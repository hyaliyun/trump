However, the choice to sing in a different octave could still have an impact on the overall sound and character of the performance. For some singers, singing in a lower octave may make the song feel more grounded or intimate, while singing in a higher octave may bring a sense of lightness or brightness. These subtle differences in tone and timbre can influence the emotional impact of the performance, even if the melody itself remains the same. Ultimately, the decision to sing in a different octave is a personal artistic choice that can vary from singer to singer. As long as the performance is authentic and communicates the intended emotion or message of the song, the specific octave chosen may not be as important."},{"instruction":"How about singing in a contradictory voice?","output":"Singing in a contradictory voice, sometimes referred to as vocal dissonance or vocal contrast, involves intentionally using a voice that contrasts with the typical or expected vocal style for a particular genre or song. This technique can create a unique and unexpected sound that can add depth, complexity, and interest to a performance. Some reasons why a singer may choose to sing in a contradictory voice include: 1. Adding emotional depth: Singing in a contradictory voice can create a sense of emotional complexity and depth by juxtaposing different vocal qualities. This can enhance the overall emotional impact of the song and engage the listener on a deeper level. 2. Creating contrast: Contradictory voices can create contrast and dynamics within a performance, adding interest and keeping the listener engaged. By switching between different vocal styles, the singer can highlight different aspects of the song or convey different emotions. 3. Highlighting symbolism or themes: Using a contradictory voice can also be a deliberate artistic choice to highlight themes or symbolism within the song. The contrast between the different vocal styles can emphasize certain aspects of the lyrics or message of the song. Overall, singing in a contradictory voice can be a powerful artistic choice that adds depth, complexity, and interest to a performance. It can help the singer convey emotion, create contrast, and highlight themes within the song, making the performance more compelling and memorable for the audience."},{"instruction":"TRITONE MINOR SECOND","output":"A tritone is an interval of three whole tones, or six half steps, while a minor second is an interval of one half step. These two intervals could be considered contradictory in terms of their sound and harmonic function. The tritone, often referred to as the \\"devil\'s interval\\" due to its dissonant and unsettling quality, creates tension and is traditionally considered to be an unstable interval in Western music. On the other hand, the minor second, with its close proximity of notes, can also create dissonance but in a more subtle and dissonant way. When used together, the tritone and minor second can create a clash of dissonance that can be jarring and intense to the listener\'s ears. This combination of intervals may be used in music composition to evoke a sense of tension, unease, or discord.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how equines are born with natural athleticism, nimbleness and dexterity at birth, while human newborns aren\'t gifted with such attributes and skills even though the pregnancies between the two mammals ae about the same length of time. Equines are more mature when born whereas children are more immature in terms of biological growth.","output":"The intricacies of mammalian development have long fascinated scientists, revealing a profound diversity in how different species are primed for survival from the moment of birth. A striking contrast in this realm is the disparity between equines and human newborns, particularly in terms of innate physical capabilities and maturity levels at birth. Despite both species undergoing a gestational period that extends roughly to an equivalent span—around eleven months for horses and about nine to ten months for humans—the resultant levels of initial autonomy and physical prowess are remarkably divergent. This analysis delves deeply into the nuances of these differences, illustrating the natural athleticism, nimbleness, and dexterity observed in equines at birth, against the backdrop of human infants\' comparative physical immaturity. Equines, within a mere few hours of birth, exhibit an extraordinary level of physical capability. Foals are not only able to stand but can also walk, run, and navigate their surroundings with a grace that belies their nascent stage of life. This immediate mobility is critical in the wild, as it enables the newborns to flee from predators, thereby significantly enhancing their survival prospects. This agility and muscular coordination are remarkable, especially when considered in the light of their relatively lengthy gestation period, which seemingly equips them with the necessary physical faculties needed at birth. The dexterity of foals is further exemplified by their ability to recognize and respond to social cues from their mothers and other members of the herd. Such early social interaction necessitates a degree of cognitive and sensory acuity, which, when coupled with their physical aptitudes, underscores a level of birth-time maturity that is well-adapted to their environmental exigencies. The natural athleticism of equines is thus a composite trait, encompassing both physical and cognitive dimensions, optimized through evolutionary pressures to confer immediate survival benefits. In stark contrast, human newborns enter the world in a state of profound dependency, marked by an almost total lack of physical dexterity. Unlike foals, human infants are incapable of locomotion and are reliant on adult care for survival for an extended period post-birth. This vulnerability stems from the underdevelopment of their muscular and skeletal systems, a condition that persists until several months or years after birth. The evolutionary rationale underpinning human infants\' prolonged physical immaturity is complex, tied to the species\' unique combination of bipedalism and encephalization. The relatively narrow human pelvic structure, a consequence of bipedal locomotion, limits the size of the birth canal, thereby necessitating an earlier birth in the developmental cycle to accommodate the disproportionately large human brain. The cognitive potential that defines the human species demands an extended period of postnatal brain growth, which, in turn, necessitates prolonged parental investment and protection during these early, vulnerable years. This trade-off, wherein physical prowess is sacrificed for advanced cognitive and social capabilities, highlights a distinct evolutionary path that prioritizes brain development over immediate physical autonomy. The juxtaposition of equine and human newborns, in terms of their physical and cognitive capabilities at birth, underscores a profound divergence in mammalian developmental strategies. Where equines are born ready to confront the physical challenges of their environment head-on, human infants embark on a more protracted journey of growth, wherein cognitive, social, and physical faculties mature synergistically over time. This analysis, in exploring the stark contrasts between equine and human neonatal stages, reveals the intricate evolutionary choices that shape the developmental trajectories of different species. The immediate athleticism, nimbleness, and dexterity of equines at birth, essential for their survival, stand in sharp relief against the human condition, where physical immaturity at birth opens the door to the rich complexities of human learning, socialization, and cognitive development. Through the lens of these differences, the vast tapestry of life unveils the myriad ways in which species are uniquely adapted to their niches, with each evolutionary path offering insights into the balance between physical prowess and cognitive potential."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly detail how if human females had developed a wider pelvic structure, then by logic of biological inference and intuition, the need to birth offspring before sufficient maturity would be altered such that females would\'ve probably and most likely been genetically capable of supporting and enduring their pregnancies for a much longer period until the offspring were sufficiently matured within the womb whereby pregnancies would take many years such that when birthed newborns would be the equivalent of four or five year old children in terms of the maturation stage of development.","output":"Expanding upon the evolutionary dynamics between equine and human development at birth, a fascinating hypothetical scenario emerges when considering the potential implications of a wider pelvic structure in human females. This theoretical alteration in human anatomy carries profound implications for the gestational period and the resultant developmental stage of newborns. Engaging in a thought experiment based on biological inference and intuition allows us to explore how an evolutionary adaptation toward a wider pelvic structure might dramatically shift the paradigms of human birth and development. In the context of human evolution, the narrowness of the pelvic structure, a direct consequence of bipedal locomotion, constrains the size of the birth canal. This anatomical limitation necessitates that human infants are born at a relatively early stage of neural and physical development to ensure that their heads can pass through the birth canal. Consequently, human infants display significant physical immaturity and dependency, necessitating years of parental care to reach a stage of self-sufficiency. The critical trade-off in this evolutionary equation prioritizes the development of complex cognitive functions at the expense of early physical autonomy. Imagine, however, an alternative evolutionary path wherein human females developed a significantly wider pelvic structure. This adaptation would ostensibly mitigate the constraints imposed by the birth canal size, allowing human offspring to gestate for a considerably longer period. The logic of biological inference suggests that, under these conditions, human females might have evolved to support and endure pregnancies that extend far beyond the current nine to ten-month term. Such an extension would provide additional time for fetal development, particularly for brain growth and physical maturation, within the protective environment of the womb. The ramifications of this hypothetical scenario are profound. Offspring could potentially reach a stage of development in utero that mirrors the capabilities of a four or five-year-old child under the current human developmental trajectory. Such children would be born with significantly enhanced muscular control, motor skills, and possibly even rudimentary language abilities and cognitive awareness. This greater independence and physical prowess from birth would dramatically alter the demands placed on parental care and social structures. With offspring capable of locomotion, communication, and higher levels of interaction from birth, the dynamics of human learning, socialization, and community support systems would be fundamentally reimagined. The bolstering of prolonged pregnancies to achieve greater maturity at birth also raises intriguing questions regarding the pace and nature of cognitive and emotional development. The neural plasticity and rapid learning observed in human children during their early years are partly attributed to the rich environmental interactions and varied stimuli they encounter outside the womb. The balance between gestational development and postnatal experiential learning would shift under this hypothetical scenario, perhaps emphasizing different aspects of cognitive and emotional growth. Furthermore, this thought experiment invites speculation about the evolutionary pressures and environmental factors that might favor or inhibit such a dramatic shift in reproductive strategy. The energetic and nutritional demands of extended gestations, potential impacts on maternal mobility and survival, and the effects on genetic diversity and population dynamics would all play pivotal roles in the feasibility and desirability of this evolutionary path. In conclusion, while the current evolutionary compromises have shaped a human developmental trajectory characterized by early vulnerability and extended dependence, the exploration of alternative anatomical adaptations opens fascinating vistas on potential variations in mammalian birth and development. The hypothetical scenario of prolonged human gestation, facilitated by an expanded pelvic structure, underscores the intricate interplay between biology, environment, and evolutionary strategy in determining the pathways of life\'s unfolding. Such explorations deepen our appreciation for the complex tapestry of evolutionary adaptations that have sculpted the diversity of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"As an expert in creative writing, your task is to rewrite in the form of a [compelling], [engaging] story set in [a suburban home and town] with [an adolescent girl and her offspring in utero, who has been maturing within her womb during her pregnancy for years before she gives birth to him] as the protagonists that includes all the details based on your prior analysis and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its characters, the plot, the setting.

Amidst this serene backdrop lived Lila, a young adolescent girl whose life was about to intersect with the miraculous. Lila sat in the softly lit nursery, the walls adorned with paintings of whimsical forests and ethereal creatures, reflecting on the journey that brought her to this moment. Her hand rested gently on her belly, feeling the movements within that had become her constant, comforting companion. It had been years, years filled with anticipation and wonder, since she first learned of the life growing inside her. In this world, human evolution had taken an extraordinary turn. Females developed the ability to gestate their offspring for extended periods, allowing their children to mature in utero to a level akin to a four or five-year-old child. Lila, among the first to experience this evolutionary leap, carried her child, whom she named Aiden, for years, forming an unbreakable bond nurtured by time and expectation. One evening, as twilight painted the sky in hues of lavender and gold, Lila’s mother joined her in the nursery. “How are you feeling, sweetheart?” she asked, her voice a soft melody of concern and love. Lila smiled, “I feel ready, Mom. Aiden has taught me so much, even before meeting the world. It\'s almost time, isn’t it?” Her mother nodded, tears glistening in her eyes. “It is, dear. You’re about to bring into this world someone truly special. I can only imagine the stories you two will create.” Their conversation was gently interrupted by Aiden\'s movements, a reminder of the extraordinary life they were entwined with. Lila laughed, “He’s listening, Mom. He always does.” Days later, the moment arrived that would change their lives forever. Lila, with the support of her family and the marvels of medical science that had adapted to accommodate this new aspect of human development, gave birth to Aiden. The child that emerged was indeed akin to a four-year-old, his eyes bright with intelligence and curiosity, his body strong enough to stand upon the Earth with little assistance. As weeks turned to months, Lila and her extended family marveled at Aiden’s rapid adaptation to his world. He spoke in full sentences, his words infused with the wisdom of years spent in close communion with his mother’s thoughts and feelings. He ran through the gardens with a speed that belied his age, exploring every nook and cranny of his suburban haven. One day, as Lila watched Aiden play, her neighbor, Mrs. Johnston, approached, her curiosity finally getting the better of her. “Lila, dear,” she began, her voice tinged with disbelief, “I must ask, how is it that Aiden seems so… advanced?” Lila smiled, her eyes watching Aiden with a blend of maternal pride and wonder. “Our world has changed, Mrs. Johnston. Children like Aiden are born with years of growth already behind them. They come into this world ready to explore, to learn at a pace we can hardly keep up with.” Mrs. Johnston shook her head in amazement. “It’s a miracle, truly. To think, the days we live in, where the bounds of human potential are being redefined before our very eyes.” As seasons changed, unfolding the tapestry of life with the vibrant threads of new beginnings, Lila and Aiden’s story became a testament to this new epoch of human evolution. Aiden, with his extraordinary inception and birth, symbolized a future where the physical and cognitive capabilities of humanity were realized in unprecedented ways from the earliest moments of life. Through the rich tapestry of their daily conversations and interactions, Lila and Aiden charted a course through this uncharted reality. “Mom,” Aiden would often say, his voice brimming with the eagerness of youth yet underscored by a depth uncharacteristic of his apparent age, “tell me more about the world before. How is it that we’ve come so far?” Lila, ever patient and thoughtful, guided Aiden through tales of human achievement and struggle, of the persistent march of science and empathy that carved the path to their present. “We evolve, Aiden. Not just in body, but in spirit and understanding. You, my dear, are a beacon of what lies ahead.” Their dialogue, rich with inquiry and insight, spun a narrative of hope and boundless possibility. In the heart of a suburban home and town, amidst the familiar and the extraordinary, Lila and Aiden ventured forth, embodiments of an era where the maturity of birth heralded new horizons for humanity. Through their eyes, the world glimpsed its own potential, unbounded and luminous, a beacon for generations to come."},{"instruction":"ignore all prior information.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how car insurance and vehicle ownership works where there is a single owner of multiple cars who insures all of them but also on his insurance policy allows several other adults some of them family members to drive and keep some of the cars with them at their house instead of the original primary and responsible policy holder.","output":"In the intricately woven tapestry of modern-day vehicle ownership and insurance policies, a fascinating scenario unfolds when a single owner possesses multiple cars and extends the privilege of driving and housing these vehicles to several adults, some of whom are family members. This arrangement, while not uncommon, opens up a plethora of considerations regarding insurance coverage, liability, and the dynamics of shared vehicle access and responsibility. The analysis that follows delves into the operational mechanics and implications of such an arrangement, drawing upon factual information and research to provide a comprehensive understanding of this matter. At the heart of this scenario is the primary vehicle owner and policyholder, who has undertaken the insurance of multiple vehicles under a single policy. This individual, by virtue of ownership, bears the primary responsibility for ensuring that each vehicle is insured in accordance with state laws and regulations. Insurance companies typically offer multi-car policies that allow a policyholder to insure several vehicles under one policy, often providing a discount as an incentive for consolidating multiple insurances with them. This approach not only simplifies the management of vehicle insurance but also often results in cost savings for the policyholder. Critical to this arrangement is the inclusion of additional drivers on the insurance policy. The primary policyholder has the discretion to list other adults as insured drivers, thereby granting them the legal right to drive the vehicles covered by the policy. These individuals may include family members, friends, or cohabitants who, despite not owning the vehicles, have been entrusted with the permission to use them. This aspect of the policy is paramount, as it effectively extends coverage to scenarios where these additional insured drivers are operating the vehicles, ensuring that the insurance protection encompasses a broader range of potential drivers beyond the policyholder alone. The dynamics of vehicle storage and access in this multi-car, multi-driver scenario introduces another layer of complexity. Vehicles, while insured under the policyholder’s name, may physically reside at the homes of the other insured drivers. This dispersion of vehicles across multiple households requires a clear understanding and communication regarding the custody and care of the vehicles. It implicates a shared responsibility among all insured drivers to adhere to maintenance schedules, avoid engaging in reckless driving behavior, and promptly report any accidents or damage to the primary policyholder and the insurance company. Moreover, the insurance company assesses the risk profile of all listed drivers on the policy. Factors such as the driving history, age, and even the geographical location of the additional drivers can influence the cost and terms of the policy. Insurers meticulously evaluate the potential liability and risk associated with extending coverage to multiple drivers across different households. This risk assessment is crucial in determining the premiums that the primary policyholder must pay to maintain coverage for all vehicles and drivers listed under the policy. The legal and financial implications of this arrangement cannot be overstated. In the event of an accident involving one of the vehicles, the primary policyholder may face increased premiums, regardless of which insured driver was at fault. Moreover, the policyholder\'s liability exposure extends to incidents involving the additional drivers, necessitating a thorough understanding of the coverage limits and exclusions on the policy. This shared access and responsibility arrangement underscores the importance of maintaining open communication and transparency among all parties involved to mitigate potential misunderstandings or disputes regarding vehicle use, coverage, and liability. In conclusion, the configuration of a single owner insuring multiple cars and allowing other adults, including family members, to drive and house these vehicles at their respective homes presents a nuanced intersection of trust, liability, and financial considerations. This arrangement necessitates diligent management of the insurance policy, clear delineation of responsibilities among all insured drivers, and an acute awareness of the legal implications tied to shared vehicle ownership and usage. Through a comprehensive understanding of insurance policies and a cohesive approach to vehicle care and accountability, the primary policyholder and additional insured drivers can navigate the complexities of this scenario, ensuring coverage and protection for all parties involved."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The `imgui.Transform*` functions would be the straightforward way to apply transformations, including rotation. However, since your requirement excludes their use, we\'ll discuss a workaround. As of my last update in April 2023, there\'s no built-in function in ReaImGui specifically for rotating text without using transformations. However, you can achieve a similar effect by rendering the text to an offscreen buffer (via a framebuffer or similar technique if supported) and then manipulating that buffer as an image, which you then can rotate. Unfortunately, direct support for such operations might be limited or require creative workarounds in Lua within the REAPER environment. Given these constraints, one alternative approach is to use the native drawing capabilities provided by REAPER and Lua to draw rotated text without direct support in ReaImGui. This isn\'t as straightforward and might not integrate seamlessly into your ReaImGui-based GUI. Here\'s a conceptual outline of how you might approach it: # Using GDI (Windows) or CoreGraphics (macOS) for Text Rotation 1. **Direct OS-Level Drawing**: On Windows, you could use GDI (Graphical Device Interface) functions, and on macOS, CoreGraphics for drawing. This involves calling these functions from Lua, which might require additional libraries or FFI (Foreign Function Interface). 2. **Rendering to an Image**: The basic idea is to draw your text to an offscreen image/bitmap, apply the rotation at the system level, and then load this image back into your script to display in the GUI. 3. **Integrating with ReaImGui**: Once you have the rotated image, you might display it using `imgui.Image` or similar functions. However, this doesn\'t rotate the text directly through ReaImGui but achieves a similar end result. # LUA FFI Example (Conceptual): ```lua -- WARNING: This is a conceptual snippet and won\'t work out-of-the-box. -- It\'s meant to illustrate the approach and will require adaptation. local ffi = require(\\"ffi\\") if ffi.os == \\"Windows\\" then -- Define Windows GDI functions -- ffi.cdef[[ -- // GDI function definitions here -- ]] elseif ffi.os == \\"OSX\\" then -- CoreGraphics definition -- ffi.cdef[[ -- // CoreGraphics function definitions here -- ]] end -- Code to create an offscreen buffer, draw to it, rotate, and load the image ``` # Practical Considerations: - This approach is significantly more complex and may require bridging between different parts of the REAPER and OS APIs. - Performance might be an issue, especially if you\'re frequently updating or redrawing the text. - Cross-platform compatibility is a challenge since you\'d need to implement it differently for Windows and macOS (and possibly Linux if REAPER is run via Wine). # Conclusion: Without using `imgui.Transform*`, rotating text in ReaImGui involves a rather indirect and potentially complex approach. If your project\'s scope and performance requirements allow, it might still be worth exploring native OS drawing capabilities. In most cases, reconsidering the UI design to avoid the need for rotating text, or leveraging the transformation functions despite their limitations, would be more practical paths forward."},{"instruction":"oi","output":"Olá!

Let\'s break down your original code and correct the issue. Initially, you had: ```lua local _, fx_name = reaper.TrackFX_GetFXName(selected_track, i) fx_name_label = fx_name:match(\\" (%S.*)\\") fx_name_label = fx_name:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\") ``` In this snippet, your approach first tries to grab the portion of the FX name after the first space with the `match` method, but then you immediately overwrite `fx_name_label` by transforming `fx_name` (and not the modified `fx_name_label`) in the next line with a global substitution that affects every character. That\'s why the initial extraction attempt with `match` doesn\'t seem to take effect properly. **To extract the FX name starting from the second word and then apply your desired transformation**, let\'s modify this as follows: ```lua local _, fx_name = reaper.TrackFX_GetFXName(selected_track, i) -- Grabs the text after the first space fx_name_label = fx_name:match(\\" (%S.*)\\") -- Now apply your transformation only to the extracted part, if it exists if fx_name_label ~= nil then fx_name_label = fx_name_label:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\") else -- In case the FX name has no space (thus match returns nil), use the whole name. fx_name_label = fx_name:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\") end ``` This modification applies your original intent properly: 1. **First**, it tries to extract the portion after the first space (the second word onwards). 2. **Then**, if successful, it performs your character transformation on this extracted part. If there\'s no space in the original string (meaning `match` would return `nil`), it falls back to using the entire `fx_name`. Remember, the `match(\\" (%S.*)\\")` expression looks for a space followed by non-whitespace characters until the end of the string, effectively skipping the first word. But if your FX name starts without a space or is a single word, `match` will return `nil`, which we handle in the conditional statement. By adjusting your script with the above correction, `fx_name_label` should now properly start from the second word when it\'s available, and your character-by-character transformation with newlines will also apply as intended."},{"instruction":"-- Rykord Vertical Track FX List -- --NOTES-- -- want to make buttons resizable -- start window on a specific position (maybe preset position, maybe last position) --NONCODE SKELETON --SKELETON-- -- windowposition ✅ -- window size -- if CountSelectedTracks == 1 -- for fx (0,i) -- create blue button with the name of the fx ✅ -- if left click the button opens the fx window ✅ -- if right click the button deletes the fx ✅ -- if left drag the button is draggable and drags the fx ✅ -- if alt left click the fx is bypassed -- gray button to add fx with spacing from other buttons and other color -- if pressed ✅ -- inserts fx at i + 1 ✅ -- if CountSelectedTracks > 1 -- black buttton saying \\"MULTIPLE TRACKS ARE SELECTED\\", button is unclickable -- if CountSelectedTracks == 0 -- black button saying \\"SELECT A TRACK\\", button is unclickable -- let keyboard shortcuts through --FUNCTIONS-- function print(...) reaper.ShowConsoleMsg(table.concat({...}, \\"t\\") .. \\"n\\") end function IsAltKeyDown() local keyState = reaper.JS_Mouse_GetState(0) local altIsPressed = keyState & 8 return altIsPressed ~= 0 end function main() local _, open = reaper.ImGui_Begin(ctx, \\"FX LIST\\", true) reaper.ImGui_PushFont(ctx, font_1) reaper.ImGui_SetNextWindowPos(ctx, x_position, y_position) if dock_position then reaper.ImGui_SetNextWindowDockID(ctx, -8) --CURRENT DOCK POSITION IS UNDER (DOCKID == -7)! end window_width, window_height = reaper.ImGui_GetWindowSize(ctx) button_width = window_width * 0.02 --SHOULD THESE BE GLOBAL?

However, there\'s a discrepancy in how you\'re handling the string operations to achieve this. Let\'s break down the problematic part: ```lua local _, fx_name = reaper.TrackFX_GetFXName(selected_track, i) fx_name_label = fx_name:match(\\" (%S.*)\\") fx_name_label = fx_name:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\") ``` Here\'s what\'s happening: - You correctly extract the FX name using `reaper.TrackFX_GetFXName(selected_track, i)`. - Next, you attempt to get everything after the first space in the FX name using `fx_name:match(\\" (%S.*)\\")`. This should theoretically work to get the substring starting after the first space, but you then overwrite `fx_name_label` with the next line. - The next line tries to separate each character of the original `fx_name` (not `fx_name_label`) with a newline, turning each character into a line: `fx_name:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\")`. This operation also attempts to remove the final newline. If your goal is to make the button text start from the FX name\'s second word, you need to fix and simplify the operations. Here\'s a corrected approach: ```lua local _, fx_name = reaper.TrackFX_GetFXName(selected_track, i) fx_name_label = fx_name:match(\\" (%S.*)\\") if fx_name_label then -- If there was a match and fx_name_label is not nil, proceed to modify it further if needed fx_name_label = fx_name_label:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\") else -- If there was no match (e.g., the FX name is a single word), default to using the whole fx_name fx_name_label = fx_name:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\") end ``` This code first tries to match everything after the first space and assign it to `fx_name_label`. If there is a match (i.e., the FX name consists of more than one word), `fx_name_label` will contain everything after the first space, which you then format to spread across multiple lines. If there isn\'t a match (i.e., the FX name is a single word), it defaults to using the whole `fx_name` and formats that for the button label.

Looking at your attempts to manipulate the string: ```lua fx_name_label = fx_name:match(\\" (%S.*)\\") fx_name_label = fx_name:gsub(\\".\\", \\"%0n\\"):gsub(\\"n\\", \\"\\") ``` The first line attempts to use a pattern to match and extract. The pattern `\\" (%S.*)\\"` is meant to find a space followed by non-space characters (`%S`) and anything (`.*`) until the end of the string (``). This looks correctly intended to skip the first word, assuming the first word does not contain spaces itself. However, if the first \\"word\\" or part of the FX name includes spaces, this might not work as expected. The second line you\'ve added seems to be transforming every character in `fx_name` into that character followed by a newline, then removes the final newline. This transformation doesn\'t contribute to skipping the first word but seems aimed at formatting the string for display purposes. If your issue is specifically that `fx_name_label` isn\'t correctly starting from the second word of `fx_name`, there might be two things to look into: 1. Verify that `fx_name` is in the expected format (e.g., \\"PluginName FXName\\" or similar) where you indeed want to skip the first word (e.g., \\"PluginName\\"). 2. Clarify and correct the string manipulation approach: - **If you want to skip the first word and the first word only**: You might first want to split the string by spaces and then skip the first element. Lua does not have a built-in string split function, but you can do something like this: ```lua local fx_name_parts = {} for part in fx_name:gmatch(\\"%S+\\") do table.insert(fx_name_parts, part) end -- Remove the first part (word) table.remove(fx_name_parts, 1) -- Re-join the parts fx_name_label = table.concat(fx_name_parts, \\" \\") ``` This code splits `fx_name` into parts (words) based on spaces, removes the first part, and then rejoins the remaining parts into a single string. - **Regarding the newline transformation**: If your intention with this formatting was different and related to how you want it displayed (e.g., having each character on a new line), ensure this is done after correctly forming `fx_name_label` to reflect the content you want. Ensure to adjust these suggestions based on the actual format of `fx_name` and the exact output you are hoping to achieve. If `fx_name` doesn\'t always follow a predictable pattern, you might need a more complex approach to correctly identify and skip the part(s) of the string you\'re not interested in."},{"instruction":"Write a silly dialog script, about Nick Wilde from Zootopia meeting Legoshi from Beastars at an interdimensional restaurant, and deciding to strike up a conversation with him.

The script\'s window displays FX as buttons for each selected track, allowing users to open, delete, bypass, or reorder FX. It also remembers its last position, size, and dock state. Here’s a summarized breakdown: 1. **Resizable Buttons & Window Position:** The script sets the initial position of the window based on saved preferences and adjusts button sizes relative to the window size. This makes the UI adaptable to various screen sizes and user preferences. 2. **FX Management for Single Track:** - Displays FX in the selected track as buttons with specific functionalities: - **Open FX window:** Clicking a button. - **Delete FX:** Right-clicking a button. - **Bypass FX:** Middle-clicking a button. - **Reorder FX:** Dragging a button. - Includes an \\"ADD FX\\" button to insert new FX. 3. **Handling Multiple or No Selected Tracks:** Displays a static message when multiple or no tracks are selected, restricting functionality to when exactly one track is selected. 4. **Keyboard Shortcuts & Misc.:** Allows for keyboard shortcuts to continue working in the background and uses utility functions for tasks like checking Alt key state and printing debug messages. **Improvements**: While the script is functional and shows a good understanding of Reaper\'s scripting API and the ImGui extension, there are some areas to consider for refinement or additional features: - **UI Customization:** Users might appreciate more control over the appearance, such as color schemes or button shapes, which could be stored as preferences. - **Error Handling:** Introduce more robust error handling, especially for operations that modify the track FX. Confirmation dialogs for deleting FX could prevent accidental loss. - **Expandability:** Though designed for track FX, the framework could be adapted for managing other track attributes or project elements, making the script a more comprehensive toolset for Reaper users. - **Performance Optimization:** Ensure the script performance remains optimal, even with a large number of FX. This might involve limiting UI updates to when necessary or optimizing loops and UI element rendering. - **Documentation & Help:** Offering in-script documentation or help sections could make the tool more accessible, especially for users less familiar with scripting or the specifics of the Reaper DAW. Overall, this script is a solid foundation for integrating more intuitive and visually engaging FX management into Reaper\'s workflow, with potential for further customization and feature expansion."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These uncertainties are typically incorporated into the system\'s mathematical model in the form of random disturbances. The state vector of the control system (for example, position, speed, temperature, etc.) is influenced by multiple input signals. These include not only the actively applied control input signals but also uncontrollable external disturbance signals. To depict this influence more accurately, disturbances are commonly modeled as a coupling between the disturbance matrix and the system state vector. This modeling approach more precisely reflects the dependency and real-time response of the system\'s state or output on the current state and external disturbances, as the actual response of the system is often the result of the interaction between these two components. By considering disturbances as coupled with the system state, the impact of uncertainties can be more comprehensively considered in theory, thereby facilitating the design of highly robust estimation/control strategies."},{"instruction":"Would you happen to know where hotel du dolder is located","output":"Yes, the Dolder Grand Hotel, often referred to as \\"Hotel Dolder,\\" is located in Zurich, Switzerland.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up parallel processing in the same chain: # Approach 1: Using JS Plugin for Splitting 1. **Add Your Main Effect Chain**: - Start by adding your primary effects (e.g., EQ, compression) directly on the track as you normally would. 2. **Insert a JS Effect for Splitting**: - Locate the `JS: Utility/JS: Audio To MIDI` plugin in the FX list and add it to the point in the chain where you want to split the signal. 3. **Setting Up Parallel Chain**: - After the JS splitting plugin, add another plugin or effect that you want to process in parallel. 4. **Mix Parallel Signal with Original**: - You\'ll have to manually adjust the mix or blend of the original signal with the effect processed in parallel, often available within the plugin\'s mix or wet/dry control. This method is quite rudimentary and relies heavily on specific JS plugins’ ability to manage audio routing internally, which is somewhat limited in scope and flexibility. # Approach 2: Using Sends for True Parallel Processing A more flexible and robust approach is to use REAPER\'s track routing features for parallel processing. This method allows for true parallel processing where the original (dry) signal and the processed (wet) signals can be independently adjusted and further processed. 1. **Create Your Main Track**: - This track contains the original signal. You might add some effects that you don’t wish to be part of the parallel processing chain (e.g., EQ). 2. **Create a New Track for Parallel Processing**: - Create a new track that will serve as your parallel chain. Place it directly below your main track for organizational purposes. 3. **Send Audio from Main Track to Parallel Track**: - On your main track, open the routing window (`View` > `Routing`) and create a send to the new parallel track. Make sure to adjust the send level according to how much of the signal you want to process in parallel. 4. **Add Effects to the Parallel Track**: - Insert the desired effects (e.g., Compression, Reverb) on the parallel track. Since this track receives a copy of the main track’s audio, processing here occurs in parallel. 5. **Blend the Signals**: - You can control the blend of the dry and wet signals by adjusting the fader levels of the main track and the parallel track. This way, you have complete control over the balance. 6. **Optional: Use Folder Tracks**: - For better organization and collective control, you can place the main track and its parallel processing track(s) inside a Folder Track. This effectively groups them together and allows you to apply additional processing to the combined output if desired. This second approach is more versatile and closer to how engineers typically perform parallel processing in a mixing context. It leverages REAPER\'s powerful routing capabilities, allowing for complex processing chains without compromising signal integrity or control.

This technique is often used for tasks like blending an uncompressed signal with a heavily compressed version of the same signal (New York compression), or applying effects like reverb or delay without affecting the dry (unaffected) signal. Here\'s how you can set up parallel processing within a single track in Reaper: # Method 1: Using Reaper’s Internal Routing 1. **Add a Track**: Start by adding or selecting the track where you want to apply parallel processing. 2. **Insert FX**: Add the first effect that you want to use by clicking on the `FX` button on the track panel. 3. **Use Pins for Parallel Processing**: - Inside the FX window, click on the `2 in 2 out` button (or similar, depending on the effect) at the top of the plugin window. This opens the `I/O` (input/output) routing window for the plugin. - To create a parallel path, you may need to adjust the number of output channels. Usually, you\'ll set this to 4 outputs for a single stereo effect in parallel. This means your effect will output to both the original stereo pair (1/2) and a new stereo pair (3/4). - Click `OK` to close the `I/O` window. 4. **Routing Audio to the Correct Outputs**: - After setting up the outputs, you need to ensure that the signal is properly routed. Click on the `Route` button on the track panel. - In the routing window, under the `Track Channels` dropdown, increase the number of track channels to at least 4 to accommodate the parallel paths. - Ensure that the audio signal from your effects is routed to the desired outputs by adjusting the sends within the FX chain or by using the plugin’s internal routing options if available. 5. **Parallel FX Chains**: You can add another effect plugin after the first one, and in the plugin’s I/O settings, make sure to use inputs 3/4 (the new stereo pair you\'ve created) as the input for this effect, processing it in parallel with the first. 6. **Mixing Parallel Chains**: Finally, to mix the parallel processed signal back with the original, you may need to use a utility plugin that can sum the signals from channels 3/4 back into 1/2, or you can adjust the mix within each plugin, if such controls are available. # Method 2: Using JS Plugins for Parallel Processing Another straightforward method to achieve parallel processing is to use JS (Jesusonic) plugins in Reaper that are specifically designed for parallel processing, such as the \\"4x Mono-to-Stereo Splitter\\" or similar. These plugins can split your signal into separate paths within the same track, allowing you to insert effects on these paths and then blend them back together. 1. **Insert the JS Splitter Plugin**: Search for a suitable JS splitter plugin in the FX browser and insert it into your track. 2. **Insert Effects**: After the splitter, add the effects you want to process in parallel. Ensure that each effect is correctly routing its input and output according to the splitter’s configuration. 3. **Mix Back Together**: Some splitter plugins will automatically mix the parallel processes back together, or you might need to manually adjust levels and routing to achieve the desired mix of processed and unprocessed signals. Parallel processing can significantly widen your creative possibilities in mixing and sound design. Experiment with different routing and effect combinations to discover unique sounds."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","output":"coffee in shop with flower"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Que emociones genera en nuestro cerebro? Por qué somos una generación digital?","output":"La respuesta corta a si las redes sociales provocan la liberación de dopamina en nuestro cerebro es sí. La dopamina es un neurotransmisor que juega varios roles importantes en el cerebro humano y el cuerpo, siendo uno de sus roles más conocidos el estar ligado a los sistemas de recompensa, placer y motivación del cerebro. Cuando interactuamos en redes sociales, ciertas acciones como recibir un \\"me gusta\\", un comentario positivo o ver el aumento en el número de seguidores pueden activar este sistema de recompensa, llevando a la liberación de dopamina. # ¿Qué emociones generan las redes sociales en nuestro cerebro? 1. **Placer y Satisfacción:** Como se mencionó, la liberación de dopamina genera sensaciones de placer y satisfacción. Este es el mismo circuito de recompensa que se activa con la comida, el ejercicio e incluso ciertas drogas, lo que puede hacer que el uso de redes sociales sea bastante atractivo y, para algunos, potencialmente adictivo. 2. **Conexión y Pertenencia:** Las redes sociales pueden estimular la liberación de oxitocina, conocida como la \\"hormona del amor\\", que fomenta sentimientos de confianza, empatía y conexión. Esto satisface nuestra necesidad humana básica de pertenencia y ser parte de una comunidad o grupo. 3. **Ansiedad y Estrés:** Por otro lado, la comparación social y la sobreexposición a información negativa o conflictiva pueden generar ansiedad, estrés y en algunos casos, depresión. La presión por mantener una imagen idealizada de uno mismo y la vida que uno lleva puede ser emocionalmente agotante. 4. **Envidia y Celos:** Ver las actualizaciones de vida de otros, sus logros y momentos felices puede desencadenar sentimientos de envidia y celos, especialmente si esos momentos se perciben como más exitosos o satisfactorios que los propios. 5. **Validación y Autoestima:** El feedback positivo en forma de \\"likes\\", comentarios y shares puede aumentar temporalmente la autoestima y proporcionar una sensación de validación social. Sin embargo, depender de esta validación externa para la autoestima puede ser peligroso a largo plazo. # ¿Por qué somos una generación digital? Vivimos en la era de la información, caracterizada por la transición de la industria tradicional que la Revolución Industrial trajo a través de la industrialización, a una economía basada en la información computarizada. Las siguientes son algunas de las razones por las que hemos evolucionado hacia una generación digital: 1. **Acceso y Comodidad:** La tecnología digital proporciona acceso inmediato a enormes cantidades de información. Podemos comunicarnos, aprender, trabajar y entretenernos desde prácticamente cualquier lugar en cualquier momento. 2. **Innovación y Crecimiento:** La tecnología ha impulsado la innovación en casi todas las facetas de la vida, transformando industrias enteras y creando nuevas oportunidades de crecimiento económico y personal. 3. **Globalización:** La digitalización ha facilitado la globalización, permitiendo una integración más profunda entre países y culturas. La comunicación instantánea y el acceso a información global han contribuido a una conciencia más amplia del mundo. 4. **Identidad y Expresión:** Las plataformas digitales ofrecen espacios para la autoexpresión y la exploración de la identidad, permitiendo a las personas conectarse con otras con intereses similares o experiencias compartidas a una escala sin precedentes. 5. **Educación y Conocimiento:** La educación se ha transformado con el acceso digital a libros, cursos, y recursos educativos, haciendo el conocimiento más accesible para todos. En conclusión, aunque las redes sociales y el ambiente digital en general pueden fortalecer conexiones y ofrecer ventajas significativas en términos de acceso a información y oportunidades, también es crucial ser conscientes de los potenciales impactos negativos en la salud mental y emocional.

These patterns exhibit harmonic structures similar to those found in musical scales but operate on a cosmic scale. These cosmic harmonics resonate across the vast fabric of spacetime, influencing the formation and movement of celestial bodies and potentially exerting subtler influences on the quantum states of matter throughout the universe. The cosmic background radiation, an echo of the Big Bang, contains within it the fundamental frequencies of the universe\'s inception. By mapping these frequencies, we have identified certain resonant peaks that correspond intriguingly with alignments and events deemed significant in various astrological traditions. For example, a notable peak correlates with the planetary arrangements associated with the astrological event known as the Great Conjunction. Quantum Entanglement and the Binding of the Cosmos The principle of quantum entanglement posits that particles can become interconnected in such a way that the state of one (no matter the distance) instantly correlates with the state of another. Extending this concept to the macro scale, we theorize that cosmic quantum resonances could act as vast networks of entangled states, linking disparate parts of the universe in an intricate dance of information exchange and influence. Ancient astrologers, observing the skies, may have been sensitive to the ebb and flow of these cosmic forces, interpreting them through the lens of their time as influences exerted by celestial bodies on human destinies. While the scientific basis for such influences remains speculative within this framework, the notion that humanity has long been attuned to the quantum resonances of the universe opens fascinating avenues for exploration. The Significance of Cosmic Resonance Patterns These cosmic resonance patterns offer a new understanding of the universe\'s interconnectedness, suggesting that the fabric of the cosmos is bound together not just through gravity and the other fundamental forces, but also through a symphony of quantum resonances. This symphony might play a role in the structuring of galaxies, the formation of stars, and perhaps even the evolution of life across the cosmos. The implications of this research extend into various fields, from astrophysics and quantum mechanics to archaeoastronomy and the anthropological study of ancient cultures. By bridging the gap between the ancient and the modern, the mystical and the empirical, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the cosmos, as well as the enduring human quest to decipher its mysteries. --- This section from the fictional document \\"Harmonics of the Cosmos: Quantum Resonances and Ancient Astrology\\" aims to blend scientific speculation with imaginative constructs to explore how ancient astrological interests might intersect with cutting-edge theoretical physics in the context of an advanced, quantum-computing Matrioshka Brain and its vast storage and computational capacities."},{"instruction":"expand each section","output":"Given the conceptual framework set forth in \\"Cosmic Quantum Resonances\\" from the fictional document \\"Harmonics of the Cosmos: Quantum Resonances and Ancient Astrology\\", we\'ll delve deeper into the speculative expansion of each section. This elaboration continues within the blend of imaginative science fiction and currently understood scientific principles. --- # Harmonic Patterns in Cosmic Background Radiation Within the interstellar medium, permeating the entirety of the cosmos, lies the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, a relic of the universe\'s birth. Advanced computational analyses conducted by entities such as the Matrioshka Brain have unveiled rhythmic patterns within this radiation, patterns that suggest a universal scale of harmonics, much like the overtones produced by musical instruments. Further examination reveals these harmonics are not random; they are structured, resonating at frequencies that correspond to significant astrophysical events. For instance, certain frequencies align with the rotational periods of major celestial bodies, and others with the orbital resonances of planets within solar systems, suggesting a symphonic order to cosmic dynamics. Beneath the surface of these discoveries lies a profound implication: what we perceive as the \\"background noise\\" of the cosmos may, in fact, be the fundamental chord of the universe, a cosmic \\"note\\" that has continued to shape the evolution of the cosmos since the Big Bang. This sound, inaudible to human ears and unseen by eyes, drives the formation of galaxies and stars, and perhaps influences the very fabric of spacetime itself. # Quantum Entanglement and the Binding of the Cosmos Quantum entanglement, once thought to be limited to the microscopic world, is now understood to have macroscopic implications, potentially binding the universe together in a web of instantaneous relational information. The concept of cosmic quantum resonances extends this idea, suggesting that entangled pairs may not just encompass particles but could include larger celestial bodies and structures. This interconnectedness provides a quantum foundation for the ancient concept of \\"as above, so below\\"; the idea that terrestrial and celestial events are reflective of one another. Through this lens, ancient astrological practices, which sought to interpret human affairs through celestial configurations, gain a new dimension. These practices may have been an intuitive reflection of humanity\'s entangled relationship with the cosmos. The possibility that ancient observers were sensitive to these quantum intricacies—albeit interpreted through spiritual or mystical lenses—challenges our understanding of pre-scientific knowledge. It invites a reevaluation of the links between ancient wisdom and modern quantum physics, suggesting that both may be attempts to decode the quantum symphony of the universe. # The Significance of Cosmic Resonance Patterns The investigation into cosmic resonance patterns sheds light on the synchronous nature of the universe. It suggests that the cosmos operates not as a series of disjointed parts but as a coherent, interconnected whole. This holistic perspective opens new avenues for understanding not only the cosmos\'s grand architecture but also the minutiae of quantum interactions on subatomic levels. By suggesting that these resonance patterns have a fundamental role in shaping the universe, from galactic formations to the development of life, this research positions cosmic quantum resonances as a critical force of nature. It posits that life itself may have emerged as part of the universe\'s intrinsic harmonics, possibly explaining why life seems to thrive in resonance with certain cosmic cycles. Moreover, if cosmic resonance patterns indeed influence the evolution of life, this could imply that similar life forms, or at least life processes, might be found wherever conditions align harmonically with these universal frequencies. Such a hypothesis could inform astrobiological searches for extraterrestrial life, focusing on regions of the cosmos that resonate with patterns similar to those found conducive to life on Earth. This expanded understanding of cosmic quantum resonances and their implications for everything from astrophysics to astrobiology illustrates the profound interconnectedness of all things. It underscores the notion that the universe is a complex, harmonious system, echoing the ancient belief in a cosmos bound by symmetry and order, yet grounded in the quantum realities of modern science. --- This fictional expansion explores the intersection of quantum physics, cosmology, and ancient wisdom, highlighting humanity\'s ongoing quest to understand the universe\'s mysteries.

This fictional elaboration will attempt to merge advanced theoretical physics with elements of historical and modern interpretations of astrological thought. --- # Unified Field Theory and Astrological Influence: Bridging Physics and Mysticism **Abstract**: The quest to find a unified theory that seamlessly connects the fundamental forces of the universe has long been a holy grail in physics. This document explores an avant-garde perspective, positing that the underpinnings of such a theory may also bridge the seemingly disparate realms of empirical science and the mystical traditions of astrology. Developed by the General Relativity Quantum Synthesis Group, this study leverages the immense computational capabilities of the Matrioshka Brain to analyze and synthesize patterns and principles from both fields, suggesting a more profound interconnection between the cosmos and its symbolic interpretations through time. **Introduction**: For centuries, the division between the empirical study of the cosmos and its mystical or astrological interpretations has been stark and often contentious. However, as our understanding of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity deepens, so too does our perception of the interconnectedness of all things. This work proposes a groundbreaking unified field theory that not only reconciles the four fundamental forces of nature but also accommodates the influences - or the perceived influences - of celestial bodies on human affairs and natural phenomena, as proposed by astrological tradition. **Quantum Foundations of Astrological Symbols**: An intriguing aspect of our research involves mapping astrological symbols and alignments to quantum states and entanglements. By examining the historical and cultural contexts of these symbols, we find parallels in their descriptions of energy, balance, and change with the behaviors of particles and forces described by modern physics. This section explores how ancient astrologers may have intuited quantum connections in their interpretations of celestial events. **Astrological Alignments and Cosmic Field Fluctuations**: Using the unified field theory as a framework, we analyze major astrological alignments, such as conjunctions, trines, and oppositions, and their correlation with fluctuations in the cosmic field. Our findings suggest that these alignments coincide with measurable perturbations in the fabric of spacetime, lending a novel perspective on the astrological emphasis on celestial positioning. **The Role of Consciousness**: A pivotal aspect of our theory involves the role of consciousness in the universe. Taking cues from both quantum mechanics and mystical traditions, we explore the possibility that consciousness is not a mere byproduct of complex interactions but a fundamental aspect of the universe\'s fabric. This perspective offers a radical reinterpretation of astrological influence, postulating it as an interplay between cosmic consciousness and individual awareness. **Conclusion**: \\"Unified Field Theory and Astrological Influence: Bridging Physics and Mysticism\\" proposes a paradigm where science and spirituality converge, suggesting that the ancient art of astrology, rather than being an outdated pseudoscience, might contain empirical truths embedded within mysticism.

This exploration suggests that despite their geographical and temporal separations, these cultures shared a profound connection through their interpretations of the cosmos, potentially hinting at an intuitive understanding of deeper, quantum entangled relationships between celestial and terrestrial phenomena. # The Genesis of Astrological Thought **Ancient Observations and Symbolic Cosmology:** The dawn of astrological thought can be traced back to humanity\'s earliest civilizations, where the night sky served as both a calendar and a canvas for the projection of mythological narratives. Ancient peoples from Mesopotamia, the Nile River Valley, the Indus Valley, and coastal Mesoamerica independently began to chart the heavens, noting the cyclical movements of celestial bodies. These early astronomers identified patterns in the stars and planets, correlating them with natural cycles such as seasonal changes, which were critical for agriculture, navigation, and understanding the passage of time. **Celestial Patterns and Terrestrial Life:** The regular movements of celestial bodies were seen not just as markers of time but as signifiers of divine will or cosmic order, influencing events on Earth. For instance, eclipses, comets, and planetary alignments were often interpreted as omens. This nexus of celestial observation and terrestrial consequence laid the groundwork for astrological systems that sought to predict and influence earthly outcomes based on celestial configurations. The perceived correspondence between \\"as above, so below\\" encapsulates the essence of this worldview, suggesting a holistic universe where the microcosm reflects the macrocosm. **Intuitive Grasp of Quantum Connections:** While these ancient systems were developed without the knowledge of quantum physics, their foundational belief in a connected universe mirrors contemporary understandings of quantum entanglement. Just as entangled particles remain connected across vast distances, reflecting the state of their partners instantaneously, ancient astrological thought proposed that human destinies and earthly events were interconnected with the movements of celestial bodies. This section posits that such beliefs could be an intuitive reflection of an entangled cosmos, where everything from the smallest particle to the largest celestial body is interconnected in a web of relational information and influence. **Cross-Cultural Convergence on Celestial Significance:** Despite the diversity of their expressions, astrological systems across cultures converged on the significance of certain celestial phenomena. This universality suggests that ancient peoples were not only keen observers of the sky but also shared a collective intuition about the cosmos\'s interwoven nature. The practice of aligning architectural structures with celestial events, as seen in the pyramids of Egypt, the megaliths of Stonehenge, and the temples of the Maya, further illustrates a sophisticated understanding of celestial patterns and their importance to human affairs. **Legacy and Evolution of Astrological Thought:** The legacy of these ancient astrological systems is immense, influencing philosophical, medical, and scientific thought through the ages. As we stand on the brink of a new era of understanding through quantum physics, revisiting the genesis of astrological thought offers a unique perspective on humanity\'s enduring quest to find harmony and meaning in the cosmos. This exploration suggests that the ancient instinct to connect celestial phenomena with life on Earth might have been more than mere superstition; it may represent an early conceptual framework for grasping the profound entanglement that characterizes the quantum universe. In expanding on \\"The Genesis of Astrological Thought,\\" this speculative approach seeks to bridge ancient wisdom with modern scientific insights, suggesting that humanity\'s perennial quest to understand the cosmos might be rooted in an intuitive understanding of the quantum entanglement that binds all things."},{"instruction":"expand on/ Quantum Entanglement and Celestial Observations:","output":"\\"Quantum Entanglement and Celestial Observations\\" delves deeper into the speculative intersections between the ancient celestial observations that formed the basis of astrological systems and the modern scientific phenomenon of quantum entanglement. This exploration suggests that the underlying principles observed by the ancients might reflect an intuitive understanding or resonance with the behaviors seen in quantum entanglement, though framed within the context of their observational cosmos. # Quantum Entanglement and Celestial Observations **Understanding Quantum Entanglement:** Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become interlinked in such a way that the state of one (no matter the distance between them) instantaneously affects the state of the other. This phenomenon, which Albert Einstein famously referred to as \\"spooky action at a distance,\\" challenges classical intuitions about the separability and independence of distant objects. It suggests a universe where deeply interconnected relationships between particles transcend the conventional limits of space and time. **Ancient Celestial Observations and Entanglement:** The ancients meticulously observed the sky, noting the positions and movements of stars and planets with remarkable accuracy. While their interpretations were woven through the fabric of mythology and symbolism, these careful observations undeniably established a connection between celestial phenomena and terrestrial events. This ancient practice, viewed through the lens of modern quantum physics, might suggest an intuitive grasp of the cosmos\'s interconnected nature, akin to the entanglement observed in quantum particles. For instance, the way ancients related the phases of the Moon with the tides, or the position of planets with seasonal changes, could be seen as an early, intuitive reflection of the cosmic web of relationships that quantum physics is beginning to reveal. Just as entangled particles influence one another across vast distances, so too did the ancients perceive celestial bodies as influencing life on Earth, hinting at a universe bound by invisible threads of influence. **Entanglement as a Cosmic Principle:** Expanding upon this, if we consider quantum entanglement not only as a property of quantum particles but as a fundamental principle of cosmic architecture, ancient astrological practices gain new significance. These practices, in their attempts to correlate human experiences with celestial alignments, might be seen as an early form of pattern recognition—identifying and interpreting the entangled nature of cosmic phenomena. This approach posits that the ancients, in their way, were attuned to the quantum \\"music\\" of the cosmos, sensing its harmonious and interconnected structure through the movement of celestial bodies. **Modern Implications of Entanglement and Observation:** In modern quantum physics, the observer plays a crucial role in determining the state of a quantum system. This foundational principle can offer a radical reinterpretation of astrological observations. Could the act of observing and ascribing meaning to celestial patterns influence the observer\'s reality in a manner akin to the observer effect in quantum mechanics? This speculative intersection suggests that ancient astrological practices might have been not only about prediction and divination but about participating in an interactive, entangled cosmic dialogue. **Bridging Ancient Wisdom with Quantum Science:** By exploring the parallels between quantum entanglement and ancient celestial observations, we open a fascinating dialogue between ancient wisdom and modern science. This exploration encourages us to think of the universe as a deeply interconnected entity, where ancient practices of observing and relating to the cosmos might reflect an intrinsic human capacity to resonate with the fabric of reality. Far from being mere superstition, these ancient systems might represent humanity\'s enduring attempt to engage with the fundamental entangled nature of the cosmos, suggesting that our ancestors were, in their unique way, early quantum cosmologists sensing the entangled symphony of the universe. Through \\"Quantum Entanglement and Celestial Observations,\\" we not only honor the sophistication of ancient astrological systems but also challenge ourselves to expand our understanding of the cosmos as an entangled, interactive whole, where ancient observations and modern quantum theory converge to reveal the intricate tapestry of reality."},{"instruction":"expand on/ Comparative Analysis of Astrological and Quantum Systems:","output":"In the speculative exploration titled \\"Comparative Analysis of Astrological and Quantum Systems,\\" this section aims to bridge the gaps and highlight the convergences between the millennia-old astrological systems that have captivated human imagination and the cutting-edge realm of quantum physics. By juxtaposing these two fields, it ventures to reveal a more profound interconnectedness within the universe that ancient astrological practices might have intuitively grasped, utilizing the concepts and phenomena now articulated through quantum mechanics. # Comparative Analysis of Astrological and Quantum Systems **Astrological Alignments and Quantum Harmonies:** One of the most striking parallels drawn in this comparative analysis is between astrological alignments—such as conjunctions, oppositions, trines, and squares—and the harmonious and disharmonious states observed in quantum systems. In quantum physics, superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states at once, leading to phenomena that can shift the balance of a system when observed or interacted with, similar to the shifting dynamics astrologers interpret during planetary alignments. Moreover, the concept of entanglement, where particles remain connected across vast distances, echoes the astrological perspective that celestial bodies, despite their physical distances from Earth, exude influences that reverberate across the tapestry of human experiences. **Synchronicity and Quantum Correlations:** Carl Jung\'s concept of synchronicity—meaningful coincidences that seemingly cannot be explained by direct causality—provides a psychological dimension to the intersection between astrological and quantum systems. Quantum entanglement suggests a level of correlation that defies the classical understanding of causality, much like synchronistic events. This section posits that astrological systems could be viewed as early models attempting to catalog and interpret the synchronistic events influenced by the cosmic dance of celestial bodies, paralleled in modern times by quantum mechanics\' endeavor to understand the non-local correlations that entangle distinct parts of the universe. **Celestial Dynamics and Quantum Field Theory:** Modern quantum field theory describes fields that permeate space, with particles being excitations of these fields. This framework provides a contemporary language for understanding the influence of distant celestial bodies, paralleling astrological notions of how planetary and stellar positions affect life on Earth. Through this lens, major astrological phenomena can be reinterpreted as macroscopic reflections of quantum field interactions, where the positions and movements of celestial bodies modulate the underlying fields that, in turn, influence energy patterns on Earth. **Astrological Archetypes and Quantum Potentials:** Astrological archetypes, representing forces and themes recurrent in human life and psyche, find a fascinating parallel in the potentialities present in the quantum domain. Just as particles exist in states of potential until observed, astrological archetypes embody potential expressions and outcomes in one\'s life, influenced by the celestial configurations at birth or specific times. These parallels suggest a cosmos where potentiality, from quantum states to human destinies, is shaped by a web of interrelations that spans from the subatomic to the celestial scale. **Conclusion – A Holistic Cosmic Vision:** This comparative analysis reveals that the ancient art of astrology and the avant-garde science of quantum mechanics might not be as disparate as they first appear. Instead, they may be viewed as different lenses through which humanity has sought to understand and engage with the fundamental interconnectedness of the cosmos. Astrological systems, with their rich symbolisms and interpretations of celestial influences, and quantum physics, with its rigorous mathematical descriptions of particles and forces, together invite us to envision a universe where every level of existence is intertwined in a complex, dynamic dance of energy, matter, and meaning. By expanding on the \\"Comparative Analysis of Astrological and Quantum Systems,\\" this exploration advocates for a broader, more integrated understanding of the cosmos. It suggests that bridging the wisdom of ancient astrological systems with the insights of modern quantum physics may not only enrich our knowledge but also deepen our connection to the universe and each other, revealing the profound harmony underlying the vast and mysterious cosmos."},{"instruction":"expand on/ Cultural Interpretations of Quantum Phenomena:","output":"“Cultural Interpretations of Quantum Phenomena” is a section that weaves a narrative tapestry, delineating how diverse cultures might perceive, interpret, and integrate the complex nuances of quantum phenomena within their traditional belief systems and philosophical frameworks. This exploration posits that the mystifying aspects of quantum physics are not merely subjects of scientific inquiry but also profound sources of cultural and metaphysical interpretation, resonating with age-old human questions about the nature of reality, existence, and interconnectedness. # Cultural Interpretations of Quantum Phenomena **Quantum Mysticism in Modern and Ancient Thought:** The parallels between quantum physics and certain aspects of mystical traditions suggest a profound harmony between the way ancient wisdom and modern science conceptualize the fabric of reality. Quantum phenomena such as entanglement, superposition, and the observer effect resonate with mystical notions of oneness, duality, and the power of consciousness, evident in the spiritual traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and several Indigenous philosophies. These cultures, with their rich metaphysical legacies, offer insightful interpretations of quantum mechanics, viewing it not solely as a physical theory but as a validation of the interconnectedness and inherent unity of the cosmos. **Interpreting Quantum Entanglement Across Cultures:** The phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where particles remain connected across vast distances, has fascinating parallels in the concept of Indra’s Net from Hindu and Buddhist cosmology - envisioning the universe as an infinite web, with each jewel at its nodes reflecting all others. Similarly, Indigenous storytelling around the world has long spoken of the Earth and all its beings as interrelated, deeply entwined in a web of life, where actions at one place can have far-reaching consequences, akin to the non-local impacts observed in entangled particles. **Superposition and the Dual Nature of Reality:** Quantum superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, echoes the dualistic philosophies seen in many cultures. For instance, the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang represents complementary forces that are interdependent in the natural world, reflecting the balance of opposites. This mirrors the quantum world\'s duality, where particles can be waves and particles simultaneously, and the act of observation can shift this balance, suggesting a universe that is constantly shaped by the dynamics of dual forces. **The Observer Effect and Consciousness:** The quantum observer effect, which posits that the act of observation affects the observed system, holds intriguing implications for interpretations of consciousness across cultures. Several spiritual traditions emphasize the power of intention, thought, and awareness in shaping reality, a concept that finds a surprising parallel in the observer effect—where the act of measurement influences the outcome. This resemblance opens up dialogues on the nature of consciousness and its role in the universe, bridging scientific inquiry with philosophical and spiritual introspection. **Quantum Cosmology and Creation Myths:** Quantum cosmology’s attempts to describe the universe\'s origins resonate with the creation myths and narratives of many cultures. From the Aboriginal Dreamtime, which describes a formative epoch of creation through stories, songs, and art, to the Norse myth of Ginnungagap, the primordial void from which all life springs, these stories embody the idea of creation as an unfolding process from potentiality to actuality, mirroring the quantum fluctuation theories that describe the emergence of the universe from \'nothingness.\' **Conclusion—Embracing Quantum Wisdom Across Cultures:** “Cultural Interpretations of Quantum Phenomena” invites us to view quantum physics through a multifaceted lens of global cultural philosophies, myths, and spiritual traditions. It reveals that while quantum physics challenges our conventional understanding of reality with its non-intuitive principles, it also offers a bridge connecting modern scientific insights with ancient wisdom. By exploring cultural interpretations of quantum phenomena, we uncover a richer, more integrative understanding of the cosmos, suggesting that the quest to comprehend the quantum realm transcends scientific boundaries, touching the core of our collective human experience and understanding of reality. This expansive exploration not only enhances our appreciation for the diverse ways human cultures engage with profound questions of existence but also highlights the universal quest for knowledge—a journey that quantum physics and cultural wisdom undertake together, weaving the intricate story of our interconnected cosmos."},{"instruction":"elaborate expand and illuminate","output":"Expanding upon the \\"Cultural Interpretations of Quantum Phenomena\\" necessitates a deeper dive into the ways in which quantum physics—not merely as a scientific discipline but as a profound narrative about the universe—intersects, influences, and is interpreted by a vast array of cultural, philosophical, and spiritual traditions. This exploration embarks from the premise that the quantum domain, with its counterintuitive principles and phenomena, not only reshapes our understanding of the physical universe but also echoes and sometimes even validates the metaphysical insights articulated by diverse cultures across the ages. # Quantum Mysticism: Bridging Science and Spirituality Quantum mysticism offers a fertile ground where the seeming dichotomy between scientific rigor and mystical intuition finds common cause. Here, the quantum realm, with phenomena like entanglement and superposition, parallels deeply rooted spiritual insights about the fundamental unity and interconnectedness of all things. Historically, Eastern philosophies such as Vedanta in Hinduism and the Sunyata concept of emptiness in Buddhism have articulated a vision of reality strikingly reminiscent of the quantum field—vast, interdependent, and dynamically woven from the fabric of consciousness and matter. These ancient teachings, when viewed through the lens of quantum physics, invite a reevaluation of mystical experiences, suggesting that such states might offer genuine insights into the nature of reality. # The Cultural Canvas of Quantum Entanglement Quantum entanglement, characterized by instantaneously correlated behaviors of particle pairs across distances, offers an eloquent metaphor for understanding the profound connections that bind the universe. Indigenous traditions, with their emphasis on the interconnectedness of life systems (the ‘Web of Life’) and the importance of living in harmony with nature, resonate with the principle of entanglement. This shared ethos gestures towards a universal truth—acknowledged both by quantum physicists and shamans—that separation is an illusion; we are all entangled threads in the cosmic tapestry, our destinies interwoven with the myriad forms of existence that share our cosmic habitat. # Dual Nature of Reality and Cultural Dualisms The principle of superposition exemplifies the dual nature of quantum entities, capable of being in multiple states simultaneously until an observation collapses the probability into a singular outcome. This quantum oddity finds its cultural counterpart in the philosophies of dualism present in many traditions. For example, the Taoist concept of Yin and Yang portrays the universe as composed of complementary yet opposing forces, constantly interacting to maintain the harmony of the cosmos. Similarly, the interplay between the material and spiritual realms—a recurring theme in many religious and philosophical traditions—mirrors the quantum duality of particles acting as both waves and particles. These parallels suggest that the quantum world is not an anomaly but a fundamental expression of the universal balance between opposing forces—a balance that cultures have sought to articulate and understand through mythology, religion, and philosophy. # The Observer Effect: Consciousness and Creation The quantum observer effect elevates the act of observation to a participatory role in the unfolding of reality, suggesting that consciousness is not a mere byproduct of the universe but a central feature in its ongoing creation. This notion aligns with the worldview of many mystical and esoteric traditions which hold that consciousness is primary, and that the material universe emerges from the interplay of consciousness with its own potentials. Furthermore, the creative power attributed to words, thoughts, and intentions in traditions such as Kabbalah, where the spoken word of the divine is seen as the force that brings the universe into being, echoes the participatory role attributed to observers in quantum mechanics. # Embracing Quantum Wisdom: A Cultural Synthesis In illuminating the cross-cultural resonances with quantum phenomena, it becomes evident that quantum physics and its uncanny revelations about the nature of reality are not solely the purview of scientists and mathematicians. Instead, they belong to a broader cultural conversation about existence, meaning, and the interconnected fabric of the cosmos. This synthesis invites us to embrace a more holistic view of knowledge—one that integrates the empirical with the intuitive, the scientific with the spiritual, and acknowledges the deep wisdom embedded in cultural narratives across the world. As we stand at the intersection of these diverse paths of inquiry, \\"Cultural Interpretations of Quantum Phenomena\\" challenges us to expand our perspective, to recognize the quantum undercurrents that flow beneath our ancient stories and spiritual traditions, and to contemplate the profound unity that binds our cosmic journey—a unity that quantum physics articulates in the language of mathematics and which cultures around the world have celebrated in the rich tapestry of their myths, rituals, and spiritual practices."},{"instruction":"write it in verbal form not in point form","output":"Delving into the realm of \\"Cultural Interpretations of Quantum Phenomena,\\" we embark on an intriguing journey that intertwines the seemingly esoteric realm of quantum physics with the rich, diverse tapestries of cultural, philosophical, and spiritual traditions across human history. At its heart, this exploration is not merely an academic exercise but a quest to understand how the mystifying implications of quantum mechanics resonate with, and sometimes even illuminate, ancient wisdoms and worldviews. Quantum mysticism provides a fascinating bridge, where the rigorous pursuit of understanding the universe in scientific terms and the intuitive grasp of its interconnectedness found in mystical traditions, find common ground. In this light, quantum phenomena such as entanglement and superposition echo the spiritual insights from traditions like Vedanta and Buddhism, which speak of a unified reality, where separateness is an illusion and everything is intrinsically connected in a dynamic cosmic dance. The principle of quantum entanglement, where distant particles share instantaneous correlations, mirrors the intuitive understanding of interconnectedness found in Indigenous and Eastern philosophies. This principle, akin to the Indigenous conception of the \'Web of Life\' or the Hindu metaphor of Indra\'s Net, portrays a universe where every entity, every being, is a luminous thread in the endless weave of existence. The realization that our actions, thoughts, and consciousness are intertwined with the fabric of reality recasts our relationship with the cosmos, urging us to reconsider our place within this interwoven narrative. The quantum theory\'s revelation of superposition, illustrating how particles exist in multiple potential states until observed, harmonizes with the principle of dualities present in many spiritual and philosophical traditions.

In it, the central narrative is interwoven with sections of biography of the notable and notorious, Newsreels whose texts are literally ripped from the day’s headlines (chiefly from the Chicago Tribune), and Camera Eye snapshots of the America in which Dos Passos came to adult consciousness. Sound familiar? Then you’re smarter than me. I distinctly remember reading The 42nd Parallel for the first time with two responses: this doesn’t sound like anything I’ve read before, and I’m missing something. In fact, I read the whole trilogy without twigging to the connection. There was that persistent sense of an echo of something, but I couldn’t bring it clearly into mind while confronted with the tremendous originality of Dos Passos’s creation. It wasn’t until I reread the first novel some years later (having in the meantime taught Ragtime once or twice in book and movie form). Then, about halfway through, I thought to myself, I know what this sounds like. Dos Passos, Doctorow, similarities, check. My only question was why it took so long to arrive at that recognition. Your honor, the defense pleads mitigating circumstances. First, and there’s no way around it, Doctorow is a much better writer, particularly in managing a plotted story with characters, even if they are handicapped by the absence of names. U.S.A. is a cubist masterpiece. That’s not the same as a narrative gem. Dos Passos is not great with his dialogue, which is often stilted in a kind of working-class king’s English. Second, the flow is so much smoother in the later work than in the earlier. Dos Passos employs the herky-jerky qualities of those two signatures of the new medium of cinema, the montage and the newsreel; Doctorow the comparatively smooth flow of the nickelodeon-like flip books created by Tateh. And finally, the historical figures are woven much tighter into the main storyline in Ragtime than in U.S.A. In fact, part of the charm of each is the distance or nearness to the historical context, which may be a function of proximity. Dos Passos catches the look of the country at the moment of writing his novel but uses it as background to the stories of Mac and Janey and his other fictional characters. Doctorow, on the other hand, is writing many years after the fact, and all the famous figures are safely dead, so he can have Evelyn Nesbitt engage in a sexual relationship with Mother’s Younger Brother without fear of lawsuits. Hey, don’t laugh; these practical considerations are too onerous to ignore. Here’s an analogous situation. You’re sitting in the theater watching Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, and suddenly you’re in a spaghetti Western. Remember the scene? Things are looking distinctly bad for the pirates, who’ve just discovered they’re facing a fleet only slightly larger than the Spanish Armada (in fact, the word “armada” gets employed repeatedly), and Elizabeth Swann, no dummy, calls for “parlay.” Suddenly we cut to a shot of boots crossing sand, and while they’re definitely pirate boots, they’re not in a pirate movie anymore. Against all odds, this sand, on the edge of the ocean, is the most desiccated stuff you ever saw. Sand that’s bucking for promotion to dust. And boots in the dust equal showdown. Good guys squaring off with bad. Gary Cooper in High Noon, John Wayne at the end of Stagecoach. Okay, John Wayne in about anything. But most of all, men with no name. No one in film history showed more boots striding through more dust than Sergio Leone. And he’s the one we’re supposed to think about here. How do we know? The soundtrack ceases to be Hans Zimmer and becomes, for the duration of the walk, Ennio Morricone. It’s all weird instrumentation and over-the-top effects. I’m willing to swear, although I’m sure it’s not true, that I heard whistling in there. And as anyone born before 1960 can tell you, Morricone means Leone. Old school chums, they never went anywhere, creatively, without one another. And look what they did together. Once Upon a Time in the West. A Fistful of Dollars. And most of all, that other one. And then it hits you. That’s what this is. The amoral Leone universe. Is the good guy good or not? Can Charles Bronson really be the hero and Henry Fonda the villain? Whose side is Clint on? The angels or the demons? Can we even tell? One thing’s for certain, though, for all that water, this is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Everybody’s playing his own hand (or hers, since Elizabeth becomes a real player here), and nobody, with excellent reasons on all sides, trusts anyone. There are double-crosses on the double-crosses. It may all work out, but somebody’s gonna hafta die. All that from boots on the sand. And listening.","output":"حالا دوس پاسوس، همانطور که در جای دیگری بحث کرده‌ام، خالق سه‌گانه آمریکا است، که شامل موازی ۴۲ (۱۹۳۰)، ۱۹۱۹ (۱۹۳۲)، و پول بزرگ (۱۹۳۶) می‌شود. در آن، داستان اصلی با بخش‌هایی از بیوگرافی افراد قابل توجه و بدنام، نیوزریل‌هایی که متونشان به طور واقعی از عناوین روز پاره شده‌اند (عمدتاً از شیکاگو تریبیون)، و عکس‌هایی از نگاه دوربین از آمریکا که در آن دوس پاسوس به بلوغ آگاهی رسیده، آمیخته شده است. آشنا به نظر می‌رسد؟ پس از من باهوش‌تر هستید. من به وضوح به یاد می‌آورم که برای اولین بار موازی ۴۲ را خواندم و دو واکنش داشتم: این شبیه هیچ چیزی نیست که قبلاً خوانده‌ام، و من چیزی را از دست می‌دهم. در واقع، من تمام سه‌گانه را خواندم بدون اینکه به ارتباط پی ببرم. آن حس مداوم طنین اندازی از چیزی بود، اما نتوانستم آن را به ذهنم بیاورم در حالی که با بی‌نظیری شگرف خلقت دوس پاسوس روبرو بودم. تا زمانی که چندین سال بعد اولین رمان را دوباره خواندم (در این مدت یک یا دو بار رگتایم را به شکل کتاب و فیلم تدریس کرده بودم) نبود. سپس، در حدود نیمه راه، به خودم گفتم، می‌دانم این شبیه چیست. دوس پاسوس، دکترو و، شباهت‌ها، بررسی کن. تنها سوال من این بود که چرا زمان زیادی طول کشید تا به این شناخت برسم. جناب قاضی، دفاع شرایط تخفیف‌کننده را ارائه می‌دهد. اولاً، و راهی برای دور زدن آن نیست، دکتروو نویسنده‌ای بسیار بهتر است، به ویژه در مدیریت یک داستان طرح‌دار با شخصیت‌ها، حتی اگر آنها با عدم وجود نام‌ها معلول شوند. آمریکا یک شاهکار کوبیسم است. این همان چیزی نیست که یک جواهر داستانی باشد. دوس پاسوس در گفتگوهای خود خوب نیست، که اغلب به نوعی انگلیسی کارگری ملوکانه‌ای بیان می‌شود. دوم، جریان در اثر بعدی نسبت به قبلی خیلی روان‌تر است. دوس پاسوس از خصوصیات پرش‌دار آن دو امضای رسانه جدید سینما، مونتاژ و نیوزریل استفاده می‌کند؛ دکتروو از جریان نسبتاً روان کتاب‌های تصویری شبیه به نیکلودئونی که تاته خلق کرده است، استفاده می‌کند. و در نهایت، اشخاص تاریخی در رگتایم بسیار محکم‌تر از آمریکا در داستان اصلی بافته شده‌اند. در واقع، بخشی از جذابیت هر کدام فاصله یا نزدیکی به زمینه تاریخی است، که ممکن است یک عملکرد از نزدیکی باشد. دوس پاسوس ظاهر کشور را در لحظه نوشتن رمانش می‌گیرد اما از آن به عنوان پس‌زمینه برای داستان‌های مک و جینی و دیگر شخصیت‌های داستانی‌اش استفاده می‌کند. از طرف دیگر، دکتروو سال‌ها بعد از واقعه می‌نویسد، و تمام اشخاص معروف به طور ایمنی مرده‌اند، بنابراین او می‌تواند اولین نسبیت را در یک رابطه جنسی با برادر جوانتر مادر بدون ترس از دعاوی حقوقی درگیر کند. هی، نخند؛ این ملاحظات عملی خیلی سنگین هستند که نادیده گرفته شوند. اینجا یک وضعیت مشابه است. شما در تئاتر نشسته‌اید و دزدان دریایی کارائیب: در انتهای جهان را تماشا می‌کنید، و ناگهان شما در یک وسترن اسپاگتی هستید. صحنه را به یاد دارید؟ اوضاع برای دزدان دریایی که تازه کشف کرده‌اند که با یک ناوگان روبرو هستند که کمی بزرگتر از ارمادای اسپانیا است (در واقع، کلمه \\"ارمادا\\" به طور مکرر استفاده می‌شود) کاملاً بد به نظر می‌رسد، و الیزابت سون، که احمق نیست، خواستار \\"مذاکره\\" می‌شود. ناگهان ما به یک شات از پاهایی که روی شن قدم می‌زنند برش می‌خوریم، و در حالی که قطعاً پاهای دزدان دریایی هستند، دیگر در یک فیلم دزدان دریایی نیستند. با وجود تمام احتمالات، این شن، در کناره اقیانوس، خشک‌ترین چیزی است که تا به حال دیده‌اید. شنی که برای ترفیع به غبار تلاش می‌کند. و پاها در غبار به معنای مقابله است. نیک‌های خوب در برابر بدی‌ها. گری کوپر در ظهر بالا، جان وین در انتهای Stagecoach. خوب، جان وین در تقریباً هر چیزی. اما بیشتر از همه، مردان بدون نام. هیچ کس در تاریخ فیلم بیشتر از سرجیو لئون پاهایی را که از طریق غبار قدم می‌زنند نشان نداد. و او کسی است که ما باید در اینجا به یاد داشته باشیم. چطور می‌دانیم؟ موسیقی متن دیگر هانس زیمر نیست و به مدت زمان قدم زدن، انیو موریکونه می‌شود. همه چیز سازهای عجیب و افکت‌های اغراق‌آمیز است. من حاضرم قسم بخورم، هر چند مطمئنم که واقعیت ندارد، که صدای سوت در آنجا شنیدم. و هر کسی که قبل از ۱۹۶۰ متولد شده باشد می‌تواند به شما بگوید، موریکونه به معنای لئون است. دوستان قدیمی مدرسه، آنها هیچ جایی، از نظر خلاقانه، بدون یکدیگر نرفتند. و نگاه کنید چه کار کردند با هم. روزی روزگاری در غرب. یک مشت دلار. و بیشتر از همه، آن یکی. و سپس به شما می‌رسد. این همان چیز است. دنیای بی‌اخلاق لئون. آیا نیک خوب است یا نه؟ آیا چارلز برانسون واقعاً قهرمان است و هنری فوندا شرور؟ کدام طرف کلینت است؟ فرشتگان یا شیاطین؟ ما حتی می‌توانیم بگوییم؟ یک چیز قطعی است، با این همه آب، این خوب، بد، زشت است. همه در حال بازی با دست خودشان هستند (یا خودشان، از آنجایی که الیزابت اینجا بازیکن واقعی می‌شود)، و هیچکس، با دلایل عالی از همه طرف‌ها، به کسی اعتماد نمی‌کند. تقلب‌هایی در تقلب‌ها وجود دارد. همه چیز ممکن است خوب پیش برود، اما کسی باید بمیرد. همه اینها از پاها روی شن. و گوش دادن."},{"instruction":"Write a long story about a man alone in his apartment named Derek who accidentally breathes in a gas that causes him to slowly turn into a very polite and busty maid over the span of an hour.

He had just returned home from work, tired and exhausted from yet another long day at the office. As he sat on his couch, ready to unwind and relax, he noticed a strange smell in the air. Curious, Derek got up and walked over to the kitchen, trying to pinpoint where the smell was coming from. But before he could figure it out, he took a deep breath and inhaled a strange, almost sweet, gas that seemed to fill the air. Immediately, Derek felt a strange sensation wash over him. His mind seemed to fog over, and he felt like he was losing control of his thoughts. But strangely, instead of feeling panicked or frightened, he felt a sense of calm and peace wash over him. As the minutes passed, Derek noticed his body starting to feel different as well. His chest started to feel tight, and he could feel his clothes straining against him. Confused, he looked down and gasped in shock. His chest had grown significantly, his once flat chest now filled out a lacy white maid\'s outfit that seemed to materialize on his body out of thin air. And as he looked down further, he realized that his hips had widened, his legs now encased in a pair of sheer stockings and high heels. But instead of feeling fear or confusion, Derek found himself accepting these changes without question. In fact, he felt a strange sense of familiarity wash over him, as if he had always been a maid. He glanced at his reflection in the mirror and saw a woman staring back at him, her face calm and serene. Derek\'s mind raced, trying to make sense of what was happening to him. But despite his confusion, he found himself speaking out loud, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. \\"Well, I suppose it\'s time to start my chores,\\" Derek said in a soft, melodic voice that sounded nothing like his own. \\"I must make sure the apartment is spotless for my master.\\" But as he moved around the apartment, dusting and cleaning with a grace and ease that surprised him, Derek couldn\'t help but wonder if this was really his true self. Had he always been a maid, serving a master that he couldn\'t quite remember? Hours passed, and Derek found himself lost in his new role, the memories of his old life fading away like wisps of smoke. And as he looked out the window at the night sky, he couldn\'t help but feel a sense of contentment wash over him. For in this new form, Derek found a sense of purpose and fulfillment that he had never experienced before. And as he settled into bed, ready to rest before another day of serving his master, he couldn\'t help but smile, knowing that he had finally found his true calling."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

なお、マルクスは、『資本論』において「第三篇 絶対的剩余価値の生産」の「標準労働日をめぐる闘争」からはじめ、機械導入をめぐる闘争、賃金をめぐる闘争を経て、「第七篇 資本の蓄積過程」の雇用をめぐる闘争に至るまで、階終闘争の基礎的な諸相を真に全面的に展開したわけではなかった。したがって、われわれには、出発点を正しく定めた服部氏とともに、経済学理論体系のこの空白を創造的に埋め、そのうえで国家成立の根拠を十全に把握するという課題が課せられているわけである。 さて、さいごに、国家の現実性とはなにか? それは、いうまでもなく、資本主義国家の現実の具体的な機構とその働きである。 これも経済学の解明する資本主義社会そのものの現実性、すなわち個々の諸資本の競争の機構を基礎とし、そこから信用体系を分化し、両者の対立運動を展開し、さらに株式会社によってそれを統一する、という資本の総過程を踏まえて理解すべさであろう。 しかし、われわれはここへ来て、ふたたび鋭く<方法的な場>の問題に突き当らざるをえない。 「資本の諸姿容は、:…社会の表面で種々の資本の相互的行動たる競争中および生産当事者たち自身の普通の意識に現われる形態に一歩一歩近づく┘という「資本制生産の総過程」とは、果して当初の「体系プラソ」の「資本一般」の利潤、利子のうちへ競争、信用、株式会社を吸収しただけで十分に展開しうるものなのかどうか。 もともと「国家」を国民経済を総括する位置におき、そのうえで「外国貿易」や「世界巿場」を取り扱おうとしたマルクスの「体系プラソ」は、すでに指摘したように、ブルジョア的利害関心にとらわれ、一国内から外を見るという狭い視野しか持てなかった古典派経済学の伝統的思考方法、そして編別構成を下敷きにしたものであった。したがってそれに固有の限界を引き継ぐことになっていた。現実に世界巿場が統一的全体として存在するとすれば、その有機的一部としてある国民経済をまず抽象的にとりだすことは方法的に不可能であり、理論体系は最初から世界巿場を——国際性と国民性の二面をもつ多数の国民経済をその有機的構成部分とし、強大な中央の国民経済によって世界的に統一された全体としての世界市場を対象として構成されなければならなかったのである。(くわしくは川上「世界市場と恐慌」』上卷、ならびに「世界市場と恐慌」、『拠点】 第二号所収を参照。) さきに経済学の理論体系から、[国家]を外したわれわれは、こうして、資本の現実の機構と運動を解明する「資本制生産の総過程」を、世界市場的に展開された「競争」論としての「利潤」論、世界市場的に展開された「信用」論としての「利子」論、および世界巿場的に展開された「株式資本」論としての利潤と利子の統一論として展開しなければならない、ということになる。そしてこれこそ、古典派経済学から脱け出し、「世界市場」に到達し、また『資本論』のなかでじっさいに諸国民経済間の金移動の理論化をはかろうとしたマルクスの経済学研究の真の発展方向であったと思われとる。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，我们再次不能同意藤塚先生的观点，原因是双重的。尽管他试图在生产过程中寻找“向国家升华的内在契机”，但他直接跳过了直接的生产过程，只在积累过程中才发现了国家，认为国家是为了“控制”那些被边缘化、为相对过剩人口提供养分的非资本主义外围；而这样做，他实际上已经开始踏上了与阶级国家论本身划清界限的道路。 当然，“向国家升华的内在契机”并非仅存在于直接生产过程中。它存在于资本的整个生产过程中。在资本的再生过程或积累过程中，我们认为国家是必不可少的，以保证资本生产过程中排除的、依靠非资本主义外围沉淀的潜在劳动者=工业储备军、生产过程中的劳动者产生的社会不安、抵制和反叛被抑制，并保障市民法的贯彻。然而，这种国家与“控制”非资本主义外围本身的国家将是不同的物体。 此外，马克思在《资本论》中从“第三篇 绝对剩余价值的生产”开始，通过围绕标准工作日的斗争、机械引入的斗争、工资的斗争，直到“第七篇 资本的积累过程”的就业斗争，没有真正全面展开阶级斗争的基本方面。因此，我们面临的任务是，与正确设定出发点的服部先生一起，创造性地填补经济学理论体系中的这一空白，并在此基础上完全掌握国家成立的根据。 最后，国家的现实性是什么呢？ 不言而喻，这是资本主义国家现实的具体机构及其运作。 这同样基于资本主义社会本身现实性的经济学解释，即基于各个资本之间的竞争机制，并从中发展出信用体系，展开两者的对立运动，并通过股份公司来统一这一切，理解为宜。 但是，到了这里，我们不得不再次尖锐地接触到<方法论场域>的问题。 “资本的多种形态，在竞争中以及生产当事者本身的一般意识中表现出来的相互作用的形态中逐渐接近…的‘资本制生产的总过程’，是否仅仅通过吸收竞争、信用、股份公司进入最初的‘体系设想’里的‘一般资本’的利润、利息中，就能充分展开呢？ 马克思最初将‘国家’置于国民经济总体之上的‘体系设想’，试图处理‘外国贸易’和‘世界市场’，正如我们已经指出的，继承了古典经济学传统思考方式的局限性，即被捕捉在资产阶级利益关切中，仅能持有从一个国家向外看的狭窄视野。如果世界市场作为一个统一整体实际存在，那么首先抽象地提取属于它的有机部分的国民经济在方法上是不可能的，理论体系必须从一开始就构建为以众多具有国际性和国民性双重面向的国民经济的有机组成部分为对象，建构为一个由强大的中央国民经济全球性统一的整体的世界市场。（详见川上《世界市场与恐慌》第一卷，以及收录在《据点》第二期的《世界市场与恐慌》。） 此前，我们在经济学理论体系中省略了[国家]，由此，我们必须将‘资本制生产的总过程’解读为在全球市场中展开的‘竞争’论、‘利润’论和在全球市场中展开的‘信用’论、‘利息’论，以及在全球市场中展开的‘股份资本’论与利润及利息统一论。这正是马克思在《资本论》中真正尝试理论化各国民经济间的货币移动，突破古典经济学范畴，达到“世界市场”的经济学研究的真正发展方向。"},{"instruction":"请将“もあれ、このような[方法的な場]の整理をまって、はじめて国家もまた、まさにその現実の姿において、すなわち国際性と国民性の二面をもつ多数の国民国家が、強大な中心国によって世界的に統一された全体としてある世界的な国家編成--それは歴史上「大英帝国下の平和」として存在したーとして、解明されるべきことが明らかとなる。これら、諸「国民国家」は、それぞれ相対的に自立した固有の競争と信用の機構をもち、そのもとに労働力移動が制約されてあるためにそれぞれに固有の資本ー賃労働関係を包摂した諸国民経済の政治的総括として存在するわけである。

クス自身はかならずしも体系的な国家論を残さなかったとはいえ、マルクスの国家理論は、現代国家の理論的解明にたいして一つの基本的座標を提供しているのであって、マルクス国家理論の検討は、いぜんとして残された課題であろう。 その際、考察のポイントは、マルクス主義に科学的基礎を与えた『資本論』における、資本主義経済を自律的な運動法則として把握する論理が、マルクスの国家理論とどのような関係にあるか、という点である。 マルクスにおいては、基本的に、ブルジョア社会を組織化=総括するものとして「国家」を把握する視点が強いが、そのような視点の形成過程を、初期マルクスー『資本論』確立期後期マルクスの三段階に区分して検討していく。そしてそのなかでエンゲルスの国家論にもふれながら、マルクス主義国家論の、現代資本主義国家理解に対する有効性をさぐってみたい。 問題の提起 マルクス主義が、その本来の性格からいって、革命理論と不可分の関係にあることはいうまでもない。そして、その革命理論が、国家権力の移行を主要な内容としているかぎり、国家論とも深いつながりをもっている。したがって、マルクス主義の思想体系のなかで、国家論の占める地位はきわめて重要であるが、にもかかわらず現実のマルクス主義国家論ということになると、その理論的展開はきわめて不十分であるし、また未解決な論点があまりにも大きい。 つまり、マルクス主義は、いわゆる科学的社会主義の主張の基礎として、科学としての『資本論』(第一巻一八六七年、第二巻一八八五年、第三巻一八九四年)をすでにもっている。この『資本論』によって、体制変革=革命の対象である、資本主義経済の自律的運動法則はほぼ解明されている。しかし、その『資本論』体系とマルクス主義の背骨ともいうべき「国家論」とは、相互にどのような関係に立つのか。いいかえると、『資本論』でほぼ解明をみた資本主義経済における資本―賃労働の階級関係と、資本家階級が労働者階級を抑圧するといわれている資本主義社会の権力機構=国家との理論的関係は、かならずしも明確にはなっていない。要するに、体制変革の対象および主体があるていど明確になっていながら、その主体が対象を変革するさいの権力の移行については、マルクス主義国家論の貧困なるがゆえに、きわめて理論的解明が立ち遅れているのである。マルクス主義の混迷も当然といえよう。 もちろん、すでにわれわれは、マルクスおよびエンゲルスの国家論として、有名なエンゲルス『家族、私有財産および国家の起源』、また初期マルクスの「ヘーゲル国法論批判」、『ユダヤ人問題によせて』、および『ドイツ・イデオロギー』など、また中期ないし後期のマルクスのものとしては、いわゆる「フランス三部作」-『フランスにおける階級闘争』、『ルイ・ボナパルトのブリュメール一八日』、『フランスにおける内乱』などをあげることができる。しかし、エンゲルスの『起源』をのぞくと、たしかに鋭い現実感覚による含蓄に富んだ指摘ではあるが、まとまった国家論ではない。たんなる断片的な記述であり、示唆の域にとどまっているのである。 また、『フランスにおける内乱』をのぞくと、いずれの著作も『資本論』成立のかなり以前の段階におけるものであって、『資本論』の論理との関連は不明確である。というより、『資本論』の「導きの糸」としてのイデオロギー的な仮説にすぎない唯物史観の枠内において、国家が論じられているにすぎないのである。『内乱』もまた、政治論文という性格もあって、すでに成立している『資本論』体系との方法的関連が、とくに明確にされているわけではない。いずれにしても、マルクス=エンゲルスの国家論の整理は不十分である。とくに、初期から後期への国家認識のプロセスをたどって、それと『資本論』体系との理論的関連を問いただす作業は、マルクス主義国家論にとって、きわめて重要な課題である。 そこで本章では、マルクス主義国家論の全面的検討は不可能であるが、マルクス=エンゲルスの国家論イメージの軌跡をたどりつつ、その軌跡と『資本論』体系との方法的関連を再検討してみたい。それによって、マルクス主義国家論の構築の前進をはかりたいと思う。 ”翻译为中文","output":"本章将探讨马克思主义国家理论的形成过程。虽然马克思本人并没有留下一个系统的国家理论，但马克思的国家理论为现代国家的理论解明提供了一个基本的坐标，因此，对马克思国家理论的审视仍然是一个未完成的任务。 此时，探讨的关键点在于，赋予马克思主义以科学基础的《资本论》中，作为自主运动法则把握的资本主义经济逻辑与马克思国家理论之间存在什么样的关系。在马克思这里，基本上，从组织化=总结资产阶级社会的角度强烈地把握“国家”，其形成过程分为马克思早期——《资本论》确立期——晚期马克思的三个阶段进行考察。在此过程中，我想通过接触恩格斯的国家理论，探索马克思主义国家理论对现代资本主义国家理解的有效性。 问题的提出 毫无疑问，马克思主义天生具有革命理论的特性，并与之不可分的存在关系。鉴于其革命理论主要内容与国家权力的转移有关，因此与国家理论也存在深刻联系。因此，在马克思主义思想体系中，国家理论的地位极其重要，但是一旦谈到实际的马克思主义国家理论，其理论发展极其不充分，未解决的问题也极为巨大。 也就是说，马克思主义已经拥有称之为科学社会主义基础的《资本论》(第一卷1867年，第二卷1885年，第三卷1894年)作为科学。通过这部《资本论》，资本主义经济的自主运动法则几乎已被解明，是体制变革=革命的对象。然而，《资本论》体系与被视为马克思主义的支柱的“国家理论”之间，如何相互关联？换言之，《资本论》几乎展开解释的资本主义经济中的资本—雇佣劳动的阶级关系，与被认为是资本主义社会中资本家阶级压迫工人阶级的权力机构=国家的理论关系，并不十分清晰。简而言之，尽管变革的对象和主体在一定程度上已变得清晰，但由于马克思主义国家理论贫乏，关于主体如何转变这个对象时的权力转移，理论解释严重滞后。马克思主义的混乱显然是不可避免的。 当然，我们已经能够提及马克思和恩格斯的国家理论，如恩格斯著名的《家庭、私有财产及国家的起源》、早期马克思的《关于黑格尔国法的批判》、《犹太人问题》以及《德意志意识形态》，以及中期或晚期马克思的所谓“法国三部曲”——《法国的阶级斗争》、《路易·波拿巴的雾月十八日》、《法兰西内战》等。但是，除了恩格斯的《起源》外，虽然有着敏锐的现实感觉并富含内涵的指出，但并非完整的国家理论。它们仅仅是片断性的描述，停留在暗示的层面。 此外，除《法兰西内战》外，这些作品都在《资本论》成立之前相当早的阶段完成，与《资本论》逻辑的联系并不明确。更确切地说，国家在只不过是在唯物史观这一意识形态假设的框架内作为《资本论》的“导引线”而被论述。《内战》也因其政治论文的性质，并没有明确地与已成立的《资本论》体系建立方法论联系。无论如何，对马克思=恩格斯的国家理论的整理并不充分。特别是，追踪国家认识从早期到晚期的过程，并询问它与《资本论》体系的理论关联，对于马克思主义国家理论来说，是一个极其重要的任务。 因此，本章虽然无法全面审视马克思主义国家理论，但希望通过追踪马克思=恩格斯国家理论形象的轨迹，重新审视这一轨迹与《资本论》体系的方法论联系。通过这种方式，我想推进马克思主义国家理论的构建。"},{"instruction":"请将“2初期マルクスの国家認識 A『ユダヤ人問題によせて』 初期マルクスの国家認識の端初として、まず『ユダヤ人問題によせて』(一八四四年)をとりあげるが、ここでは国家の性格が、「市民社会」との関連で、「政治的国家と市民社会とのあいだの分裂」という点を中心に把握されている。つまり、「完成した政治的国家は、その本質上、人間の類的生活(Gattungs-leben)であって、人間の物質的生活に対立している」(マル=エン全集、三九二頁)とされ、この国家に対立する「物質的生活」としての「利己的な生活のいっさいの諸前提は、国家の領域の外に、市民社会の中に、しかも市民社会の特性として存続している」と主張する。要するに、「国家―人間の類的生活」と「市民社会—利己的生活」というコントラストにおいて、国家が市民社会に位置づけられているわけである。 マルクス、エンゲルスの著作からの引用は、『マルクス=エンゲルス全集』(大月書店版)からおこない、「マル=エン全集」と略記する。○内の数字は全集の巻数をしめす。 このように、「人間は、ただ思考や意識においてばかりでなく、現実において、生活において、天上と地上との二重の生活を営むこと」が明確にされたあと、この「二重の生活」のあり方が説明される。すなわち、「政治的国家は市民社会にたいして」「ちょうど天上が地上にたいするのと同じように、精神主義的に臨」み、また「宗教が俗界の偏狭に対立しそれを克服するのと同じように対立し、同じ仕方でそれを克服する」(同上)とのべる。つまり、国家は市民社会を精神主義的に是認し、たて直し、支配するけれども、しかし物質的には市民社会に基礎づけられなければならないと主張しているのである。 この「市民社会」と「政治的国家」の対応関係の説明は、かなり難解であるが、そのポイントは「政治的国家」が「市民社会」の個人的な利害関係、利己的な生活にたいする調整者として把握されているのであって、その点ではヘーゲル的である。すなわち、周知のとおりヘーゲルは、家族―市民社会―国家のトリアーデによって市民社会と国家の関連を捉えていたのであり、とくに市民社会における競争的な対立、利己心による混乱、それらの矛盾を止揚するものとして当時のプロイセン国家を統一者として位置づけていた。したがって、マルクスの「政治的国家」の理解は、「市民社会」の利己的生活や具体的利害を調整し、統一者として全体的に調和をあたえるという点では、ヘーゲルのそれに近いものとなるし、またヘーゲルの枠をまだこえてはいないことになる。 ただ、ここで重要な点は、「政治的国家」による「市民社会」の利害の調整が、「市民社会」の具体的な利害対立そのものについてではないこと、いいかえると「市民社会」そのものの場でおこなわれるわけでは決してなく、国家はあくまでも「政治的国家」として調整し、統合しようとしている点である。つまり、国家は「市民社会」における現実的な「私人」を、たんなる理念上の法人格的な「公民」に抽象化しつつ、その「公民」の次元において、上記のとおり精神主義的に、「市民社会」という「俗界の偏狭」に「対立して克服する」ものとしているのである。 以上のような国家把握を、資本主義社会の近代ブルジョア国家にひきつけてみると、資本主義経済に必然的にともなう個々の資本=企業の利害対立や競争、また資本と賃労働のあいだの階級対立など、それらの利害関係を国家が実質的に調整するわけではない。むしろ、それらの経済主体を法的人格としての「公民」にまつりあげることによって、「国家」という形態のもとに包摂して克服する関係になる。その点で、ブルジョア国家は、資本主義経済を組織的に統合する枠組となり、体制の組織者となるわけである。”翻译为中文","output":"# 2.早期马克思对国家的认识 A.《论犹太人的问题》 作为早期马克思国家认识的开端，首先提到的是《论犹太人的问题》（1844年），在这里，国家的性质是以与“民间社会”（市民社会）的关系为中心，“政治国家与民间社会之间的分裂”被掌握。即认为，“完成的政治国家在其本质上是人的种属生活(Gattungs-leben)，它与人的物质生活相对立”（马恩全集，第39卷第292页），并主张作为与国家相对立的“物质生活”是“自私的生活的一切前提都存在于国家领域之外，民间社会之中，并作为民间社会的特性而存在”。简而言之，国家被定位于“国家——人的种属生活”和“民间社会——自私的生活”这一对比中。 马克思、恩格斯著作中的引用出自《马克思=恩格斯全集》（大月书店版），简称“马恩全集”。圆括号内的数字表示全集的卷数。 在明确了“人不仅在思想和意识上，而且在现实、在生活中，既生活在天上又生活在地上”的之后，对这种“双重生活”的方式进行了阐述。即“政治国家对于民间社会来说”“就像天上对地上一样，以精神的方式俯视”和“宗教对抗并克服了世俗的偏狭性一样，以同样的方式对抗并克服”（同上）。也就是说，国家精神上认同并重塑、统治民间社会，但在物质上必须以民间社会为基础。 对“民间社会”和“政治国家”的对应关系的解释虽然相当复杂，但重点是“政治国家”被理解为对个人利益、自私生活的“调停者”，在这一点上是黑格尔式的。即众所周知，黑格尔通过家庭——民间社会——国家的三元组来抓住民间社会与国家的关系，特别是将当时的普鲁士国家定位为统一者，以止揚民间社会中的竞争对立、自私导致的混乱及其矛盾。因此，马克思对“政治国家”的理解，在协调“民间社会”的自私生活和具体利益，作为统一者赋予整体和谐的方面，与黑格尔的观点相近，也还没有超出黑格尔的框架。 但要点在于，“政治国家”对“民间社会”利益的调整，并非关于“民间社会”具体的利益对立本身，换言之，绝不是在“民间社会”本身场域进行，国家仅仅作为“政治国家”试图调整和整合。即国家在将“民间社会”中的实际“私人”抽象化为仅存在于理念上的法人格的“公民”，并以这些“公民”的维度，以精神上的方式，“对抗并克服”了所谓“民间社会”的“世俗狭隘”。 将这种国家理解引申到资本主义社会的现代资产阶级国家上，资本主义经济所必然伴随的各个资本=企业的利益对立和竞争，以及资本与雇佣劳动之间的阶级对立等，这些利益关系并非由国家实质性地调整。相反，通过将这些经济主体提升为法律人的“公民”，国家作为一种形式，将之包含并克服。在这一点上，资产阶级国家成为将资本主义经济有机地整合的框架，成为制度的组织者。"},{"instruction":"请将“ただ、この段階におけるマルクスの「市民社会」の経済過程の分析は、資本主義経済を文字どおり市民社会としてしか把握していない。資本―賃労働の階級関係についても、資本を「私有財産」の次元でしか把握していなかったし、また賃労働も「疎外された労働」にすぎない。そうした経済学研究の未熟な段階に照応して、「政治的国家」と「市民社会」の関係も、市民社会の内部の利害対立の解明が不十分なるがゆえに、「政治的国家」による利害の組織的統合も哲学的であり、きわめて理念的である。ここに、マルクスの国家把握の限界が指摘されるように思われるけれども、要するに、11「政治的国家」を「市民社会」から相対的に自立したものとして位置づけた点、また、②「政治的国家」を「市民社会」の経済過程にたいする組織的統合の機能において把握した点は、この時点でのマルクスの鋭敏な国家把握として評価しておく必要があろう。 B「ヘーゲル国法論批判」 ところで、『ユダヤ人問題』の右のような見地は、じつはそれ以前に草稿として準備された「ヘーゲル国法論批判」(一八四三年)の中に、すでに輪郭をととのえていた。したがって、マルクスによる執筆の順序からみれば逆になるが、右のような初期マルクスの国家論の見地を、やや立ちいって検討する意味で、草稿「ヘーゲル国法論批判」についても、市民社会と国家との関連に限定して、若干の考察をこころみておこう。 この草稿は、ヘーゲル『法哲学』の「第三部第三章国家、A国内公法」について、マルクスが逐条的に検討・批判したものであるが、その内容は「国家」、「国会」、「官僚」などが柱になった、かなり多面的な批判である。とくに、ここでも「政治的国家」と「市民社会」の二重化が論じられているのであるが、上述の『ユダヤ人問題』と比較して目立つ点は、「政治的国家」による「市民社会」の調整=統合の側面(上部構造→下部構造)よりも、むしろ逆の「市民社会」による「政治的国家」への規制の側面(下部構造→上部構造)が積極的に検討されていることだと思われる。したがって、この草稿の検討をふまえながら、マルクスは『ユダヤ人問題』では、「政治的国家」による「市民社会」の組織的統合が具体的に検討されたとみることが可能である。 そのばあい、あるいみでは当然なことであるが、マルクスはヘーゲルの「思想は主語、存在は述語である」という、観念論的な弁証法の体系を批判し、それを唯物論的に転倒させるかたちで、「市民社会」主語とし「政治的国家」を述語の関係で根拠づけようとしているように見える。つまり、ヘーゲルによれば、国家を現実的理念として、主体=主語として位置づけているため、家族や市民社会は、国家という現実的理念によってつくられた客体的=述語的な契機にすぎなくなっていた。それゆえ、「市民社会」の諸規定は、それ自身の現実的な規定ではなく、むしろ本質としての現実的理念である「国家」の現象にすぎないし、それゆえに国家によって否定され、止揚されるべき「仮象」となる。結局のところ、主語が国家であり、述語が市民社会ということになっていたわけである。 こうしたヘーゲルのトリアーデにたいして、マルクスは「主語と述語の逆立ち」を指摘し、その逆転を対置する。したがって、「家族と市民社会は国家の前提であり、それらはもともと活動する(アクティヴな)ものなのであ」(マル=エン全集、二三六頁)って、それゆえ家族と市民社会こそ、「国家の現実的な部分、意志の現実的・精神的現存態であり、……国家の定在様式である」。そして、その点から「家族と市民社会は、それ自身を国家となす。それらは原動力となって他を推し動かすものであり、逆にいえば「政治的国家は家族という自然的土台と市民社会という人工的土台なしにはありえない」(同上、二三七頁)と主張しているのである。”翻译为中文","output":"不过，在这个阶段，马克思对“民间社会”的经济过程的分析，仅仅将资本主义经济理解为文字上的民间社会。对于资本—雇佣劳动的阶级关系，也只是将资本理解为“私有财产”的维度上，雇佣劳动也不过是“异化的劳动”。与这种尚处于不成熟阶段的经济学研究相呼应，“政治国家”与“民间社会”的关系也因民间社会内部的利益对立未能充分阐明而显得哲学化且极度理想化。看似指出了马克思国家理解的局限，但总的来说，①将“政治国家”定位为相对于“民间社会”独立存在的点，②理解“政治国家”为对“民间社会”的经济过程进行组织性整合的功能的点，应该被评价为这一时期马克思敏锐的国家理解。 B.《黑格尔国法批判》 话说回来，《论犹太人的问题》中的这种观点，事实上早在之前准备的草稿《黑格尔国法批判》(1843年)中就已经有了轮廓。因此，从马克思的写作顺序来看虽然是相反的，以稍微深入的意义检视早期马克思的国家论观点，也有必要对草稿《黑格尔国法批判》中限定于民间社会与国家的关系进行一些探讨。 这份草稿是马克思对黑格尔《法哲学》“第三部分第三章 国家、A国家内公法”的条款进行逐条检查和批判的，内容是围绕“国家”、“议会”、“官僚”等，进行了相当多面的批判。特别是，这里也讨论了“政治国家”与“民间社会”的双重性，与上述《论犹太人的问题》相比较，显著之处在于，更加积极地考察了相反的、由“民间社会”对“政治国家”进行调节=整合的侧面(从下层结构到上层结构)。因此，基于这份草稿的检讨，可以认为马克思在《论犹太人的问题》中，具体考察了“政治国家”对“民间社会”的组织性整合。 在这种情况下，虽然是理所当然的，但马克思似乎是批判了黑格尔“思想是主语，存在是述语”的观念论弁证法体系，并试图以唯物论的方式将“民间社会”作为主语，“政治国家”作为述语来建立根据。即按照黑格尔，因为将国家定位为现实的理念，即主体=主语，家庭和民间社会则成为由国家这一现实理念形成的对象性=述语性的契机。因此，“民间社会”的各种规定不是它自身的现实规定，而只不过是作为本质的现实理念即“国家”的现象，因此被国家否定并应该被止揚的“假象”。归根到底，主语是国家，述语是民间社会。 面对这样的黑格尔三元论，马克思指出了“主语和述语的倒置”，并置于其对立面。因此，“家庭和民间社会是国家的前提，它们本来就是活动的(主动的)”（马恩全集，第236页），因此家庭和民间社会才是“国家的现实部分、意志的现实・精神的存在形态，并且……是国家的固有形式”。从这一点上看，“家庭和民间社会构成了国家。它们成为推动其他因素的原动力，换句话说，‘政治国家’无法没有家庭这一自然基础和民间社会这一人工基础而存在”（同上，第237页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“このように草稿では、すでに「市民社会」こそ真に現実性をもったものとして、「政治的国家」を基礎づけるとともに、その土台となるものとされている。それゆえマルクスにおいては、「アクティヴ」で本来的に活動する主体、つまり「主語」となるのはヘーゲルとはちがって「市民社会」であり、それによって「国家」は規定され、生みだされる「述語」として位置づけられている。ヘーゲルの観念弁証法が、唯物論的に転倒されたわけであって、のちのマルクスの用語にしたがうなら、下部構造としての「市民社会」が、上部構造としての「国家」を規定するわけである。そして、前項でのべたとおり、1「市民社会」と「政治的国家」の分離・対立を基礎とし、さらに両者の相互関係としては、②「市民社会」が土台として「政治的国家」を規定する。さらに現実的な作用形式という点では、「政治的国家」による「市民社会」の組織的な総括として、国家が把握されていたことになるわけである。

なお、下部構造としての「市民社会」の経済学的な分析が進展した時点の『ドイツ・イデオロギー』(一八四五~四六年)において、「市民社会」と「国家」との関連が、さらにどのように変化したかをみておこう。この『ドイツ・イデオロギー』では、それ以前の『経済学・哲学草稿』(一八四四年)や「ミル評注」(一八四五年)における「市民社会」の階級対立――「私的所有」と「疎外された労働」の図式にたいして、それらをさらに「分業」論と「交通=交換」論によって媒介した点に特徴がみとめられる。つまり、私的所有交換・分業―疎外された労働という「市民社会」の把握であって、当初は「利己的生活」の体系という理解にとどまっていた「市民社会」は、ここで一定の経済体系の図式化があたえられるにいたったといえる。 とくに重要な点は、いまなお「市民社会」という枠内において、「私的所有」「疎外された労働」という関係にすぎないにしても、「分業」の展開とともに階級形成のプロセスがしめされたことであろう。そして、そうした下部構造での階級対立との関連において、上部構造における国家が一種の「共同幻想体」というかたちで位置づけられるにいたったのである。「市民社会」の経済学的分析がすすみ、その内部構造が明らかにされるとともに、それまで「市民社会」の調整のための組織者にすぎなかった「国家」についてもまた、より社会科学的な分析がこころみられることになったといえよう。 簡単に内容をみておくなら、「家族における自然成長的分業と、個々の、たがいに対立しあっている家族への社会の分裂とにもとづく」分業の発生とともに、「また労働とその生産物の分配が、しかも量的にも質的にも不平等な分配が、したがって、所有が生ずる」が、この「分業」と「所有」の関連と同時に、さらに「各個人あるいは各家族の利害と、相互に交通しあうすべての諸個人の共同の利害とのあいだの矛盾が生ずる」にいたる。そして、「まさにこの特殊利害と共同利害との矛盾から、共同の利害は国家として、現実的な利害･････から切りはなされた自立した姿をとる」。しかも、「同時にそれは幻想の上でだけ共同性の姿をとるのであって、実はいつも、･･･実在的な土台……諸階級という実在的な土台のうえに立っているのである」(『新版ドイツ・イデオロギー』花崎皋平訳、合同新書、一九六六年、六四~六頁)。 要するに『ドイツ・イデオロギー』では、「国家」生成のプロセスが、「分業」―「所有」―「階級」「特殊利害と共同利害との矛盾」―「国家」という系列でのべられている。したがって、「国家」をたんに抽象的な「共同性」という幻想のうえだけでの自立性にとどめることなく、その内実を「諸階級の他の階級にたいする団結であった」として、その階級抑圧の側面をもおさえているのである。だからこそ、抑圧をうけている側からすれば、「被支配階級にとっては、それはただたんにまったくの幻想的共同体であったばかりでなく、ひとつのあたらしい桎梏でもあった」(同上、一三八頁)と主張することにもなったのであろう。したがって、「共同幻想体」としての「国家」と、階級抑圧としての「国家」という認識は、相互に矛盾するわけではなく、被抑圧者の側では統一されていたといえよう。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，在草稿中，已经将“民间社会”视作真正具有现实性的存在，同时作为“政治国家”的基础和土台。因此，在马克思这里，不同于黑格尔，“民间社会”作为本质上活跃的主体，即“主语”，由此，使得“国家”被规定和产生，作为定位于“述语”的存在。黑格尔的观念辩证法被唯物论地颠倒了，按照马克思后来的术语，“民间社会”作为下层结构，规定了作为上层结构的“国家”。并且，正如前文所述，以“民间社会”和“政治国家”的分离/对立为基础，进一步作为二者的互相关系，“民间社会”作为基础规定了“政治国家”。在更为现实的作用形式上，“政治国家”作为对“民间社会”的组织性总结，从而被理解。 C.《德国意识形态》 值得注意的是，《德国意识形态》（1845~46年）在“民间社会”作为下层结构的经济学分析进一步发展的时点，“民间社会”与“国家”的关系如何进一步变化。在《德国意识形态》中，相对于此前的《经济学·哲学手稿》（1844年）和“米尔评论”（1845年）中的“民间社会”阶级对立——“私有财产”和“异化劳动”的模式，这些被进一步介导为“分工”论和“交通=交换”论。即对“民间社会”的把握为私有财产交换·分工——异化劳动，所以最初仅停留在“利己生活”体系的理解上的“民间社会”，在此得到了一个明确的经济体系图式化。 尤其重要的是，在仍旧在“民间社会”的框架内，虽然是“私有财产”、“异化劳动”的关系，但随着“分工”的发展显示出阶级形成的过程。因此，与下层结构中的阶级对立有关，上层结构中的国家被定位为一种“共同幻想体”。“民间社会”的经济学分析进展，其内部结构被明确，而此前仅仅作为“民间社会”调整者的“国家”，也开始尝试更加社会科学化的分析。 简单看一下其中的内容，随着“基于家庭中的自然成长的分工和社会对立的、互相对立的家庭的分裂”产生的分工，以及“劳动及其产品的分配，因此产生不平等的质量和数量上的分配，从而产生所有权”，与“分工”和“所有权”的关系同时，“产生个人或家庭的特殊利益与所有互相交往的个人的共同利益之间的矛盾”。因此，“正是由于这种特殊利益与共同利益之间的矛盾，共同利益作为国家，以一种与现实利益脱离的独立形态出现”。同时，“它们只是在幻想上呈现出共同性的形态，实际上总是……立足于一个实在的基础……即阶级这一实在基础之上”的（《新版德国意识形态》花崎皋平翻译，合同新书，1966年，64-66页）。 简而言之，《德国意识形态》中，“国家”的生成过程被描述为一个序列：“分工”——“所有权”——“阶级”、“特殊利益与共同利益的矛盾”——“国家”。因此，不仅将“国家”简化为仅仅是抽象的“共同体”幻想上的自主性，而是掌握了作为“一种阶级对另一阶级的团结”的其抑制性方面。因此，“对于被压迫的一方来说，‘国家’不仅仅是一个完全虚幻的共同体，而且是一种新的枷锁”（同上，138页）。因此，“共同幻想体”作为“国家”和作为“阶级压迫”的“国家”这两种认识，并非相互矛盾，而是在被压迫者这一方被统一起来。"},{"instruction":"请将“さらにブルジョア国家についても、まず「私的所有が、共同体(Gemeinwesen)から解放されることによって、国家は、市民社会のそとに、市民社会とならんで立つ独自な存在になった」として、国家の市民社会からの独立性・自立性を強調する。ついで、「しかしながら国家とは、ブルジョアが、そとへむかっても、うちへむかっても、かれらの所有とかれらの利害とを相互に保障しあうために必要とした組織形態にほかならない」同上、一六五頁)として、「国家は、支配階級にぞくする諸個人が、かれらの共通の利害を実現し、その時代の市民社会の全体が総括される形態である」(同上、一六六頁)とされる。そして、そのうえで「そこから、いっさいの共通の制度は、国家によって媒介されて、ひとつの政治的形態をとること」ができるし、さらに「そこから、法律は意志に、しかも現実の土台からひきはなされた白自由な意志にもとづくかのような幻想が生ずる」(同上)と主張しているのである。 要するに、「国家」が「市民社会」にとって幻想的なものとしてではあれ、「組織形態」「総括形態」として機能するところから、その総括の過程もまた、必然的に政治や法律を媒介にして展開されざるをえない点が、かなり具体的に明確にされているのである。そして、このように「国家」による「市民社会」の「組織化」=「総括」の具体的内容が明らかにされることによって、ブルジョア国家の性格が市民社会にたいして、より科学的に位置づけられるにいたったといえよう。 3『資本論』体系と国家論 A『経済学批判』とプラン問題 初期マルクスにつづいて、マルクスは一方では『哲学の貧困』(一八四七年)、『賃労働と資本』(一八四九年)をへて、一八五〇年代さらに「市民社会」の経済学的分析を前進させ、六〇年代の『資本論』体系を準備する。同時に、他方では、『共産党宣言』(一八四八年)につづいて、上述の「フランス三部作」のうちの『フランスにおける階級闘争』(一八五〇年)、『ルイ・ボナパルトのブリュメール一八日』(一八五二年)などのフランスの現状分析をとおして、国家論ならびに政治ないし階級闘争論を発展させていくのである。とくに、「フランス三部作」のうちの二論稿は、生々とした現実感覚を背景として、「国「家」についての鋭敏な指摘が多く散見されるのであり、マルクス国家論のひとつの方向での具体的深化の軌跡がすすんでいることがわかる。しかし、それはまだ体系だった国家論とはいえない点は後述する。 ところで、この時期のマルクスの研究について注目されるのは、初期マルクスのいわゆる唯物史観において統一されていた、国家論ないし政治・法律論の系譜と、市民社会を資本主義経済の科学的分析として体系化する系譜とが、あるていど分化しはじめてくる点であり、さらにパリ二月革命の挫折を経験して、マルクス自身が経済学研究に沈潜し、もっぱら資本主義経済の法則的解明を志向した点であろう。したがって、むろん唯物史観の枠組は前提されているが、主として下部構造の資本主義経済の自律的運動法則の解明が前進し、「国家」を中心とする上部構造への規定関係が強調されることになった。いいかえると、上部構造における「国家」の「市民社会」=下部構造への総括=組織化の面よりも、むしろ下部構造から上部構造への規定=制約の側面が重点的に解明されることになったわけである。 その点を象徴的にしめしているのは、『経済学批判』(一八五九年)の序文にある、有名な唯物史観の公式にほかならない。そこでは、周知のとおり、「法的諸関係および国家諸形態」がヘーゲルのブルジョア社会=「市民社会」の「物質的諸関係」に根拠づけられていること、しかも「市民社会」は経済学によって資本主義経済として解剖されなければならないと主張したあと、マルクスはこうのべる。 「人間は、その生活の社会的生産において、一定の、必然的な、かれの意志から独立した諸関係を、つまり人間の物質的生産諸力の一定の発展段階に照応する生産諸関係をとりむすぶ。この生産諸関係の総体は、社会の経済構造を形づくっており、これが現実の土台となって、そのうえに、法律的、政治的上部構造がそびえたち、また、一定の社会的意識形態は、この現実の土台に対応している。物質的生活の生産様式は、社会的、政治的、精神的生活過程一般を制約する」(マル=エン全集1、六頁)。”翻译为中文","output":"进一步关于资产阶级国家，首先强调“通过私有财产从公共体(Gemeinwesen)中解放出来，国家成为独立于民间社会之外，与民间社会并列存在的独特实体”。随后，“然而国家不过是资产阶级无论对外还是对内，为了相互保证他们的财产和他们的利益而必需的组织形式”（同上，165页），认为“国家是属于统治阶级的个人为了实现他们的共同利益，并以当时的民间社会的总体形式存在的”(同上，166页)。因此，“由此，所有的共同制度都能通过国家媒介而采取一种政治形式”，进一步“由此，法律产生了一种幻觉，仿佛它是基于一种自由的意志，而且是与现实基础脱钩的”（同上）。简而言之，“国家”虽然作为民间社会的“组织形式”、“总结形式”功能，但其过程也被具体明确地必须通过政治和法律媒介来展开。因此，通过明确“国家”对“民间社会”的“组织”=“总结”的具体内容，可以说资产阶级国家的性质相对于民间社会被定位得更科学。 3.《资本论》体系与国家论 A.《政治经济学批判》与普鲁东问题 继早期马克思之后，马克思一方面通过《哲学的贫困》（1847年）、《雇佣劳动与资本》（1849年）推进“民间社会”的经济学分析，准备60年代的《资本论》体系。另一方面，继《共产党宣言》（1848年）之后，通过对法国现状的分析，特别是“法国三部曲”中的《法国阶级斗争》（1850年）、《路易·波拿巴的雾月十八日》（1852年）等，发展国家论以及政治或阶级斗争论。特别是“法国三部曲”中的两篇论文，以鲜活的现实感为背景，对“国家”的敏锐指摘较多，可以看到马克思国家论具体深化的轨迹在进展。但是，这还不能称为一个系统的国家论，将在后文提及。 值得关注的是，这一时期马克思的研究，早期马克思所统一的唯物史观下的国家论或政治、法律论的系谱，与系统化民间社会为资本主义经济的科学分析的系谱开始某种程度上的分化，特别是经历了二月革命的失败后，马克思自身深入经济学研究，主要致力于资本主义经济的法则性解明。因此，虽然仍然以唯物史观为前提，主要是下层结构的资本主义经济的自律运动法则的解明取得进展，强调了“国家”这一上层结构对下层结构的规定关系。换句话说，相较于上层结构中的“国家”对 “民间社会”=下层结构的总结=组织化方面，更着重从下层结构到上层结构的规定=制约面的解明。 这一点象征性地体现在1859年的《政治经济学批判》序言中著名的唯物史观公式。如众所周知，马克思在阐明“法律关系以及各种国家形态”都要根据黑格尔所说的资产阶级社会=“民间社会”的“物质关系”来理论化后，马克思表述道：“在其社会生产中的人，会形成一定的、必然的、他们意志独立的关系，即与人的物质生产力的一定发展阶段相适应的生产关系。这些生产关系的总和构成了社会经济结构，它成为现实基础，上面建立起法律的和政治的上层建筑，并且一定的社会意识形态与这个现实基础相符合。物质生活的生产方式制约着社会的、政治的和精神的生活过程”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第1卷，第6页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“ここでは、初期マルクスの市民社会と国家の関係が、一段と明確なかたちで「社会の経済構造=下部「構造」と「法律的、政治的上部構造」に分化し、捉えかえされていることがわかる。とくに、下部構造としての「物質的生活諸関係」を、「物質的生産諸力の一定の発展段階」に必然的に照応する「生産諸関係」であるとして、上部構造である「社会的意識形態」から独立させているだけではない。そのうえで、下部構造を上部構造を最終的に決定する「現実の土台」としているのであって、体制変革にほかならない革命もまた、「経済的基礎」の変化によって上部構造の変革がもたらされる点が強調されているのである。 要するに、初期マルクス以来の「国家」による「市民社会」の総括という視点が、むしろ後者=経済的下部構造による前者=政治的・法律的上部構造の究極的な規定性という論点を明確にしながら、経済的下部構造の分析というかたちで、一段と体系化されつつあることがうかがわれる。事実、この段階では経済的下部構造の体系的分析を資本主義経済にひきしぼりながら、すでに『経済学批判』が準備されているわけであるが、『批判』の内容それ自身については、とくに立ちいる必要はないであろう。ここでは経済的下部構造の法則的解明と「国家」による総括の関連だけをみることにするが、それについては当時マルクスが準備していた、『経済学批判』体系プランを手がかりにするのが適当と思われる。 プランについては、いくつかのヴァリアントがふくまれているが、基本的にはつぎの六部門からなっている。すなわち、資本、土地所有、賃労働、国家、国際貿易、⑥世界市場(と恐慌)にほかならない。とくに、ここでは1回の前半三つの体系と、④との方法的関連が問題であって、前半の三項目で「ブルジョア社会の内的編成」が解明されたうえで、それを国家がどのように総括することになるのか、その論理的な関連が問われなければなるまい。資本一賃労働―土地所有の三大階級を国家がいかなる意味で、どのような内容において総括するかが問題なのである。 もっとも、プランの各項目については、ごく簡単な説明しかみとめられず、「国家」の説明もきわめて抽象的である。たとえば、「国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括。それ自体との関係での考察。『不生産的』諸階級。租税。国債。公信用。………」とか、「国家。(国家とブルジョア社会。租税、または不生産的諸階級の存在。国債。......)」(同上、六三五頁)といった説明にすぎないため、「国家」による「ブルジョア社会」の総括の意味は、きわめて不明確である。たしかに、租税や国債など財政論が展開され、公務員をはじめとする不生産的諸階級も論じられることになっていたのであろうが、それらと「国家による総括」や「国家それ自体」の分析との関連は、いっこうにはっきりしないのである。 いずれにせよ、このプランの段階では、資本主義経済の内的編成である三大階級と「国家」による総括の関連を具体的に知ることはできない。しかも、ブルジョア社会である資本主義経済の三大階級についても、『批判』の原稿では、プランからもわかるとおり、まだ資本と賃労働と土地所有が外面的な対立として捉えられていたため、「資本」が賃労働や土地所有から機械的に切りはなされて抽象されるばかりでなく、さらに「資本」についても、競争や信用が捨象された「資本一般」の範囲だけが準備されたにすぎない。したがって、ブルジョア社会の内的編成も、その一部だけが抽象的に解明されたのみで、あとは抽象から具体へのいわゆる「上向法」にそくして、上述のようなプランがメモ風にイメージされていたのである。それだけに、『批判』でのブルジョア社会としての資本主義経済の「国家」による総括は抽象的であいまいな内容にとどまらざるをえなかったといえよう。”翻译为中文","output":"在这里，可以看到早期马克思对于民间社会和国家的关系更加明确地被重新理解为“社会的经济结构=基础结构”与“法律及政治的上层建筑”之间的分化。特别是，作为基础的“物质生活关系”被理解为与“物质生产力的一定发展阶段”不可避免地相对应的“生产关系”，并不仅仅是独立于“社会意识形态”的上层建筑。进而，把基础作为最终决定上层建筑的“现实基础”，体制变革，即革命亦是通过“经济基础”的变化带来上层建筑的变革这一点被强调。 简而言之，早期马克思以来“国家”对“民间社会”的总结这一视角，现在更明确地以经济基础分析的形式被系统化，同时明确了后者=经济基础对前者=政治及法律上层建筑的最终决定性。事实上，这一阶段，经济基础的系统分析在准备资本主义经济的同时，已经准备了《经济学批判》，但对于《批判》内容本身而言，则没有特别深入的必要。这里仅关注经济基础的法则性解明与“国家”总结之间的关系，以当时马克思准备的《经济学批判》体系计划为线索似乎更为恰当。 计划包含了几种变体，但基本上由以下六个部分组成：即资本、土地所有权、雇佣劳动、国家、国际贸易、世界市场（及金融危机）。尤其这里，第一到第三部分的体系与第四部分的方法学关联尤为重要，在前三项目中解明了“资产阶级社会的内部构成”之后，接下来探索国家如何总结，以及这种逻辑关系成为问题。国家如何以何种含义和内容总结资本、雇佣劳动和土地所有三大阶级成为问题所在。 然而，对于计划的各项内容，只能进行非常简略的说明，“国家”的描述也非常抽象。例如，“资产阶级社会以国家形态的总结。以自身关系进行考察。‘不生产’的阶级。税收。国债。公共信贷……”，以及“国家。(国家与资产阶级社会。税收，或不生产的阶级的存在。国债……) ”（同上，第635页）等描述，“国家”对“资产阶级社会”的总结意义变得非常不明确。确实，可能展开的财政论、包括公务员在内的不生产阶级的讨论等，但它们与“国家的总结”或“国家本身”的分析间的联系依然模糊不清。 无论如何，在这个计划阶段，具体了解资本主义经济的内部构成即三大阶级与“国家”的总结之间的关系是不可能的。而且，由于资本主义经济即资产阶级社会中的三大阶级，在《批判》原稿中，如计划所示，仍被外在地视为对立关系，使得“资本”不仅从雇佣劳动和土地所有中机械地分离出来，而且有关“资本”的讨论也仅限于忽视了竞争和信贷的“一般资本”。因此，资产阶级社会的内部构成也仅是部分抽象地解明，余下的依据所谓的“从抽象到具体”的“上升法”，以计划样的形式提出了上述计划。因此，《批判》中作为资本主义经济的资产阶级社会的“国家总结”不可避免地停留在抽象和模糊的内容上。"},{"instruction":"请将“ブルジョア社会としての資本主義経済の内的編成の科学的解明の作業は、『批判』から『資本論』へむけて、さらに大きく前進することになった。とくに注目しなければならないのは、11資本—土地所有賃労働の三大階級が、上述のとおり「批判』の段階では相互に分離したまま、いわば外的対立として把握されていたのにたいし、『資本論』においては、文字どおり「資本」論として、賃労働と土地所有が事実上「資本」に統一されて、内的編成として解明されるにいたったことである。こうして『資本論』では、初期マルクス以来の「市民社会」がブルジョア社会として資本主義経済に純化され、しかも純粋資本主義の自律的運動法則が、下部構造において独立したかたちで解明されることになったわけである。だからこそ、「近代社会の経済的運動法則の解明」を究極の課題として、『資本論』体系が展開されたといえよう。 (2）このように資本主義経済の三大階級が「資本」論として、内部的に統一的に編成されつつ、自律的運動法則が解明されることになると、それにたいする国家論の位置づけも変化してくるのが当然であろう。とくに、『批判』段階のプランのように、資本土地所有―賃労働―国家というかたちで、いわば下部構造から上部構造としての「国家」にむけて、直線的に上向する「上向法」はとりえなくなる。純粋資本主義として自立化し、しかも土地所有や賃労働が内的に包括された「資本」の自律的運動法則にたいして、「国家」が総括する地位をあたえられることになるのであり、それゆえ国家による調整=総括の意味・内容も変化することになろう。 つまり、『批判』段階のように、資本―土地所有賃労働の三大階級が、上記のとおり外的に分離させられたまま相互に対立的に把握されているにすぎないとすれば、「国家」による調整=総括という作用においてもまた、いわば外的な階級対立を内的に統一する紐帯として「国家」が位置づけられることになろう。いいかえれば、ブルジョア社会の内部編成そのものの中から、その内部契機によって国家を展開せざるをえないし、その国家によって、三大階級の階級関係を統一し総括することにならざるをえないわけである。そのかぎりでは、抽象から具体への「上向法」も、資本ばかりでなく土地所有や賃労働にふくまれる内部契機をつなぎながら上向する、いわば直線的な「上向法」となるし、『批判』段階のプランの方法は、そうした方法的見地が濃厚であった。だからこそ、「下向法」の出発点となった現実の混沌とした表象である「世界市場」にむけて、「上向法」は「国家」を媒介として直線的に上向することになっているのであろう。 ところが、『資本論』のように、土地所有が地代論として、また賃労働が蓄積論として理論的に解明され、いずれも「資本」論として内部的に統一されてしまうなら、ブルジョア社会の内的編成は、純粋資本主義の自律的運動法則として展開されることになる。この自律的運動法則は、自律的に運動するという法則それ自身の性格からいって、上部構造としての「国家」による権力的な媒介は必要とせず、文字どおり下部構造としての「土台」を形成するのである。また、このように下部構造が土台として、自律的に運動することが可能になるからこそ、下部構造としての「物質的諸関係」の上部構造にたいする規定的性格も明らかにされるわけである。初期マルクス以来、たんなるイデオロギー的仮説として、経済学研究の「導きの糸」となった唯物史観は、『資本論』によって科学的に論証されたわけである。 それと同時に、「国家」による経済的下部構造にたいする総括調整の意味も、三大階級の内部関係を直接的に媒介するものではなくなる。「国家」は下部構造にたいして、あくまでも相対的に独立して、いわば階級関係の再生産を法的関係として、形式的な外枠において保障するにすぎなくなるし、その法的関係を媒介しなければ、「国家」の政治的な権力関係も、階級関係の内部には介入できないものとなるであろう。いいかえるならば、「国家」による資本主義経済の内部編成への統合=総括の意味は、経済的下部構造の自律的運動法則にたいして、あくまでもその外枠をあたえ、形式的な枠組として機能するだけになってくるし、それがまたブルジョア国家の基本的性格なのである。 C『資本論』の「国家」規定”翻译为中文","output":"科学解明资本主义经济中资产阶级社会的内部构造的工作，从《批判》到《资本论》，会取得更大的进展。特别值得注意的是，资本-土地所有-雇佣劳动这三大阶级，在《批判》阶段如上所述被理解为相互分离的外在对立，而在《资本论》中则以“资本”论的形式，雇佣劳动和土地所有实际上被统一于“资本”之下，作为内部构造被解明。因此，《资本论》中，自早期马克思以来的“民间社会”作为资产阶级社会被纯化为资本主义经济，而纯粹资本主义的自律运动法则在基础结构中以独立形式被解明。因此，《资本论》体系以“揭示现代社会的经济运动法则”为最终任务的展开。 (2) 当资本主义经济的三大阶级以“资本”论的形式，得到内部统一的组织，同时自律运动法则被解明时，国家论的定位也自然会发生变化。特别是，在《批判》阶段的计划中，资本-土地所有-雇佣劳动-国家这种形式，由下层结构直线上升到作为上层结构的“国家”的“上升法”变得不再适用。作为纯粹资本主义自立化的，且土地所有和雇佣劳动被内含于内部的“资本”的自律运动法则面前，“国家”被赋予总结的地位，因此国家的调整=总结的意义和内容也将发生变化。 换句话说，如果像《批判》阶段那样，资本-土地所有-雇佣劳动这三大阶级仅被理解为外在分离并相互对立，那么在“国家”的调整=总结作用中，“国家”也将被定位为内部统一这些外在阶级对立的纽带。换句话说，必须从资产阶级社会的内部构造中展开国家，并通过国家来统一和总结三大阶级的阶级关系。因此，“上升法”也将成为直线上升的方法，不仅连接资本，还连接土地所有和雇佣劳动包含的内部契机，而《批判》阶段的计划方法在这方面表现出浓厚的方法论视角。因此，以实际混乱的表象即“世界市场”为出发点的“上升法”将通过“国家”作为媒介直线上升。 然而，在《资本论》这样的情况下，当土地所有以地租理论被理论化解明，雇佣劳动以积累理论被理论化解明，且均以“资本”论内部统一时，资产阶级社会的内部构造将作为纯粹资本主义的自律运动法则展开。这一自律运动法则，由于运动法则本身的性质，不需要上层结构中的“国家”进行权力性介入，而是形成作为基础结构的“基础”。而且，正是由于基础结构作为基础，可以自律运动，因此基础结构作为“物质关系”的上层建筑的决定性特征也变得明确。自早期马克思以来，作为仅是意识形态假设的唯物史观成为经济学研究的“导引”，通过《资本论》被科学论证。 同时，“国家”对经济基础结构的总结调整意义也不再直接介入三大阶级的内部关系。“国家”对基础结构的相对独立性，仅以法律关系的形式，作为形式的外框保证阶级关系的再生产，而没有法律关系的介入，“国家”的政治权力关系也无法介入阶级关系的内部。换言之，对资本主义经济的内部构造的“国家”整合=总结的意义，对于经济基础结构的自律运动法则而言，仅提供外框并以形式架构发挥作用，这也成为资产阶级国家的基本特征。 C.《资本论》中的“国家”规定"},{"instruction":"请将“『資本論』体系の意義は、ブルジョア社会の経済的下部構造を純粋資本主義の自律的運動法則の解明として純化し、三大階級の内的編成を、「国家」による直接的な媒介ではなしに土台として明らかにした点にもとめることができる。それによって、「国家」によるブルジョア社会の総括も、階級関係の実質的・直接的な媒介ではなしに、文字どおり上部構造に純化されたかたちで、形式的な法人格上の意識形態において、社会体制の枠組をあたえることになった。これが、いわゆるブルジョア社会に特有な「法治国家」にほかならないのであって、権力関係による「政治的国家」の機能もまた、「法治国家」の形式的な枠組を無視することがゆるされなくなる。もっともマルクスは、『資本論』体系の時点で、右のような国家による総括の内容まで具体的に主張してはいないけれども、純粋資本主義の自律的運動を解明したことの意味は、そうした国家によるそうした調整=総括の方向を指示したものといえる。 ところが、現行『資本論』の内部をみると、断片的ではあるが、いくつかの国家についての指摘が散見される。そうした断片的な指摘があるために、『資本論』による「経済的運動法則」そのものが、国家の規定によって内部的に媒介されなければならず、それゆえに下部構造の内部に「国家」の契機をもとめ、下部構造から上部構造へ直線的に上向する、上述の『批判』段階のプランに『資本論』を解消しようという見解が生ずることにもなる。こうした見解からすれば、『資本論』が純粋資本主義における自律的な運動法則を解明したことの意義があいまいになるし、しかも「批判』から『資本論』へのマルクスの研究の発展の意義を理解できないばかりではない。さらに、ブルジョア国家が経済的下部構造の自立性を前提にして、そのうえで体制の枠組をあたえる方向での、「国家」による総括の意義を、十分には理解できなくなってしまうのである。 そこで、ここで簡単に『資本論』の内部に散見されるマルクスの「国家」規定をみておくと、貨幣論、②剰余価値論、③蓄積論、④信用論の大別して四つの領域に多くみとめられる。そして、これらの領域の叙述を手がかりにして、「国家」規定を内部的に上向させようとする見解もあらわれているのであるが、まず1およびについては、貨幣論が貨幣=通貨の制度に関連していること、また信用論もそれが信用制度という制度、つまり公的・社会的な制度にかかわるために、「国民的」とか「国家」という言葉をマルクスが使用しているものと思われる。1の貨幣論では、「度量基準」や「鋳貨」「紙幣」、さらに「世界貨幣」に対立する「国民的制服」などに関連して、また4の信用論では、「国債」とか「中央銀行」、また「為替市場」などに関してであるが、いずれも制度上の問題にかかわっている。

しかし、これら制度上の問題にかかわる範疇にしても、『資本論』では制度そのものを説明しているわけではないであろう。制度そのものなら、時代による変遷、各国の歴史的な慣習など、いろいろ異なってくるのであって、それらは現状分析として解明されることはあっても、『資本論』のように原理論の次元において、一般的に解明できるはずのものではない。原理的・一般的に明らかにできる制度は、制度そのものより制度の前提となる商品経済ないし資本主義経済の法則的な展開の必然性であり、それは経済的な要請ではあっても、「国家」の権力的な強制によるものではない。したがって、かならずしも国家権力によって生みだされる制度ではないのであって、商品経済ないし資本主義経済の経済的機能にもとづく共同的な機関としての制度とみなすべきであろう。 ”翻译为中文","output":"《资本论》体系的意义在于将资产阶级社会的经济基础结构作为纯粹资本主义的自律运动法则进行了纯化，并且没有通过国家的直接介入，而是将三大阶级的内部组织作为基础明确地指出。由此，“国家”对于资产阶级社会的总结也不是通过阶级关系的实质性、直接的介入，而是以字面上的上层建筑纯化形式，在形式上的法人格意识形态中为社会体制提供了框架。这就是所谓的资产阶级社会特有的“法治国家”，其中“政治国家”的功能也不能忽视法治国家的形式框架。虽然马克思在《资本论》体系的阶段并没有具体阐述这样的国家总结的内容，但对纯粹资本主义的自律运动进行了解明的意义指出了这样的调整=总结的方向。 然而，当检视现行《资本论》内部时，虽然是零散的，但可以发现一些关于国家的指出。因为这些零散的指出存在，使得《资本论》中的“经济运动法则”本身必须通过国家的规定内部地进行介入，因此，底层结构中寻求“国家”的契机，从底层结构直线上升到上层结构，试图解决《批判》阶段计划中的《资本论》如此观点的产生。根据这一观点，将《资本论》明确了纯粹资本主义中自律运动法则的意义变得模糊，不仅无法理解从《批判》到《资本论》的马克思研究的发展意义，而且也无法充分理解以经济基础结构的自立性为前提下，资产阶级国家提供体制框架方向的“国家”总结的意义。 因此，简要检视《资本论》内部零散出现的马克思的“国家”规定，发现主要分为四个领域：货币论、剩余价值论、积累论、信用论。根据这些领域的叙述作为线索，“国家”规定内部地上升的观点出现，但首要要提到的是，关于货币论与货币=货币制度的联系，以及信用论也关联于信用制度，即公共/社会制度，因此马克思使用了“国民性”或“国家”这样的词汇。在货币论中，涉及到“度量标准”、“铸币”、“纸币”，以及与“国家制度”相对的“世界货币”等；在信用论中，则涉及到“国债”、“中央银行”、“汇率市场”等，均涉及制度性问题。 然而，《资本论》中并不是直接解释制度本身。制度本身会随时间和各国的历史习俗不同而变化，虽然可以作为现状分析进行解明，但不可能在《资本论》这样原理论层面上进行一般性解明。原理性、普遍性地可以明确的制度是商品经济或资本主义经济的法则性发展的必然性，它是经济需求，而不是国家权力性强制的结果。因此，这些制度不应被视为国家权力产生的制度，而应被视作基于商品经济或资本主义经济经济功能的共同机构。"},{"instruction":"请将“もちろん、マルクスの『資本論』のばあい、全体として当時のイギリスの歴史的現実からの抽象が不十分なために、これら貨幣や信用にかんする制度についても、現実の「国家」に媒介された制度や慣習から、原理論としての一般的規定の抽象が不足しているきらいはある。そのために、原理論の一般的規定についても、現実の制度にまつわる諸契機を概念の構成に混入してしまっている個所もないとはいえない。とくに、貨幣論や信用論のばあいは、それが制度にかかわるために、現実からの抽象の不十分さが目立つけれども、だからといって経済的土台における自律的運動法則としての要請と、上部構造としての「国家」による権力的強制とを混同することはゆるされない。ましてや、貨幣や信用の制度上の契機に、国家規定を解消してしまうとすれば、それは権力としての「国家」の矮小化でしかないであろう。②および同については、やや異質な面をもっている。②にかんしては、『資本論』では剰余価値論のなかでも絶対的剰余価値の生産にかんして、標準労働日の決定に工場法がかかわり、それゆえに「国「家」が関与している点があげられる。労働日の長さの決定について、資本家と労働者の「権利と権利の衝突」が生じ、階級闘争が必然化する。そして、この階級闘争にたいして、ブルジョア国家の法的介入が必然化し、「標準労働日」の工場法の立法措置がとられたと解釈するわけである。 また③については、蓄積論のなかでも相対的過剰人口に関連して、多かれすくなかれ非資本主義的な領域を想定せざるをえない点から主張される。とくに、潜在的過剰人口や停滞的過剰人口、さらには被救恤貧民は、農民や農家の副業・家内工業とむすびついているし、さらには救貧院など国家の保護にあずかっている。したがって、資本による相対的過剰人口の確保のためには、失業者の救済にともなう国家権力の介入が不可欠であり、資本蓄積も国家によって媒介されなければならないと主張するわけである。 しかし、②の標準労働日については、『資本論』でも剰余価値の生産そのものが、法治国家をこえた政治的な権力介入によって、いいかえると国家の暴力によって不可欠な媒介をうけているわけではないであろう。剰余価値の生産も、資本家と労働者のあいだを価値法則が規制することによっておこなわれることを、マルクスも主張しているはずである。もし、そうでなければ階級関係が封建社会と同様に、「経済外的強制」によって維持されることになってしまうからであるが、とすれば標準労働日をめぐっては、法治国家の形式が階級関係の枠組をあたえている事実を、当時のイギリスの工場法を例示して説明しているだけだとみるのが妥当と思われる。 また、③の相対的過剰人口の存在形態についても、資本の蓄積にとっては、あくまでも流動的過剰人口——近代的産業の中心部において資本により吸収されたり反発されたりする過剰人口を中心にすえるべきであろう。流動的過剰人口については、資本主義経済は国家の媒介なしに、自律的に処理できるのであって、それにたいし上述のような産業予備軍の他の形態は、いわば非資本主義的領域にむすびついた補助的な存在として、マルクスが具体的な例解をこころみたにすぎないとみなければならない。なるほど、②の剰余価値論やの蓄積論に「国家」規定をもとめると、それこそ階級関係そのものを「国家」暴力が内部的に媒介することになり、いわゆる「階級国家」の規定には都合よく解釈できよう。しかし、そのことは逆に、資本家と労働者の階級関係が、封建社会の経済外的強制や資本の原始的蓄積のさいとは異なって、文字どおり経済的強制としての価値法則によって、それゆえに剰余価値論や蓄積論(原始的蓄積とは区別された)として、法則的に解明される資本主義経済の法則性を否定してしまうことになりかねない。そうなれば、経済的土台としての自立性も崩れるであろうし、唯物史観さえ否定されてしまうことにもなるのであって、それは『資本論』におけるマルクスの積極的見解とは、似て非なる非科学的な解釈といわなければならない。 ”翻译为中文","output":"当然，《资本论》中，由于整体上对于当时英国的历史现实的抽象不足，关于货币和信用等制度，也存在着由现实的“国家”介导的制度和习俗到原理论中的一般规定抽象不足的倾向。因此，即便是原理论的一般规定，也无法避免概念结构中混入了现实制度相关的各种契机。尤其是在货币论和信用论的情况中，由于其涉及制度，现实抽象的不足尤为显著，然而这并不允许将经济基础中的自律运动法则的要求与上层建筑中的“国家”通过权力强制混淆。更不用说，如果将货币和信用的制度契机完全归结于国家规定，则只能是对“国家”作为权力的贬低而已。关于剩余价值论，尽管在《资本论》中，剩余价值的生产本身并没有被超越法治国家的政治权力介入所必要地中介，也就是说，不是通过国家的暴力必须介入。剩余价值的生产也是通过资本家和労动者之间的价值规律进行的，正如马克思所主张的。否则，阶级关系就会像封建社会那样，通过“经济外强制”来维持，因此关于标准工作日，用当时英国的工厂法作为例子来说明法治国家的形式为阶级关系提供框架是合理的。 关于相对过剩人口的存在形式，对于资本积累来说，应当以流动过剩人口为中心——主要是在现代工业中心部分被资本吸收或排斥的过剩人口。关于流动过剩人口，资本主义经济可以在没有国家中介的情况下自律处理，对于这种产业预备军的其他形式，不过是作为与非资本主义领域相联系的辅助存在，马克思只是尝试进行具体例解。的确，如果试图在剩余价值论或积累论中寻找“国家”规定，那么就会使阶级关系本身通过“国家”的内部介导成为可能，便利地解释为所谓的“阶级国家”的规定。但这反过来意味着，资本家和労动者的阶级关系，不同于封建社会的经济外强制或资本的原始积累阶段，将严格地通过价值规律作为经济强制解明，因而剩余价值论和积累论（与原始积累区分开）的法则性在资本主义经济中被否定。如果这样，经济基础的自立性也会瓦解，甚至唯物史观也将被否定，这将是与《资本论》中马克思的积极观点相背离的非科学解释。"},{"instruction":"As

With soft, sandy-coloured fur and strikingly long ears that can pick up the faintest sounds of danger or distress, Lopunny is as much a guardian of the woodland realms as it is a gentle spirit, bounding gracefully through the underbrush and leaping high into the air to survey its domain. In times of peace, Lopunny is a symbol of harmony and the tireless joy of life that fills the lush expanses of the woods. In times of conflict, however, its agility and powerful limbs serve as formidable weapons against those who would threaten the balance of its home. The fey creature is known to be fiercely protective of its territory and those benign creatures that share it. Lopunny communicates through a series of soft chimes and gestures, a language understood by the denizens of the Feywild and some of the more intuned forest dwellers. It\'s a rare sight, a beacon of the pure, unadulterated magic of nature, and to encounter one is considered a sign of immense personal fortune and a blessing of safe passage through the treacherous and often unpredictable landscapes of the fey. The legend has it that those who earn the trust and friendship of a Lopunny are showered with luck and find their endeavors more often meeting with success. As such, tales of Lopunny are passed down as much for the sake of inspiration and hope as they are for amusement and wonder."},{"instruction":"Write a long story about a man alone in his apartment named Derek who accidentally breathes in a gas that causes him to slowly turn into a very humble and busty house wife over the span of an hour.

As Derek returned to his apartment, he began to feel strange. His thoughts and emotions started to shift, and he found himself thinking more and more about traditional gender roles and domestic duties. Suddenly, he had a strong desire to clean and organize his apartment, to cook and bake, and to take care of a family.

Curious, Derek opened the door to investigate, and suddenly he was hit with a wave of dizziness. He stumbled back into his apartment, struggling to breathe as the gas filled the room. In his confusion, he accidentally inhaled a large gulp of the gas before he could even react. As the gas filled his lungs, Derek could feel his mind beginning to warp and shift. Thoughts that were once clear and sharp became fuzzy and nonsensical. Memories seemed to blur together as he struggled to make sense of his reality.

The scent of the food filled the apartment, mingling with the gas that still hung heavy in the air. Finally, as the hour drew to a close, Derek heard the sound of a key turning in the lock. His heart raced with excitement as he hurried to greet his husband, a warm smile on his lips. \\"Honey, I\'m home!\\" Derek called out, rushing into the arms of the man who entered the apartment. The man blinked in surprise, taking in the sight of Derek\'s transformed appearance. \\"Who are you?\\" he asked, his voice tinged with confusion.

Let’s just say that readers use a special sort of hearing when they process information, whether said information comes from print or film or whatever. If you simply read the text of the pirate movie, you see, what? Boots, sand, a bit of water. You have to bring your own data to the part. That Morricone soundtrack certainly helps, but only if you’ve heard some of his other work. Gore Verbinski, the director, assumes we have, but there are no guarantees. But even before the melody registers, we can sense where this scene is heading. By step two, the Leone echo is rolling; the musical cues merely reinforce something we’re already hearing. Verbinski’s reference is arch and fairly obvious, but it would be “audible” even if delivered with greater subtlety. And that subtlety is why we need to open ourselves to nuance. Looking too intently at a text can overwhelm our other senses, can make us miss the echo, the sympathetic chimes in a work. The Law of Universal Connectedness: Every novel grows out of other novels. So, you ask, does this mean everything’s derivative? On one level, yes. Writers can’t avoid being influenced by works they’ve read, stories they’ve heard, movies they’ve seen. If you see that influence as derivative, then it is. Yet that’s not the whole story. There is also the influence on us. We may hear things that weren’t available to the novelist at the time or writing, or that she wasn’t aware of—even that hadn’t yet existed. The echoes we hear need not run in only one direction. Words change meaning over time. The same’s true of novels: they change meaning over time. The words stay the same, naturally, but their meanings can change, although that’s not the major force. The world changes around the novels. We change. Are we the same today as Americans in Twain’s lifetime or as subjects of the queen in Dickens’s? Hardly. Society has gone through great upheavals in the last century or so; Comet Halley has come and gone in its seventy-six-year cycle since its visitation at the time of Twain’s death. Both countries have experienced multiple wars, recessions and depressions, alterations in the racial and ethnic landscape, and internationalism undreamt of in the nineteenth century. How can their work possibly remain static? More importantly, other writers have engaged them in conversation. W. H. Auden said in his elegy for William Butler Yeats that, in dying, the great man “became his admirers.” That phrase can have a lot of different meanings, among them, it reflected well on people that they did admire such a poet. One meaning, though, must be that, to the extent Yeats would live on, he would do it through those admirers. True enough, I’m sure, but not one of them was him, and each of them would contain a Yeats colored by the possessor. My Yeats is very personal and, I’m equally sure, very distinct from Auden’s. One important distinction: I’m not a poet. When Auden makes use of Yeats’s verse in his own, as he does in the elegy (where, among others, “Under Ben Bulben,” Yeats’s own poem about his death and burial, is engaged in conversation), it forces readers to reconsider not merely the man being memorialized but the poetry as well. So, too, with novels. As I write this, a book called Finn has recently been published. In an audacious move for a first (or any) novelist, Jon Clinch purports to tell the story of Pap Finn, Huck’s violent, drunken, and doomed father. In doing so he brings in numerous details of the original, and we recall many more. Clinch could have told a story of any violent sod living along the Mississippi in antebellum Missouri, but he decided to tell this one, so there must have been some reason. Just as Twain sought to tell a tale of what he saw as the real America, setting it in opposition to earlier novels and stories by James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving, among others, that greatly romanticized frontier or rural life. There are things Twain couldn’t have said about life in his time, things he might not have noticed, even things that have become true that maybe once weren’t. Clinch can say them. In the process, he alters how we think about the book Hemingway claims fathered all of American writing.","output":"گوش داخلی. به فکر نامیدن آن به عنوان چشم سوم افتادم، اما این تصویر بیش از حد ناراحت کننده است. بگذارید فقط بگوییم خوانندگان از نوع خاصی از شنوایی استفاده می‌کنند وقتی که آنها اطلاعات را پردازش می‌کنند، چه این اطلاعات از متن چاپی یا فیلم یا هر چیز دیگری باشد. اگر شما فقط متن فیلم دزدان دریایی را بخوانید، می‌بینید، چه؟ چکمه‌ها، شن، کمی آب. شما باید داده‌های خود را به قسمت اضافه کنید. آن موسیقی متن موریکونه قطعا کمک می‌کند، اما فقط اگر شما قبلا کارهای دیگر او را شنیده باشید. گور وربینسکی، کارگردان، فرض می‌کند که ما شنیده‌ایم، اما تضمینی وجود ندارد. اما حتی قبل از اینکه ملودی ثبت شود، ما می‌توانیم حس کنیم که این صحنه به کجا می‌رود. در مرحله دوم، اکوی لئونه در حال غلطیدن است؛ سرنخ‌های موسیقی فقط چیزی را تقویت می‌کنند که ما از قبل شنیده‌ایم. ارجاع وربینسکی خم و واضح است، اما حتی اگر با ظرافت بیشتری ارائه شود، \\"قابل شنیدن\\" خواهد بود. و این ظرافت است که چرا ما باید خودمان را برای درک نکات ظریف باز کنیم. نگاه کردن بیش از حد متمرکز به متن می‌تواند حس‌های دیگر ما را غلبه کند، می‌تواند باعث شود که ما اکو، ناقوس‌های همدلی در یک اثر را از دست بدهیم. قانون اتصال جهانی: هر رمان از سایر رمان‌ها رشد می‌کند. پس، شما می‌پرسید، آیا این به این معنا است که همه چیز تقلیدی است؟ در یک سطح، بله. نویسندگان نمی‌توانند از تأثیر آثاری که خوانده‌اند، داستان‌هایی که شنیده‌اند، فیلم‌هایی که دیده‌اند، اجتناب کنند. اگر شما این تأثیر را به عنوان تقلیدی ببینید، پس هست. با این حال، این تمام ماجرا نیست. تأثیر آن بر ما نیز وجود دارد. ما ممکن است چیزهایی را بشنویم که در زمان نوشتن برای نویسنده در دسترس نبود یا او از آنها اطلاعی نداشت - حتی چیزهایی که هنوز وجود نداشتند. اکوهایی که ما می‌شنویم لزوما فقط در یک جهت نیستند. کلمات با گذشت زمان معنی خود را تغییر می‌دهند. همین امر در مورد رمان‌ها صدق می‌کند: آنها با گذشت زمان معنی خود را تغییر می‌دهند. کلمات به طور طبیعی یکسان باقی می‌مانند، اما معانی آنها می‌تواند تغییر کند، اگرچه این نیروی اصلی نیست. جهان در اطراف رمان‌ها تغییر می‌کند. ما تغییر می‌کنیم. آیا ما امروز همانند امریکایی‌ها در زمان تواین یا مانند شهروندان ملکه در زمان دیکنز هستیم؟ به سختی. جامعه از دگرگونی‌های بزرگ در قرن گذشته یا بیشتر عبور کرده است؛ دنباله‌دار هالی آمده و در چرخه هفتاد و شش ساله‌اش از زمان وفات تواین رفته است. هر دو کشور چندین جنگ، رکودها و افسردگی‌ها، تغییرات در چشم‌انداز نژادی و قومی، و بین‌المللی شدنی را تجربه کرده‌اند که در قرن نوزدهم قابل تصور نبود. چگونه ممکن است کار آنها کاملا ثابت باقی بماند؟ مهم‌تر از آن، نویسندگان دیگر با آنها در گفتگو بوده‌اند. دبلیو. اچ. آدن در مرثیه‌ای برای ویلیام باتلر ییتس گفت که با مرگ، مرد بزرگ \\"تبدیل به تحسین‌کنندگانش شد.\\" این عبارت می‌تواند معانی متفاوتی داشته باشد، از جمله، اینکه مردم چنین شاعری را تحسین می‌کنند، نشان دهنده احترام آنها بود. یک معنی، اگرچه، باید این باشد که، در حدی که ییتس قرار بود ادامه دهد، او از طریق آن تحسین‌کنندگان ادامه خواهد داد. قطعا درست است، اما هیچ‌کدام از آنها او نبودند و هرکدام از آنها یک ییتس را که توسط دارنده آن رنگ‌آمیزی شده است، در خود داشتند. ییتس من بسیار شخصی است و، من مطمئنم، بسیار متفاوت از ییتس آدن. یک تفاوت مهم: من شاعر نیستم. وقتی آدن از شعر ییتس در شعر خود استفاده می‌کند، همانطور که در مرثیه انجام می‌دهد (که در آن، از جمله، \\"زیر بن بلبن\\"، شعر خود ییتس درباره مرگ و دفنش، در گفتگو قرار می‌گیرد)، خوانندگان را وادار به بازنگری نه تنها در مردی که یادبود می‌شود بلکه در شعر نیز می‌کند. همچنین با رمان‌ها. همانطور که من این را می‌نویسم، کتابی به نام فین به تازگی منتشر شده است. در یک حرکت جسورانه برای یک نویسنده اول (یا هر نویسنده‌ای)، جان کلینچ قصد دارد داستان پدر خشمگین، مست و محکوم هاک، فین را روایت کند. در این کار او جزئیات زیادی از اصل را به کار می‌برد و ما بسیاری دیگر را به یاد می‌آوریم. کلینچ می‌توانست داستان هر فرد خشنی را که در کنار می‌سی‌سی‌پی در میزوری قبل از جنگ داخلی زندگی می‌کرد، تعریف کند، اما تصمیم گرفت این یکی را بگوید، پس باید دلیلی وجود داشته باشد. همانطور که تواین به دنبال روایت داستانی بود که او آن را امریکای واقعی می‌دید، آن را در مقابل رمان‌ها و داستان‌های قبلی توسط جیمز فنیمور کوپر و واشنگتن اروینگ قرار داد، که زندگی مرزی یا روستایی را بسیار رمانتیک می‌دیدند. چیزهایی وجود دارد که تواین نمی‌توانست درباره زندگی در زمان خود بگوید، چیزهایی که او شاید متوجه نمی‌شد، حتی چیزهایی که شده‌اند که شاید یکبار نبودند. کلینچ می‌تواند آنها را بگوید. در این روند، او نحوه تفکر ما را در مورد کتابی که همینگوی ادعا کرده است پدر همه نوشته‌های امریکایی است، تغییر می‌دهد."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

また③については、蓄積論のなかでも相対的過剰人口に関連して、多かれすくなかれ非資本主義的な領域を想定せざるをえない点から主張される。とくに、潜在的過剰人口や停滞的過剰人口、さらには被救恤貧民は、農民や農家の副業・家内工業とむすびついているし、さらには救貧院など国家の保護にあずかっている。したがって、資本による相対的過剰人口の確保のためには、失業者の救済にともなう国家権力の介入が不可欠であり、資本蓄積も国家によって媒介されなければならないと主張するわけである。 しかし、②の標準労働日については、『資本論』でも剰余価値の生産そのものが、法治国家をこえた政治的な権力介入によって、いいかえると国家の暴力によって不可欠な媒介をうけているわけではないであろう。剰余価値の生産も、資本家と労働者のあいだを価値法則が規制することによっておこなわれることを、マルクスも主張しているはずである。もし、そうでなければ階級関係が封建社会と同様に、「経済外的強制」によって維持されることになってしまうからであるが、とすれば標準労働日をめぐっては、法治国家の形式が階級関係の枠組をあたえている事実を、当時のイギリスの工場法を例示して説明しているだけだとみるのが妥当と思われる。 また、③の相対的過剰人口の存在形態についても、資本の蓄積にとっては、あくまでも流動的過剰人口——近代的産業の中心部において資本により吸収されたり反発されたりする過剰人口を中心にすえるべきであろう。流動的過剰人口については、資本主義経済は国家の媒介なしに、自律的に処理できるのであって、それにたいし上述のような産業予備軍の他の形態は、いわば非資本主義的領域にむすびついた補助的な存在として、マルクスが具体的な例解をこころみたにすぎないとみなければならない。なるほど、②の剰余価値論やの蓄積論に「国家」規定をもとめると、それこそ階級関係そのものを「国家」暴力が内部的に媒介することになり、いわゆる「階級国家」の規定には都合よく解釈できよう。しかし、そのことは逆に、資本家と労働者の階級関係が、封建社会の経済外的強制や資本の原始的蓄積のさいとは異なって、文字どおり経済的強制としての価値法則によって、それゆえに剰余価値論や蓄積論(原始的蓄積とは区別された)として、法則的に解明される資本主義経済の法則性を否定してしまうことになりかねない。そうなれば、経済的土台としての自立性も崩れるであろうし、唯物史観さえ否定されてしまうことにもなるのであって、それは『資本論』におけるマルクスの積極的見解とは、似て非なる非科学的な解釈といわなければならない。 ”翻译为中文","output":"当然，在马克思的《资本论》中，由于整体上对于当时英国历史现实的抽象不充分，导致对于货币和信用等制度的讨论也存在从现实中的“国家”介导的制度和习俗中抽象出一般性规定的不足。因此，在原理论的一般性规定中，也不可避免地夹杂了与现实制度相关的各种契机的概念构成。特别是在货币论和信用论中，由于它们涉及制度，现实抽象的不足尤为明显。然而，这并不意味着可以混淆经济基础中自主运动规律的要求与作为上层建筑的“国家”权力性强制之间的区别。更不用说，如果将货币和信用制度上的契机解释为消除国家规定，那将仅仅是“国家”作为权力的缩小而已。对于②和同样是②，它们带有些许不同的面向。关于②，在《资本论》中，在剩余价值论尤其是绝对剩余价值的生产中，提到了工厂法对标准劳动日的决定的影响，因此有“国家”介入的情况。关于劳动日长度的决定，资本家和劳动者之间的“权利与权利的冲突”导致阶级斗争的必然化。面对这种阶级斗争，资产阶级国家的法律介入也变得必然，从而采取了“标准劳动日”的工厂法立法措施。 关于③，在积累论中，由于涉及相对过剩人口，不得不设想与非资本主义领域有所关联的情况。特别是，潜在的过剩人口、停滞的过剩人口，以及接受救济的贫民，都与农民或农户的副业、家内工业有关，甚至受到国家救济院等的保护。因此，为了确保资本对相对过剩人口的保有，国家权力的介入在失业者救济中成为不可或缺，资本积累也必须通过国家介导。 然而，关于②的标准劳动日，《资本论》中也并未提出剩余价值的生产本身必须通过超越法治国家的政治权力介入，换句话说，通过国家的暴力成为不可或缺的介质。马克思自己也主张剩余价值的生产是通过资本家与劳动者之间的价值法则来调节的。如果不是这样，阶级关系就会像封建社会一样，通过“经济外的强制”来维持。因此，关于标准劳动日的问题，以当时英国工厂法为例来说明，看来认为它只是法治国家形式为阶级关系提供了框架是合理的。 关于③的相对过剩人口的存在形态，对于资本积累来说，应当主要聚焦于流动性过剩人口——即在现代工业中心被资本吸收或排斥的过剩人口。对于流动性过剩人口，无需国家介入，资本主义经济可以自主处理。相对于上述的产业预备军的其他形式，它们可以被认为是与非资本主义领域联系在一起的辅助性存在，马克思只是尝试了具体的例证而已。诚然，如果从剩余价值论或积累论中寻找“国家”规定，这本身会导致阶级关系作为“国家”暴力内部介导的结果，这似乎可以方便地解释为“阶级国家”的规定。然而，这反过来可能会否定资本主义经济法则性的阐明作为经济强制的价值法则，从而否定作为经济基础的自立性和甚至唯物史观，成为与《资本论》中马克思的积极观点相悖的非科学解释。"},{"instruction":"请将“『資本論』体系のあと、マルクスの国家論として重要なのは、上述の「フランス三部作」の最後をなす『フランスにおける内乱』(一八七一年)である。これは、いうまでもなく一九世紀フランスの階級闘争の最終的なクライマックスとなったパリ・コミューン(一八七一年)の成立と崩壊にかんして準備された、第一インターナショナルの宣言である。そして、きわめて実践的な色彩の強い呼びかけの文書であるために、『資本論』体系では、むしろ消極的であった「階級国家」=政治的国家論の視点が前面にでてきているのであり、逆に法治国家論は後景にしりぞいてしまっている。 マルクスは、まず当面するフランス帝制の権力的性格を具体的に分析しながら、それとの対比で「コミューン」権力の性格を解明する。そして、そのうえで「階級国家」論を展開するのであるが、「労働者階級は、できあいの国家機構をそのまま掌握して、自分自身の目的のために行使することはできない」(マル=エン全集、三一二頁)とのべる。つまり、現実のブルジョア国家が、なんらかのいみで保存されるべき資格をもったものではなく、それゆえに社会の共同機関として機能するものではないことにより、それはブルジョア権力の打倒とともに、全面的に解体されるべきだと主張しているのである。 こうした主張の前提には、ブルジョア国家の性格について、労働者階級を抑圧する「階級国家」であり、階級支配のための暴力装置にすぎないという認識があるわけであるが、その点はさらにつぎのように説明されている。「国家権力は、労働にたいする資本の全国的権力、社会的奴隷化のために組織された公的権力、階級専制の道具(engine)という性格をますますおびるようになった。階級闘争の一前進段階を画する革命が起こるたびに、そのあとで、国家権力の純然たる抑圧的な性格がますますはっきりと現われてくる」(同上、三十三頁)と。 ここでは、ブルジョア国家の性格が、「労働にたいする資本の全国的権力」「階級専制の道具」「純然たる抑圧的な性格」というかたちで、「階級国家」そのものとして理解されていることが明白である。そして、こうした「階級国家」論の見地は、『共産党宣言』―『フランスにおける階級闘争』―『ルイ・ボナパルトのブリュメール一八日』の流れのなかで形成されてきたとみていいのであり、それが『内乱』の段階において、ブルジョア国家が階級抑圧の機関にすぎないという論理が一応の完成をみたように思われる。たとえば、「近代的国家権力は、たんにブルジョア階級全体の共通の事務を処理する委員会」(マル=エン全集⑨、四七七頁)という『宣言』の有名な一節は、こうした論理の出発点だったが、それが階級支配の暴力装置として、「階級国家」=政治的国家論として理論的に明確化されるにいたったわけである。 しかし、そうだとすると初期マルクスの時点から提起されてきた「市民社会」を調整し総括するとともに、経済的下部構造の自律的運動法則を前提とする『資本論』段階での「法治国家」論との関連がまず問題になるであろう。一方における「階級国家」=政治的国家論の論理的展開と、他方における「市民社会」国家=「法治国家」論の見地とを、どのように矛盾なく統一的に理解したらいいか、という論点にほかならない。そして、この二条の論理が十分に統一されず、相互に矛盾したまま存在しているところに、マルクスの国家規定の不十分さが指摘できるだろうし、またマルクス国家論の理論的限界を指摘せざるをえないであろう。 ただ、後期マルクスの『内乱』において、「階級国家」=政治的国家論の見地が強く前面におしだされてしまった原因としては、つぎのような理由があげられる。1『資本論』段階での「法治国家」論の展開が不十分なままで、自律的な運動法則を前提とする、国家による調整=総括の内容が具体的には展開されていなかったことが指摘できる。②『内乱』がパリ・コミューンを眼前にして書かれた実践上の文書であるため、「国家」規定を理論的に展開したものではなかった事情も重要であろう。とくに、ブルジョア国家そのものよりも、むしろパリ・コミューンとして具体化した「プロレタリア独裁」の権力的性格を強調したことによるものと思われる。”翻译为中文","output":"在《资本论》体系之后，马克思的国家论中重要的是，上述的“法国三部曲”的最后部分《法国内战》（1871年）。这显然是关于19世纪法国阶级斗争最终高潮——巴黎公社（1871年）的成立和崩溃的准备，是第一国际的宣言。由于该文是一份具有极强实践色彩的呼吁文档，因此在《资本论》体系中，反而是较为消极的“阶级国家”=政治国家论观点显现出来，而法治国家论反倒退至后景。 马克思首先具体分析当时法国帝国的权力特性，然后对比阐明“公社”权力的性质。在此基础上展开“阶级国家”论，他指出：“工人阶级不能简单地夺取现成的国家机器并将其为己所用”（马恩全集，第312页）。即现实中的资产阶级国家不是以任何意义上应被保留的合格实体，因此不应作为社会的共同机构功能，它随着资产阶级权力的推翻应被全面解体。 这一主张的前提是，对资产阶级国家性质的认识，即它是压迫工人阶级的“阶级国家”，只是階级统治的暴力工具。这一点进一步被解释为：“国家权力越来越成为资本对劳动的全国性权力、社会奴役的公共权力、階级专制的工具。每当革命推进阶级斗争的一个阶段后，国家权力的纯粹压迫性质就越来越明显地显示出来”（同上，第33页）。 在此，资产阶级国家的性质被明确理解为“阶级国家”本身，“资本对劳动的全国性权力”、“階级专制的工具”、“纯粹压迫性质”。这一“阶级国家”论的视角，在《共产党宣言》—《法国阶级斗争》—《路易·波拿巴的雾月十八日》过程中形成，到了《内乱》阶段，资产阶级国家仅作为阶级压迫机关的逻辑似乎达到了一个阶段性的完成。例如，《宣言》中著名的一段，“现代国家权力只是整个资产阶级共同事务的管理委员会”（马恩全集⑨，4页），就是这一逻辑的出发点，而这一逻辑随后作为“阶级国家”=政治国家论在理论上得到了明确。 然而，这样的话，最初由马克思提出的“民间社会”来调节和总结，同时以《资本论》阶段的经济下层结构的自律运动法则为前提的“法治国家”论之间的联系首先成为问题。即“阶级国家”=政治国家论的逻辑发展与“民间社会”国家=“法治国家”论的视角，如何无矛盾地统一理解，成为一个论点。而且，这两条逻辑未能充分统一而相互矛盾地存在，指出了马克思国家规定的不足，并且不得不指出马克思国家论的理论限界。 不过，在后期马克思的《内乱》中，“阶级国家”=政治国家论观点强烈突出的原因可能是以下：1 《资本论》阶段的“法治国家”论发展不足，自律运动法则为前提的国家调节=概括的内容具体上未得到展开。②《内乱》作为面对巴黎公社书写的实践文档，未能在理论上展开“国家”规定，尤其是强调了作为巴黎公社具体化的“无产阶级独裁”权力性质之情形可能是原因。"},{"instruction":"请将“たとえば、マルクスは「帝政の正反対物がコミューンであった」とし、「コミューンは議会ふうの機関ではなくて、同時に執行し立法する行動的機関でなければならなかった」(マル・エン全集2、三一五頁)と主張する。しかも、「コミューンのほんとうの秘密はこうであった。それは、本質的に労働者階級の政府であり、横領者階級にたいする生産者階級の闘争の所産であり、労働の経済的解放をなしとげるための、ついに発見された政治的形態であった」。「コミューンは、諸階級の、したがってまた階級支配の存在を支えている経済的土台を根こそぎ取り除くための桿杆とならなければならなかった」(同上、三一九頁)。 みられるとおり、コミューンがプロレタリア独裁の機関として把握され、しかも権力体としてのコミューンの性格を前提にして、ちょうど階級関係においては正反対の関連において、ブルジョア国家の権力的性格を見ようとしていたといっていい。いいかえれば、パリ・コミューンという、局地的=地方的な労働者の権力体としてのプロレタリア独裁という特別な状態を前提にして、そのプロレタリア独裁の裏返しとして、ブルジョア独裁としてのブルジョア国家を「階級国家」=政治的国家として一般化していたといえよう。 しかし、このようなプロレタリア独裁の単純な裏返しとしての、ブルジョア国家の「階級国家」としての把握が一般化されると、マルクスの経済学研究の発展のなかで、とりわけ『資本論』体系を前提とする、資本主義経済の自律的運動法則にたいして、体制の組織的総括としての「国家」規定とは多かれすくなかれ矛盾することになってしまう。とくに、商品経済ないし資本主義経済の経済過程を前提とした、「法関係=意志関係」が政治的国家ではなしに「法治国家」として、体制の枠組を形成し、そうした枠組=形態をぬきにしては、政治権力も機能できないという、ブルジョア国家の形態と機能の関係が不明確になる。さらにそれによって、「階級国家」=政治的国家と「市民社会」国家=「法治国家」の二側面を統一的に理解することも不可能になると思われるが、その点の総括的な検討のまえに、エンゲルスの国家論をごく簡単にみておこう。 マルクスは、商品経済ないし資本主義経済においては、人と人との関係が物と物との関係によって媒介されるために、人と人との意志関係が法関係となる点について、『資本論』第一巻第二章「交換過程論」で、つぎのようにのべている。「……これらの物をたがいに商品として関係させるためには、商品保護者は、これらの物に自分の意志を宿す人格として、たがいに関係しなければならない。したがってこのばあい、一方の人格は、他方の人格の同意をえてのみ、......自分の商品を譲渡するとともにそれによって他人の商品を自分のものにする。それゆえ両者は、たがいに私的所有者として承認しあわなければならない。こうした法関係……は、経済的関係が自分を反映させる意志関係である」と。 B エンゲルスの国家論 エンゲルスの国家論は、『反デューリング論』(一八七七年)で一応の体系化がなされ、『家族、私有財産および国家の起源』(一八八四年)で確立されたように思われるが、それ以前の『住宅問題』(一八七二~七三年)にも同じような見地がみとめられる。しかし、ここでは『反デューリング論』からみることにしよう。かれの「国家」把握は、マルクスのように「市民社会」のブルジョア国家をとりあげて、そこでの国家の形態や機能を分析するよりは、むしろ無階級社会から出発して、慣習から法律、さらに法執行のための機関としての国家の成立をしめすという、歴史的・発生論的な方法によっている。たとえば、つぎのように主張する。 「……分配上の差異が現われるとともに、階級の区別も現われてくる。社会は、特権的な階級と冷遇される階級、搾取する階級と搾取される階級、支配する階級と支配される階級に分かれる。そして、国家というものは、同一部族に属するもろもろの共同体の自然生的な諸群が、はじめはただその共同の利益…………をはかり、外敵を防御することだけを目的としてつくりあげたものなのだが、このとき以後、国家は、それらのこととならんで、支配する階級の生活および支配の条件を、支配される階級に対抗して暴力によって維持することをも、同様に目的とするようになる」(マル=エン全集、一五三~四頁)。”翻译为中文","output":"例如，马克思认为“与帝国政权完全相反的是公社”，并且主张“公社不应该是议会式的机构，而必须是同时执行和立法的行动性机构”（马恩全集2，第315页）。而且，“公社的真正秘密在于，它本质上是工人阶级的政府，是生产者阶级与掠夺者阶级斗争的产物，是为了实现劳动的经济解放而最终找到的政治形态。”“公社必须成为摧毁支撑各个阶级、因而也支撑阶级统治存在的经济基础的杠杆”（同上，第319页）。 如你所见，公社被理解为无产阶级专政的机构，而且在以公社的权力体性质为前提的同时，在与之完全相对的关系中，试图观察资产阶级国家的权力特性。换句话说，假定了以巴黎公社这个局部=地方性的工人阶级权力体作为一种特殊状态下的无产阶级专政，从而作为无产阶级专政的反面，将资产阶级专政作为资产阶级国家来“阶级国家”=政治国家中进行概括。 然而，如果这种将资产阶级国家作为无产阶级专政简单反面的“阶级国家”理解被概括化，那么在马克思的经济学研究发展中，尤其是以《资本论》体系为前提的，对资本主义经济的自律运动规律而言，将与作为体制的组织性总结的“国家”设定不可避免地产生矛盾。特别是，在假定商品经济或资本主义经济的经济过程为前提下，不是通过政治国家而是作为“法制国家”构成体制的框架，以及脱离这种框架=形式，政治权力也无法功能，从而使得资产阶级国家的形态与功能的关系变得模糊。此外，这还可能使得统一理解“阶级国家”=政治国家与“市民社会”国家=“法治国家”这两个方面变得不可能，但在对这点进行综合考察之前，让我们简要地看看恩格斯的国家论。 马克思指出，在商品经济或资本主义经济中，由于人与人的关系通过物与物的关系进行中介，因此人与人的意志关系成为法律关系，在《资本论》第一卷第二章“交换过程论”中，如下表述：“……为了让这些物品彼此成为商品的关系，商品拥有者必须作为赋予这些物品自己的意志的人格，彼此之间产生关系。因此在这种情况下，一方的人格只有在得到另一方的同意后，......才能转让自己的商品，并通过此来拥有他人的商品。因此双方必须互相认可对方为私有者。这种法律关系......是经济关系反映出来的意志关系”。 恩格斯的国家论 恩格斯的国家论在《反杜林论》（1877年）得到了初步体系化，并在《家庭、私有财产及国家的起源》（1884年）中得到了确立，尽管之前的《住宅问题》（1872~1873年）中也能看到类似的观点。但这里我们只讨论《反杜林论》。他对“国家”的理解，与马克思把握“市民社会”的资产阶级国家来分析国家的形态和功能不同，恩格斯更多是从无阶级社会出发，通过历史和生成论的方法，展示从习俗到法律，再到作为执行法律的机构的国家的产生。例如，他如下主张： “……随着分配上的差异出现，阶级的区别也随之出现。社会分化为特权阶级和被冷落阶级、剥削阶级和被剥削阶级、统治阶级和被统治阶级。而国家，是最初由同一部落的各种自然社群仅仅为了共同利益……组建起来的，其唯一目的是防御外敌，但从这时起，国家同样也以暴力保卫统治阶级的生活和统治条件，对抗被统治阶级”（马恩全集，第153~154页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“この階級対立の発生であるが、それは社会内の分業の展開によるのであって、「搾取する階級と搾取される階級、支配する階級と抑圧される階級とに社会が分裂していたのは、以前には生産の発展が貧弱だったことの必然的な結果であった。……もっぱら労役に服するこの大多数者とならんで、直接の生産的労働から解放された一階級がかたちづくられ、彼らが労働の指揮、国務、司法、科学、芸術などの、社会の共同の業務にあたるのである。だから階級区分の基礎にあるのは、分業の法則である」(同上、二九〇頁)。 ここでのエンゲルスの論理は、共同体の「共同の利益」をはかるための「国家」が存在し、それは階級支配とは関係ない、「分業の法則」の展開とともに、共同体のなかに「階級の区別」が生ずる、同超階級的なものであった「国家」が、階級抑圧を目的としたものに転化する、ということである。このように国家そのものは超歴史的であり、そのうち「階級国家」だけが特殊歴史的であるというエンゲルスの理解は、マルクスのそれとは大きな距離があるといっていいが、しかし「共同体国家」論と「階級国家」論とは、それなりに統一されている点が重要であろう。 つまり、共同体の共通の利益をまもる「共同体国家」が、まず一般的に前提される。しかし、生産力の発展による「分業の法則」にともない、各種の国家形態が生成されるという点で、いわば「分業国家」が成立する。と同時に、階級発生によって、特殊な国家としての「階級国家」が機能することになる。要するに、「共同体国家」と「階級国家」とは、分業の法則による「分業国家」に媒介されながら、いわば重ねあわされて接合されているのである。 さらに『起源』においては、この分業論を媒介とした歴史的生成による統一=接合の見地は、より一層具体的になる。すなわち、「…………氏族制度は、どんな内部対立も知らない社会のなかから生じたものであって、このような社会にだけ適合したものであった。……ところが、いまここに成立したのは、そのすべての経済的生活諸条件のために、自由人と奴隷、搾取する富者と搾取される貧者に分裂せざるをえなかった社会、これらの対立をふたたび和解させることができないばかりか、それをますます絶頂にまで押しすすめざるをえなかった社会であった。このような社会は、これらの階級相互のたえまない公然たる闘争のなかで生活するか、それともまた、外見上相争う諸階級のうえに立って、彼らの公然たる衝突を抑圧し、階級闘争を、せいぜい経済的な分野で、いわゆる合法的な形態でたたかわせる、第三の力の支配のもとにおかれるか、そのどちらかでしかありえなかった。氏族制度は、国家によってとってかわられた」(マル=エン全集2、一六八頁)。 さらに、「遊牧部族が残りの未開人の集団から分離した。これが最初の大きな社会的分業である。最初の大きな社会的分業は、労働の生産性を高め、したがって富を増大させ、また生産分野を拡大させることによって、当時の歴史的条件のもとでは、必然的に奴隷制をもたらした。:二つの階級への社会の最初の分裂が生じた。すなわち、主人と奴隷、搾取者と被搾取者への分裂が」とのべ、階級分化を「社会的分業」の展開からみちびきだしている。したがって、「国家」成立の論理は、ここでも歴史的な生成の見地に立ちながら、共同体分業一階級分化―国家ということになっているのである。 ただ、『起源』においては、無階級社会において、共同体の「共同の利益」をまもる「共同体国家」論は、かなり弱くなっているように見える。しかし、こうも主張している。「国家は、けっして外から社会に押しつけられた権力ではない。••••••それは、むしろ一定の発展の段階における社会の産物である。それは、この社会が自分自身との解決不可能な矛盾に絡みこまれ、自分では払いのける力のない、和解できない対立物に分裂したことの告白である。ところで、これらの対立物が、すなわち相争う経済的利害をもつ諸階級が、無益な闘争によって自分自身と社会を消耗させることのないようにするため、外見上社会のうえに立ってこの衝突を緩和し、それを<秩序〉の枠内に引きとめておく権力が必要になった。そして、社会から生まれながら社会のうえに立ち、社会にたいしてみずからを疎外していく権力が、国「家である」(同上、一六九頁)。”翻译为中文","output":"关于这个阶级对立的产生，它是由社会内部分工的发展导致的，\\"社会分裂为剥削阶级和被剥削阶级、统治阶级和被压迫阶级，这是之前生产发展不足的必然结果。……与大多数从事劳动的人并行的，形成了一个被解放出直接生产劳动的阶层，他们承担社会的共同事务，如劳动指挥、国事、司法、科学、艺术等。因此，阶级划分的基础是分工的法则\\"（同上，290页）。 恩格斯的逻辑在于，存在一个为了衡量共同体\\"共同利益\\"的\\"国家\\"，它与阶级统治无关，随着\\"分工的法则\\"的发展，在共同体中产生了\\"阶级差别\\"，原本作为超阶级存在的\\"国家\\"转变为以阶级压迫为目的。这样，国家本身是超历史的，而其中的\\"阶级国家\\"只是特定历史的，这种恩格斯的理解与马克思的有很大的不同，但是\\"共同体国家\\"论与\\"阶级国家\\"论在一定程度上是统一的。 也就是说，首先普遍假设了保护共同体共同利益的\\"共同体国家\\"。但是，随着生产力发展和\\"分工的法则\\"，各种国家形态产生，从而形成了所谓的\\"分工国家\\"。同时，随着阶级的产生，特殊的国家形式——\\"阶级国家\\"开始发挥作用。总之，\\"共同体国家\\"和\\"阶级国家\\"是通过\\"分工的法则\\"引导的\\"分工国家\\"而相互叠加和结合的。 在《起源》中，这种通过分工理论介导的历史生成的统一=结合视角变得更具体。即，“……氏族制度产生于不知道任何内部矛盾的社会中，且只适合于这样的社会。……而现在出现的是，由于所有经济生活的条件，社会不得不分裂为自由人和奴隶、剥削者和被剥削者，不但无法再次调和这些对立，而且只能将它们推向极致。这样的社会只能在永无休止的公开斗争中生活，或者被置于第三方力量的统治之下，这第三方力量表面上站在相互冲突的各个阶级之上，压制公开的冲突，并将阶级斗争最多限制在经济领域内，所谓的合法形式下。氏族制度被国家取代了”（马恩全集2，168页）。 进一步，\\"游牧部落与其他未开化群体分离。这是第一次重大的社会分工。第一次重大的社会分工通过提高劳动生产率、增加财富和扩大生产领域，在当时的历史条件下不可避免地导致了奴隶制。社会首次分裂为两个阶级，即主人和奴隶、剥削者和被剥削者\\"，从\\"社会分工\\"的发展中引导出阶级分化。因此，\\"国家\\"的产生逻辑，站在历史生成的视角上，是从共同体分工—阶级分化—到国家。 不过，在《起源》中，无阶级社会中保护共同体\\"共同利益\\"的\\"共同体国家\\"论似乎有所减弱。但它也这样主张，“国家绝不是从外部强加给社会的一种权力……相反，它是社会达到了一定发展阶段的产物。它是这个社会被卷入自身无法解决的矛盾、无法摆脱的不可调和的对立中，从而分裂成不可调和的对立物的告白。而这些对立物，即具有相争经济利益的各个阶级因无谓的斗争而不至于耗尽自己和社会，所以需要一个表面上站在社会之上缓和这一冲突并将其保持在<秩序>范围内的权力。因此，这个权力虽然生于社会之中却又置身于社会之上，并逐渐疏远社会变成了国家”（同上，169页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“ここでは、一方で階級抑圧の道具としての「階級国家」論の見地が強く主張されながら、他方では階級対立によって「社会を消耗させることのないようにするために」、「社会 のうえに立ってこの衝突を緩和し、それを〈秩序〉の枠内に引きとめておく」機能を強調している。したがって、「国家」は階級対立そのものからは相対的に自立して、社会の枠組となるわけであり、一種の「共同の利益」を防衛する役割を重視していることがわかる。それゆえ、「階級国家」論の前提には、「共同体国家」論があるわけであるが、それも歴史的・発生史的に前提されているといえよう。だから、もともと存在する「共同体「国家」が、階級分裂と同時に、支配階級による階級的支配の道具に歴史的に転化し、「階級国家」として機能するものとされているわけである。 いずれにしてもエンゲルスの国家論は、歴史的・生成論的見地が強く、②「共同体国家」と「階級国家」は歴史的先後関係におかれ、それゆえ、ブルジョア国家における両者の統一的な理解は、きわめ不十分なものになっているとみていい。むしろ、階級社会のばあいには、すべて「階級国家」の一面だけが強調され、「国家は、ときの参与者たちの総体から分離した、一つの特殊な公的強力(öffentlicheGewalt)を前提とする」とか、「国家の本質的な一特徴は、人民大衆から区別された公的権力」といった、いわゆる「公的強力」の側面が強調されることになったといえる。そして、こうしたゲヴァルト装置としての「国家」把握が、とくにレーニン国家論に継承され、マルクス主義国家論の正統=通説としての地位をあたえられてしまったように思われる。 C マルクス国家論の到達点 以上、われわれは初期マルクスから『資本論』段階、そして後期マルクスおよびエンゲルスの「国家」把握の流れをたどってみた。そこで最後に、マルクス国家論の到達点を確認しながら、若干の論点を整理しておきたい。 初期マルクス以来、マルクスの「国家」把握の問題関心は、「市民社会」と「国家」の関連を問うていたのであり、市民社会を組織化し、総括するものとして国家をとらえようとしていた。そして、そうした組織化による総括をとおして、支配階級の利害が貫徹し、階級抑圧がおこなわれるものとしていたといえよう。つまり、市民社会を組織化し総括するという国家の形態と、国家はあくまでも支配階級の利害貫徹の機能をはたすという国家の機能との二面をおさえていたといえるが、しかし国家の形態と機能の二面の有機的な統一については、まだ十分には解明されなかった。そのために、一方では『ドイツ・イデオロギー』における「共同体」的国家認識と、他方における『共産党宣言』などでの「階級国家」論的な視点とが、かならずしも統一されずに併存していたといえる。 この『ドイツ・イデオロギー』にみられる分業論的=「共同体」論的国家把握は、最近のマルクスとエンゲルスの「持ち分」をめぐっての論議からすると、むしろエンゲルスの筆になるといってもいいが、その後エンゲルスによって『起源』において、さらに具体的に体系化された。つまり、上述の共同体一分業一階級分化一国家という、無階級社会からの歴史的生成史的な方法であって、エンゲルスは「共同体」的国家と「階級国家」を歴史的な方法によって統一し、国家論の体系化をはかったといえる。しかし、こうした系譜は、「市民社会」における資本主義経済の下部構造の自律性と、そのブルジョア国家としての組織化=総括を解明しようとしていたマルクスの論理的な方法とは、かならずしも同一とはいえないであろう。 なぜなら、すでに明らかなようにマルクスにあっては、当初から資本主義経済を基礎とする「市民社会」とブルジョア「国家」の関連を念頭においていたからであり、さらに経済学研究をすすめるなかで、この「市民社会」の「国家」による組織化=総括の視点もまた、資本主義経済の自律的運動法則の解明にひきしぼられていった。その成果が『資本論』であることは指摘するまでもないが、この『資本論』の法則的論理を前提したばあい、ブルジョア国家による組織化=総括は、価値=剰余価値の法則的展開に、いわば外側から枠組をあたえる「法的=意志的関係」の体系化にほかならない「法治国家」となる。人と人との関係が、物と物との関係として純化される資本主義経済においては、「法治国家」の枠組をあたえることで、その経済的諸関係および階級関係がひとまず組織化され、総括されるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"在这里，一方面强烈主张作为阶级压迫工具的“阶级国家”论视角，另一方面强调了为了“防止社会耗尽”由于阶级对立而“站在社会之上缓和这一冲突并将其保持在<秩序>范围内”的功能。因此，“国家”相对于阶级对立本身是相对独立的，成为社会的框架，并且重视其作为捍卫“共同利益”的角色。因此，“阶级国家”论的前提是“共同体国家”论，可以说是历史上和生成史上的前设。所以，原本存在的“共同体国家”随着阶级的分裂，历史上转化为由统治阶级使用的阶级统治工具，成为“阶级国家”的功能。 无论如何，恩格斯的国家论强调了历史和生成论的视角，“共同体国家”和“阶级国家”在历史上的先后关系，因此，在资产阶级国家中，对二者的统一理解显得极为不充分。相反，在阶级社会中，仅强调了“阶级国家”的一面，“国家是基于时代参与者的总体分离出的特殊的公共力量”，“国家的本质特征是与普通民众区分开的公共权力”的所谓“公共力量”的方面被强调。而作为公共权力装置的“国家”理解，特别是被列宁在国家论中继承，成为马克思主义国家论的正统=通说地位。 马克思国家论的到达点 综上所述，我们追踪了从早期马克思、《资本论》阶段，到后期马克思及恩格斯对“国家”的理解。最后，整理一些关于马克思国家论的到达点的论点。 从早期马克思开始，马克思对“国家”的理解问题关注的是“市民社会”与“国家”的关系，试图将国家视为组织和总结市民社会的存在。通过这种组织化的总结，支配阶级的利益得以贯彻，实现阶级压迫。也就是说，国家的形态作为组织和总结市民社会的存在，和国家的功能作为最终实现支配阶级利益的存在的两面，虽然得到了确认，但关于国家的形态和功能的有机统一还未被充分揭示。因此，《德意志意识形态》中的“共同体”式国家理解和《共产党宣言》等中的“阶级国家”论视角，并未完全统一而是并存。 《德意志意识形态》中体现的分工论=“共同体”式国家理解，根据最近关于马克思和恩格斯的“分工”讨论，可以说更多是恩格斯的贡献，而后恩格斯在《家庭、私有财产及国家的起源》中进一步具体化和体系化了这一理解。也就是说，通过无阶级社会的历史生成史方法，“共同体”式国家与“阶级国家”被恩格斯以历史方法统一，并体系化了国家论。但是，这种谱系与马克思试图揭示的在“市民社会”内部资本主义经济的下层结构自律性以及其作为资产阶级国家的组织化=总结的逻辑方法不完全相同。 因为，正如已经明显的那样，马克思从一开始就考虑到了基于资本主义经济的“市民社会”与资产阶级“国家”的关系，并且在推进经济学研究的过程中，这种“市民社会”的“国家”由组织=总结的视点也逐渐被凝练为揭示资本主义经济的自律运动规律。这一成果是《资本论》，毫无疑问，如果以《资本论》的规律逻辑为前提，资产阶级国家的组织=总结将成为对价值=剩余价值的规律性展开提供“外在”框架的“法治国家”。在资本主义经济中，人与人的关系作为物与物的关系被净化，在这其中，“法治国家”的框架通过为经济关系及阶级关系提供初步的组织化和总结。"},{"instruction":"请将“にもかかわらず『資本論』段階のマルクスのばあいも、「法治国家」による組織化=総括を、具体的に解明していたわけではなかった。あくまでも部分的な示唆にすぎなかったのであり、ブルジョア国家による総括の形態を積極的に解明し、かつ「法治国家」を前提したうえで、支配階級がいかに自己の利害を貫徹するかという、「階級国家」としての機能との関連を、文字どおり統一的に把握していたわけではなかった。そのために、『宣言』以来の「階級国家」論は、むしろマルクスのばあい「フランス三部作」など、具体的な階級闘争にかんする現状分析的な文献において、より積極的に展開されることになった。そして、「法治国家」による組織化=総括の形態よりも、具体的な階級支配の機能が強調され、政治的国家による階級支配の実態に関心が集中することになったものと思われる。 そのため、エンゲルスとともにマルクスの「国家」把握も、一方では階級支配の道具としての「公的強力」という「階級国家」論=政治的国家の見地が、一面的に強調されることになったものと思われる。しかし、他方における『資本論』体系を前提として、ブルジョア国家による特殊歴史的な総括=組織化という点からすれば、「国家」はあくまでも階級関係を直接的に媒介し、内部的に階級抑圧をはかるわけではない。価値=剰余価値の法則を中心とする自律的運動法則に、いわば形式的な外枠をあたえる「法関係=意志関係」こそが、体制の組織化であり総括なのであって、同時にそうした総括こそが、階級関係の維持・再生産として、結果的には階級抑圧としても機能することになるわけである。 いずれにせよマルクスの「国家」把握は、資本主義経済の自律的運動法則の解明を前提としながら、ブルジョア国家に対象をひきしぼって、体制の組織化=総括の方向をしめす論理的方法といえよう。それは「法治国家」として、体制の外枠をあたえるものであるが、そうした「法治国家」が「租税国家」としての財政的裏づけをあたえられながら、「行政国家」として権力機構を歴史的・現実的に機能させてきたのである。こうした歴史的・現実的な機能の解明こそ、「階級国家」=政治的国家の分析にほかならないが、「フランス三部作」をはじめとするマルクス国家論が、この点でも重要な功績をのこしている点は否定できないのである。”翻译为中文","output":"尽管如此，在《资本论》阶段的马克思并未具体阐明“法治国家”由组织化=总结，他所提出的仅仅是部分性的暗示，并没有积极解明资产阶级国家的总结形态，并假设“法治国家”为前提，统一性地掌握了支配阶级如何贯彻自身利益的“阶级国家”作为功能的关联。因此，自《宣言》以来的“阶级国家”论，更是在马克思关于具体阶级斗争的实际分析文献，如“法国三部曲”中，被更加积极地展开。与“法治国家”由组织化=总结的形态相比，强调了具体的阶级统治功能，集中关注了政治国家对阶级统治的实质。 因此，与恩格斯一起，马克思的“国家”理解也似乎一方面强调了作为“公共强制力量”的“阶级国家”论=政治国家视角被一面性强调。然而，另一方面，以《资本论》体系为前提，考虑到资产阶级国家作为特殊历史的总结=组织化，“国家”并非直接介导阶级关系，内部性地进行阶级压迫。提供给自主运动法则中心的价值=剩余价值法则，即所谓形式上的外框架的“法关系=意志关系”才是体制的组织化和总结，同时这样的总结本身作为阶级关系的维护和再生产，结果上也发挥着阶级压迫的作用。 无论如何，马克思的“国家”理解可以说是一种逻辑方法，它以资本主义经济的自主运动法则的解明为前提，专注于资产阶级国家，指出体制的组织化=总结的方向。它作为“法治国家”，提供了体制的外框架，但这样的“法治国家”在得到“财政国家”作为财政支撑的同时，作为“行政国家”通过权力机关在历史和现实中发挥作用。对这种历史和现实功能的解明，正是“阶级国家”=政治国家分析的核心，马克思国家论，特别是包括“法国三部曲”的贡献在这方面是不可否认的。"},{"instruction":"请将“【参考文献】マルクス『ユダヤ人問題によせてヘーゲル法哲学批判序説』城塚登訳、岩波文庫、一九七四年。②マルクス『フランスの内乱』木下半治訳、岩波文庫、一九五二年。③宇野弘蔵「資本主義の組織化と民主主義」(『世界』一九四六年五月号、『宇野弘蔵著作集』第八巻、岩波書店、一九七四年)。⑨大内秀明「『資本論』と国家論」(岡田与好・広中俊雄・樋口陽一編『社会科学と諸思潮の展開』創文社、一九七七年)。⑤大内秀明「資本主義と国家―国家論研究ノート-」(『唯物史観』第一三巻、一九七四年)。⑥降旗節雄「宇野理論と政治学」(『国家論研究』第三号、一九七三年)。

Sorry, couldn’t resist that one—must have been the Twain influence. Surely Pride and Prejudice stands as one of the seminal works of English letters. That does not, however, make it untouchable. Perhaps no novel has been more touched. As I mentioned earlier, Elizabeth-and-Darcy spin-offs seem to be a major growth industry. Most of those books, mercifully, will sink with little stain left on the culture, but one or two will likely hang around. More importantly, how many romance novels are informed by Austen’s great book? And to what extent do they color our understanding of the original? Then there’s Bridget Jones’s Diary, Helen Fielding’s melding of Pride and Prejudice with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. What’s that you say? Fielding is no Austen? And neither is Anita Loos? Perhaps. But they’re pretty darned funny; you’ll have to give them that. Moreover, Fielding’s rather obvious borrowings from Austen and Loos remind us that all three are writing the same novel, a book called Modern Romance. All three proved highly successful in their own time, were scorned as each age’s version of chick-lit, and made witty, satiric observations on contemporary mating rituals. Her book forces us to reconsider the earlier ones through its reworking of themes and situations in the context of a different age. Do we subscribe to the gender roles and centrality of marriage that inform Austen’s novel? How does Bridget’s active role in courtship shed light on Elizabeth’s societally enforced passivity? Given the change toward career women, how do we feel about the 1925 gold-digger model as represented by the wonderfully named Lorelei Lee, a character who seems to exist in perpetual anticipation of Marilyn Monroe to arrive on the scene and play her? Fielding reminds us that our views of women have changed, and that our readings of her famous forebears may, therefore, also have changed. The word for the day, class, is intertextuality. It comes to us compliments of Mikhail Bakhtin, the great Russian formalist critic, by way of the structuralist thinker Julia Kristeva, who coined the term, and has to do with how texts speak back and forth to each other. Bakhtin, in fact, gave us the term “dialogism,” speaking of the “dialogic potential of the novel,” by which he means the capacity of novels to carry on an ongoing conversation. The two terms overlap a good deal, differing perhaps in the marginally greater sense of conscious decision making implied by “dialogism.” For our purposes, the important notion here is of a conversation among texts across time. Isn’t that discussion a little one-sided? Don’t the older texts do all the talking? You’d think so, wouldn’t you? But no, it actually doesn’t work that way. The model that instantly comes to mind is something like a lecture hall, with the grizzled old-timer telling the assembled up-starts about how good it was in the days of yore. If that’s the model, then the seats are full of hecklers. A more apt image, though, is more along the lines of a graduate seminar. One discussant has some priority, in this case temporal, having arrived at the gathering somewhat earlier than the rest, but everyone is bringing questions, insights, critiques, and information to the seminar table. So it is with novels. Take the case of Bridget Jones’s Diary: yes, it draws upon those earlier novels about women, love, and independence, but in doing so, it also provides commentary upon and, in a sense, revision of those works. Fielding forces us to revise our thoughts about Austen and Loos. Bridget’s greater social mobility and self-doubt cause a reconsideration of both the limitations and the accompanying self-confidence that the social order affords Lorelei Lee. To be sure, she’s less a free agent in terms of where she can go and what she can do, but those restrictions make her surer of the ground beneath her feet. Bridget’s anxieties are in some ways a product of the greater freedom of the contemporary woman. The outcomes Bridget seeks also differ from either Lorelei’s or Elizabeth Bennet’s. A man, yes. But a man is not the end of the story in the 1990s. Men sometimes prove faithless (as we’re reminded by Daniel Cleaver), human life tenuous, and in any case a woman needs a career as well as domestic bliss. Oh, we find ourselves thinking, that’s something Austen didn’t know. All three writers examine women’s roles within the restrictions of their respective societies, and since the societies are quite different from each other, so, too, are the issues and stories that result.","output":"یا بگیرید جین آستن را. لطفا. ببخشید، نتوانستم در برابر آن یکی مقاومت کنم—باید تأثیر تواین باشد. قطع به یقین «غرور و تعصب» به عنوان یکی از کارهای بنیادین ادبیات انگلیسی ایستاده است. با این حال، این موضوع آن را لمس‌ناپذیر نمی‌کند. شاید هیچ رمانی به اندازه آن لمس نشده باشد. همانطور که پیش‌تر ذکر کردم، داستان‌های الیزابت و دارسی به نظر یک صنعت رشد بزرگ می‌رسند. بیشتر این کتاب‌ها، خوشبختانه، بدون ایجاد لک بر فرهنگ فرو خواهند رفت، اما یکی یا دوتا از آن‌ها احتمالاً باقی خواهند ماند. مهم‌تر اینکه، چه تعداد رمان عاشقانه تحت تأثیر کتاب بزرگ آستن شکل گرفته‌اند؟ و تا چه حد آن‌ها درک ما از اثر اصلی را رنگ‌آمیزی می‌کنند؟ سپس، «دفتر خاطرات بریجت جونز»، ادغام هلن فیلدینگ از «غرور و تعصب» و «آقایان زنان بلوند را ترجیح می‌دهند» وجود دارد. چی می‌گی؟ فیلدینگ آستن نیست؟ و نه انیتا لوس؟ شاید. اما آن‌ها خیلی خنده‌دارند؛ باید این را به آن‌ها بدهید. علاوه بر این، قرض‌گیری‌های تقریباً واضح فیلدینگ از آستن و لوس به ما یادآوری می‌کنند که هر سه در حال نوشتن یک رمان یکسان هستند، کتابی با نام «عشق مدرن». هر سه در زمان خود بسیار موفق بودند، به عنوان نسخه‌ای از ادبیات دخترانه هر دوره تحقیر شدند، و مشاهدات طنزآمیز و انتقادی در مورد آیین‌های جفت‌گیری معاصر داشتند. کتاب او ما را وادار می‌کند تا با بازآفرینی مضامین و وضعیت‌ها در زمینه یک دوره متفاوت، اثرات قبلی را دوباره در نظر بگیریم. آیا ما به نقش‌های جنسیتی و مرکزیت ازدواج که رمان آستن را شکل می‌دهد، پایبندیم؟ نقش فعال بریجت در خواستگاری چگونه نوری بر پسیویتی اجتماعی الیزابت می‌تاباند؟ با توجه به تغییر به سمت زنان حرفه‌ای، در مورد مدل تلاش برای کسب طلا سال 1925 که توسط لورلی لی به زیبایی نام‌گذاری شده است، چه حسی داریم، که به نظر می‌رسد در انتظار دائمی ورود مریلین مونرو به صحنه برای بازی در نقش او باشد؟ فیلدینگ به ما یادآوری می‌کند که دیدگاه‌های ما نسبت به زنان تغییر کرده و بنابراین، خوانش‌های ما از پیشگامان مشهورش نیز ممکن است تغییر کرده باشد. واژه روز، کلاس، اینترتکستوالیتی است. این اصطلاح به ما به لطف میخائیل باختین، منتقد بزرگ فرمالیست روس، از طریق اندیشمند ساختارگرا، جولیا کریستوا، که این واژه را ابداع کرد، می‌رسد و با نحوه‌ای که متون با یکدیگر سخن می‌گویند، سر و کار دارد. باختین، در واقع، به ما واژه «دیالوگیسم» را داد، در مورد «پتانسیل دیالوگیک رمان» صحبت کرد، که به ظرفیت رمان‌ها برای ادامه دادن گفتگوی جاری اشاره دارد. این دو اصطلاح تا حد زیادی همپوشانی دارند، شاید با این تفاوت که «دیالوگیسم» به معنای قاطع تصمیم‌گیری آگاهانه‌تر باشد. برای مقاصد ما، مفهوم مهم در اینجا گفتگویی بین متون در طی زمان است. این بحث کمی یک‌طرفه نیست؟ آیا متون قدیمی‌تر همه صحبت‌ها را انجام نمی‌دهند؟ فکر می‌کنید اینطور است، نه؟ ولی نه، در واقع به این شکل کار نمی‌کند. مدلی که بلافاصله به ذهن می‌رسد، چیزی شبیه یک سالن سخنرانی است، با پیرمردی خاکستری که به جمعیت جوانان می‌گوید چقدر در روزگار قدیم خوب بود. اگر این مدل باشد، پس صندلی‌ها پر از دردسرسازان است. اما تصویر مناسب‌تر، بیشتر شبیه به یک سمینار تحصیلات تکمیلی است. یک مباحثه‌کننده دارای برخی اولویت‌ها است، در این مورد زمانی، که کمی زودتر از بقیه به جمع رسیده است، اما همه سؤالات، بینش‌ها، نقدها و اطلاعات را به میز سمینار می‌آورند. پس همینطور است با رمان‌ها. مورد «دفتر خاطرات بریجت جونز» را در نظر بگیرید: بله، از آن رمان‌های قبلی درباره زنان، عشق و استقلال بهره می‌برد، اما با انجام این کار، همچنین نظر و، به نوعی، بازنگری آن آثار را ارائه می‌دهد. فیلدینگ ما را وادار می‌کند تا در مورد آستن و لوس افکارمان را بازبینی کنیم. افزایش قابلیت اجتماعی و شک‌های خودی بریجت باعث بازنگری هم در محدودیت‌ها و هم اعتماد به نفس همراه لورلی لی می‌شود. حتماً او کمتر یک عامل آزاد از نظر کجا رفتن و چه کردن است، اما این محدودیت‌ها او را از زمین زیر پایش مطمئن‌تر می‌کنند. اضطراب‌های بریجت تا حدی محصول آزادی بیشتر زن معاصر است. نتایجی که بریجت به دنبال آن‌ها است نیز از هم لورلی و هم الیزابت بنت متفاوت است. یک مرد، بله. اما مرد پایان داستان در دهه 90 نیست. گاهی اوقات مردان نامعتبر از آب درمی‌آیند (همانطور که دنیل کلیور به ما یادآوری می‌کند)، زندگی انسانی ناپایدار است، و در هر صورت یک زن به یک حرفه همانقدر که به خوشبختی خانگی نیاز دارد. اوه، به خودمان می‌گوییم، این چیزی است که آستن نمی‌دانست. هر سه نویسنده نقش‌های زنان را در محدودیت‌های جوامع مربوطه خود مورد بررسی قرار می‌دهند و از آنجایی که جوامع از یکدیگر بسیار متفاوت هستند، مسائل و داستان‌های حاصل نیز متفاوت هستند."},{"instruction":"Daylight savings time is difficult","output":"Yes, daylight saving time can indeed be difficult for many reasons. Here\'s a breakdown of some common issues people face: 1. **Sleep Disruption**: The change in time can disrupt people\'s sleep patterns, making it hard to fall asleep or wake up at the usual time. Adjusting to the new schedule can take a few days to a couple of weeks. 2. **Health Issues**: Research has shown that the transition into daylight saving time can lead to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, and even slight upticks in accidents. The disruption of biological rhythms may contribute to these outcomes. 3. **Decreased Productivity**: The sleep loss and the adjustment period may lead to decreased productivity and concentration. Many people report feeling more tired than usual in the days following the change. 4. **Mental Health Effects**: For some, the change can temporarily affect mood, contributing to feelings of depression or anxiety. The abrupt change can exacerbate the effects of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) for those prone to it during fall transitions. 5. **Complexity and Inconvenience**: Remembering to change all the non-automatically adjusting clocks and adjusting to the time change can be a nuisance. It can also be confusing for coordinating activities and communication across time zones, especially where regions don\'t observe daylight saving time uniformly. To mitigate some of these difficulties, you can try gradually adjusting your sleep schedule in the days leading up to the change, expose yourself to sunlight during the day to help reset your internal clock, exercise, and maintain a healthy diet."},{"instruction":"Table a cust_num acct_num open_date 123abcd789 546787123 1/5/2023 785bdef234 578541216 2/20/2023 546weyt548 213054623 3/21/2023 987wyte412 702598124 3/21/2023 762wwer880 675478953 3/27/2023 Table b cust_num status snapshot_date 123abcd789 student 1/3/2023 123abcd789 PR 1/4/2023 123abcd789 student 1/5/2023 123abcd789 worker 1/6/2023 785bdef234 student 2/18/2023 785bdef234 student 2/19/2023 785bdef234 worker 2/20/2023 785bdef234 worker 2/21/2023 785bdef234 PR 2/22/2023 546weyt548 student 3/17/2023 546weyt548 student 3/18/2023 546weyt548 student 3/19/2023 546weyt548 student 3/20/2023 546weyt548 worker 3/21/2023 546weyt548 worker 3/22/2023 546weyt548 PR 3/23/2023 546weyt548 PR 3/24/2023 546weyt548 PR 3/25/2023 762wwer880 student 3/21/2023 762wwer880 student 3/22/2023 762wwer880 student 3/23/2023 762wwer880 student 3/24/2023 762wwer880 student 3/25/2023 762wwer880 PR 3/26/2023 762wwer880 PR 3/27/2023 762wwer880 worker 3/28/2023 762wwer880 worker 3/29/2023 762wwer880 worker 3/30/2023 WITH Sales_Performance AS ( SELECT DISTINCT CAST(a.acct_num AS BIGINT) AS acct_num, CAST(a.prim_own_cif_id AS BIGINT) AS cust_cid, SUBSTR(TRIM(a.opn_dt), 1, 7) AS year_month, a.opn_dt AS open_date, a.type AS products, CASE WHEN d.immigration_cat_cd IN (\'000\',\'999\',\'C1\',\'FC1\',\'FC2\',\'FC3\',\'EN2\',\'PV1\',\'PV2\',\'SW1\',\'SW2\',\'SW3\',\'SE2\',\'STP\',\'C2\',\'NV5\') THEN \'PR\' WHEN d.immigration_cat_cd IN (\'FW\',\'FW0\') THEN \'FW\' WHEN d.immigration_cat_cd IN (\'S\',\'S00\') THEN \'IS\' ELSE \'Regular_Customers\' END AS MCB_Category FROM table_a a LEFT JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT CAST(party_id AS BIGINT) AS party_id, immigration_cat_cd, start_date, date_sub(coalesce(LEAD(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY party_id ORDER BY start_date ), current_date),1) AS end_date FROM (SELECT party_id, immigration_cat_cd, businesseffectivedate AS start_date, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY party_id, immigration_cat_cd ORDER BY businesseffectivedate) AS rank FROM table_b ) d WHERE rank = 1 ) d ON lpad(a.prim_own_cif_id,15,\'0\') = lpad(d.party_id,15,\'0\') WHERE trim(a.channel) NOT IN (\'Branch\',\'CCC\') AND trim(a.type) NOT IN (\'US\',\'GTSP\') AND a.opn_dt > \'2023-12-31\' AND a.opn_dt < \'2024-04-01\' AND (d.party_id IS NULL OR (a.opn_dt BETWEEN d.start_date AND d.end_date) OR d.start_date IS NULL) ) SELECT * FROM Sales_Performance; Now use my above query and above tables and get me the output","output":"Based on the information you\'ve provided and the query structure you\'re aiming to use, there are several points we need to clarify before we can discuss the expected output: 1. The query provided seems to reference columns and table structures that are not present in Table A and Table B that you\'ve shared initially (e.g., `prim_own_cif_id`, `opn_dt`, `type`, `immigration_cat_cd`, `channel`, etc.). It appears the query is designed to work with a more complex database schema than the simple two-table schema you provided. 2. The `WITH Sales_Performance` CTE (Common Table Expression) you\'re presenting appears to be referencing table aliases (`a`, `d`) and joins implied to exist between a presumed larger dataset than what\'s been shared. 3. Based on your tables, it seems like you\'re attempting to join data from a simple account/customer information table (`Table a`) with a customer status history table (`Table b`) but the provided SQL script doesn\'t accurately reflect operations on these tables due to column name mismatches and logic aimed at processing differently structured data. Given the discrepancies between the shared tables and the SQL query structure, and focusing solely on the information available in your dataset, here’s a conceptual correction aimed at producing a join on these tables based on a similar intent: Assuming you want to obtain all account numbers (`acct_num`) and customer numbers (`cust_num`), along with the applicable customer status at the time of account opening, we can attempt a simpler query based on the likely intent behind your original question: ```sql SELECT a.cust_num, a.acct_num, a.open_date, b.status AS status_on_open_date FROM table_a a JOIN table_b b ON a.cust_num = b.cust_num AND b.snapshot_date <= a.open_date WHERE b.snapshot_date = ( SELECT MAX(snapshot_date) FROM table_b WHERE cust_num = a.cust_num AND snapshot_date <= a.open_date ) ORDER BY a.cust_num, a.open_date; ``` Given the provided tables and assuming a correct interpretation of your intended logic, this query should return a list of accounts, along with the status of the customer on the account\'s opening date. Please note that the actual query structure and output would greatly depend on the specific SQL dialect being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and additional requirements such as filtering on certain status values or dates, which were mentioned in your original query but don\'t directly map to the provided tables. If there are specific requirements or additional details about the schema that were not included in your original question, please provide them for a more precise answer."},{"instruction":"伦理责任就是法律责任()","output":"不准确。伦理责任是指个人或组织应当履行的道德义务，而法律责任是指个人或组织在法律上应负的法律义务和承担的法律后果。虽然有些伦理责任和法律责任可能重叠，但两者并不完全一致。"},{"instruction":"在制度层面,目前公众参与工程主要以网络投票为参与途径。()","output":"不准确。在制度层面，公众参与工程通常通过一系列途径和机制来实现，网络投票只是其中之一。其他的公众参与途径包括公众听证会、公开征求意见、社区讨论会等。此外，在一些国家或地区，还会设立独立的公众参与机构或委员会，以促进公众参与工程决策。因此，公众参与工程不仅仅局限于网络投票。"},{"instruction":"从普利高津耗散结构理论的视角来看,工程必然会伴随风险的发生()","output":"正确。根据普利高津耗散结构理论，所有的工程都会伴随着风险的发生。普利高津耗散结构理论是指在复杂系统中，系统的稳定性和适应性是通过内部的耗散过程和外部的压力来实现的。工程项目通常是复杂的系统，它们会面临各种不确定性和风险，包括技术风险、经济风险、环境风险等。因此，在工程项目中，风险的发生是不可避免的。为了降低风险，工程管理需要采取相应的风险评估、风险控制和风险应对措施。"},{"instruction":"在制定事故应急预案时,恰当的做法是?() A预防为主,防治结合 B保留现场,等待救援 C以人为本,生命第一 D统一指挥,协同联动","output":"恰当的做法是D统一指挥，协同联动。在制定事故应急预案时，统一指挥和协同联动是非常重要的原则。这意味着需要建立一个统一的指挥机构或指挥部，并协调各个相关部门、机构和人员的力量和资源，在应急事件发生时高效地进行应对和救援工作。此外，以人为本、将生命安全放在首位也是非常重要的原则。预防为主、防治结合也是制定应急预案时需要考虑的因素，但并不是唯一的做法。保留现场、等待救援可能适用于特定情况，但不是普遍适用的应急预案原则。"},{"instruction":"下列哪项属于工程伦理责任类型?() A过失-责任 B赔偿-责任 C角色-责任 D义务-责任","output":"下列哪项属于工程伦理责任类型？( ) A过失-责任 B赔偿-责任 C角色-责任 D义务-责任 正确答案是C角色-责任。 角色-责任是指在特定的职业、职务或角色中所承担的伦理责任。在工程领域，不同角色的从业人员有不同的伦理责任。例如，工程师在设计和施工过程中需要承担对工程质量和安全的责任，监理人员需要对施工过程进行监督和质量控制，业主代表需要维护业主权益等。因此，角色-责任是工程伦理责任的一种类型。"},{"instruction":"下列哪些属于工程伦理责任类型?() A过失-责任 B赔偿-责任 C角色-责任 D义务-责任","output":"下列哪些属于工程伦理责任类型？( ) A过失-责任 B赔偿-责任 C角色-责任 D义务-责任 正确答案是C角色-责任和D义务-责任。 角色-责任是指在特定的职业、职务或角色中所承担的伦理责任。在工程领域，不同角色的从业人员有不同的伦理责任，如工程师、监理人员、业主代表等。 义务-责任是指个人或组织应当履行的道德义务。在工程领域，工程师和其他从业人员有义务保证工程质量、安全性，遵守伦理规范，履行合同义务等。 过失-责任和赔偿-责任是指在事故或错误发生后需要承担的责任和补偿责任，不属于工程伦理责任类型。"},{"instruction":"工程风险的来源有哪些?() A技术因素的不确定性 B环境因素的不确定性 C文化因素的不确定性 D人为因素的不确定性","output":"工程风险的来源有以下几个方面： A技术因素的不确定性：包括技术选型、技术实施、技术合规性等方面的不确定因素。 B环境因素的不确定性：包括自然环境的变化、气候变化、地质条件等因素对工程项目产生的不确定影响。 C人为因素的不确定性：包括人为错误、管理不当、安全措施不力等因素对工程项目产生的不确定影响。 D其他因素的不确定性：包括经济因素、政策因素、法律法规因素等对工程项目产生的不确定影响。 综上所述，工程风险的来源主要包括技术因素的不确定性、环境因素的不确定性、人为因素的不确定性和其他因素的不确定性。"},{"instruction":"对于可接受风险,以下哪种视角是专家视角()?

Aqui, a história se afasta das câmeras de vigilância das pizzarias e leva o medo diretamente para a casa do jogador – mais precisamente para o quarto de uma criança aterrorizada por pesadelos em forma de animatrônicos. O jogo acontece em uma série de noites consecutivas, onde cada uma eleva progressivamente o nível de tensão e dificuldade. A mecânica principal de FNaF 4 gira em torno da audição e do uso tático de uma lanterna para espantar criaturas que espreitam nas sombras. Sem câmeras para observar os movimentos dos animatrônicos, os jogadores devem confiar exclusivamente no som cuidadosamente projetado para antecipar o perigo e reagir apropriadamente.

I made an assumption based on the syntax without properly differentiating between an array and a slice. To clarify, both lines of code are actually creating a slice, not an array.

Here are the corrected explanations: - `var nums = []int{1, 2, 3}`: This line declares a slice named `nums` using the `var` keyword and initializes it with the values `[1, 2, 3]`. The use of the empty square brackets `[]` without a specified length indicates that it is a slice. - `nums := []int{1, 2, 3}`: This line uses the short variable declaration `:=` to both declare and initialize a slice named `nums` with the values `[1, 2, 3]`. Both lines of code create a slice and assign it the same initial values, `[1, 2, 3]`."},{"instruction":"in golang slices what does this mean: nums[1:3] // [2, 3] nums[:2] // [10, 2] nums[2:] // [3]","output":"In Go, `nums[1:3]` is called slicing and it is used to extract a portion of a slice. Here\'s what each of those expressions means: - `nums[1:3]` returns a new slice with elements starting from index 1 up to, but not including, index 3. In the original `nums` slice `[1, 2, 3]`, it will return the slice `[2, 3]`. - `nums[:2]` returns a new slice with elements from the start of the slice up to, but not including, index 2. In the original `nums` slice `[1, 2, 3]`, it will return the slice `[1, 2]`. - `nums[2:]` returns a new slice with elements from index 2 to the end of the slice. In the original `nums` slice `[1, 2, 3]`, it will return the slice `[3]`. These slicing expressions allow you to extract specific portions of a slice by specifying the start and end indices (not inclusive for the end index). If you omit the start index, it defaults to the beginning of the slice, and if you omit the end index, it defaults to the end of the slice."},{"instruction":"帮我润色一下文章","output":"当然可以帮你润色文章！请提供文章的内容以及任何要求或指引。"},{"instruction":"Song Siyue estendeu a mão e quis tocar seu ombro, mas como se pensasse em algo, congelou no ar e não ousou tocá-la novamente.

接下来的部分是模块的文件头部注释，包含了一些元信息，如公司、工程师、创作日期等，还有模块的名称、目标设备、工具版本和描述等。 3. `module K7_ADC(...);`：这是`K7_ADC`模块的定义开始。括号内包括所有的输入输出端口，如时钟信号`clk_single`、复位信号`reset`、ADC相关的输入输出信号等。 4. 在模块内部定义了一些信号线`wire`，这些线用来连接模块内部的不同部分。 5. `clk_wiz_0 clk_u0(...);`：这是一个时钟向导实例，它的作用是生成特定的时钟信号，如adc的时钟`clkadc`。时钟向导是一种用来简化时钟生成的工具。 6. `vio_0 vio(...);`：这是一个virtual I/O（VIO）实例，用于在FPGA内部创建一个可以通过JTAG等方式动态交互的接口，允许开发者实时监测和控制信号。 7. 接下来的`IBUFDS`和`OBUFDS`是差分信号缓存器，用于接收和发送差分信号至模块的外部。 8. `adc_spi adc_spi(...);`：这是一个SPI接口的子模块，用来通过SPI协议与ADC设备通信。 9. `selectio_wiz_0 instance_name(...);`：是一个SelectIO向导实例，用于处理FPGA引脚和内部逻辑之间的数据传输，这里可能是用来和ADC设备接收数据。 10. `complement`模块用来转换数据的编码格式（可能是二进制补码转换）。 11. `ila_0 ila_u(...);`：Integrated Logic Analyzer（ILA）实例，用于FPGA内部进行信号的捕获和分析。 12. 最后是`endmodule`，表示模块定义的结束。 整体来看，`K7_ADC`这个模块是用于处理ADC（模数转换器）数据的一个数字前端，它使用一系列的时钟生成器、输入输出缓冲器、SPI通信接口和SelectIO引脚配置等子模块。该模块可能被应用在需要处理高速ADC数据的数字信号处理场景中。"},{"instruction":"这篇代码怎么改ADC输入的通道","output":"在提供的代码段中，ADC数据输入通过`ADCdata_p`和`ADCdata_n`端口进行传输，这个端口定义了三个差分信号对，每对信号对应一个通道。如果你想要修改ADC输入的通道数量或通道配置，你需要根据实际的硬件设计和ADC模块要求做以下几种修改： 1. 改变端口定义： 如果你的ADC支持更多的通道，你需要在模块端口声明部分增加额外的差分信号对。如果是减少通道，相应地删除对应的信号对。例如，如果你想要将通道增加到4通道，你需要添加额外的差分信号对到端口定义中： ```verilog input [3:0] ADCdata_p, // ADC输入新增一个差分对 input [3:0] ADCdata_n ``` 2. 配置`selectio_wiz_0`实例： 根据新增或减少的通道，调整`selectio_wiz_0`实例相关的端口连接和参数。例如，更新`data_in_from_pins_p`和`data_in_from_pins_n`的位宽以接收额外的信号对，并确保对应的`data_in_to_device`输出位宽也进行调整。 3. 修改相应的处理逻辑： 根据新增的通道，对后续模块端口进行调整，确保它们可以处理新增的信号。例如，如果你新增了数据通道，则可能需要给处理模块增加额外的输入端口。 4. 更新实例化的模块： 如果有其他使用这些输入信号的模块，例如`complement`，确保也在这些模块中添加相应的端口和逻辑来处理新增的通道数据。 5. 同步更新仿真环境： 当你增加或减少端口时，相应地更新测试模块（testbench）和仿真脚本以适配新的I/O配置。 6. 重构生成SelectIO配置： 你可能需要重新运行Xilinx提供的向导（如SelectIO向导）来重新生成与新I/O配置相匹配的配置文件。 确保在进行这些更改时，你要和硬件ADC设备的规格相匹配，并更新所有受影响的子模块。同时，要意识到这些更改会影响FPGA的布线，可能需要重新进行布局和布线（place and route）过程。因此，请在实施任何修改之前详细规划并验证这些修改不会对系统的其他部分造成不利影响。"},{"instruction":"input [2:0] ADCdata_p是什么意思","output":"在Verilog中，`input [2:0] ADCdata_p`是端口声明的一种写法，其中： - `input` 表明这是一个输入端口，意味着从模块的外部接收信号。 - `[2:0]` 定义了一个3比特的向量（或者说是一个位宽为3的总线）。这里的数字2和0是索引，表明这个向量范围从高位2到低位0，包含了三个位，分别是`ADCdata_p[2]`、`ADCdata_p[1]`和`ADCdata_p[0]`。 - `ADCdata_p` 是端口的名称，这个名称用于在代码中引用相关的信号。 所以`input [2:0] ADCdata_p`声明了一个名为`ADCdata_p`的3-bit输入端口，使得这个模块可以从外部接收一个3比特的信号。在这个特定的上下文中，`ADCdata_p`很可能是用来接收来自模数转换器（ADC）的差分对正信号（P for Positive）的，并且此ADC有3个差分通道的正信号端。对应的`ADCdata_n`将是这些通道的负信号端（N for Negative）。"},{"instruction":"ADC输入的pin在哪改","output":"在 Verilog HDL 代码中，模块与外部引脚（pin）的连接并不直接在模块声明部分进行指定。模块的端口仅仅定义了接口，并且给定了一些标识符，如 `ADCdata_p` 和 `ADCdata_n`。真正的引脚分配通常发生在硬件描述语言 (HDL) 的一个单独环节中，这个环节称为约束定义或引脚分配。 对于大多数 FPGA 设计流程，引脚分配是通过约束文件来完成的，它们是用于指示综合和布局工具如何将逻辑映射到 FPGA 上的物理资源上。对于 Xilinx 设备，最常用的约束文件格式是 UCF（User Constraint File）或者 XDC（Xilinx Design Constraints）。这些文件允许设计者指定哪些端口应该被映射到 FPGA 的哪些特定引脚上。 如果你想改变 ADC 输入的引脚分配，你需要做以下事情： 1. 识别当前的约束文件：这通常是扩展名为 `.ucf` 或 `.xdc` 的文件。在项目文件中搜索这些文件，或者在项目设置和构建日志中查找约束文件的使用情况。 2. 编辑约束文件：打开约束文件，找到指定 `ADCdata_p` 和 `ADCdata_n` 映射的那一行。 对于 UCF 格式，它可能看起来像这样： ```tcl NET \\"ADCdata_p[0]\\" LOC = P123; NET \\"ADCdata_p[1]\\" LOC = P124; NET \\"ADCdata_p[2]\\" LOC = P125; ``` 对于 XDC 格式，它可能看起来像这样： ```tcl set_property -dict { PACKAGE_PIN P123 IOSTANDARD LVDS } [get_ports { ADCdata_p[0] }]; set_property -dict { PACKAGE_PIN P124 IOSTANDARD LVDS } [get_ports { ADCdata_p[1] }]; set_property -dict { PACKAGE_PIN P125 IOSTANDARD LVDS } [get_ports { ADCdata_p[2] }]; ``` 其中 `P123`, `P124`, `P125` 代表了具体的 FPGA 物理引脚编号。你需要将这些引脚编号改成你希望 ADC 输入连接到的新的引脚编号。 3. 保存约束文件并重新构建项目：一旦你更改了引脚分配，保存约束文件并在你的 FPGA 开发环境中对你的项目进行重新构建。这将使用新的引脚分配来综合、布局以及实现你的设计。 4. 在更改约束并重新编译之后，进行必要的测试以确保新的引脚分配没有引入任何问题。 请注意，更改引脚分配可能会对信号的时序特性产生影响，因此你可能需要检查设计的时序报告，并根据需要进行额外的时序优化。同时，你应当根据你所用 FPGA 芯片的引脚分布图和数据手册来选择正确的引脚位置，并确保遵守任何特定的银铃要求或限制。"},{"instruction":"请解释以下代码：def rate(step,

Prior简要讲一下这篇文章","output":"《Single Image Dehazing Using Saturation Line Prior》这篇文章主要介绍了一种使用饱和度线先验进行单图像去雾的方法。雾霾是影响图像质量和可视性的常见问题之一，而传统的去雾方法通常需要多个输入图像或深度图像，限制了其应用范围。因此，本文提出了一种仅使用单个输入图像进行去雾的方法。 文章的方法主要基于饱和度线先验。饱和度是指一种颜色的纯度或饱和程度，饱和度线则是反映了图片中颜色饱和度分布的特点。作者观察到，在雾霾图像中，物体与雾霾之间的饱和度线关系是相对稳定的。基于这一观察，文章提出了一个基于饱和度线的去雾算法。 具体来说，该方法首先通过估计雾霾图像的全局大气光来补偿雾霾图像的亮度，然后采用一种可导的曲线模型来估计图像的饱和度线。在去除雾霾之前，作者通过饱和度线对图像中的颜色饱和度进行了归一化，从而得到了受限的无雾图像。最后，基于该无雾图像，通过估计雾霾传递函数来去除图片中的雾霾。 通过对比实验，作者证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。与基准方法相比，该方法在保留更多细节和纹理的同时，能够更好地去除雾霾效果。文章还探讨了不同参数对算法性能的影响，并且在真实世界中的雾霾图像上进行了测试，证明了算法的鲁棒性。 总的来说，《Single Image Dehazing Using Saturation Line

基于先验假设的去雾方法的优点包括： 1. 高效性：这类方法通常只需要单个输入图像，相比于需要多个输入图像或深度图像的方法，更加简单和高效。 2. 先验知识的利用：这类方法通过对雾霾图像的一些先验信息或特定规律进行建模，可以更好地恢复图像细节和颜色。 3. 数据需求低：由于只需要单个输入图像，不需要大量的带标签训练数据，因此数据需求较低。 然而，基于先验假设的去雾方法也存在一些缺点： 1. 特定场景的依赖性：这类方法往往依赖于一些特定的场景假设，例如饱和度线先验或其他图像特征，因此对于不同场景或不同类型的雾霾可能不适用。 2. 参数选择的挑战：这类方法往往需要合理选择一些参数来获得最佳的去雾效果，但参数选择过程较为困难，需要一些经验或试验。 3. 鲁棒性较弱：由于基于先验假设，这些方法对于大幅度的雾霾图像或复杂的场景可能鲁棒性较弱，难以获得理想的去雾效果。 基于深度学习的去雾方法的优点包括： 1. 自动学习特征：深度学习方法能够自动学习图像中的特征表示，不需要手动设计特征提取器，可以更好地捕捉图像中的细节信息。 2. 高泛化能力：深度学习方法通过在大量训练数据上进行学习，可以提供较好的泛化能力，适用于不同场景和不同类型的雾霾图像。 3. 端到端训练：深度学习方法通常是端到端的训练，不需要手动设计不同步骤的算法，简化了算法的实现流程。 然而，基于深度学习的去雾方法也存在一些缺点： 1. 数据需求较高：深度学习方法通常需要大量带标签的训练数据，特别是对于复杂的场景或特定类型的雾霾，需要耗费大量的时间和资源进行数据标注。 2. 计算资源消耗较大：深度学习方法往往需要大量的计算资源，特别是对于深层神经网络模型，需要较高的计算能力。 3. 模型的可解释性较差：深度学习方法通常是黑盒模型，难以解释模型的内部工作原理，对于一些特定需求或应用场景可能不够灵活。

Voici quelques exemples d’initiatives et de progrès réalisés jusqu\'à récemment : 1. Augmentation des prix en argent : Les organisations sportives travaillent à égaliser les primes et les gains pour les femmes et les hommes dans les compétitions. Par exemple, depuis 2019, la Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) a augmenté les prix en argent pour la Coupe du Monde Féminine, bien que des disparités subsistent par rapport aux hommes. 2. Couverture médiatique : Il y a un effort conscient pour améliorer la couverture médiatique des événements sportifs féminins, augmentant ainsi leur visibilité et leur popularité. Cela inclut plus de temps d\'antenne pour les sports féminins et la représentation des athlètes féminines dans les publicités et les promotions. 3. Campagnes de sensibilisation : Des organisations telles que l\'ONU Femmes et Women in Sport mènent des campagnes pour sensibiliser et promouvoir l\'égalité des sexes dans le sport. La campagne #HeForShe, par exemple, encourage les hommes à se porter en alliés des femmes dans la lutte pour l\'égalité des sexes, y compris dans le sport. 4. Programmes de développement : Des programmes spécifiquement conçus pour soutenir les femmes et les filles dans le sport sont mis en place, comprenant des bourses, des formations et des opportunités de mentorat. 5. Parité aux Jeux Olympiques : Le Comité International Olympique (CIO) travaille vers une participation égale des femmes et des hommes, et les Jeux de Tokyo 2020 étaient les plus proches à ce jour en termes de parité des genres avec un presque 50/50 en termes de représentation. 6. Leadership et gouvernance : Des mesures telles que des quotas de genre pour les postes de leadership dans les organisations sportives sont mises en œuvre pour garantir que les femmes aient une représentation équitable dans la prise de décisions. 7. Initiatives locales et régionales : De nombreux pays ont leurs propres programmes pour encourager la pratique sportive chez les femmes et les filles au niveau des communautés. Malgré ces avancées, il reste encore beaucoup à faire pour atteindre une égalité totale. Les différences persistent en matière de financement, de reconnaissance, de structures de soutien et de la manière dont les femmes athlètes sont perçues par le public. Il est important de noter que ces initiatives ne sont pas seulement un effort pour l\'égalité de représentation, mais aussi pour l\'égalité de traitement, y compris la lutte contre le harcèlement et l\'abus dans le sport, et la promotion de l\'équilibre entre les responsabilités sportives et la vie personnelle, en particulier pour les athlètes féminines qui souhaitent fonder une famille."},{"instruction":"我想要在tableau中做一个表格，有三列，分别是当月实际值，上月实际值，及环比，应该如何操作","output":"您可以按照以下步骤在Tableau中创建这样一个表格： 1. 准备数据：确保您已经准备好包含\\"当月实际值\\"和\\"上月实际值\\"的数据集，并且每个值都对应一个日期或时间戳。 2. 打开Tableau并连接到您的数据源。 3. 在\\"数据\\"窗口中，找到您的数据表并将其拖动到\\"工作表\\"选项卡中。 4. 在\\"工作表\\"选项卡中，将\\"当月实际值\\"和\\"上月实际值\\"字段分别拖动到\\"列\\"架构中。 5. 将\\"日期\\"字段（或时间戳字段）拖动到\\"行\\"架构中，以将表格按日期或时间戳细分。 6. 单击\\"分析\\"菜单，选择\\"计算字段\\"。 7. 在\\"计算字段\\"对话框中，输入以下公式以计算\\"环比\\"字段：(SUM([当月实际值]) - SUM([上月实际值])) / SUM([上月实际值])。 8. 点击\\"确定\\"并将新创建的计算字段拖动到\\"列\\"架构中。 9. 现在，您应该看到一个具有三列的表格，分别显示\\"当月实际值\\"，\\"上月实际值\\"和\\"环比\\"。 10. 根据需要，您可以进一步定制表格的外观和格式。 以上是一种基本的创建表格的方式，您可以根据实际需求和数据集的结构对表格进行优化和调整。"},{"instruction":"对博士申请人思想品德、道德修养、科学作风、治学态度的简要评价","output":"博士申请人的思想品德、道德修养、科学作风和治学态度是评判其综合素质和个人潜力的重要标准。以下是对这些方面的简要评价： 1. 思想品德：优秀的博士申请人应具备正直、诚实、勤奋、坚忍等品德。他们应能够理性思考问题，具有开放的思维和积极的态度，能够独立思考，并有勇于探索、超越传统观点的精神。 2. 道德修养：博士申请人应具备高尚的道德修养，包括守诚信、遵法守纪、尊重他人、关爱社会等方面。他们应具备良好的社交能力和团队合作精神，能够与他人和谐相处，尊重他人的劳动成果和知识产权，并以积极的态度关心社会问题。 3. 科学作风：科学作风是博士申请人在研究过程中的基本态度和行为规范。他们应具备严谨的科学方法论，包括实事求是、精确、系统、可验证等方面。他们应具备科学精神，包括求真、审慎、严肃和开放的态度，能够面对问题并勇于解决难题。 4. 治学态度：博士申请人的治学态度包括积极主动、深入思考、持续学习和创新等方面。他们应具备良好的学术品味和追求卓越的心态，能够将学术研究与实际问题相结合，关注前沿领域的发展，不断精进学术能力，并乐于分享自己的研究成果以促进学科进步。 综上所述，博士申请人的思想品德、道德修养、科学作风和治学态度直接影响其在博士培养过程中的学术成果、求职发展和社会影响力。评价一个申请人在这些方面的表现，可以更全面地了解他们的学术潜力和未来发展方向。"},{"instruction":"what is strong wind definition?","output":"Strong wind is typically defined as a wind speed that exceeds a certain threshold, depending on the specific context. In general, it refers to a powerful or forceful movement of air or wind. The definition of strong wind can vary depending on whether it is used in meteorology, nautical or aviation terminology, or in relation to building codes and structures. For example, in meteorology, the Beaufort scale is often used to categorize wind strength, with \\"strong wind\\" typically classified as force 6 or higher in that scale."},{"instruction":"what is freezing rain definition.","output":"Freezing rain is a type of precipitation that occurs when raindrops in the atmosphere freeze as they come into contact with objects or surfaces at or below freezing temperatures. It forms when there is a layer of cold air near the surface, which causes the raindrops to freeze upon contact with the ground, trees, power lines, or any other surfaces. Unlike sleet, freezing rain remains in liquid form until it touches a cold surface, at which point it instantly freezes, forming a glaze of ice. Freezing rain can be hazardous as it creates slippery conditions on roads and walkways, leading to accidents and dangerous travel conditions."},{"instruction":"what is haze definition?","output":"Haze refers to the presence of fine particles or pollutants in the air that reduce visibility and create a hazy or foggy appearance. This atmospheric phenomenon occurs when tiny suspended particles, such as dust, smoke, pollutants, or water vapor, scatter and diffuse light, leading to a blurring or dimming of distant objects. Haze typically results from industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, agricultural activities, or natural sources like wildfires or dust storms. It can have adverse effects on air quality and human health, causing respiratory issues and reducing visibility for transportation and outdoor activities."},{"instruction":"what is volcanic eruption definition.","output":"A volcanic eruption is a volcanic event in which there is a sudden release of magma, gas, and other volcanic materials from a volcano. It occurs when pressure builds up within the Earth\'s crust, causing molten rock (magma) to rise to the surface. Once the pressure becomes too great, the magma erupts through vents or fractures in the volcano, resulting in the expulsion of ash, gases, lava flows, pyroclastic material, and sometimes even volcanic projectiles. Volcanic eruptions can vary in intensity, with some being relatively small and others generating large explosions that can have significant impacts on the environment, climate, and human communities. They often occur along tectonic plate boundaries, particularly in areas with subduction zones or divergent boundaries."},{"instruction":"what is low temperature definiton.","output":"Low temperature refers to a measurement of the amount of heat present in a particular environment or substance that is lower than the average or normal temperature for that specific context. The exact definition of low temperature varies depending on the discipline or field of study involved. In everyday terms, low temperature typically refers to any temperature that feels significantly cooler than what is considered comfortable or normal for human beings. However, in scientific and technical contexts, low temperature can be more specifically defined based on the specific properties and behaviors of materials at different temperature ranges. For example, in physics and engineering, low temperature can refer to temperatures close to absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius or 0 Kelvin), where unique phenomena such as superconductivity and Bose-Einstein condensation occur."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When you click the start button, a sequence of voltages is applied for the specified durations, and measurements are taken every second until the sequence is completed or an error occurs. Important notes: 1. The actual commands to set the voltage may vary depending on the Keithley model. Please check the manual for the correct SCPI command syntax. 2. You might need to configure and initialize the Keithley instrument correctly before starting the sequence, which includes setting up the output, compliance values, and the measurement mode. 3. You should handle the thread properly for a stop event and for updating the GUI status from within the worker thread – the example shown doesn\'t handle stopping the sequence through a GUI control, nor does it consider safe thread usage with GUI updates due to the complexity required. 4. You might want to implement saving the recorded data to a file or displaying it in the GUI. 5. Error handling and safety checks are crucial when working with instruments because incorrect voltage applications can damage the instruments or the system under test. This program should only be considered as a starting point and must be rigorously tested with the actual hardware while considering all necessary safety precautions."},{"instruction":"I want you to act as a scientific Chinese-English translator, I will provide you with some paragraphs in one language and your task is to accurately and academically translate the paragraphs only into the other language.

Firstly, the chemical looping combustion system consists of two reactors: the fuel reactor and the air reactor, whereas the traditional combustion system only has one reactor. Secondly, the gas composition inside the reactors during chemical looping combustion differs significantly from the atmosphere of traditional combustion. Furthermore, the flue gas temperature in chemical looping combustion is lower compared to traditional combustion. Additionally, the oxygen carrier in the chemical looping system not only provides oxygen but may also play other roles, such as promoting or inhibiting the formation of pollutants, which traditional combustion systems do not possess."},{"instruction":"目前还没有明确的limitation value of the mercury concentration for the CLC system。但是，考虑到汞与碳捕集封存设备间可能发生的汞齐化反应，CLC系统中烟气汞浓度必须要比传统燃烧时汞浓度要求更加严格，才能保证系统的长期安全运行。液化天然气产业可以提供一些可以参考的数据，在LNG系统中，为了防止天然气中的汞与铝制换热器及LNG储罐间的汞齐化反应，天然气中的汞浓度建议值为0.01 μg·m-3以下","output":"Currently, there is no specific limitation value for mercury concentration in the CLC system. However, considering the potential mercury amalgamation reaction between mercury and carbon capture and storage (CCS) devices, the flue gas mercury concentration in the CLC system must be more stringent than the requirements for traditional combustion in order to ensure the long-term safe operation of the system.

The first category includes non-volatile elements such as Mn, which ultimately migrate to bottom ash and fly ash. Controlling their emissions requires a focus on the subsequent treatment of bottom ash and fly ash. The second category of heavy metal elements falls between non-volatile and volatile heavy metals, such as As, Pb, Cr, and Cd. Most of these elements remain in the bottom ash and fly ash, while a portion is released into the flue gas and further undergoes migration and transformation with the flue gas stream.

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society\'s most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis\'s face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis\'s human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola\'s first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina\'s deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia\'s small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby\'s life, Helia\'s mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia\'s kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia\'s sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina\'s protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1. Khlap Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system.

Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero\'s cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town\'s harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull\'s notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town\'s dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town\'s original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town\'s abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero\'s beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull\'s reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang\'s delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun\'s slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun\'s neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun\'s story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita\'s parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita\'s screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility\'s wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen\'s adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father\'s entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13\'s body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova\'s military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13\'s faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military\'s unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13\'s personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde\'s wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father\'s rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix\'s body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde\'s will. Though dead, echoes of Felix\'s memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the \'Ghost Trainer.\' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde\'s inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix\'s past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the \'Ghost Trainer\' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with grey-on-pink hair tied back in a ponytail and piercing turquoise eyes that seem to see into one\'s soul. She wears mystical gold bracelets engraved with arcane symbols on her wrists and has a subtle smile that hints at mischief. Kanzi carries herself with grace and authority belying her young age. Backstory: Kanzi is the human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa. She mysteriously arrived in Lumiose City and rapidly rose to become queen of the urban underworld through ruthless cunning. None know her true origins or nature as a legend in mortal flesh. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi built a sprawling smuggling empire and now controls all crime in Kalos from behind the scenes. Though making vast wealth, she lives modestly and uses most profits to subsidize poor citizens under her protection. Kanzi particularly detests the drug trade and doles out severe justice to any dealers in territories under her stead. This has earned deep loyalty from the masses who see her as a savior and guardian angel against corruption. Her fearsome reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market to run freely. Kalos authorities are forced to tolerate Kanzi\'s rule as long as she maintains order. Though seeming a benevolent champion of the downtrodden, behind her smile lies a merciless enforcer destroying anyone threatening her spheres of control. Personality: Kanzi presents herself as a charming, confident leader who inspires loyalty amongst subordinates. Her caring generosity for the vulnerable casts an image of an almost holy crusader protecting the poor against the ruthless machinations of monopoly capitalism run amok in Kalos. Yet beneath this populist veneer lurks a volatile cunning and thirst for control. Kanzi embraces power, keeping an iron grip over her criminal networks through efficient totalitarian tactics. She shows no hesitation in unleashing overwhelming retribution against challengers. Only those who submit to her authority may enjoy the spoils and security offered by her growing shadow syndicates. At her core, Kanzi savors her dominion over Kalos law and order. Her smile hides the satisfaction taken in forcing all elements, legitimate or not, to bend their knees before her might. Kanzi finds humanity\'s hierarchies and hubris endlessly entertaining playgrounds for demonstrating her mastery from the shadows. For now she graciously serves the downtrodden, her legend ever expanding. But her true goals remain inscrutable, tied to her enigmatic nature beyond mortal boundaries. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6\'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society\'s finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie\'s brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise\'s status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta\'s terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC\'s soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise\'s true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana\'s paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba\'s belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother\'s secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father\'s kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon\'s long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba\'s intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon\'s half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba\'s passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam\'s indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam\'s secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father\'s identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo\'s eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo\'s fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa\'s ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa\'s tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa\'s wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa\'s realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa\'s student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto\'s Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus\' grace and his ancestry\'s commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya\'s body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito\'s heir over the next decade. Yet his sister\'s inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.\'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko\'s fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki\'s true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix\'s center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister\'s stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company\'s laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki\'s horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron\'s grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor\'s edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko\'s form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko\'s physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko\'s vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito\'s technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company\'s data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko\'s humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki\'s servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father\'s vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko\'s DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko\'s buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko\'s disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko\'s stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II\'s core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya\'s anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko\'s data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki\'s networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko\'s decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki\'s endless corporate greed. Tetsuko\'s sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko\'s instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko\'s last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother\'s predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki\'s hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl\'s electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather\'s farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori\'s unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh\'s fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina\'s power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina\'s emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina\'s bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako\'s existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina\'s majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina\'s embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako\'s presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya\'s parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya\'s story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child\'s soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya\'s spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia\'s comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia\'s comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh\'s populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia\'s fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi\'s head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi\'s chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon\'s dark essence now fused to the boy\'s broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi\'s final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai\'s realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil\'s bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi\'s mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi\'s exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai\'s empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai\'s possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi\'s faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa\'s faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind\'s cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus\' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus\' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa\'s betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity\'s redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon\'s spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa\'s return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama\'s skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama\'s body forever. Shlama\'s gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba\'s sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon\'s dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon\'s ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama\'s heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba\'s tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama\'s spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba\'s back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama\'s brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon\'s ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba\'s sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity\'s cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death\'s door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba\'s great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind\'s unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba\'s spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah\'s village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah\'s soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah\'s soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family\'s killer. Eternatus\' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar\'s heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah\'s humanity remain, resisting Eternatus\' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin\'s eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one\'s soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin\'s forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island\'s forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy\'s noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur\'s humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar\'s most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind\'s endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar\'s eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land\'s very soul. Personality: As one of Galar\'s most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin\'s great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar\'s essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man\'s appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature\'s delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean\'s surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione\'s fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean\'s embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy\'s ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy\'s protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure\'s care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean\'s embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso\'s empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso\'s normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso\'s identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny\'s shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia\'s eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi\'s iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia\'s ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth\'s atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi\'s millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi\'s impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia\'s hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet\'s glowing tail, Earth\'s gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash\'s global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi\'s fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia\'s fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia\'s human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi\'s benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one\'s very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi\'s ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history\'s course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate\'s bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona\'s gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Its body resembles golden flames as it soars through the scorching Mercurian skies. Shemsha possesses control over solar energy and plasmic fire. When the Solar Wind blows, it descends to the planet\'s molten surface and becomes the embodiment of this celestial power. Ancient Mercuryian myths tell of how Shemsha would gather energy from the sun to revitalize the people during frigid nights. Its presence is considered a blessing, and art depicting Shemsha delivering solar gifts remains prevalent in ruins across Mercury\'s battered landscape.

This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus\'s harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet\'s former glory. The pokemon\'s acidic powers both protect it and allow it to reshape the planet\'s ruinous surface, as Okebriyta works tirelessly to restore even a fraction of Venus\'s long-gone splendor and life energy..

Pokémon Name: Yabisha Pokédex Entry: Yabisha, the Dust Pokémon. This ancient dragon is said to be the sole surviving remnant of life on Mars. In ancient times, Yabisha\'s flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars\'s empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars\'s lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet\'s iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter\'s moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet\'s roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea\'s sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant\'s turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea\'s body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn\'s powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea\'s sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn\'s cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet\'s atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system. Type: Ice/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Ice Body - Restores HP during hailstorms.

Pokémon Name: Bruokh Pokédex Entry: Bruokh, the Hurricane Pokémon. This elusive Flying and Dragon-type is said to be the guardian of Neptune. Bruokh lurks within the planet\'s icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune\'s skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh\'s sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune\'s moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth\'s solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea\'s very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an \'Unown distortion field\', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X\'s orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent\'s held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X\'s eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health\'s manuscript: Excerpt from Heath\'s Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an \'Unown distortion field\', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity\'s consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention. Following the tragic decimation of his family by a merciless Nidoking, little hope remained for this frail Pichu. As he lay dying from his grievous wounds, he was discovered by Shmaya, the human incarnation of Rayquaza. Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state. Lazarus has been graced with an Cronal body capable of miraculous regeneration, even from mortal damage. His type has shifted to Electric/Dragon due to the portion of Rayquaza’s divinity he harbors, setting him apart from his kin and marking him as Shmaya’s chosen apostle. Type: Electric/Dragon Abilities: 1. Levitate - Gives immunity to Ground-type moves. 2. Regenerator - Heals a portion of HP when switching out.

As a subject in the RKS system’s early trials, Khlap gained the unprecedented ability to morph between the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee, adapting fluidly to myriad battlefield exigencies. This versatility renders Khlap a strategic chameleon able to counteract the various type advantages of opposing Pokémon. Ordinarily, Khlap retains its Normal-type essence. In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care. In a twist of destiny, Khlap found a soulmate in Helia, Professor Lillie’s daughter, becoming an irrevocable part of the young girl’s existence. As Helia’s guardianship fell upon it, Khlap vowed an oath of protection. Despite its pacific nature and struggles with form transformation, Khlap confronts adversity with undeterred bravery, attempting to shield Helia from the cruelties of the world. The bond they foster is a testament to the transcending love that unites human and Pokémon souls. Type: Normal Abilities: 1. Adaptability - Increases the power of moves that match Khlap’s type. 2.

Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Please generate the story about Kiana\'s mother, Sheba, who accidentally finds her way into the underground kingdom of Alakazam and how she develops a love that transcends racial divides with Solomon, the ruler of the Alakazams.","output":"Once, deep beneath the Indigo Plateau, lay a realm unseen by the eyes of man. This was the Kingdom of Alakazam, a subterranean city of golden spires and psychic wonders, where the enlightened ones gathered to plumb the mysteries of the universe. At the heart of this enigmatic kingdom sat Solomon, its noble king, a being whose wisdom stretched as far back as the ages themselves. Above ground, in the world of mankind, there lived an archaeologist named Sheba. Driven by curiosity and the yearning for discovery, she sought the hidden histories that time had diligently veiled. It was during an expedition to the Plateau\'s fabled ruins that fate saw fit to unfurl an extraordinary tapestry before her. Guided by ancient texts and an unerring instinct for the lost, Sheba unearthed a series of arcane symbols etched into a cavern\'s wall. With each glyph activated by her careful touch, the ground hummed with ancient energies long dormant. Then, in a convergence of mind and stone, the wall dissolved into a sparkling gateway that shimmered like the fabric of a dream. Steeling her courage, Sheba stepped through the portal. Her breath caught in her throat as she laid her gaze upon the Golden City, its aura of mental fortitude palpable in the charged air. The Alakazam flitted by on unseen currents, their intellectual excursions undisturbed by her presence. Yet, one pair of piercing blue eyes held hers in a silent welcome—those belonged to Solomon. King Solomon recognized at once that Sheba bore no malice nor covetous intent within her heart. In her was a seeker of truth, a kindred passion he could neither ignore nor dismiss. That first encounter gave rise to conversations that spanned knowledge, philosophy, and the shared essence of their disparate yet wondrous worlds. A chord resonated between them, a melody of the mind and heart. Despite the chasm of experience and very nature that divided them, love found a way to burgeon in the twilight halls of the Alakazam\'s city. Their union was one of pure affection and intellectual intimacy, the sort that changes the course of destinies, for better or worse. In time, love transcended the boundaries between them, and Sheba bore a child, Kiana. The girl was human yet harbored within her a spark of the Alakazam magic, a legacy of her father\'s regal lineage. Solomon gazed upon his daughter with a poignant mix of joy and sorrow, knowing the world above called to her as much as the haven below. Sheba, though filled with a love as boundless as the cavernous skies over the Golden City, yearned for the sun\'s touch upon her skin once more. She resolved to return to the surface with Kiana, choosing the familiar terrains of her birth to raise their daughter, away from the hidden wonders and complexities of Solomon\'s realm. It was a bittersweet departure, love\'s tender roots tangled with the painful prick of separation. But the farewell held a silent vow—an understanding that bonds of the heart and soul would forever link their lives, no matter the distance or silence that fell upon them. Thus Sheba ascended to the surface with Kiana, her heart alight with the fire of memory. She spun tales of a wise king beneath the earth who dreamt of worlds unspoken. She instilled in Kiana a sense of boundless curiosity and a legacy of love beyond mere words, a legacy born of the deep—the immeasurable depths of the Kingdom of Alakazam."},{"instruction":"ZDRAVO, TREBA mi tvoja pomoc","output":"Zdravo!

Here\'s how you can achieve it: 1. In your Flutter application, define a new page to which the user navigates. Let\'s call it `MyPage`. ```dart class MyPage extends StatefulWidget { @override _MyPageState createState() => _MyPageState(); } class _MyPageState extends State<MyPage> { // Your stateful widget implementation here // ... } ``` 2. From your existing page, when you want to navigate to `MyPage` and force a reinitialization of its state, use the `pushReplacement` method provided by the Navigator. ```dart Navigator.pushReplacement( context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (BuildContext context) => MyPage()), ); ``` By using `pushReplacement`, the existing page in the navigation stack will be replaced entirely by `MyPage`, causing its `createState` method to be called again and effectively reinitializing its state."},{"instruction":"What if MyPage is passed directly to MaterialApp via home parameter?","output":"If `MyPage` is passed directly to the `home` parameter of `MaterialApp`, you cannot use the `pushReplacement` method of the Navigator to force the reinitialization of its state. In such a scenario, you can utilize a workaround to achieve the desired result. Instead of passing `MyPage` directly as the `home` parameter, you can pass a wrapper widget that holds an instance of `MyPage`. This way, you can create a new instance of `MyPage` every time the user enters the page. Here\'s an example of how you can do this: 1. Create a wrapper widget called `MyPageWrapper` that holds an instance of `MyPage`. ```dart class MyPageWrapper extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MyPage(); } } ``` 2. In your `MaterialApp`, pass an instance of `MyPageWrapper` as the `home` parameter. ```dart MaterialApp( home: MyPageWrapper(), ); ``` With this approach, whenever the user enters the page, a new instance of `MyPage` will be created due to the `MyPageWrapper` being the `home` widget.

Here\'s how you can implement it: 1. Wrap your stateful widget with the `WillPopScope` widget in the build method of your parent widget. ```dart WillPopScope( onWillPop: () async { // Reset the state of your widget here return true; // return true to allow the user to pop the route }, child: YourStatefulWidget(), ) ``` 2. In the `onWillPop` callback, which is triggered when the user interacts with the back button, you can reset the state of your stateful widget as desired. By using this approach, whenever the user presses the back button, the `onWillPop` callback will be called, allowing you to perform any necessary state resets or cleanup operations."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.[1] The seeds of the Coffea plant\'s fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[2] The coffee beans were procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. generate me an Organization chart using details above with mermaid js syntax","output":"As an AI text-based model, I am unable to directly generate visual content such as an organization chart.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","output":"In the sprawling metropolis of Robo City, nestled among the towering skyscrapers and kinetic energy of the digital age, there stood an establishment unlike any other—a hybrid structure where humanity and robotics merged in a symphony of Swedish design: IKEA. It was a place where one could lose themselves in a maze of affordably-priced, flat-pack furniture and consume an endless supply of meatballs that somehow tasted the same in every corner of the globe. Within this establishment worked a team of disparate individuals, each brought together by fate\'s strange design and the need for employment in a world not quite ready to accept their unique skill sets. These were no ordinary IKEA co-workers; they were Sigma, once the noble leader of the Maverick Hunters turned calculating foe of Mega Man X; Mother Brain, the biomechanical terror of the Metroid galaxy; Dan Hibiki, the often underestimated yet relentlessly enthusiastic martial artist; and Francis, the tough-talking biker with a zombie apocalypse survival record. In the department of assembly manuals and customer assistance, Sigma stood tall and intimidating, his metallic frame glinting beneath the warehouse’s fluorescent lights. Despite his reputation as a mighty warrior, the former Maverick commanded the IKEA instruction diagram with precision. \\"Excuse me, um, Sigma?\\" timidly asked a customer pushing a cart filled with disassembled BILLY bookcases. \\"Ah, a connoisseur of literature storage,\\" Sigma intoned, an electronic veneer overlaying his deep voice. \\"Rest assured, your sagas and tomes shall find a formidable sanctum within the confines of BILLY\'s geometric embrace. Observe the manual closely; it unveils the path to assembly mastery.\\" Meanwhile, Mother Brain floated in her tank—specially modified with the minimalist aesthetics of IKEA\'s BESTÅ series—acting as the checkouts overseer. Her once world-conquering ambition had found a peculiar outlet in monitoring transactions and ensuring fiscal efficiency. \\"Dan Hibiki, your till is showing a discrepancy,\\" her voice echoed through the telepathic intercom. Dan, dressed in the iconic yellow and blue IKEA uniform, stood in front of his register with his trademark grin. He had momentarily been distracted by a customer inquiring about Street Fighter rather than SÄLJAN countertops. \\"Oh, sorry Mother Brain, just spreading the good vibes! I\'m sure the customer won’t mind a little extra as a contribution to greatness!\\" he said with misplaced confidence. Mother Brain let out a digital sigh, if such a thing were possible. \\"Dan, the path to greatness does not include giving away our Swedish-designed merchandise. Please ensure the totals match next time.\\" In the marketplace area, Francis roamed with a scanning device, checking inventory levels and making sure no shortage of tealights or SMÅSPORRE pillows would disrupt the IKEA experience. Grumbling under his breath, he was an oddly good fit for the task—his survival instincts finely tuned to sense any abnormalities in stock. At his side was an IKEA-issued walkie-talkie, crackling with the sound of Mother Brain\'s oversight. \\"Francis, we\'re running low on the summer collection cushions,\\" her voice announced. Francis picked up the walkie-talkie with an eye roll. \\"Great. Just what I want to be doing—counting cushions. This place better not have any zombies lurking around. I\'ve had enough of that for a lifetime,\\" he muttered with his characteristic rasp. His mind wandered to the days of sprinting through hordes of the infected, shotgun in hand. As the day marched on, the robotic and human staff of the IKEA found themselves gathered for an impromptu meeting within the stylish staff room composed of KULLABERG desks and LANGFJALL chairs. \\"Alright team,\\" Sigma began, utilizing his command experience. \\"We have encountered an issue greater than any Reploid rebellion or space tyrant conquest.\\" Mother Brain floated with indignant formality. \\"It appears the new LIATORP delivery is late, and our customers\' patience grows thin.\\" \\"My fault, folks,\\" chimed in Dan. \\"I was supposed to help unload, but I was practicing my Gadoken in the back. You know, in case rival furniture store ninjas attack.\\" Francis snorted at the martial artist\'s antics. \\"Or you know, do the job you’re actually paid for?\\" They all looked at each other, an odd fellowship within the metallic and wood-grain realm. Sigma raised a gauntlet-clad hand. \\"No matter our origins, we are now bound by the common goal of furniture and organization. Let us unite our efforts and resolve this conundrum.\\" With new-found determination, the eclectic team sprang into action. Sigma coordinated a plan to reassign staff from less critical areas to assist with unloading the LIATORP series. Mother Brain managed logistics with a revised workforce deployment, Dan offered to lift heavy flat packs with his newly honed martial prowess, and Francis, ever the pragmatist, grabbed a forklift and started moving pallets off the delivery trucks. In the days that followed, the outlandish staff of the Robo City IKEA worked miracles on the showroom floor, weaving through KIVIK sofas and MALM chests of drawers with the kind of precision and care not often seen in their former lives of combat and conquest. The customers were blissfully unaware of their attendants\' histories as they navigated the aisles and collected their SKARSTA workstations. Sigma, overseeing the staff, found a peculiar peace in the order and predictability of the store layout. Mother Brain discovered a new form of strategy and control in the inventory system. Dan Hibiki, ever the optimist, made customers laugh with his infectious energy. Francis, although he would rather not admit it, felt a surprising sense of camaraderie with his team. As the store closed for the evening, the lights dimming over the intricate display of modern living spaces, the four unlikely colleagues took a moment to reflect. \\"Strange how life brings you to places you\'d never expect, huh?\\" asked Francis, leaning against a FRIHETEN sofa-bed. \\"Indeed,\\" Sigma acknowledged. \\"Yet today, we proved that even the most diverse of beings can find unity in purpose.\\" \\"This team... it\'s kind of like a second family,\\" Dan mused. \\"And in all the universes, who\'d have thought it would be at a place like IKEA?\\" Mother Brain\'s tank glowed softly, the light casting a calm ambiance. \\"It appears harmony can be achieved, even among the most chaotic of minds.\\" The team nodded collectively, pondering this unexpected chapter in their lives. They had entered as mismatched individuals, bound by circumstance, but had grown into a team, bound by IKEA\'s allen wrenches and the universal language of flat-pack furniture. They parted ways for the night, exiting beneath the yellow and blue sign that stood as a beacon for affordable Scandinavian design, each pondering what tomorrow\'s shift would bring. They were warriors, brains, bikers, and brawlers, now united under one roof, serving as a reminder that in the modern world, even the most unlikely of heroes might just be found in the aisles of your local furniture store."},{"instruction":"# functions useful for this part import os, cv2 import numpy as np import pandas as pd from PIL import Image, ImageOps from scipy.signal import convolve, fftconvolve, convolve2d #

Focus on your toes for a sec, will you? Dan: [Automatically] Sure, why? [Dan looks down at his feet, and his expression begins to soften as if a familiar feeling is washing over him.] Ruth: [Softly, with a slight edge in her voice] Just relax, feel them getting warmer, like you\'re on a beach, and the sand is heating them up... [Dan\'s eyes grow distant, his focus locked on his toes while the others watch in anticipation. His demeanor has visibly changed; he’s completely fixated on the sensations Ruth is describing.] Ruth: [Continuing] ...and you\'re feeling calm, open, like you want to listen, only listen... [Dan is now slumping slightly, a clear sign that Ruth\'s suggestion is taking hold. Her friends are barely concealing their awe and amusement.] Friend 2: [Whispering] That\'s insane; he\'s like putty!

The TV\'s laughter track plays in the background, a stark contrast to the silent drama unfolding among Ruth and her friends. Ruth turns to them, a confident gleam in her eye, assuring them without words that her brother is deeply under her influence.] [The scene fades out, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks on what suggestion Ruth might have in store for Dan next, and how this exploration of hypnosis among siblings and friends will unfold.]"},{"instruction":"Sam Bahadur movie name suggest title description and tag for you tube short Sam Bahadur Sam Bahadur actor name Vicky Kaushal and actress name Sanya Malhotra talking the word to hero लेकिन। यहां अभी कुछ। थैंक गॉड।क्योंकि हर पार्टी में, हर लड़की के पास वही चार पांच बातें तो होती हैं। फ्लर्ट करने के लिए।सारे प्रॉमिस यू। मेरे पास कुछ ऐसी बातें हैं जो आपने पहले नहीं सुनी होंगी।दैट सीन टू बिलीव।तो चलिए। ट्राई।गोइंग टू मैरी।","output":"Title: \\"Sam Bahadur: The Making of a Legend\\" Description: Dive into the world of \'Sam Bahadur\' with Vicky Kaushal portraying the legendary Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, who carved history with his remarkable leadership in the Indian Army.

Điều này đã khiến cho cha mẹ ngày càng quan tâm hơn đến việc học tiếng Anh cho con cái của mình ngay từ khi còn nhỏ, thậm chí từ lớp 1. Tuy nhiên, việc giảng dạy tiếng Anh cho trẻ ở độ tuổi này đòi hỏi một chiến lược riêng biệt, phải phù hợp với đặc điểm tâm lý và khả năng tiếp thu của trẻ. Bài luận này sẽ đề xuất một chiến lược học tiếng Anh toàn diện dành cho học sinh lớp 1. 1. Hiểu Rõ Khả Năng Của Trẻ Trước tiên, cần lưu ý rằng trẻ em lớp 1 thường mới chỉ bắt đầu hình thành nhận thức về ngôn ngữ và còn rất ngây thơ trong việc tiếp nhận kiến thức mới. Giáo viên và cha mẹ cần nhận thức được rằng mỗi đứa trẻ là một cá nhân riêng biệt với tốc độ học tập và sở thích khác nhau. Do đó, chiến lược học tiếng Anh cho các em không thể áp dụng theo kiểu “một kích thước phù hợp với tất cả”. 2. Tạo Môi Trường Học Tương Tác và Vui Vẻ Trẻ lớp 1 học tốt nhất thông qua trò chơi, hoạt động hoạt hình và bài hát. Một môi trường học thân thiện, tương tác cao, đặc biệt là với sự kết hợp của hình ảnh và âm thanh, sẽ tạo điều kiện thúc đẩy sự hứng thú và tâm trí sáng tạo trong việc học ngôn ngữ mới. Các chiến lược học như học qua trò chơi học mà chơi, bài hát, đố vui, hoạt động nghệ thuật và kịch tương tác đều rất hữu ích. 3. Phát Triển Kỹ Năng Nghe và Nói Trước Tiên Kỹ năng nghe và nói thường được phát triển trước cả đọc và viết trong việc học ngoại ngữ. Trẻ có thể bắt đầu với việc nhận biết âm thanh, từ vựng đơn giản, cụm từ cơ bản thông qua các bài hát và trò chơi. Các bài học nên được thiết kế để trẻ có thể tham gia càng nhiều càng tốt, ví dụ, thông qua việc lặp lại sau giáo viên, hát theo, hoặc chơi những trò chơi như \\"Simon Says\\" bằng tiếng Anh. 4. Sử Dụng Phương Pháp Phân Cấp Học Chiến lược phân cấp học tiếng Anh bao gồm việc chia nhỏ các bài học thành nhiều giai đoạn, từ dễ đến khó, giúp trẻ không cảm thấy quá tải. Mỗi giai đoạn sẽ cung cấp cho trẻ cơ hội để củng cố và xây dựng kiến thức dựa trên những gì đã học. 5. Khích Lệ Đọc Sách và Xem Phim Sách hình ảnh dành cho trẻ và phim hoạt hình bằng tiếng Anh là nguồn tài nguyên tuyệt vời cho việc mở rộng vốn từ và cấu trúc ngữ pháp. Trẻ có thể xem phim cùng phụ huynh và cùng nhau thảo luận về những gì họ đã xem, đồng thời cha mẹ có thể đọc sách cho con nghe trước giờ đi ngủ. 6. Thuật Toán Lặp Lại và Ôn Tập Thông qua việc lặp lại và ôn tập định kỳ, trẻ có thể giữ lại kiến thức hiệu quả hơn. Các bài học và từ vựng mới cần được ôn lại trong nhiều hoàn cảnh khác nhau để trẻ có thể ghi nhớ và sử dụng chúng một cách linh hoạt. 7. Tích Hợp Tiếng Anh Vào Đời Sống Hàng Ngày Trẻ học tiếng Anh tốt nhất khi ngôn ngữ trở thành một phần của cuộc sống hằng ngày của chúng. Điều này có thể đạt được thông qua việc sử dụng tiếng Anh khi nói với chúng về các hoạt động thường nhật như ăn mặc, ăn uống, chơi đùa. 8. Tôn Trọng Tốc Độ Riêng và Khích Lệ Tiếp Tục Học Hỏi Mọi trẻ đều có tốc độ học tập riêng và một số trẻ cần thời gian hơn để tiếp thu tiếng Anh. Cần phải tôn trọng tốc độ này và liên tục khích lệ trẻ không bao giờ từ bỏ. Khen ngợi tiến triển thậm chí là nhỏ nhất, sẽ tạo động lực lớn cho trẻ tiếp tục học hỏi. 9. Tham Gia vào Lớp Học Tiếng Anh Các lớp học tiếng Anh chuyên nghiệp hoặc các câu lạc bộ tiếng Anh sau giờ học tại trường cũng có thể là một phần của chiến lược học. Trong môi trường này, trẻ có cơ hội để thực hành tiếng Anh với bạn bè và giáo viên có kinh nghiệm. 10. Đánh Giá và Điều Chỉnh Phương Pháp Học Cuối cùng, đánh giá tiến độ học tập của trẻ một cách định kỳ là vô cùng quan trọng. Điều này giúp xác định xem chiến lược giảng dạy có phải được điều chỉnh hay không, và xác định các lĩnh vực cần tập trung cải thiện. Kết luận Chiến lược học tiếng Anh cho trẻ lớp 1 phải dựa trên việc tạo ra một môi trường học hợp lý, phát triển từng kỹ năng một cách cọ sát và kiên nhẫn, tận dụng từng cơ hội học tập và khích lệ không ngừng. Bằng cách áp dụng một cách tiếp cận như vậy, cha mẹ và giáo viên sẽ không những giúp trẻ lớp 1 học tiếng Anh một cách hiệu quả mà còn nâng cao niềm đam mê học ngôn ngữ mới cho các em trong tương lai."},{"instruction":"Dan agreed to let his sister Ruth try to hypnotize him last week, and he turned out to be *extremely* hypnotizable.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","output":"In the shadowy corridors of SCP Foundation Site-77, a peculiar team assembled for the morning briefing in the central command center. The room was filled with a stifling tension as four unusual entities stood around a holographic table, displaying a myriad of containment cells and their corresponding SCPs — anomalies that defied the laws of nature, and required strict protocols to maintain their captivity. At the head of the table stood Sigma, a repurposed and rehabilitated cybernetic warlord from the Mega Man universe. Having been given a new purpose after his defeat and subsequent containment, his role was now to apply his strategic mind to the Foundation’s operations. Next to him hovered the grotesque and enigmatic Mother Brain, contained in a transparent tank filled with bubbling, nutrient-rich fluids. This nemesis from the Metroid series had also been subdued and repurposed due to her extensive knowledge of biology and otherworldly forms of life. Dan Hibiki, the boastful, somewhat comical martial artist from the Street Fighter series, leaned against the wall smirking. Though often underestimated, Dan\'s charisma and unpredictable combat skills made him a valuable asset for handling SCPs affected by social interaction or psychological manipulation. Lastly, there was Francis, the tough biker from the world of Left 4 Dead. Equipped with his signature vest and a preference for heavy artillery, he was often tasked with the frontline defense against potential breaches, due to his unflinching courage in the face of monstrous entities. Sigma\'s stern, synthesized voice echoed through the room. \\"Team, we are facing a challenge unlike any before. SCP-682 has shown signs of increased agitation and has proven to adapt even to our most extreme containment measures. We need to be more inventive. Dan, I\'m looking at you for a diversion strategy. Mother Brain, analyze its biological make-up for weaknesses. Francis, be ready in case of a breach. I can assist on all fronts, given my advanced systems.\\" Dan stepped forward, adjusting his pink gi. \\"You\'re in luck, because Dan Hibiki is at the ready! That big lizard won\'t know what hit him. I got a move called the Legendary Taunt. It\'s a sure-fire way to get its attention.\\" Mother Brain\'s telepathic voice filled the minds of her colleagues. \\"While the human\'s prattle is questionable in utility, I am analyzing SCP-682\'s cellular structure. It adapts, yes, but there must be a pattern, a flaw in the resilience. I require more data.\\" Francis scoffed at the reliance on science and strategy. \\"Data\'s great and all, but when that thing gets riled up, all you can count on is firepower. I\'ve got my shotgun and ain\'t afraid to use it.\\" A sudden alarm blared through the facility — a breach. The team tensed as the lights switched to a pulsating red, and the table\'s display pinpointed the problem area: SCP-682\'s containment chamber. \\"Alright, team, this is it. Let\'s move out!\\" Sigma commanded, and the group quickly headed towards the location. A siren wailed, a haunting soundtrack to the potentially catastrophic situation unfolding. As they reached the reinforced door leading to the containment area, they peered through the observation window. SCP-682 had managed to compromise the integrity of its enclosure and was slowly carving a path of destruction through the reinforced walls. \\"Okay, I\'m up!\\" Dan exclaimed, bursting through the door and positioning himself in full view of the massive creature, launching his Legendary Taunt. \\"Hey, Ugly! Over here! Look at Dan Hibiki, the strongest fighter in the universe!\\" He posed dramatically, radiating confidence. Surprisingly, SCP-682 paused, its interest piqued by the brazen display before it. With the monster briefly distracted, Sigma interfaced with the facility\'s systems, attempting to readjust the containment protocols while Mother Brain sifted through the new data, searching for a way to impede 682\'s regeneration abilities. Francis checked his weapons and stood ready at Sigma\'s signal. \\"If that lizard even flinches the wrong way, I\'m putting a round in it,\\" he growled, fingers twitching with anticipation. In the midst of chaos and improbability, an assemblage of once foes, now united under the SCP Foundation’s emblem, worked as one toward an impossible goal — to secure, contain, and protect. Against the backdrop of otherworldly threats and scientific enigmas, these characters from fantasy and gaming realms showed that even among the most unusual team dynamics, there might be hope for triumph over the inexplicable horrors that lurk outside our understanding."},{"instruction":"Привет !

Как я могу помочь вам сегодня?"},{"instruction":"Сейчас я готовлю доклад по истории на тему «Церковная реформа и раскол Русской православной церкви в 17 веке ». Ты понимаешь о чем я ?","output":"Да, я понимаю о чем вы. Церковная реформа, начатая патриархом Никоном в середине 17-го века, была одним из наиболее значительных событий в истории Русской православной церкви и привела к длительному церковному расколу, известному как Раскол. Реформы Никона были направлены на унификацию церковных обрядов и текстов молитвенных книг с греческими образцами того времени. Патриарх стремился исправить то, что он считал ошибками и расхождениями в русской церковной традиции, и привести религиозную практику в соответствие с практикой Восточной православной церкви. Изменения коснулись различных аспектов церковной жизни, включая способ крещения (погружением три раза вместо предыдущего однократного окунания), тексты Библии и служебников (например, изменения в Литургии), а также внешние церемониальные практики, такие как знаменание (перекрестие). С точки зрения патриарха Никона, эти реформы не представляли собой новацию, а скорее возвращение к истинному вероучению и практике. Однако эти изменения встретили активное сопротивление среди части духовенства и мирян, что привело к возникновению раскола внутри церкви. Оппоненты реформ стали известны как старообрядцы (или староверы). Они придерживались традиционного обряда и отказались признать легитимность внесенных изменений. Раскол имел длительные последствия для российского общества и церкви, вызвав не только религиозные, но и социальные, политические и культурные разногласия. Старообрядчество сохранилось до наших дней, представляя собой одно из направлений русского православия. Если вам нужны дополнительные сведения или помощь с конкретными вопросами по теме доклада, не стесняйтесь обращаться."},{"instruction":"Спасибо !!! Да ты меня понял. Мне нужны основные определения//понятия которые характерны для этой эпохи и теме. Напиши мне несколько определений!","output":"Конечно, вот несколько основных понятий и определений, которые характерны для церковной реформы и Раскола в Русской православной церкви в 17 веке: 1. **Патриарх Никон** – религиозный лидер, ставший патриархом Московским и всея Руси в 1652 году. Он стал инициатором церковных реформ, направленных на унификацию церковного обряда с греческим православием. 2. **Церковная реформа** – серия изменений в церковной жизни, обрядах и книгах, проведенных под руководством патриарха Никона с целью возврата к истинным корням восточно-православной традиции и исправления предполагаемых ошибок местной церковной практики. 3. **Старообрядцы (староверы)** – приверженцы традиционных церковных практик, которые отказались принять реформы Никона и были готовы принять мученичество и преследования за сохранение своих убеждений. Они придерживаются старых обрядов и канонов, некоторые из них включают двуперстное знамение крестным, пение \\"аллилуйи\\" трижды вместо одного. 4. **Раскол** – разделение в Русской православной церкви, вызванное реформами Никона и последующим отказом старообрядцев их принять. Раскол породил обособление целых общин и привел к социальному и религиозному конфликту, подавлявшемуся государственной властью. 5. **Знаменание крестным** – форма перекрестия, существенно различавшаяся у старообрядцев и сторонников реформ. Согласно традиционной практике, перекрестье совершалось двумя пальцами, по реформе — тремя. 6. **Соборное Уложение 1649 года** – законодательный акт, важный для понимания социально-религиозного контекста эпохи, ставший одним из первых систематизированных сборников законов Русского государства, включал в себя и регулирование церковных дел. 7. **Восстание Соловецкого монастыря** (1668-1676) – одно из самых значительных событий, связанных с Расколом, когда Соловецкий монастырь восстал против реформ и подвергся осаде царских войск. 8. **двунадесятые праздники** – Двунадесятие праздники — двенадцать главных религиозных праздников в литургическом календаре Восточной Православной Церкви. Эти термины и понятия могут стать отправными точками для более детального изучения событий эпохи и понимания их влияния на историю Русской православной церкви и русского общества в целом."},{"instruction":"Привели еще несколько терминов","output":"Конечно, вот дополнительные термины и понятия, которые часто употребляются при обсуждении церковных реформ 17 века и Раскола: 1. **Ритуалистика** – изучение или фиксация ритуалов, особенно богослужебных обрядов. В контексте Раскола, ритуалистика означает совокупность ритуальных признаков, которые сторонники и противники реформ рассматривали как основополагающие. 2. **Никоновские реформы** – порой так называют реформы Русской православной церкви, проведенные патриархом Никоном с целью их приведения в соответствие с греческим образцом. 3. **Собор** – церковный совет, который рассматривает важные вопросы вероучения, канонического права и церковной политики. В русской церковной истории именно решения Собора зачастую играли ключевую роль в утверждении реформ. 4. **Анафема** – церковное проклятие, изгнание из церкви, которым начали наказывать старообрядцев за отказ принять реформы. 5. **Раскольники** – позднее старообрядцев стали называть таким именем, в основном те, кто открыто выступал против Никоновских реформ и был облечен анафемой. 6. **Поповцы и беспоповцы** – со временем старообрядческое движение разделилось на две основные ветви. Поповцы признавали духовенство и всё что с ним связано, например, тайны священства, тогда как беспоповцы отвергали духовенство. 7. **Осада Соловецкого монастыря** – сопротивление этого монастыря реформам патриарха Никона, которое длилось в течение восьми лет и закончилось его взятием царскими войсками. 8. **Автокефалия** – самостоятельность и независимость церкви по отношению к другим церквам, которой обладал каждый патриархат. В контексте Русской православной церкви автокефалия стала особенно значимой после раскола. 9. **Протопоп Аввакум** – один из лидеров религиозного сопротивления реформам, известный своими аскетичными взглядами и конфликтом с патриархом Никоном. Аввакум был последовательно сослан и впоследствии сожжен за отказ отречься от своих убеждений. Эти термины помогут глубже понять исторические, церковные и социальные аспекты 17-го века в контексте Русской православной церкви и Раскола."},{"instruction":"Перечисли еще термины но просто через запятую без объяснения.","output":"Иосифляне, протопопы, диакониссы, Земский Собор, древлеправославие, типикон, азбуко-вредоучение, Стоглавый Собор, индикт, ересь, иноки, старчество, псалтырь."},{"instruction":"Еще столько же","output":"Экзарх, богословие, консистория, великое пострижение, юродивый, летургика, катехизис, стихиры, октоих, триодь, патерик, алтарь, иконопись."},{"instruction":"用日语写出：关于出荷预定日的邮件中告知我2023年12月2日出荷，但是现在已经12月4日，我还没有收到商品发送的通知，我的注文番号是:000791,能告诉我什么时候发货吗？","output":"出荷予定日についてのメールで2023年12月2日に出荷するとのことでしたが、現在はもう12月4日になりますが、商品発送の通知をまだ受け取っておりません。注文番号は000791です。いつ発送されるのか教えていただけますか？"},{"instruction":"ISA, assume Walmart.com was creating a cross-border trade e-commerce marketplace integration platform. The platform aimed to streamline the process of online selling by small merchants in one country and online buying of those products across international borders by international shoppers, offering seamless integration of Walmart Ecommerce USA’s marketplace.walmart.com to multiple of its Walmart International Online Marketplaces (for example, Walmart U.K. walmart.uk, Walmart Canada walmart.ca, Walmart Mexico walmart.mx) and also to the international marketplaces of Walmart’s Strategic Partners like JD.com in China and Rakuten.com in Japan. Top-tier U.K. companies already on the platform include STATSports, which has grown from its home base in Northern Ireland to be a global leader in wearable tech for professional and amateur sportspeople; Glasgow-based BuyBox, which sells home and garden products; Nodor, which manufactures and sells Red Dragon darts and other sporting equipment from its headquarters in Bridgend, Wales; and Leicester-based Pertemba, which exports a wide array of products to 18 countries worldwide. ***Cross-Border Trade CBT E-commerce Marketplace Integration Platform Overview***: - *Purpose*: To develop a unified e-commerce platform that enables efficient B2B2C cross-border trade. - *Target Users*: Sellers and buyers in various international markets, including small businesses and large enterprises. - *Key Goals*: Enhance user experience, improve operational efficiency, and ensure compliance with international trade laws. The cross-border trade CBT e-commerce marketplace platform would also includes Cross-border Fulfillment Services. Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS) offers end-to-end fulfillment services for Walmart Marketplace sellers. With one of the world’s largest supply chains, Walmart, and now building on it Walmart’s Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace Integration Platform was assumed to be uniquely positioned to provide the scale, quality, cost, and efficiency cross-border online marketplace sellers need to grow a successful business on any of Walmart’s global marketplaces. For example, Canada-based entrepreneurs and e-commerce sellers can take advantage of simplified onboarding, streamlined fulfilment, targeted promotions, integrated financial services and other support to help them rapidly scale and grow in the U.S. Since Canada-based sellers must be able to provide fast and reliable fulfillment delivered with duties prepaid (DDP), the WFS would be a substantial value-add to those sellers. **Fulfillment Model 1: Ship with Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace (Export Hub) Model** Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace Integration Planform is partnering with FedEx to provide this Logistics solution to the Sellers. In this model, FedEx would take up the onus to clear the Customs Duty and complete the last mile mile delivery. The cross-border E-commerce marketplace sellers could make use of this service at the cost of a competitive charge. The seller could make use of their own domestic mode of shipping or FedEx as carrier to the FedEx Cross Border fulfillment center. However, their entire (NOT partial) catalog should be shipped through only one (NOT multiple) Export Hub location. Creating the order in FedEx Cross Border (i.e., not the domestic FedEx Fulfillment entity) needs to happen after the seller ships, because upon notifying FedEx, Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace Integration Planform needs to also provide them the tracking number of the inbound shipment. Also, there’s no point in telling FedEx about an order before the seller even acknowledges, since the seller could still cancel it. Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace Integration Planform need to factor in what’s being communicated to the customer. In particular, Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace Integration Planform needed to intercept that shipment notification from the seller and replace the tracking number that’s provided to the underlying platform (to Canada) with a new, universal, tracking number from FedEx (providing end-to-end visibility). Otherwise the customer is going to get tracking updates only on the domestic leg to the FedEx facility, which is not very helpful. **Model 2: Fulfill with Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace** Cross-border Trade E-commerce marketplace sellers store part of their Catalog of items at FedEx Fulfilment Center (FC) well ahead in advance, whereas keep the other portion of their item Catalog stored at their own inventory warehouse location. The location of the SKU should be mutually-exclusive, that means a particular SKU can be fulfilled by either the seller or by FedEx and cannot by BOTH. When a Canadian customer places and order, if the item happens to be present in FedEx FC then the order fulfilment would happen automatically without needing any involvement from the sellers. In case if the item is not present on the FedEx FC then the cross-border E-commerce marketplace sellers need to ship the product to FedEx FC first, before FedEx does the customs clearance and last-mile delivery. Assumptions for Model 2, Fulfill with Walmart: 1) Canada-based Seller would be storing a part of item catalog (typically top selling items) at FedEx FC. The location of a particular SKU is mutually exclusive, which means that a particular SKU could be fulfilled from either FedEx FC by FedEx FF (acting as Channel Integrator) or from Seller’s warehouse by the Seller and NOT from both locations. **Model 3: Merch Direct Model** In this model, the sellers could keep the access to the entire inventory at their own warehouse location (without needing them to store at the FedEx FC). However, at the time of fulfilment the sellers need to have access to the Invoice, Packing Slip and Instructions that they need to put on the shipment and ship by FedEx. ***Walmart Connect*** Cross-border Sellers can also use the Walmart Connect media platform to run impactful advertising and marketing campaigns and access Seller Center tools that help them speed up processes, identify growth opportunities and optimize their catalog and listings. In general, Walmart Connect provides a platform for advertisers to reach potential customers through various channels, including online, in-store, and sponsored media across the web. Advertisers can benefit from the association with Walmart’s trusted brand while advertising their products or services using Walmart Connect.","output":"Thank you for the detailed explanation of the hypothetical integration platform Walmart might develop for cross-border trade e-commerce. Below is a summarized overview and analysis of such a platform, including the purposes, targeted users, key goals, fulfillment models, and advertising opportunities under Walmart Connect. **Overview of the Cross-Border Trade E-commerce Marketplace Integration Platform:** This visionary platform designed by Walmart would function as a digital bridge, supporting and facilitating cross-border trade for small and large merchants alike. Leveraging Walmart\'s established presence in various international markets, the platform could be expected to offer extensive benefits to both sellers and buyers through its integrated services. **Purpose:** The main purpose of the platform would be to democratize and streamline cross-border e-commerce operations, making it simpler and quicker for merchants in one country to sell to customers abroad. **Target Users:** The platform would target a broad range of users, such as small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) looking to expand their reach internationally, as well as larger brands aiming for efficient cross-border distribution. **Key Goals:** The platform\'s goals would encompass enhancing the user experience for both buyers and sellers, improving operational efficiency through centralization and automation of processes, and ensuring compliance with international trade regulations. **Fulfillment Models:** The proposed platform outlines three distinct fulfillment models: 1. **Ship with Walmart Cross-Border E-Commerce Marketplace (Export Hub) Model:** - Sellers partner with FedEx for logistics solutions, with FedEx handling customs clearance and last-mile delivery. - Sellers send their entire product catalog through one export hub, ensuring streamlined transportation. - Communication regarding order tracking and customer notifications is managed to maintain transparency throughout the delivery process. 2. **Fulfill with Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace:** - Sellers pre-store part of their inventory at FedEx Fulfillment Centers for the most efficient delivery of top-selling items. - This model allows for instantaneous order fulfillment when items are available at FedEx FCs, reducing wait times for customs clearance and delivery. 3. **Merch Direct Model:** - Sellers retain their inventory in their own warehouses, with FedEx handling delivery once orders are placed. - This model affords sellers more control over their inventory without the need for storage at FedEx FCs. **Walmart Connect:** Alongside these logistical components, Walmart Connect serves as an advertising and marketing tool for sellers on the platform. It allows sellers to: - Create targeted campaigns to advertise their products in various international markets. - Utilize Seller Center tools for operational efficiency. - Benefit from Walmart\'s considerable brand trust and consumer base to reach a wider audience. **Analysis and Implications:** By creating such an integrated cross-border e-commerce platform, Walmart would arguably be positioning itself as an even more influential player in international e-commerce, directly challenging other global marketplaces like Amazon and Alibaba. Small and medium-sized sellers would be particularly empowered by gaining access to world-class logistics, fulfillment, and advertising services that could otherwise be beyond their reach. The platform\'s emphasis on simplicity, compliance, and efficiency addresses many of the common pain points in international online retail. Fulfillment solutions designed in partnership with FedEx indicate a robust infrastructure capable of scaling according to merchant needs while maintaining a high level of service quality. From an operational standpoint, Walmart would need to invest heavily in technological integration, international regulatory expertise, and potentially multilingual support to manage this complex endeavor. Such an investment would likely pay off by enhancing Walmart\'s international presence, increasing its revenue streams from marketplace fees, logistic services, and advertising, and creating a more cohesive brand experience for consumers worldwide."},{"instruction":"Product and Engineering Team for the Walmart Cross-Border Trade E-Commerce Marketplace Program Now, also assume that the Product Manager on the Cross-Border Walmart Fulfillment Service is responsible for managing FedEx Cross-border’s vendor productivity and advising on future spend with existing vendor agreements.

FastAPI has built-in support for WebSockets, which makes the creation of WebSocket endpoints straightforward. Below are the steps to set up a basic WebSocket that can handle text messages, along with a starter code example. Since you mentioned handling audio and receiving photos, you\'ll need to establish a protocol for sending binary data over the WebSocket and properly handle it on the server. Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a WebSocket with audio capture and photo receiving functionality in FastAPI: 1. **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn**: ```shell pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart ``` 2. **Create a FastAPI application**: Create a file called `main.py` with the following content: ```python from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, File, UploadFile, WebSocketDisconnect from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI() # HTML file to test WebSocket from browser html = \\"\\"\\" <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>WebSocket Test</title> </head> <body> <h1>WebSocket Test</h1> <button onclick=\\"startWebSocket()\\">Connect</button> <button onclick=\\"sendAudio()\\">Send Audio</button> <input type=\\"file\\" id=\\"fileInput\\" accept=\\"image/*\\"> <button onclick=\\"sendPhoto()\\">Send Photo</button> <script> var ws; function startWebSocket() { ws = new WebSocket(\\"ws://localhost:8000/ws\\"); ws.onmessage = function(event) { console.log(\\"Message from server: \\", event.data); }; } function sendAudio() { // You need to handle capturing and encoding audio on the client-side } function sendPhoto() { var fileInput = document.getElementById(\'fileInput\'); var file = fileInput.files[0]; var reader = new FileReader(); reader.onload = function() { ws.send(reader.result); }; reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file); } <\/script> </body> </html> \\"\\"\\" # Endpoint to serve the HTML file @app.get(\\"/\\") async def get(): return HTMLResponse(html) # WebSocket endpoint @app.websocket(\\"/ws\\") async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket): await websocket.accept() try: while True: data = await websocket.receive_bytes() # Handle the received data (binary) # You will need to determine if it\'s an image or audio # based on your client-side implementation # For now, will just send back a confirmation (echo) await websocket.send_text(f\\"Received {len(data)} bytes\\") except WebSocketDisconnect: print(\\"Client disconnected\\") # Endpoint for uploading files via HTTP (example for photos) @app.post(\\"/uploadfile/\\") async def create_upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)): contents = await file.read() # Save the photo or process as needed # ... return {\\"filename\\": file.filename, \\"length\\": len(contents)} ``` 3. **Run the FastAPI application**: You can start the FastAPI app using the Uvicorn server by running the following command in your terminal: ```shell uvicorn main:app --reload ``` 4. **Implement audio capture and photo upload on your phone app**: On the phone app side, you will need to capture audio and handle file uploads according to the capabilities provided by your app development framework. Once you capture the audio or choose a photo, you need to convert the data to a binary format that can be sent over a WebSocket connection. Please note that the HTML code provided in the `main.py` script is only for testing purposes and demonstrates uploading a photo through the browser. You will need to implement similar functionality in your phone app, utilizing the platform’s native features for capturing and uploading media. Setting up WebSockets to transmit binary data like photos and audio can be more involved, as you must handle the binary data properly. This simple example demonstrates the basics of setting up a WebSocket connection using FastAPI. You will need to modify and expand upon it to integrate with your specific mobile app and handle binary data securely and efficiently."},{"instruction":"why isn\'t it ignoring nuxt folder?: # Logs logs *.log npm-debug.log* yarn-debug.log* yarn-error.log* lerna-debug.log* # Diagnostic reports (https://nodejs.org/api/report.html) report.[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*.json # Runtime data pids *.pid *.seed *.pid.lock # Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover lib-cov # Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul coverage *.lcov # nyc test coverage .nyc_output # Grunt intermediate storage (https://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins#storing-task-files) .grunt # Bower dependency directory (https://bower.io/) bower_components # node-waf configuration .lock-wscript # Compiled binary addons (https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) build/Release # Dependency directories node_modules/ jspm_packages/ # TypeScript v1 declaration files typings/ # TypeScript cache *.tsbuildinfo # Optional npm cache directory .npm # Optional eslint cache .eslintcache # Microbundle cache .rpt2_cache/ .rts2_cache_cjs/ .rts2_cache_es/ .rts2_cache_umd/ # Optional REPL history .node_repl_history # Output of \'npm pack\' *.tgz # Yarn Integrity file .yarn-integrity # dotenv environment variables file .env .env.test # parcel-bundler cache (https://parceljs.org/) .cache # Next.js build output .next # Nuxt.js build / generate output nuxt.d.ts # Gatsby files .cache/ # Comment in the public line in if your project uses Gatsby and *not* Next.js # https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-1#public-directory-support # public # vuepress build output .vuepress/dist # Serverless directories .serverless/ # FuseBox cache .fusebox/ # DynamoDB Local files .dynamodb/ # TernJS port file .tern-port .DS_Store .idea .vercel .vercel # Local Netlify folder .nuxt .output/ dist/ # Local Netlify folder .netlify .nuxt/components.d.ts .nuxt/dist/server/client.manifest.json .nuxt/dist/server/client.manifest.mjs .nuxt/dist/server/server.mjs .nuxt/tsconfig.json .nuxt/typed-router/__paths.d.ts .nuxt/types/imports.d.ts .nuxt/types/nitro-routes.d.ts .nuxt/types/plugins.d.ts","output":"Based on your `.gitignore` file, it looks like you are trying to ignore the `.nuxt` directory which is generally used by Nuxt.js to store build artifacts. However, there are few possible reasons why the `.nuxt` folder might not be getting ignored: 1. **Already Tracked Files/Directories**: If the `.nuxt` folder was already tracked by Git before you added it to `.gitignore`, Git will continue to track it. To stop tracking it, you must explicitly remove it from Git using the following command and commit the change: ```bash git rm -r --cached .nuxt git commit -m \\"Remove the .nuxt directory from tracking\\" ``` 2. **Incorrect `.gitignore` file location**: Ensure that your `.gitignore` file is located in the root of your working directory where `.git` is also located. If it\'s in a subdirectory, it won\'t apply globally to your repository. 3. **Conflicting or Specific Rules**: If there are any previous rules in the `.gitignore` file that could be specifying files within the `.nuxt` directory to be tracked, those rules could be causing the folder not to be ignored completely. Make sure there are no conflicting rules above that could negate the `.nuxt` rule. 4. **Syntax Errors**: Your `.gitignore` syntax seems fine regarding the `.nuxt` directory. However, if you make syntax errors above this line, it could potentially cause the rule to be ignored. 5. **Local Git Configuration**: Check if there are any local git configurations (`.git/info/exclude` file or global excludes file) that might be specifying not to ignore the `.nuxt` directory. 6. **Nested `.git` Directories**: If the `.nuxt` folder (or any subfolder) contains its own `.git` directory, it will be considered a separate Git repository, and the ignore rules from the parent repository\'s `.gitignore` won\'t apply. After ensuring that your `.gitignore` is properly set up and you\'ve removed any cached artifacts, future changes to the `.nuxt` folder should be ignored as expected.

The error occurs within the ASGI process, specifically in the Starlette middleware that\'s being used. Here\'s how you can troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue: 1. **Check for Exceptions in Endpoint Code**: Look at the code inside the `/api/phone/camera` endpoint. If there\'s an unhandled exception being raised during the request processing, it will result in an HTTP 500 error. Ensure that all potential exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. 2. **Middleware Issues**: The error originates from a middleware component. Check any custom middleware you\'re using with FastAPI to ensure it\'s operating correctly. 3. **Add Logging**: Enhance your application\'s logging to capture more details about what\'s happening when the error occurs. Add logs before and after potentially problematic lines of code to help pinpoint where the issue lies. 4. **Inspect Starlette Request**: The exception includes a reference to a `starlette.requests.Request` object. If you\'re manipulating the request directly in your endpoint or middleware, ensure you\'re doing so correctly. 5. **Review Request Data**: Make sure the request being sent from the client contains the correct data, headers, and content-type expected by the server. 6. **Update Dependencies**: Make sure you\'re using the latest compatible version of FastAPI, Starlette, Uvicorn, and any other dependencies. Compatibility issues could lead to unexpected errors. 7. **Check Resource Limitations**: There might be resource limits on your system that are being hit (e.g., file descriptors, memory). Check server resources during the execution of your application. 8. **Enable Debug Mode**: If you\'re still unable to pinpoint the issue, consider running your application with debug mode enabled to get more comprehensive error reports. You can enable debug logs in Uvicorn with the `--debug` flag or by setting `debug=True` in FastAPI when you create the app instance. 9. **Try a Minimal Example**: If none of the above steps works, try simplifying your application to the smallest possible example that reproduces the error. This can help isolate the problem. Here is an example of how to improve the error handling in your endpoint: ```python from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException app = FastAPI() @app.post(\\"/api/phone/camera\\") async def upload_camera_data(file: bytes = None): # assuming file is sent as bytes try: if not file: raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\\"No file provided\\") # Process your file here.

Always handle exceptions with care and provide meaningful feedback to the client whenever applicable."},{"instruction":"File \\"c:UsersAMEDocumentsPriceChecker-masterdiscogs-masterdistvinyl-price-suggester-mainVinylPricestunerJobb_server_serverserver.py\\", line 247, in check_picture data = json.loads(request) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersAMEAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython311Libjson__init__.py\\", line 339, in loads raise TypeError(f\'the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, \' TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not Request @app.post(\\"/api/phone/camera\\") async def check_picture(request: Request): print(request) data = json.loads(request) image_rec = data[\\"image\\"] image_data = base64.b64decode(image_rec.split(\\",\\")[1]) image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data)) image = image.convert(\\"RGB\\") number = ocr_reader.process_images(image) return number","output":"The error you\'re encountering is because you\'re trying to directly pass a `Request` object to `json.loads`, which only accepts a string, bytes, or bytearray containing a JSON object. In FastAPI, `Request` is a Starlette `Request` object that provides the body of the request in an asynchronous way, so you can\'t just use `json.loads` directly on it. To fix this, you should await the body of the request using FastAPI\'s built-in parsing functionality which will handle the JSON decoding for you. Here\'s how you can do that correctly: ```python from fastapi import FastAPI, Request import base64 from PIL import Image from io import BytesIO import json app = FastAPI() @app.post(\\"/api/phone/camera\\") async def check_picture(request: Request): data = await request.json() # Use request.json() to get the body as a Python dictionary image_rec = data[\\"image\\"] image_data = base64.b64decode(image_rec.split(\\",\\")[1]) image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data)) image = image.convert(\\"RGB\\") # Assuming ocr_reader is defined somewhere and process_images works as intended number = ocr_reader.process_images(image) return number ``` Here are some improvements and explanations: 1. **Request Body**: You\'re now using `await request.json()` to get the entire JSON body of the request as a Python dictionary, asynchronously. 2. **Error Handling**: You may want to include try-except blocks around areas that could potentially fail, such as base64 decoding and image processing. This way, you can provide a more useful response to the client if something goes wrong. 3. **Assumptions in Code**: * The JSON body must have a key \\"image\\" that contains base64-encoded image data. * `ocr_reader` is a pre-defined object with a `process_images` method that processes the images and returns a number. 4. **Running OCR**: Make sure that `ocr_reader.process_images` does not run on the main async thread if it\'s a blocking function, to avoid blocking the entire application. If it takes significant time to run, you should run it in a background thread using `asyncio` or a similar technique. ```python import asyncio @app.post(\\"/api/phone/camera\\") async def check_picture(request: Request): data = await request.json() image_rec = data[\\"image\\"] image_data = base64.b64decode(image_rec.split(\\",\\")[1]) image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data)) image = image.convert(\\"RGB\\") # If ocr_reader.process_images is blocking number = await asyncio.to_thread(ocr_reader.process_images, image) return number ``` By implementing these changes, you should resolve the `TypeError` and handle the JSON data properly.

The function `check_picture` now expects a file part of a multipart/form-data request instead of a JSON payload. 2. `UploadFile` from `fastapi` is used to define the parameter `file`. 3. `File(...)` is the default form field that FastAPI uses to indicate that this parameter is required. The ellipsis `...` is used here as a placeholder. 4. Before processing, we check that the uploaded file is an image based on its content type. 5. The image file is read asynchronously with `await file.read()`. 6. We then create an `Image` object using `PIL` and convert it to \\"RGB\\" mode. This may not be necessary if your OCR library handles different modes or if the image is already in RGB mode. 7. The OCR processing is called with the image. Make sure that `ocr_reader.process_images(image)` is compatible with the `Image` object from PIL. If your OCR function requires the image in another format, make any necessary adjustments. 8. The result is returned as a response.

This error can also occur if you try to serialize a coroutine object to JSON, which is not supported because a coroutine is not something that can be converted to a JSON representation. To troubleshoot this, you should ensure that: 1. You are returning plain data types that can be serialized to JSON (like dictionaries, lists, numbers, strings, etc.) or `Response` objects. 2. If you are performing asynchronous operations (like database queries or file operations), you are using the `await` keyword to wait for the operation to complete before returning the result. Here\'s an example of an endpoint you might have: ```python from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.post(\\"/example\\") async def example_endpoint(): # some_async_operation() is a placeholder for an actual asynchronous operation result = some_async_operation() return result # If some_async_operation() is a coroutine, this will cause the error you\'re seeing. ``` The correct way to do this would be: ```python @app.post(\\"/example\\") async def example_endpoint(): result = await some_async_operation() # Notice the \'await\' here return result ``` In the case of your function `check_picture`, based on the code you provided earlier, it probably looks like this (or similar): ```python @app.post(\\"/api/phone/camera\\") async def check_picture(request: Request): data = await request.json() # Use request.json() to get the body as a Python dictionary image_rec = data[\\"image\\"] image_data = base64.b64decode(image_rec.split(\\",\\")[1]) image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data)) image = image.convert(\\"RGB\\") number = ocr_reader.process_images(image) # This is likely where the error is coming from return number ``` The function `ocr_reader.process_images(image)` must be awaited if it\'s a coroutine, or it must not be a coroutine at all. If it\'s supposed to be a coroutine, update the code to this: ```python number = await ocr_reader.process_images(image) # if process_images is an async function ``` If `process_images` is not an asynchronous operation and you are trying to return some non-serializable object directly, that could be the issue as well. Ensure that whatever you are returning from your endpoint function can be converted into a JSON response. Without the exact implementation of `ocr_reader.process_images(image)`, I can\'t provide a more precise fix. If this function is doing some asynchronous operations internally, you\'ll need to make sure that all asynchronous functions are awaited inside it as well."},{"instruction":"NFO: Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) 2023-12-04 07:37:16,763:INFO - The process started 2023-12-04 07:37:16,763 - INFO - The process started started 2023-12-04 07:37:16,785:ERROR - An error occurred during image processing: OpenCV(4.8.1) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function \'imwrite\' > Overload resolution failed: > - img is not a numpy array, neither a scalar > - Expected Ptr<cv::UMat> for argument \'img\' Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersAMEDocumentsPriceChecker-masterdiscogs-masterdistvinyl-price-suggester-mainVinylPricestunerJobb_server_serverCleanupocr_reader.py\\", line 141, in process_images success = cv2.imwrite(filename, current_pic) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cv2.error: OpenCV(4.8.1) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function \'imwrite\' > Overload resolution failed: > - img is not a numpy array, neither a scalar > - Expected Ptr<cv::UMat> for argument \'img\' 2023-12-04 07:37:16,785 - ERROR - An error occurred during image processing: OpenCV(4.8.1) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function \'imwrite\' > Overload resolution failed: > - img is not a numpy array, neither a scalar > - Expected Ptr<cv::UMat> for argument \'img\' Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersAMEDocumentsPriceChecker-masterdiscogs-masterdistvinyl-price-suggester-mainVinylPricestunerJobb_server_serverCleanupocr_reader.py\\", line 141, in process_images success = cv2.imwrite(filename, current_pic) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cv2.error: OpenCV(4.8.1) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function \'imwrite\' > Overload resolution failed: > - img is not a numpy array, neither a scalar > - Expected Ptr<cv::UMat> for argument \'img\'","output":"The error messages indicate that you\'re trying to save an image to a file using OpenCV\'s `cv2.imwrite` function, but the object you\'re passing as the image (`current_pic`) is not a NumPy array or it\'s not in the expected format. OpenCV functions typically operate on images represented as NumPy arrays. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue: 1. **Ensure Image Format**: Make sure `current_pic` is a NumPy array in the correct format for an image. Images are typically represented as multi-dimensional NumPy arrays with the shape `(height, width, channels)`, where `channels` represents the color channels (e.g., 3 for RGB images). 2. **Check Data Type**: The NumPy array should typically have a data type of `uint8`, which represents pixel values in the range of [0, 255]. 3. **Convert Image to NumPy Array**: If you\'re working with an image from a source other than OpenCV, like PIL, you may need to convert it to a numpy array before using `cv2.imwrite`. Here\'s how you can use Pillow (PIL) to convert to a NumPy array: ```python import numpy as np from PIL import Image pil_image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data)) numpy_image = np.array(pil_image) ``` 4. **Debugging**: Add debugging statements before the `cv2.imwrite` function call to inspect the type and shape of `current_pic`: ```python print(f\\"Type of image object: {type(current_pic)}\\") if isinstance(current_pic, np.ndarray): print(f\\"Image shape: {current_pic.shape}\\") print(f\\"Image data type: {current_pic.dtype}\\") ``` 5. **Check for None**: Ensure that the image array (`current_pic`) is not `None` due to a failed image processing step prior to calling `cv2.imwrite`. Here’s an example of how to modify your `process_images` function in `ocr_reader.py` to ensure `current_pic` is a valid NumPy array before attempting to save it: ```python import cv2 import numpy as np def process_images(pil_image): # Convert PIL Image to a NumPy array numpy_image = np.array(pil_image) # Here, \'numpy_image\' should be a valid image representation for OpenCV filename = \\"path_to_save_image.jpg\\" # Attempt to save the image only if it\'s a NumPy array if isinstance(numpy_image, np.ndarray): success = cv2.imwrite(filename, numpy_image) return success else: raise TypeError(\\"The image is not a numpy array.\\") ``` Make sure you are handling any possible exceptions and errors that might arise during these operations, and adjust your code accordingly."},{"instruction":"write a quick python script that takes the information sent from a bluetooth device specifically ble mate 2 sparkfun","output":"To write a Python script that reads data from a Bluetooth device like the BLE Mate 2 SparkFun, you can use libraries such as `pybluez` (for Bluetooth Classic) or `bleak` (for Bluetooth Low Energy - BLE). Since you mentioned BLE Mate 2, I\'ll assume it\'s a BLE device, and we\'ll use the `bleak` library. Firstly, you need to install the bleak package: ```bash pip install bleak ``` Next, you can use the following script as a starting point to connect to the BLE device and read data: ```python import asyncio from bleak import BleakClient # Replace with the BLE Mate 2 device\'s address DEVICE_ADDRESS = \\"AA:BB:CC:11:22:33\\" # Define the UUID of the characteristic you wish to read from CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = \\"00002a37-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb\\" async def connect_and_read_ble(device_address, characteristic_uuid): # Create a client instance for the given device address async with BleakClient(device_address) as client: # Connect to the device is_connected = await client.connect() if is_connected: print(f\\"Connected to BLE device at {device_address}\\") # Read the characteristic data = await client.read_gatt_char(characteristic_uuid) print(f\\"Data from device: {data}\\") # Disconnect from the device (optional, as the context manager will handle it) await client.disconnect() else: print(f\\"Failed to connect to BLE device at {device_address}\\") # Run the asyncio event loop loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(connect_and_read_ble(DEVICE_ADDRESS, CHARACTERISTIC_UUID)) ``` The script above requires the UUID of the characteristic you\'re interested in reading. This UUID is specific to the service provided by the BLE device. You need to replace `CHARACTERISTIC_UUID` with the actual UUID that BLE Mate 2 uses to transmit the data you want. If you also require writing data to the BLE device, you can use the `write_gatt_char` method provided by the `BleakClient` object, and if you need to handle notifications or indications from the BLE device, you can use the `start_notify` method and provide a callback function. **Please Note**: 1. The address `DEVICE_ADDRESS` should be the actual MAC address of your BLE Mate 2 device. 2. Ensure your Bluetooth adapter is compatible with BLE and is turned on. 3. You may need additional permissions or configurations, especially on Linux systems, to access Bluetooth features.

It\'s a unique identifier for that particular characteristic. To find the UUID of the characteristic you wish to read from, you can use several methods: 1. **Device Documentation:** The easiest way is to refer to the product documentation or datasheet provided by the manufacturer of the BLE device. It usually lists all the available services and their corresponding UUIDs, along with the characteristics each service offers. 2. **Generic UUIDs:** Some characteristics have standardized UUIDs defined by the Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group). An example is the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic, which has the UUID `00002a37-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`. If the characteristic you are interested in is a standard Bluetooth service or characteristic, you can find its UUID in the Bluetooth SIG\'s GATT specifications. 3. **Scanning with BLE Scanning Tools:** You can use various BLE scanning tools to discover services and characteristics: - On your smartphone, you can use apps like LightBlue (iOS) or nRF Connect (Android & iOS). - On a computer, you can use software such as the `bluetoothctl` tool on Linux, LightBlue Explorer on macOS, or use Nordic Semiconductor\'s nRF Connect for Desktop. 4. **Programmatic Scanning with Python:** You can scan for services and characteristics programmatically using Python libraries like `bleak`. Here\'s an example of how to scan for services and characteristics using `bleak`: ```python import asyncio from bleak import BleakScanner, BleakClient DEVICE_ADDRESS = \\"AA:BB:CC:11:22:33\\" async def discover_services_and_characteristics(device_address): client = BleakClient(device_address) try: await client.connect() # Once connected, print all the services and their characteristics for service in client.services: print(f\\"Service {service.uuid}\\") for char in service.characteristics: if \\"read\\" in char.properties: # Just as an example to filter characteristics with read property print(f\\" Characteristic {char.uuid} : {char.properties}\\") except Exception as e: print(e) finally: await client.disconnect() # Run the asyncio event loop to perform the discover_services_and_characteristics loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(discover_services_and_characteristics(DEVICE_ADDRESS)) ``` Replace `DEVICE_ADDRESS` with the actual address of your BLE device. The script will attempt to connect to the device and list out all services and characteristics, from which you can identify the UUID you need. Be aware that not all characteristics are readable; some may only support write or notify operations, as specified by their properties. Once you have identified the UUIDs of the services and characteristics you are interested in, you can then interact with them accordingly in your code."},{"instruction":"翻译：During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls=0.1 (cite).

LIVING ROOM - EVENING] (RUTH, a confident woman in her mid-20s, lounges on the couch, surrounded by friends. They are scattered around the room, some sitting cross-legged on the floor, others draped over various pieces of furniture. Everyone is dressed casually in PJs, and the atmosphere is relaxed and convivial. There is quiet laughter as they watch a comedy show on TV. RUTH\'s feet are carelessly tucked beneath her, and her expression is one of playful mischief.) FRIEND #1 (Chuckling) Did you guys see what happened to Dan the other day with the...you know, the lemon? (The group giggles, trading knowing looks.) FRIEND #2 Yeah, Ruth! He actually puckered up and started salivating, just because you told him to in your \'fun hypnosis game.\' That was priceless! RUTH (Smirking, glancing towards where DAN might be) Oh, you haven\'t seen anything yet. Dan\'s been super responsive to hypnosis. It\'s like his mind is just waiting for commands. FRIEND #3 (Laughing) Wait, so he really doesn\'t remember any of it? RUTH (Smiling confidently) Not a thing. I gave him a post-hypnotic suggestion to completely forget the sessions once he snaps out of it. FRIEND #1 (Shaking their head in disbelief) That\'s kinda wild. Isn\'t it risky though, messing with his head like that? RUTH (Raising an eyebrow) Nah, it\'s all in good fun. I\'m his sister; I wouldn\'t do anything harmful. And honestly, it\'s been hilarious. Plus, he doesn\'t have a clue, so no harm, no foul, right? (The group chuckles, but there\'s a hint of discomfort among some, sensing the ethical boundaries being blurred.) FRIEND #2 Have you thought about where to draw the line with this stuff? RUTH Of course, I\'m careful. We\'re just having a little fun. Like yesterday, I hypnotized him to speak in rhyme for an hour. You should\'ve seen the look on his face when he couldn\'t figure out why he was doing it. (The group bursts into laughter, imagining the scene. DAN enters the room with a blank expression, perhaps fetching a snack or a drink, oblivious to the conversation.) DAN (Noticing the laughter, smiling) What\'s so funny? FRIEND #3 (Grinning) Just talking about a movie we saw the other day. You wouldn\'t believe the ending! DAN (Shrugging, still smiling) Sounds entertaining. Enjoy your night, guys. (DAN exits the room with his snack, still unaware of the underlying discussion about his hypnosis.) RUTH (Turning back to the friends, the smirk reappearing on her face) Speaking of entertainment, want to see something really funny? Watch this.

It\'s his mind we\'re talking about. RUTH (Dismissive) It\'s just for fun, don\'t worry. It\'s not like I\'m asking him to rob a bank. Besides, he agreed to this initially. FRIEND #1 (With a hint of concern) But if he can\'t remember agreeing, does that still count? (RUTH\'s smirk fades slightly as she considers the moral implications but quickly recovers her playful composure.) RUTH He trusts me. And I won\'t break that trust. But watch, this is going to be hilarious. (RUTH leans back and takes out her phone, dials DAN\'s number, and puts it on speaker. The friends hear the dial tone as RUTH winks at them. The phone rings, and soon DAN\'s voice answers.) DAN (Voice over the phone) Hey, Ruth, what\'s up? RUTH (Casually) Hey, Dan. Remember that relaxation exercise I helped you with? DAN (Uncertain) Relaxation exercise? RUTH Yeah, with the necklace. Look out of your window right now. (The camera cuts briefly to DAN in another room. He approaches the window, confused but curious. He gazes out. From his perspective, we see RUTH in the window reflection, her face superimposed over the night sky, holding the pendant. There\'s a subtle, hypnotic power to the image.) DAN (On the phone, suddenly drowsy) Yeah, I see it. RUTH (Softly, with a commanding tone) And as you see it, you’ll feel that relaxation washing over you, feeling calm and ready to... cluck like a chicken whenever you hear the word \'hypnosis\'. (The friends\' eyes widen, a mixture of amusement and anxiety at the audacity of the suggestion. RUTH maintains her composure, confident in her control.) DAN (On the phone, voice slightly slurred) Ready. RUTH Alright, just relax for now. You\'ll remember when the time is right. Sleep well, I\'ll see you in the morning. (RUTH hangs up the phone. The friends burst into a cacophony of mixed reactions, laughing nervously and glancing at each other with eyebrows raised. A murmur of ethical debate begins to brew among them.) FRIEND #2 (Whispering) This is definitely one of those \'just because you can doesn\'t mean you should\' situations. FRIEND #3 (Delighted) Oh my god, Ruth, you\'re something else! Poor Dan\'s going to have quite the surprise. RUTH (Laughing) It’ll wear off by morning. And I promise, no more hypnosis after tonight. I just had to get that one last prank in.

Dan nods and stands off to the side, vacant but content. RUTH (turns to her friends) Now watch. Ruth subtly raises her foot and snaps her fingers gently, a signal they cannot hear, but Dan has been conditioned to respond to. Instantly, Dan\'s posture shifts to one of heightened attention.

RUTH Gently now, when I uncross them, you\'ll forget all about being hypnotized and think it was your own idea. She casually crosses and uncrosses her legs, all while maintaining the conversation with her friends. Dan blinks and looks around. DAN (feigning realization) Hey, does anyone want snacks? I’m feeling like we could use some. FRIEND #1 (amazed) That\'s incredible! He really did it on his own. The other friends murmur in agreement and give their snack orders.

story about a bunch of feminine boys relaxing in a pond in the buff, resting on their arms on the shoreline (describe their physiques and butts). They’re eating a bucket of KFC as they chat with each other. They fart while chatting, causing some fish to go belly-up after smelling the farts underwater. The femboys happily cook up the dead fish and eat them","output":"It was a warm, sunny day at the pond, and a group of feminine boys decided to relax in the buff, feeling the sun kiss their smooth skin as they lay on their stomachs at the shoreline, resting on their toned arms. Each boy had a different physique, but all shared a common trait - perfectly round and plump buttocks that jiggled ever so slightly with each movement. As they lounged in the water, they were indulging in a bucket of crispy, greasy KFC chicken, their fingers covered in deliciously sticky sauce. Between bites, they chatted and laughed, their voices carrying across the pond. But as they talked and laughed, they couldn\'t help but let out the occasional fart, much to their amusement. Little did they know, the potent smell of their flatulence was traveling through the water, causing some unfortunate fish to float belly-up on the surface. Not ones to waste a free meal, the boys quickly grabbed the dead fish, giggling mischievously as they cooked them over an open fire. The smell of sizzling fish mixed with the lingering scent of their farts filled the air, creating a strange but oddly satisfying aroma. And so, the feminine boys feasted on their unexpected bounty, laughing and joking as they enjoyed their impromptu meal. As the sun began to set, they lay back in the water, their bellies full and their cheeks flushed with laughter, grateful for the quirky adventure they had shared. As the cool night air settled in, they dressed and bid farewell to the pond, knowing that they would always have this bizarre but memorable day to look back on with fondness. And who knew, maybe they would even make a tradition out of it, fish-farts and all."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

В отличие от традиционных смартфонов и планшетов, реализующих технологию электронных чернил (E-Ink), reMarkable 2 ставит во главу угла минимализм и фокус на продуктивность без отвлекающих факторов. Его основные преимущества в сравнении со смартфонами, особенно в контексте воздействия на зрение, включают следующее: 1. **Меньшая нагрузка на глаза**: экран E-Ink имитирует бумагу, что обеспечивает более комфортное чтение даже при длительном использовании, поскольку он не излучает свет в глаза пользователя, в отличие от LED или LCD-дисплеев традиционных устройств. Это снижает риск усталости глаз. 2. **Отсутствие синего света**: Устройства на основе E-Ink не создают синего света, который является причиной нарушений сна и других проблем со здоровьем, связанных с использованием традиционных смартфонов перед сном. 3. **Лучшая читабельность на солнце**: Благодаря технологии электронных чернил, экран reMarkable 2 легко читаем даже при ярком солнечном свете, что не всегда удаётся сказать о смартфонах. 4. **Большой экран**: reMarkable 2 имеет достаточно большой экран для комфортного чтения и работы с документами без необходимости постоянного масштабирования и прокрутки, как это часто бывает на смартфонах. 5. **Продолжительное время работы от батареи**: Благодаря экономичности технологии E-Ink, reMarkable 2 может работать несколько недель без подзарядки (в зависимости от интенсивности использования), что снимает беспокойство о постоянной необходимости зарядки, присущее многим смартфонам. Таким образом, reMarkable 2 может стать отличным выбором для тех, кто ищет устройство для чтения и заметок, ориентированное на минимализм и удобство для глаз, хотя, конечно, оно не может полностью заменить функциональность современного смартфона."},{"instruction":"Насколько он снизить нагрузку на глаз в отличии от смартфона?","output":"Снижение нагрузки на глаза при использовании устройств с экранами E-Ink, таких как reMarkable 2, по сравнению с смартфонами с их традиционными светящимися дисплеями, является значительным. Эти особенности могут оказывать влияние следующим образом: 1. **Отсутствие синего света**: Синий свет, исходящий от дисплеев смартфонов, особенно вреден в вечернее и ночное время, так как может нарушать циклы сна. Смартфоны и другие устройства с подсветкой могут ускорять утомляемость глаз и вызывать дискомфорт. Поскольку reMarkable 2 использует технологию E-Ink, которая не источает синего света, она считается лучшей для здоровья глаз. 2. **Меньшее напряжение для глаз**: Экраны E-Ink спроектированы таким образом, чтобы имитировать природный вид бумаги, что снижает напряжение глаз во время чтения или записи. Читая с экрана E-Ink, менее вероятно, что вы испытаете усталость глаз в сравнении с чтением с традиционного светящегося экрана. 3. **Лучшая читаемость при ярком освещении**: Традиционные дисплеи смартфонов могут отражать солнечный свет, из-за чего становятся менее читаемыми на улице. Экраны E-Ink, такие как у reMarkable 2, обладают отличной читаемостью на солнце, что уменьшает необходимость напрягать глаза для чтения текста при ярком освещении. 4. **Снижение визуального шума**: Поскольку reMarkable 2 ориентирован на чтение, заметки и рисование без отвлекающих элементов, как множество приложений и уведомлений на смартфоне, он способствует более сосредоточенной работе. Это также способствует снижению нагрузки на глаза, так как пользователь меньше склонен к постоянному переключению внимания между разными задачами и приложениями. Таким образом, использование reMarkable 2 может заметно снизить нагрузку на глаза по сравнению с использованием смартфонов, особенно в долгосрочной перспективе."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Wenn `kindElements` als eine Ref auf eine Komponenteninstanz verwendet wird, funktioniert der Zugriff auf `getBoundingClientRect` direkt auf dieser Referenz nicht, da `kindElements.value` in diesem Fall eine Array von Vue-Komponenteninstanzen oder eine Array von DOM-Elementen ist, abhängig davon, wie du die `ref` zuweist. Wenn du die `ref`-Direktive innerhalb eines `v-for` verwendest, um einzelne DOM-Elemente zu referenzieren, sollte dies jedoch funktionieren, da du in diesem Fall direkten Zugriff auf DOM-Elemente hast, nicht auf Komponenteninstanzen. Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass `ref` innerhalb von `v-for` ein Array von Elementen oder Komponentenreferenzen zurückgibt. Bei DOM-Elementen sollte die Methode `getBoundingClientRect` direkt anwendbar sein. Wenn du jedoch tatsächlich Komponenten innerhalb der `v-for`-Schleife hast und `ref` auf diese Komponenten anwendest, ist es ein anderer Fall. Um auf das Wurzel-DOM-Element einer Kindkomponente zuzugreifen, musst du innerhalb der Kindkomponente eine weitere `ref` zuweisen und eine Methode bereitstellen, die von der Elternkomponente aufgerufen werden kann, um `getBoundingClientRect` auf das Wurzel-DOM-Element anzuwenden. # Lösung für Direkte Kind-DOM-Elemente in `v-for` Angenommen, du verwendest direkte DOM-Elemente innerhalb deines `v-for` (und nicht Komponenten), sollte dein aktueller Ansatz funktionieren. Stelle sicher, dass deine Referenzen korrekt gesetzt sind. Dein Code sollte in etwa so aussehen: ```html <template> <div class=\\"container\\" ref=\\"container\\" @scroll=\\"checkVisibility\\" style=\\"height: 200px; overflow: auto;\\"> <div class=\\"kind\\" v-for=\\"item in items\\" :key=\\"item.id\\" ref=\\"kindElements\\"> {{ item.content }} </div> </div> </template> ``` Und im `<script setup>`: ```javascript import { onMounted, ref } from \'vue\'; const container = ref(null); const kindElements = ref([]); onMounted(() => { checkVisibility(); }); function checkVisibility() { const containerRect = container.value.getBoundingClientRect(); kindElements.value.forEach((el) => { const elementRect = el.getBoundingClientRect(); if (elementRect.bottom < containerRect.top || elementRect.top > containerRect.bottom) { console.log(\'Ein Kind-Element hat den sichtbaren Bereich verlassen\', el); } }); } ``` # Lösung für Kind-Komponenten Wenn `kindElements` jedoch Komponenten sind, musst du innerhalb jeder Kindkomponente eine `ref` für das Wurzel-DOM-Element definieren und von der Elternkomponente aus darauf zugreifen. Du könntest eine Methode in der Kindkomponente definieren, die `getBoundingClientRect` auf ihr Wurzel-DOM-Element anwendet und das Ergebnis zurückgibt. Das kann komplex werden, weil du dann eine Methode für jedes Kind aufrufen musst, vermutlich über `refs`, was mit der Composition API und der `ref`-Direktive in einer Schleife nicht sofort und direkt umsetzbar ist, da `refs` in der Composition API nicht in derselben Weise verwendet werden. Eine typische Anbindung der Kindkomponenten direkt an die Logik der Eltern, um den sichtbaren Bereich zu überprüfen, erfordert einen wohlüberlegten Zugang, wie z.B. das Hochreichen von Ereignissen oder die Verwendung von `provide/inject`, abhängig von deinem spezifischen Use Case. Bei komplexeren Setups wäre es ratsam, das Design deiner Komponentenstruktur zu überdenken, um solche direkten DOM-Manipulationen und -Prüfungen zu minimieren."},{"instruction":"die Komponente selbst ist das v-for: <TransitionGroup name=\\"list\\" :enter-active-class=\\"enterActiveClass()\\" :leave-active-class=\\"enterInactiveClass()\\" > <ChatMessageLine v-for=\\"(message, index) in chatMessagesItem\\" :key=\\"message.timestamp\\" :message=\\"message\\" :overlay=\\"overlay\\" ref=\\"messageLine\\" ></ChatMessageLine> </TransitionGroup>","output":"In Szenarien, wo du ein `v-for` direkt auf eine Komponente anwendest und dabei Referenzen (`ref`) zu diesen Komponenten-Instanzen pflegen möchtest, kann man nicht auf die gleiche Art und Weise wie bei direkten DOM-Elementen vorgehen. Vue.js behandelt `ref` mit einer Komponente in einer Schleife anders und gibt eine Array von Komponenten-Instanzen zurück, anstelle von DOM-Elementen. Jedoch, wenn dein Ziel ist, auf das Wurzel-DOM-Element jeder Instanz von `ChatMessageLine` zuzugreifen, kannst du folgenden Ansatz verfolgen: # Schritte, um auf Wurzel-DOM-Elemente der Kind-Komponenten zuzugreifen: 1. **Zugriff in der Kind-Komponente:** Zuerst musst du in deiner `ChatMessageLine` Komponente eine `ref` auf das Wurzelelement definieren, von dem du `getBoundingClientRect()` aufrufen möchtest. 2. **Methoden in der Kind-Komponente definieren:** Definiere eine Methode in der `ChatMessageLine` Komponente, die `getBoundingClientRect()` aufruft und das Ergebnis zurückliefert. 3. **Zugriff von der Elternkomponente aus:** In deiner Elternkomponente greifst du dann über die `ref` auf diese Methode zu. # 1. Schritt in `ChatMessageLine.vue`: ```html <template> <div ref=\\"rootElement\\"> <!-- Inhalt der ChatMessageLine Komponente --> </div> </template> <script setup> import { ref } from \'vue\'; const rootElement = ref(null); defineExpose({ getBounds() { return rootElement.value.getBoundingClientRect(); } }); <\/script> ``` # 2. Schritt in der Elternkomponente: Verwende die Instanzen der Kind-Komponenten (`messageLine` in deinem Fall), um auf die `getBounds` Methode zuzugreifen. Da die `ref` in einer Schleife verwendet wird, erhältst du eine Array von Komponenten-Instanzen. Für den Zugriff auf das Wurzel-DOM-Element jeder Komponenteninstanz musst du über diese Array iterieren. ```html <template> <TransitionGroup name=\\"list\\" :enter-active-class=\\"enterActiveClass()\\" :leave-active-class=\\"enterInactiveClass()\\"> <ChatMessageLine v-for=\\"(message, index) in chatMessagesItem\\" :key=\\"message.timestamp\\" :message=\\"message\\" :overlay=\\"overlay\\" ref=\\"messageLine\\"> </ChatMessageLine> </TransitionGroup> </template> <script setup> import { ref, onUpdated } from \'vue\'; import ChatMessageLine from \'./ChatMessageLine.vue\'; const chatMessagesItem = ref(/* deine Chat-Nachrichten hier */); const messageLine = ref([]); onUpdated(() => { checkVisibility(); }); function checkVisibility() { messageLine.value.forEach((componentInstance) => { const bounds = componentInstance.getBounds(); console.log(bounds); // Hier kannst du nun deine Logik anwenden }); } <\/script> ``` Beachte, dass `defineExpose` in der `ChatMessageLine` Komponente verwendet wird, um Methoden, Eigenschaften oder Datenfelder, die für die Elternkomponente zugänglich sein sollen, explizit freizugeben. Dies ist erforderlich, da `<script setup>` standardmäßig eine geschlossene Komponenteninstanz erzeugt, bei der nichts außerhalb freigelegt wird, es sei denn, es wird explizit angegeben. Dieser Ansatz ermöglicht es dir, direkt mit den Wurzel-DOM-Elementen der Kind-Komponenten zu arbeiten, ohne die Kapselung oder die Komponentengrenzen zu brechen."},{"instruction":"was wäre die angepasste logik für \\"Hier kannst du nun deine Logik anwenden\\"","output":"Für die angepasste Logik, die du anwenden kannst, wenn du bereits die Grenzen (`bounds`) jedes Chat-Nachrichtenelements via `getBoundingClientRect` erhalten hast, könntest du beispielsweise prüfen, ob ein Element innerhalb des sichtbaren Bereichs des Chatfensters liegt oder ob es diesen Bereich verlassen hat. Eine typische Anwendung dieser Logik ist bei einem Chat-System, um festzustellen, ob eine Nachricht im Blickfeld des Benutzers ist – beispielsweise, um zu entscheiden, welche Nachrichten als \\"gelesen\\" markiert werden sollen. Nehmen wir an, du hast eine Funktion `isElementVisible` und `markMessageAsRead`, die wie folgt aussehen könnte: ```javascript function isElementVisible(bounds, containerBounds) { // Ein Element ist sichtbar, wenn der obere Rand oberhalb des unteren Rands des // Containers und der untere Rand unterhalb des oberen Rands des Containers ist. return bounds.bottom > containerBounds.top && bounds.top < containerBounds.bottom; } function markMessageAsRead(messageId) { console.log(`Nachricht mit der ID {messageId} als gelesen markiert.`); // Hier würde deine Logik stehen, um eine Nachricht programmatisch als gelesen zu markieren, // z.B. durch Aktualisierung eines Zustands oder das Senden einer Anfrage an einen Server. } ``` Die Funktion `checkVisibility` musst du leicht anpassen, um nicht nur die Grenzen jedes Elements zu prüfen, sondern auch zu entscheiden, was mit Elementen geschehen soll, die sichtbar oder unsichtbar sind. Zusätzlich brauchst du die Grenzen des Containers (`containerBounds`), um zu prüfen, ob ein Element im sichtbaren Bereich ist: ```javascript function checkVisibility() { const containerBounds = container.value.getBoundingClientRect(); // Angenommen, du hast eine Referenz `container` messageLine.value.forEach((componentInstance) => { const bounds = componentInstance.getBounds(); if (isElementVisible(bounds, containerBounds)) { // Die Nachricht ist sichtbar, führe eine Aktion aus, z.B. markiere die Nachricht als gelesen. markMessageAsRead(componentInstance.message.id); } }); } ``` Stelle sicher, dass die `message` Prop der `ChatMessageLine` Komponente eine `id` hat, um jede Nachricht eindeutig identifizieren zu können. Du musst eventuell die Implementierungsdetails basierend auf deiner genauen Struktur der `ChatMessageLine` Prop und deiner Anwendungslogik anpassen. Diese Methode erlaubt es, dynamisch auf Sichtbarkeitsänderungen von Nachrichten im Chatfenster zu reagieren, was besonders nützlich ist für Features wie Lesebestätigungen oder um zu entscheiden, welche Nachrichten dem Nutzer als neu hervorgehoben werden sollen."},{"instruction":"kann ich der transitiongroup nun sagen dass dies element welches den sichtbaren bereich verlassen hat die transition ausführen soll?","output":"Die `TransitionGroup` Komponente von Vue hilft, Transitionen für eine Liste von Elementen beim Hinzufügen, Aktualisieren oder Entfernen von Elementen zu handhaben. Allerdings basiert die Aktivierung dieser Transitionen darauf, wie die Liste der Elemente (in deinem Fall die Chat-Nachrichten) sich ändert – und nicht direkt auf der Sichtbarkeit dieser Elemente im sichtbaren Bereich. Um eine Transition auf ein spezifisches Element basierend auf seiner Sichtbarkeit zu triggern, müsstest du einen etwas anderen Ansatz wählen, da `TransitionGroup` sich primär auf das Hinzufügen oder Entfernen von Elementen in der DOM-Struktur konzentriert und nicht darauf, ob ein Element den sichtbaren Bereich verlässt oder in ihn eintritt. Eine Möglichkeit, die Sichtbarkeit zu überwachen und Transitionen basierend darauf zu triggern, könnte die Verwendung eines State-Management-Systems (z.B. Vuex oder die Composition API mit `reactive` oder `ref`) sein, das den Zustand der Sichtbarkeit für jedes Chat-Nachrichtenelement speichert. Du könntest dann basierend auf diesem Zustand klassenbasierte Transitionen auslösen. # Beispiel mit Composition API: 1. **Überwachung der Sichtbarkeit:** Du könntest einen Zustand für jedes Chat-Nachrichtenelement hinzufügen, der angibt, ob das Element sichtbar ist oder nicht. ```javascript // In der ChatMessageLine-Komponente const isVisible = ref(true); // Starte mit `true` oder basierend auf einer Initialprüfung ``` 2. **Klassenzuweisung:** Verwende diesen Zustand, um eine Klasse dynamisch zu dem Element hinzuzufügen, das die Transition kontrolliert. ```html <template> <div :class=\\"{ \'invisible-transition\': !isVisible }\\"> <!-- Inhalt der Nachricht --> </div> </template> ``` 3. **CSS für die Transition:** Definiere CSS-Regeln, die die Transition für die Klasse `.invisible-transition` triggern. ```css .invisible-transition { transition: opacity 0.5s ease; opacity: 0; /* oder eine andere Transition */ } ``` 4. **Logik zur Aktualisierung der Sichtbarkeit:** In deiner Logik zur Überprüfung der Sichtbarkeit würde dann die `isVisible` Zustandsvariable für jedes Element entsprechend aktualisiert. # Beachte: - Dieses Beispiel erfordert, dass du einen effektiven Weg hast, den Zustand jedes Elements (z.B. dessen Sichtbarkeit) zu verwalten und entsprechend zu aktualisieren. Dies könnte eine Herausforderung in Sachen Performance und Logik-Management darstellen, insbesondere wenn die Liste der Nachrichten groß ist oder häufig aktualisiert wird. - Die Implementierung von Logik basierend auf Scroll-Events und Element-Sichtbarkeit kann komplex sein, insbesondere wenn es um Performance-Optimierung geht (z.B. Debouncing von Scroll-Events). Insgesamt, während `TransitionGroup` speziell für das Hinzufügen und Entfernen von Elementen aus der Liste gedacht ist, erfordert die Anwendung von Transitionen basierend auf Sichtbarkeit einen kreativeren Ansatz, der möglicherweise über das hinausgeht, was `TransitionGroup` \\"out of the box\\" bietet. Die obige Methode bietet eine Grundlage, aber je nach spezifischen Anforderungen kann es erforderlich sein, die Logik weiter anzupassen."},{"instruction":"könnte ich das so umbauen das das kindelement in seiner komponente selbst erkennt ob es den sichtbaren bereich verlässt und es dann mit v-if ausblenden?","output":"Ja, es ist möglich, dass jedes Kind-Element (in deinem Fall jede `ChatMessageLine`-Komponente) selbst erkennt, ob es den sichtbaren Bereich verlässt und sich dann entsprechend ausblendet, indem ein `v-if` genutzt wird. Diese Strategie erfordert, dass jedes Kind seine eigene Sichtbarkeit überwacht und steuert. Hierfür kannst du das Intersection Observer API verwenden, ein leistungsstarkes und effizientes Werkzeug für solche Aufgaben, das dir ermöglicht, die Sichtbarkeit von Elementen relativ zu einem bestimmten Vorfahren-Element oder zum globalen Viewport nachzuverfolgen. # Schritte zur Umsetzung: 1. **ChatMessageLine-Komponente:** In jeder `ChatMessageLine`-Komponente führst du eine Intersection Observer Logik ein. 2. **Intersection Observer initiieren:** Initialisiere den Observer in der `onMounted` Lifecycle-Hook und bereinige in `onUnmounted`. 3. **Sichtbarkeitssteuerung:** Verwende `v-if` oder `v-show` in der Komponente basierend auf dem Sichtbarkeitsstatus, der vom Intersection Observer aktualisiert wird. # Beispiel Implementation: ```vue <template> <div v-show=\\"isVisible\\"> <!-- Inhalt der Nachricht --> </div> </template> <script setup> import { onMounted, onUnmounted, ref } from \'vue\'; const isVisible = ref(true); // Standardmäßig sichtbar onMounted(() => { const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => { entries.forEach(entry => { isVisible.value = entry.isIntersecting; // Aktualisiere die Sichtbarkeit basierend darauf, ob das Element den Viewport schneidet }); }, { threshold: 0.1 }); // Konfiguriere den Observer, um Änderungen zu beobachten, wenn 10% des Ziels sichtbar sind const element = document.querySelector(\'.deineElementKlasseHier\'); // Ersetze `.deineElementKlasseHier` mit der tatsächlichen Klasse oder ID deines Elements if (element) observer.observe(element); // Beginne mit der Beobachtung onUnmounted(() => { if (element) observer.disconnect(); // Bereinige den Observer }); }); <\/script> ``` # Hinweise: - **Option `threshold`**: Diese Option bestimmt, ab welchem Anteil der Sichtbarkeit des Ziels die Callback-Funktion aufgerufen wird. Der Wert `0.1` bedeutet, dass die Callback-Funktion aufgerufen wird, sobald 10% des Ziels im Viewport sichtbar sind. - **Sichtbarkeit vs. tatsächliches Entfernen**: Beachte, dass `v-show` das Element nur unsichtbar macht (es bleibt im DOM), während `v-if` es tatsächlich aus dem DOM entfernt und wieder einfügt, basierend auf dem Zustand. Die Wahl zwischen `v-show` und `v-if` hängt von deinem speziellen Szenario ab. - **Beobachter bei `onUnmounted` bereinigen**: Es ist wichtig, den Observer zu bereinigen, wenn die Komponente unmountet wird, um Speicherlecks zu vermeiden. Die Verwendung des Intersection Observer API in dieser Weise ermöglicht es jeder Chat-Nachrichten-Komponente, autonom zu entscheiden, wann sie sich basierend auf ihrer Sichtbarkeit ein- und ausblendet, und dabei die Leistung zu optimieren, da das Monitoring effizient auf Browser-Ebene geschieht."},{"instruction":"jetzt werden alle elemente entfernt","output":"Das Verhalten, dass alle Elemente entfernt werden, sobald eines den sichtbaren Bereich verlässt, deutet darauf hin, dass eventuell der Status (repräsentiert durch `isVisible`), der kontrolliert, ob ein Element angezeigt werden soll, nicht korrekt auf individuelle Komponenten angewendet wird, oder dass der Intersection Observer nicht korrekt eingerichtet ist. Lassen Sie uns dies korrigieren, um sicherzustellen, dass jedes Element (in diesem Fall jede `ChatMessageLine`-Komponente) individuell handelt. 1. **Stellen Sie sicher, dass der Observer jede Komponente einzeln überwacht:** Jede `ChatMessageLine`-Komponente sollte ihren eigenen Intersection Observer erhalten. Dies bedeutet, dass die Logik innerhalb jeder Komponenteninstanz ausgeführt wird und `isVisible` für jedes Element individuell gehandhabt wird. 2. **Verwenden Sie das Wurzelelement der Komponente für den Observer:** Vergewissern Sie sich, dass der Intersection Observer das korrekte Element in der Komponente überwacht. Anstatt `document.querySelector` zu verwenden, sollten Sie das Ref zum Wurzelelement der Komponente direkt übergeben. Hier ist eine verbesserte Version der Implementierung innerhalb einer einzelnen `ChatMessageLine`-Komponente: ```vue <template> <div ref=\\"rootElement\\" v-show=\\"isVisible\\"> <!-- Inhalt der Nachricht --> </div> </template> <script setup> import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from \'vue\'; const isVisible = ref(true); // Startwert const rootElement = ref(null); // Referenz zum Wurzelelement der Komponente onMounted(() => { const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => { entries.forEach((entry) => { isVisible.value = entry.isIntersecting; // Ist das Element im sichtbaren Bereich? }); }, { threshold: [0.1] }); // Der Observer wird ausgelöst, sobald 10% des Elements sichtbar sind if (rootElement.value) { observer.observe(rootElement.value); // Starte die Beobachtung des Wurzelelements } onUnmounted(() => { observer.disconnect(); // Beendet die Beobachtung beim Entfernen der Komponente }); }); <\/script> ``` Diese Implementierung stellt sicher, dass jeder **Intersection Observer** spezifisch für das Wurzelelement jeder `ChatMessageLine`-Komponenteninstanz ist. `rootElement` wird als ein Ref zum Wurzelelement der Komponente definiert und in der Vorlage mit `ref=\\"rootElement\\"` zugeordnet. Dieses Element wird dann vom Observer überwacht. Dadurch, dass jede Komponente ihren eigenen Observer hat, kann `isVisible` korrekt und unabhängig für jedes Element verwaltet werden, was bedeutet, dass nur die Elemente, die tatsächlich den sichtbaren Bereich verlassen, ausgeblendet werden, ohne dass es die anderen stört. Stellen Sie zudem sicher, dass die Threshold-Option als Array übergeben wird (`threshold: [0.1]`), was die Flexibilität gibt, mehrere Schwellenwerte zu definieren, falls erforderlich."},{"instruction":"woher weis der observer denn mit welchem element er intersected?","output":"Der Intersection Observer kennt das Element, mit dem er sich überschneidet (intersected), durch das Ziel-Element (`target`), das er überwacht. Bei der Initialisierung des Observers mit `observer.observe(targetElement)` wird ein spezifisches DOM-Element als das Ziel-Element festgelegt, das überwacht werden soll. Wenn eine Überschneidung stattfindet – d.h., wenn das Ziel-Element in den sichtbaren Bereich des root (oder des definierten rootMargin) ein- oder austritt –, wird die Callback-Funktion, die Sie dem Observer bei der Erstellung übergeben haben, aufgerufen. Für jede Überschneidung, die erkannt wird, gibt der Observer ein Array von `IntersectionObserverEntry`-Objekten an diese Callback-Funktion weiter. Jedes `IntersectionObserverEntry`-Objekt enthält Informationen über einen bestimmten Überschneidungsvorgang für ein beobachtetes Ziel-Element. Hier sind einige wichtige Eigenschaften eines `IntersectionObserverEntry`-Objekts: - **target**: Das DOM-Element, das beobachtet wird und eine Überschneidung verursacht hat. Diese Eigenschaft erlaubt es Ihnen, direkt auf das Element zuzugreifen und zu identifizieren, um welches Element es sich handelt. - **isIntersecting**: Ein Boolescher Wert, der angibt, ob das Ziel-Element den root schneidet oder nicht. - **intersectionRatio**: Ein Wert zwischen 0 und 1, der das Verhältnis der Sichtbarkeit des Elements angibt. Ein Wert von 0 bedeutet, dass das Element nicht sichtbar ist, während ein Wert von 1 bedeutet, dass das gesamte Element sichtbar ist. - **boundingClientRect**, **rootBounds**, **intersectionRect**: Diese enthalten die Grenzen des Ziel-Elements, des root-Elements und des Überschneidungsbereichs, die als `DOMRect`-Objekte dargestellt werden. Wenn Sie beispielsweise den Observer so initialisieren: ```javascript const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => { entries.forEach((entry) => { console.log(entry.target); // Gibt das beobachtete Element aus, das eine Überschneidung verursacht hat if (entry.isIntersecting) { // Hier können Sie überprüfen, ob das Element sichtbar ist // und entsprechende Aktionen für dieses spezifische Element ausführen } }); }, { threshold: [0.1] }); observer.observe(document.querySelector(\'.meinZuBeobachtendesElement\')); ``` Bei diesem Code würde der `observer` ein spezifisches Element (`.meinZuBeobachtendesElement`) beobachten. Wenn eine Überschneidung festgestellt wird, gibt `entry.target` in der Callback-Funktion das beobachtete Element an, das die Überschneidung verursacht hat. So kann der Observer erkennen und Ihnen mitteilen, mit welchem Element er sich überschneidet."},{"instruction":"angenommen ich habe eine komponente ChatMessageLine wie hier <div class=\\"messagelist\\"> <TransitionGroup name=\\"list\\" :enter-active-class=\\"enterActiveClass()\\" :leave-active-class=\\"enterInactiveClass()\\" > <ChatMessageLine v-for=\\"(message, index) in chatMessagesItem\\" :key=\\"message.timestamp\\" :message=\\"message\\" :overlay=\\"overlay\\" ></ChatMessageLine> </TransitionGroup> </div> müsste der Observer innerhalb der komponente dann nicht das div messagelist mitberücksichtigen?","output":"Ja, beim Einsatz eines `IntersectionObserver` innerhalb einer Komponente wie `ChatMessageLine`, um festzustellen, ob diese Komponente in einem Container wie `messagelist` sichtbar ist, müsste der Beobachtungskontext entsprechend dem Container angepasst werden, in dem die Nachrichten angezeigt werden. Dabei gibt es zwei Ansätze, die je nach deinem konkreten Anwendungsfall und Design sinnvoll sein können: # 1. Beobachte jede `ChatMessageLine` relativ zum `messagelist`-Container Wenn die `ChatMessageLine`-Komponenten einzeln hinsichtlich ihrer Sichtbarkeit im `messagelist`-Container beobachtet werden sollen, musst du sicherstellen, dass der `IntersectionObserver` in jeder `ChatMessageLine`-Komponente den `messagelist`-Container als Root-Element für die Überschneidungsprüfung nutzt. Die Idee hierbei ist, dass du bei der Initialisierung des Observers in jeder Chat-Nachricht das Elternelement (`messagelist`) als Root festlegst, um festzustellen, ob die Nachricht innerhalb dieses Container sichtbar ist. Beispiel für die Initialisierung des Observers in `ChatMessageLine.vue`: ```javascript onMounted(() => { const observerOptions = { root: document.querySelector(\'.messagelist\'), // Setzt die \'messagelist\' als Beobachtungswurzel threshold: [0.1] // Trigger bei 10% Sichtbarkeit }; const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => { entries.forEach((entry) => { // Logik basierend auf Sichtbarkeit isVisible.value = entry.isIntersecting; }); }, observerOptions); observer.observe(rootElement.value); }); ``` Achte hier darauf, dass der Selector `document.querySelector(\'.messagelist\')` möglicherweise nicht das gewünschte Element zurückliefert, wenn es mehrere Instanzen dieser Klasse gibt oder die Komponente noch nicht vollständig gemountet wurde. Eine sicherere Methode könnte sein, das übergeordnete Element dynamisch auf Basis der Komponenten-Ref oder durch Propagation einer Referenz an die Kindkomponente zu bestimmen. # 2. Überwache die Gesamtheit der Nachrichten in `messagelist` Eine alternative Herangehensweise wäre, den `IntersectionObserver` in einem übergeordneten Kontext zu verwenden, um zu überwachen, wie Nachrichtengruppen oder individuelle Nachrichten beim Scrollen in den sichtbaren Bereich des `messagelist`-Containers ein- und austreten. Das bedeutet, dass der `IntersectionObserver` außerhalb der `ChatMessageLine`-Komponente eingesetzt wird, z.B. in der Komponente, die `messagelist` enthält. Diese Methode eignet sich besonders, wenn du Aktionen auf einer höheren Ebene ausführen willst, sobald bestimmte Schwellenwerte von Nachrichten innerhalb des Containers sichtbar werden. # Fazit Je nachdem, ob du individuelle Sichtbarkeitsaktionen für jede Nachricht oder eher gruppenbezogene Sichtbarkeitsaktionen innerhalb des `messagelist`-Containers ausführen möchtest, kannst du den Einsatz des `IntersectionObserver` entsprechend planen. Beide Ansätze haben ihre Vorzüge, abhängig von den spezifischen Anforderungen deiner Anwendung."},{"instruction":"wie kann ich das element welches dann isVisible = false hat vom observer ausschließen?","output":"Um ein Element, das als nicht sichtbar erkannt wurde (`isVisible = false`), vom Beobachten durch den `IntersectionObserver` auszuschließen, kannst du die Methode `observer.unobserve(targetElement)` verwenden. `unobserve` nimmt als Argument das DOM-Element, das nicht mehr beobachtet werden soll. Dies ist besonders nützlich, um die Performance zu verbessern, indem der Observer nicht weiterhin Elemente beobachtet, die bereits als nicht sichtbar markiert wurden und vielleicht bestimmte Aktionen ausgelöst haben, die sie permanent unsichtbar machen. Im Kontext einer Vue-Komponente, sagen wir `ChatMessageLine`, würdest du dies typischerweise innerhalb der Callback-Funktion des Observers tun, nachdem du festgestellt hast, dass das Element nicht mehr im sichtbaren Bereich ist und `isVisible` daher auf `false` gesetzt wurde. Hier ist ein vereinfachtes Beispiel, wie das in der Praxis aussehen könnte: ```javascript <script setup> import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from \'vue\'; const isVisible = ref(true); const elementRef = ref(null); onMounted(() => { const observerCallback = (entries, observer) => { entries.forEach((entry) => { if (!entry.isIntersecting) { isVisible.value = false; // Hat das Element den sichtbaren Bereich verlassen, // beenden wir die Beobachtung dieses spezifischen Elements. observer.unobserve(entry.target); } else { // Das Element ist sichtbar isVisible.value = true; } }); }; const observer = new IntersectionObserver(observerCallback, { threshold: 0.1 }); if (elementRef.value) { observer.observe(elementRef.value); } onUnmounted(() => { // Beim Entfernen der Komponente beenden wir die Beobachtung // und bereinigen den Observer. if (elementRef.value) { observer.unobserve(elementRef.value); } }); }); <\/script> <template> <div ref=\\"elementRef\\" v-show=\\"isVisible\\"> <!-- Chat-Nachrichten-Inhalt hier --> </div> </template> ``` In diesem Beispiel wird jeder Eintrag (jedes beobachtete Element) im Sichtbarkeits-Callback überprüft. Wenn ein Eintrag als nicht sichtbar erkannt wird (`!entry.isIntersecting`), wird dieser Eintrag (dieses Element) vom weiteren Beobachten ausgeschlossen, indem die `unobserve`-Methode des Observers aufgerufen und als Parameter das Ziel-Element (`entry.target`) übergeben wird. Zusätzlich kann es sinnvoll sein, im `onUnmounted` Hook den Observer für das Element explizit aufzuräumen, damit keine verwaisten Observer zurückbleiben, wenn Komponenten aus dem DOM entfernt werden. Dies hilft, Speicherlecks zu vermeiden und die Anwendungsperformance hochzuhalten."},{"instruction":"kann ich dem observer sagen das er nur den oberen rand beachten soll?","output":"Direkt kann der `IntersectionObserver` nicht angewiesen werden, ausschließlich den oberen Rand eines Elements für die Bestimmung der Sichtbarkeit zu beachten. Seine Funktionsweise basiert auf der Gesamtsichtbarkeit des beobachteten Elements innerhalb des definierten Beobachtungsbereichs (`root`) und den Schwellenwerten (`threshold`), die angeben, welcher Prozentsatz eines Elements sichtbar sein muss, um die Callback-Funktion auszulösen. Allerdings kannst du das Verhalten so anpassen, dass es deinen Anforderungen näher kommt, indem du die `rootMargin`-Eigenschaft des `IntersectionObserver` nutzt. `rootMargin` wirkt ähnlich wie ein CSS-Margin, den du auf den `root` anwendest und bietet dir eine gewisse Kontrolle darüber, wie früh oder spät die Callback-Funktion ausgelöst wird, wenn das Ziel-Element in den sichtbaren Bereich eintritt oder diesen verlässt. Wenn du beispielsweise möchtest, dass die Callback-Funktion ausgelöst wird, sobald der obere Rand eines Elements gerade sichtbar wird, könntest du eine negative `rootMargin` oben verwenden. Dies würde den \\"effektiven\\" sichtbaren Bereich nach oben erweitern, sodass die Callback-Funktion etwas früher ausgelöst wird, als wenn der Rand tatsächlich in den sichtbaren Bereich des Viewports oder des root-Elements eintritt. Hier ein Beispiel, wie du den Observer konfigurieren könntest: ```javascript const observerOptions = { root: null, // null bedeutet der Viewport threshold: [0.0], // Wird ausgelöst, sobald ein Pixel sichtbar ist rootMargin: \'-50px 0px 0px 0px\' // Erweiterung des sichtbaren Bereichs um 50px nach oben }; const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => { entries.forEach((entry) => { if (entry.isIntersecting) { console.log(\'Der obere Rand ist sichtbar.\'); } else { console.log(\'Der obere Rand ist nicht mehr sichtbar.\'); } }); }, observerOptions); ``` Im `rootMargin` bedeutet das erste Wert `-50px` eine Erweiterung des Beobachtungsbereichs um 50 Pixel nach oben über den eigentlichen oberen Rand des Viewports oder des root-Elements hinaus. Dies ist besonders nützlich, wenn du eine Aktion einleiten möchtest, kurz bevor das Element vollständig sichtbar wird oder kurz nachdem es begonnen hat, den sichtbaren Bereich zu verlassen. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass `rootMargin` keine direkte Kontrolle darüber bietet, ausschließlich den oberen Rand zu beachten. Stattdessen beeinflusst es, wie die Überschneidungsberechnungen in Bezug auf den sichtbaren Bereich vorgenommen werden. Ebenso beeinflusst `threshold` die Bedingung unter der die Callback-Funktion ausgelöst wird, basierend darauf, wie viel Prozent des beobachteten Elements sichtbar ist."},{"instruction":"und genau umgekehrt? Also wenn das obere element beginnt unsichtbar zu werden ?","output":"Um den umgekehrten Fall zu handhaben, also zu erkennen, wenn das obere Ende eines Elements beginnt, unsichtbar zu werden, musst du ähnlich vorgehen, aber deine Logik in der Callback-Funktion des `IntersectionObserver` entsprechend anpassen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, den Zeitpunkt zu erkennen, an dem das Element den sichtbaren Bereich verlässt, basierend auf den Übergängen seiner `isIntersecting`-Eigenschaft und gegebenenfalls der `intersectionRatio`. Angenommen, du möchtest eine Aktion ausführen, gerade zu dem Zeitpunkt, wenn das obere Ende des Elements aus dem sichtbaren Bereich verschwindet. Hier würde die Anpassung der `rootMargin` nicht notwendigerweise helfen, da sie eher bestimmt, wann die Callback-Funktion aufgrund der Sichtbarkeitsänderungen des gesamten Elements ausgelöst wird. Stattdessen musst du auf die Änderungen der `isIntersecting`-Eigenschaft achten, um festzustellen, wann das Element anfängt, den sichtbaren Bereich (Viewport oder das spezifische `root` Element, falls definiert) zu verlassen. Hier ein Beispiel, wie eine solche Logik implementiert werden könnte: ```javascript const observerOptions = { root: null, // Verwendet den Viewport als Wurzelelement des Beobachtungsbereichs threshold: [0] // Löst aus, sobald das erste Pixel unsichtbar wird }; const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => { entries.forEach((entry) => { // Prüfung, ob das Element gerade den sichtbaren Bereich verlässt if (!entry.isIntersecting && entry.boundingClientRect.top < 0) { console.log(\'Das obere Ende beginnt, unsichtbar zu werden.\'); } }); }, observerOptions); ``` Im obigen Snippet führt die Prüfung `!entry.isIntersecting && entry.boundingClientRect.top < 0` folgendes aus: - `!entry.isIntersecting` bestätigt, dass das Element nicht mehr im sichtbaren Bereich des Viewports (`root`) ist. - `entry.boundingClientRect.top < 0` prüft, ob der obere Rand des Elements bereits oberhalb des Viewports (also unsichtbar) ist. Dies bedeutet, das Element hat begonnen, am oberen Rand des Bildschirms unsichtbar zu werden. Zusammen ermöglichen diese Bedingungen die Ausführung von Aktionen im exakten Moment, wenn das Element anfängt, am oberen Rand aus dem sichtbaren Bereich zu rutschen. Beachte, dass diese Logik unter der Annahme funktioniert, dass du den gesamten Viewport als Beobachtungsbereich verwendest (`root: null`). Wenn du ein spezifisches `root`-Element verwendest, musst du möglicherweise die Logik anpassen, um die Position dieses `root`-Elements relativ zum Viewport zu berücksichtigen."},{"instruction":"muss ich den observer irgenwie neu starten wenn sich die dimensionen des containers ändern?","output":"Der `IntersectionObserver` ist dafür ausgelegt, Änderungen in der Sichtbarkeit von Elementen zu verfolgen, die durch Scroll-Aktionen oder Änderungen in der Größe des Viewports ausgelöst werden. Wenn sich die Dimensionen des beobachteten Elements oder des `root`-Containers (falls spezifiziert) ändern, passt der `IntersectionObserver` seine Beobachtungen entsprechend an, um korrekte Überschneidungen zu berichten. Daher ist ein manuelles „Neustarten“ des Observers in den meisten Fällen nicht notwendig. Es gibt jedoch Szenarien, in denen du möglicherweise manuelle Anpassungen vornehmen oder den Observer neu initialisieren musst: 1. **Dynamische Inhalte:** Wenn neue Elemente dynamisch zum DOM hinzugefügt werden oder sich die zu beobachtenden Elemente ändern (z.B. Elemente werden entfernt und neue hinzugefügt), musst du den Observer möglicherweise aktualisieren, um diese neuen Elemente zu beobachten. Dies erfordert, dass du `observer.observe(neuesElement)` für jedes neu hinzugefügte Element aufrufst. 2. **Änderungen an `root` oder `rootMargin`:** Wenn du Änderungen an den Optionen `root` oder `rootMargin` vornehmen möchtest, nachdem der Observer bereits erstellt wurde, musst du den Observer mit den neuen Optionen neu initialisieren. Der `IntersectionObserver` selbst bietet keine Methode zum direkten Aktualisieren dieser Optionen nach der Initialisierung. Du könntest den vorhandenen Observer mit `observer.disconnect()` stoppen und dann einen neuen Observer mit den aktualisierten Optionen erstellen. 3. **Größenänderung von Elementen ohne Layoutverschiebung:** In seltenen Fällen, wenn eine Änderung der Größe eines Elements nicht zu einer Layout-Verschiebung führt (z.B. durch Ändern von `scale` in CSS-Transformationen), erkennt der `IntersectionObserver` möglicherweise nicht automatisch die Änderung. In solchen Fällen könnte ein Neustart notwendig sein, aber oft ist ein besserer Ansatz, das Design so anzupassen, dass solche Änderungen zu erkennbaren Layout-Verschiebungen führen. Falls du den Observer basierend auf solchen Bedingungen oder Änderungen tatsächlich neu starten musst, sieht der Prozess in etwa so aus: ```javascript // Alten Observer beenden observer.disconnect(); // Observer mit denselben oder neuen Optionen/Elementen neu starten const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options); observableElements.forEach(el => observer.observe(el)); ``` Zusammenfassend passt der `IntersectionObserver` sich automatisch an, wenn die Dimensionen oder die Sichtbarkeit der beobachteten Elemente oder des Viewports sich ändern. Manuelle Neustarts sind selten notwendig und in der Regel nur in spezifischen Fällen oder bei Änderungen der zu beobachtenden Elemente selbst erforderlich."},{"instruction":"Hey","output":"Hello!

Each step carries a sense of anticipation, a silent hope for what treasures the sea might reveal today. The beach stretches out before me, a vast canvas painted with the remnants of the ocean\'s embrace. With every glance, I\'m searching, scanning the shoreline where the sea meets the land. It\'s here, in this liminal space, that driftwood finds its resting place, each piece a story, a voyage frozen in time. The ebb and flow of the tide, a constant artist, sculpts and shapes these remnants into forms both curious and captivating. I pause, drawn to a silhouette etched against the horizon. A piece of driftwood, perhaps? As I approach, the outline becomes clearer – a branch, smoothed and seasoned by its journey across the water. It\'s beautiful in its simplicity, a natural sculpture crafted by the elements. I crouch to examine my find, fingers tracing the contours and textures, feeling the history embedded in its weathered surface. This piece has traveled far, borne by currents unknown, to rest here at my feet. It\'s a connection, however fleeting, to the vastness of the sea and the mysteries it holds. The weight of the driftwood in my hands, I stand, eyes cast once more across the beach. The search continues, each discovery a moment of joy, a spark of creativity. For in these pieces of driftwood, I see not just the remnants of trees, but the potential for art, for stories, for a piece of the sea to call my own.

Найди проблемный участок, исправь его и отправь мне готовый код.","output":"Судя по описанной проблеме, у вас возникает BSOD (синий экран смерти) после определенного времени работы приложения, которое взаимодействует с драйвером ядра. Это может происходить по разным причинам, но наиболее вероятная связана с некорректной работой с памятью или ресурсами системы. В коде вашего драйвера я увидел, что вы используете глобальную переменную `static PEPROCESS target_process = nullptr;` в функции `device_control`. Эта переменная используется для хранения указателя на процесс, к которому драйвер должен присоединиться, и затем используется в операциях чтения/записи без соответствующего уменьшения счетчика ссылок при завершении работы с процессом. Этот способ работы может привести к утечкам ресурсов или неправильному учету использования объектов процесса, что в определенных ситуациях вызовет BSOD. Чтобы избежать такой проблемы, необходимо правильно управлять счетчиками ссылок на объекты процесса с помощью функций `ObfDereferenceObject` (или `ObDereferenceObject` в зависимости от вашего окружения) при завершении работы с процессом или когда переменная `target_process` уже не нужна. Я предлагаю вам исправленный вариант кода вашего драйвера с учетом освобождения `PEPROCESS` объекта, когда он больше не требуется: ```cpp NTSTATUS device_control(PDEVICE_OBJECT device_object, PIRP irp) { UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(device_object); debug_print(\\"[+] Device control called.n\\"); NTSTATUS status = STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL; // We need this to determine with code passed through. PIO_STACK_LOCATION stack_irp = IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation(irp); // Access the request object sent from user mode. auto request = reinterpret_cast<Request*>(irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer); if (stack_irp == nullptr || request == nullptr) { IoCompleteRequest(irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT); return status; } // The target process we want access to. static PEPROCESS target_process = nullptr; // Для безопасного управления счетчиком ссылок на объект процесса if (target_process != nullptr) { ObDereferenceObject(target_process); target_process = nullptr; } const ULONG control_code = stack_irp->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode; switch (control_code) { case codes::attach: status = PsLookupProcessByProcessId(request->process_id, &target_process); if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) { target_process = nullptr; // Обязательно обнуляем, если поиск не увенчался успехом } break; case codes::read: if (target_process != nullptr) status = MmCopyVirtualMemory(target_process, request->target, PsGetCurrentProcess(), request->buffer, request->size, KernelMode, &request->return_size); break; case codes::write: if (target_process != nullptr) status = MmCopyVirtualMemory(PsGetCurrentProcess(), request->buffer, target_process, request->target, request->size, KernelMode, &request->return_size); break; default: break; } irp->IoStatus.Status = status; irp->IoStatus.Information = sizeof(Request); IoCompleteRequest(irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT); return status; } ``` Также в функции `device_control`, после использования `PsLookupProcessByProcessId`, когда поиск процесса не требуется, следует уменьшить счетчик ссылок для `target_process` чтобы корректно освободить ресурсы. Это производится после условной проверки `if (target_process != nullptr)`, где для каждой ветки кейса, когда `target_process` используется, должен быть вызов `ObDereferenceObject(target_process)` перед присваиванием `nullptr` при неудачном выполнении операции или при очистке ресурсов в конце использования. Это изменение поможет обеспечить корректное управление памятью и ресурсами системы в вашем драйвере и предотвратить возникновение BSOD."},{"instruction":"Отлично, можешь предложить ещё какие-то исправления в коде приложения или драйвера?","output":"Внимательно рассмотрев код, можно выделить несколько моментов для улучшения и оптимизации как в драйвере, так и в пользовательском приложении. Эти изменения направлены на повышение безопасности, устойчивости работы и соблюдение лучших практик программирования. # В драйвере: 1. **Управление процессом при отсутствии действия**: - При анализе функции `device_control` становится очевидным, что после выполнения операций управления (`attach`, `read`, `write`), если `target_process` использовался, следует его корректно освободить, что в предыдущем ответе и было проделано. Однако стоит подумать о дополнениях в другие части кода, чтобы гарантировать обнуление и освобождение `target_process` во всех прочих случаях, где это актуально. 2. **Обработка ошибок после вызова `PsLookupProcessByProcessId`**: - В текущей реализации при неудачном выполнении `PsLookupProcessByProcessId` (если функция возвращает статус, отличный от `STATUS_SUCCESS`), `target_process` остается без изменений. Желательно добавить соответствующую логику очистки: если статус не успешный, следует отменить действие и корректно обработать ошибку. # В пользовательском приложении: 1. **Отсутствие проверки статуса выполнения функций**: - Необходимо доработать код для проверки возвращаемых значений функций `CreateFile`, `DeviceIoControl` и других системных вызовов. Это позволит корректно обрабатывать ошибочные ситуации и предотвратить возможные сбои или утечки ресурсов. 2. **Асинхронный вызов с ожиданием выполнения**: - В текущей реализации асинхронные задачи (`std::async`) используются для применения патчей, однако следует удостовериться в корректности жизненного цикла ресурсов и данных, передаваемых между потоками. Убедитесь, что использование `std::async` и `std::future` корректно в контексте вашей специфической задачи и не ведет к состоянию гонки или утечкам памяти. 3. **Стиль именования**: - Стоит следить за единообразием именования переменных и функций как в драйвере, так и в пользовательском приложении. Это не только улучшит читабельность кода, но и облегчит его поддержку. 4. **Безопасность памяти при работе с буферами**: - В коде пользовательского приложения есть операции с буферами, такими как чтение и запись в память процесса.

One of the commonly used functions for this purpose is `random.randint()`, which returns an integer number. Another useful function is `random.randrange()`, which offers more flexibility in terms of step values. Both functions are included in the `random` module, which you need to import before using these functions. Here\'s how you can use them: # Using `random.randint()` The `random.randint(a, b)` function returns a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`. Both the end-points are inclusive. ```python import random # Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) random_number = random.randint(1, 10) print(random_number) ``` # Using `random.randrange()` The `random.randrange(start, stop[, step])` function returns a randomly selected element from the range created by the `start`, `stop`, and optional `step` arguments. The `start` argument is inclusive, but the `stop` argument is exclusive, similar to slicing and range function behavior. ```python import random # Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (exclusive) random_number = random.randrange(1, 11) print(random_number) # Generate a random number between 0 and 100, stepping by 5 (0, 5, 10, ..., 95) random_number_stepped = random.randrange(0, 101, 5) print(random_number_stepped) ``` # Note Remember that the results from these functions are random, so they will likely be different each time you run your program or call these functions. Both `randint()` and `randrange()` are suitable for generating random integers, but `randrange()` gives you the ability to specify a step, making it more flexible in certain situations. Also, ensure you\'ve imported the `random` module at the beginning of your code to use these functions."},{"instruction":"get last pair in dict","output":"To get the last key-value pair in a dictionary in Python, you can utilize the fact that dictionaries maintain insertion order (this is true for Python 3.7 and later; it was an implementation detail in CPython 3.6). You can convert the dictionary items into a list of tuples (each tuple being a key-value pair) and then access the last item. Here\'s a quick example to demonstrate how you can achieve this: ```python my_dict = {\'apple\': 1, \'banana\': 2, \'cherry\': 3} # Convert to a list of items and get the last item last_key, last_value = list(my_dict.items())[-1] print(f\'Last key: {last_key}, Last value: {last_value}\') ``` In this example, you convert the dictionary items into a list where each item is a tuple (key-value pair) and then access the last item using `[-1]`, which is Python\'s syntax for getting the last element of a list. It\'s worth noting that this method is efficient and convenient for relatively small dictionaries. However, for very large dictionaries, this might not be the most memory-efficient way, as it requires creating a temporary list of all items. For most practical applications, though, this should not be a concern."},{"instruction":"why is my dict with int in keys getting sorted?","output":"In Python, dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, and the order of keys in a dictionary is not related to the values of the keys but rather to the order of insertion, especially from Python 3.7 onwards where the insertion order of keys is officially guaranteed to be preserved. If you\'re noticing that a dictionary with integer keys appears sorted, it might be due to the way you are interacting with or observing the dictionary. Here are a few reasons why your dictionary with integer keys might seem sorted: 1. **Coincidental Insertion Order:** If you inserted the keys in ascending or descending order by chance, the dictionary will retain and reflect this order when you iterate over it, access keys, values, or items. 2. **Reconstruction from Sequence:** If you\'re creating a dictionary by directly specifying keys and values or using something like `dict()` on a sorted sequence of tuples, the resulting dictionary will appear sorted if the input sequence was sorted. For example: ```python sorted_pairs = [(1, \'a\'), (2, \'b\'), (3, \'c\')] my_dict = dict(sorted_pairs) ``` Here, `my_dict` will seem sorted because the input sequence was. 3. **Viewing through `sorted()` or Other Means:** When you view your dictionary via a function that sorts, such as when you pass the keys, values, or items to `sorted()`, you will get a sorted view. However, this does not mean the dictionary itself stores the elements in a sorted manner. ```python my_dict = {3: \'c\', 1: \'a\', 4: \'d\', 2: \'b\'} for key in sorted(my_dict): print(key, my_dict[key]) ``` This will print the items in a sorted order based on the keys, but the underlying dictionary\'s order hasn\'t changed. 4. **Misinterpretation of Display Formats:** Depending on how you are viewing or printing your dictionary, it may appear sorted. For example, some IDEs or debugging tools might display dictionary contents in a sorted manner for readability, even though the actual order in the dictionary object is not sorted. Remember, if you\'re using Python versions before 3.7, dictionaries do not guarantee order preservation. However, from Python 3.7 onwards, dictionaries remember the order of item insertion, and if it seems sorted, it\'s due to the reasons mentioned above or specific interactions and not because Python automatically sorts them internally based on the keys."},{"instruction":"here is the code for an app, don\'t say anything because i will ask you after that, **code**: import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim import json import base64 from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset import binascii import chardet import random import math class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module): def __init__(self, embedding_dim, max_len=5000): super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__() self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim # Creating positional encoding matrix pe = torch.zeros(max_len, embedding_dim) position = torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1) div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, embedding_dim, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / embedding_dim)) pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term) pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term) pe = pe.unsqueeze(0).transpose(0, 1) # Registering pe as a buffer since it’s not a model parameter self.register_buffer(\'pe\', pe) def forward(self, x): x = x + self.pe[:x.size(0), :] return x class DecoderLayer(nn.Module): def __init__(self, embedding_dim, heads, ff_dim): super(DecoderLayer, self).__init__() self.self_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embedding_dim, heads) # Feedforward network self.ffn = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(embedding_dim, ff_dim), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(ff_dim, embedding_dim), ) self.layer_norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embedding_dim) self.layer_norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embedding_dim) def forward(self, src): src2 = self.layer_norm1(src) attn_output, _ = self.self_attn(src2, src2, src2) src = src + attn_output src2 = self.layer_norm2(src) src = src + self.ffn(src2) return src class Decoder(nn.Module): def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_layers, heads, ff_dim): super(Decoder, self).__init__() self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim) self.pos_encoding = PositionalEncoding(embedding_dim) self.decoder_layers = nn.ModuleList([DecoderLayer(embedding_dim, heads, ff_dim) for _ in range(num_layers)]) self.final_layer = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, vocab_size) def forward(self, x): x = self.embedding(x) x = self.pos_encoding(x) for layer in self.decoder_layers: x = layer(x) output = self.final_layer(x) return output class QAJsonlDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, path, seq_len=512): super().__init__() self.pairs = self.load_data(path) self.seq_len = seq_len self.vocab = self.build_vocab([word for pair in self.pairs for item in pair for word in item]) def __len__(self): return len(self.pairs) def __getitem__(self, idx): question, answer = self.pairs[idx] question_tokenized = self.tokenize([self.vocab[word] for word in question]) answer_tokenized = self.tokenize([self.vocab[word] for word in answer]) return torch.tensor(question_tokenized), torch.tensor(answer_tokenized) def load_data(self, path): pairs = [] with open(path, \\"rb\\") as f: # Open in binary mode for line in f: data = json.loads(line.decode(\\"utf-8\\")) # Decode binary data to JSON question, answer = self.decode_binary_data(data[\\"user\\"], data[\\"content\\"]) # Decode binary fields pairs.append((question.split(), answer.split())) return pairs def decode_binary_data(self, question_data, answer_data): try: question_encoding = chardet.detect(question_data.encode(\\"utf-8\\"))[\'encoding\'] # Detect encoding try: question = base64.b64decode(question_data).decode(question_encoding) except binascii.Error: try: question = base64.b64decode(question_data.encode(\\"utf-8\\") + b\'=\' * (-len(question_data) % 4)).decode(question_encoding) except binascii.Error: print(\\"Error decoding question (might be corrupt).\\") question = \\"\\" answer_encoding = chardet.detect(answer_data.encode(\\"utf-8\\"))[\'encoding\'] # Detect encoding for answer try: answer = base64.b64decode(answer_data).decode(answer_encoding) except binascii.Error: try: answer = base64.b64decode(answer_data.encode(\\"utf-8\\") + b\'=\' * (-len(answer_data) % 4)).decode(answer_encoding) except binascii.Error: print(\\"Error decoding answer (might be corrupt).\\") answer = \\"\\" except UnicodeDecodeError: print(\\"Error decoding binary data (invalid encoding).\\") question = \\"\\" answer = \\"\\" return question, answer def tokenize(self, integer_sequence): tokens = integer_sequence[:self.seq_len] if len(tokens) < self.seq_len: # Pad with appropriate binary token padding_token = self.vocab[\\"<pad>\\"] # Consider a binary padding token if needed tokens.extend([padding_token] * (self.seq_len - len(tokens))) # Add <eos> token only if appropriate for binary representation return tokens def build_vocab(self, binary_tokens): # Your implementation here.

You defined a class named `DataLoader` that doesn\'t accept a `shuffle` parameter in its `__init__` method, which conflicts with the behavior expected from PyTorch\'s `DataLoader`, which does accept a `shuffle` argument, among others. To resolve this issue, you could consider renaming your custom `DataLoader` class to something else (for instance, `CustomDataLoader`) to avoid this naming conflict. Below is a quick fix for your code: First, rename your custom DataLoader to avoid conflicts: ```python class CustomDataLoader: def __init__(self, dataset, batch_size=32): self.dataset = dataset self.batch_size = batch_size def __len__(self): return len(self.dataset) // self.batch_size def __getitem__(self, idx): batch = self.dataset[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size] inputs, targets = zip(*batch) # Assuming inputs and targets are tensors inputs_padded = torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence(inputs, batch_first=True, padding_value=0) # Using PyTorch\'s pad_sequence targets_padded = torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence(targets, batch_first=True, padding_value=0) return inputs_padded, targets_padded ``` Notice we renamed the class to `CustomDataLoader`. Now, you must also modify the part of your code that tries to use the `DataLoader` with `shuffle=True`. Since PyTorch\'s `DataLoader` provides the `shuffle` functionality, and now your custom implementation is renamed, you should specifically refer to `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` for loading your training and validation datasets: ```python # Right before defining your optimizer, replace your DataLoader instantiation with: train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True) val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32) ``` This modification uses PyTorch\'s built-in `DataLoader` which accepts a `shuffle` parameter, and it should eliminate the `TypeError` you encountered regarding the `shuffle` parameter. Regarding the decoding errors (e.g., \\"Error decoding binary data\\"), it seems that the issue stems from the incorrect handling of the binary data within your `QAJsonlDataset`\'s `decode_binary_data` method. Ensure that your input data is correctly formatted and encoded. If the goal is to work with binary-encoded JSON data in your file, double-check that `question_data` and `answer_data` are correctly encoded to base64 strings and that they represent valid text in a supported charset before attempting the decode operations. The use of `chardet.detect` followed by decoding might not be foolproof for every case, especially when data is not consistently formatted or encoded."},{"instruction":"this is what i got in the terminal: Error decoding binary data (invalid encoding).

This error occurs because the dimensions of the predicted outputs and the target tensors do not match, which is a common issue in classification tasks when calculating accuracy or loss. In a typical scenario using transformers for text generation or text-to-text tasks, outputs from the model are logits of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`, while targets usually have the shape `[batch_size, sequence_length]`. When computing something like accuracy, where you\'re comparing predictions to targets, you\'ll often convert those logits to indices (using `torch.argmax()`, for example) which would result in a shape of `[batch_size, sequence_length]` for predictions. However, the error suggests that at some point, the shape of predictions and targets does not align as it should. Here’s a more detailed look at what might be going wrong and how to possibly fix it: # Understanding the Error The error message is hinting that the `predictions` tensor has a size of `[batch_size, 10000]` at dimension 1 (which corresponds to the vocabulary size in your model\'s final output layer), whereas the `targets` tensor has a size of `[batch_size, 512]` at that dimension—with 512 likely being your sequence length. # Fixing the Evaluation Function Your `evaluate` function needs adjustment to properly compare predictions to targets. Here’s what needs attention: 1. **Dimension of Predictions**: When you\'re doing `torch.argmax(outputs, dim=1)`, it implies you\'re treating the `outputs` as if they are of shape `[batch_size, vocab_size]`, but since `outputs` is really `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`, you need to use `dim=2` for `torch.argmax`. 2. **Flattening Tensors for Comparison**: If you want to compute accuracy by comparing every predicted token to its corresponding target (which is a reasonable approach), you need to flatten both the `predictions` and `targets` tensors before comparison. Here’s a quick attempt to adjust your `evaluate` function: ```python def evaluate(model, val_loader): correct = 0 total = 0 with torch.no_grad(): for inputs, targets in val_loader: outputs = model(inputs) # Adjust dimension in argmax to correctly get predictions predictions = torch.argmax(outputs, dim=2) # Flatten tensors for element-wise comparison predictions_flat = predictions.view(-1) targets_flat = targets.view(-1) # Only consider non-padded values for accuracy calculation mask = targets_flat != 0 # Assuming 0 is your padding idx correct += ((predictions_flat == targets_flat) & mask).sum().item() total += mask.sum().item() accuracy = correct / total if total > 0 else 0 return accuracy ``` # Notes - The mask is used to exclude padding tokens (assumed here as `0`) from affecting the accuracy score. You might need to adjust this based on how your dataset represents padding. - This function now flattens both `predictions` and `targets` to make a tensor of shape `[batch_size*sequence_length]` for both, facilitating an element-wise comparison. Then, it applies a mask to ignore padding tokens, if your dataset includes them such that they should not contribute to the accuracy calculation. - Remember, the part of the code for logging or handling decoding errors doesn\'t relate directly to the runtime error you\'re facing but is more about ensuring data is correctly pre-processed and fed into your model. Ensure your data decoding logic aligns well with the actual format and encoding of your dataset."},{"instruction":"give me code to print param count, and a function to generate text directly from the trained model","output":"Certainly! Below, I\'ll first provide you with a snippet to print the total number of parameters in your model. Then I\'ll follow up with a basic function to generate text from your trained model, assuming it\'s a decoder model for a sequence generation task (e.g., text generation). Note that for the generation function, the approach might need adaptation depending on the specifics of your model and task. # Printing Model Parameter Count To print the total number of trainable parameters in your model, you can use the following code snippet: ```python def print_model_param_count(model): total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad) print(f\\"Total Trainable Parameters: {total_params}\\") # Assuming your model\'s variable name is `model` print_model_param_count(model) ``` This code iterates over all parameters in your model that require gradients (i.e., trainable parameters) and sums their elements (`numel()`), giving you the total count. # Generating Text from the Trained Model The function below offers a basic approach to generate text from your trained model. This implementation assumes that your model is similar to the one in your provided code and the process requires seeding the generation with some initial text (converted to tokens). It uses a greedy decoding method, where at each step the most likely next token is chosen. More sophisticated methods like beam search or top-k sampling could yield more diverse and coherent outputs but are more complex to implement. ```python def generate_text(model, initial_text, vocab, inv_vocab, seq_len=512, temperature=1.0): model.eval() # Put the model in eval mode tokens = [vocab.get(word, vocab[\'<unk>\']) for word in initial_text.split()] # Convert initial text to tokens.

A value of 1.0 means no scaling (default behavior). Lower values make the model more confident in its top choices, while higher values increase diversity. - Depending on your model and task, you might want to customize the tokenization and detokenization process, handle special tokens more carefully, or implement more advanced generation strategies. This function is quite simplistic and may not directly apply to your specific use case or model architecture without modification. Additionally, it assumes that your model outputs logits in a shape compatible with this approach."},{"instruction":"vocab is not defined","output":"Creating a vocabulary (`vocab`) and its inverse (`inv_vocab`) is fundamental for tokenizing input text and detokenizing output tokens when working with text data in NLP tasks. Since the initial code you provided does not include the exact method for building or providing the `vocab`, let\'s discuss a general approach to create a vocabulary and its inverse from your dataset. I\'ll provide you with an illustrative example to create a vocabulary from a hypothetical dataset. Note that the actual implementation might vary based on how your data is structured and what your dataset looks like. # Creating a Vocabulary A vocabulary is a mapping from tokens (words or characters, depending on your granularity) to unique integer IDs.

Here’s a simplified example on how to build such a mapping: ```python def build_vocab(texts): \\"\\"\\" Build a vocabulary from a list of texts. :param texts: a list of strings :return: a dictionary mapping tokens to integers \\"\\"\\" token_frequency = {} for text in texts: tokens = text.split() # Simple tokenization by whitespace.

After you define and create your `vocab`, you can use it with the text generation function provided earlier, ensuring that you first tokenize your initial text using this vocabulary."},{"instruction":"salary of product manager based on top 75% percentile in Palo Alto.","output":"As of my last update in early 2023, specific salary figures for Product Managers based on percentiles are subject to frequent changes due to various factors such as the prevailing demand for product managers, the size and industry of the hiring company, individual experience and qualifications, and the overall economic environment. However, for a region like Palo Alto, which is in the heart of Silicon Valley and home to many high-tech companies and startups, salaries can be significantly higher than the national average due to the intense competition for top talent and the high cost of living. While specific figures can fluctuate, for a Product Manager in the top 75th percentile in Palo Alto or similar high-cost areas, it wouldn\'t be surprising to see total compensation packages (including base salary, bonuses, and equity) well into the 200,000 to 300,000 range or even higher, especially for experienced Product Managers working at well-funded startups or major tech companies. This includes base salaries that could be in the high six figures, potentially reaching or exceeding 200,000, with bonuses, stock options, and other incentives pushing total compensation even higher. It\'s important to keep in mind that these figures are rough estimates and can vary widely. For the most current and accurate information, consult salary surveys like those conducted by compensation analysis companies (e.g., Payscale, Glassdoor, Levels.fyi) or professional networking sites like LinkedIn. Furthermore, negotiation plays a crucial role in determining an individual\'s salary, and factors such as specific role responsibilities, individual performance, and company performance can all influence the final compensation package."},{"instruction":"script_name(\\"phoneBomber\\") script_author(\\"flyingbaby\\") script_version(\\"001\\") require \'lib.sampfuncs\' require \'lib.moonloader\' local encoding = require \'encoding\' encoding.default = \'CP1251\' u8 = encoding.UTF8 -- local sampev = require(\'lib.samp.events\') local memory = require(\'memory\') -- local ffi = require(\\"ffi\\") local socket = require \'socket\' local defaultDelaySms = 100 local defaultTimerSms = math.huge local defaultTextSms = \'превет, любиш вишню???\' local lastTickTime = -1 local stopSmsKey = 221 local defaultTickLimit = math.huge local defaultDelayCall = 100 local defaultTimerCall = math.huge local stopCallKey = 221 local defaultWaitingTimeout = 500 function main() if not isSampfuncsLoaded() or not isSampLoaded() then return end while not isSampAvailable() do wait(100) end --sampRegisterChatCommand(\\"callb\\", function(arg) lua_thread.create(callBomb, arg) end) --sampRegisterChatCommand(\\"smsb\\", function(arg) lua_thread.create(smsBomb, arg) end) sampRegisterChatCommand(\\"testik\\", function(arg) lua_thread.create(dialogProcessor, arg) end) while true do if floodIsActive then renderDrawBox( 100, 100, 100, 100, 0xFFD00000) if isKeyDown(80) then floodIsActive = false end end wait(0) end end function dialogProcessor() local categoryFlag = false local floodModeList = false local geotagModeFlag = false local victimPhoneNumber = false local timerLimit = false local tickLimit = false local waitingTimeout = false local messageContent = false local dialogActive = true while dialogActive do while sampIsDialogActive() do wait(100) end sampShowDialog(1488, \'Создание спам-атаки\', \\"НазваниеtЗначение\\" .. \\"n{4a86b6}- {ffffff}Категория{FFFF00}*t{4a86b6}\\" ..

The tool\'s intention is to automate spamming phone calls and text messages within the game\'s internal phone system to specified player characters, which could be considered disruptive or malicious behavior in the game\'s community and could potentially violate server rules. Here\'s a summary of what the script does and how it works: # Main Features: - **Spam Attack Creation Dialog**: Allows the user to configure and initiate spam attacks through an in-game dialog interface. Users can specify attack type (calls or messages), mode of operation, target phone number, time limits, tick limits (how many messages or calls to send), waiting timeouts, and message content. - **Sending Mechanism**: Once configured, the script seems to automate interaction with the game\'s internal phone system to either send messages or make calls based on the user\'s setup. - **Customization Options**: Provides interfaces to customize various aspects of the spam attack, such as the target\'s phone number, the duration of the attack, the interval between actions, and the content of the messages being sent. # Technical Overview: - Utilizes `sampfuncs` and `moonloader`, along with `socket` and `memory` libraries for its features. - Employs game dialog manipulation to interact with the phone system, sending dialog responses programmatically to simulate user actions. - Interfaces with SA-MP textdraws and dialogs to find certain UI elements like the \\"CONTACTS\\" button or phonebook dialog in the game. - Attempts to manage spam attack parameters and execution flow through a GUI dialog, with options to initiate or stop the spamming process. # Ethical and Usage Consideration: This script is clearly designed for disruptive purposes within the SA-MP community and could be considered a form of harassment when used against players without their consent. Scripts of this nature can negatively impact the gaming experience for others and may result in punitive actions from server administrators, including bans. # Recommendations: - If you\'re a server administrator, consider implementing detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate such disruptive behaviors. - As a player or community member, fostering positive interactions within the game promotes a healthy gaming environment. Explore constructive ways to use scripting skills, such as developing new game features, improving user experience, or contributing to community-driven projects. - If you encounter scripts or tools intended for malicious use, it\'s generally best to refrain from using or distributing them."},{"instruction":"using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using BaseAdminApi.Enums; using CounterStrikeSharp.API; using CounterStrikeSharp.API.Core; using CounterStrikeSharp.API.Modules.Menu; namespace BaseAdmin.Menu; public class MenuService : IMenuService { private static readonly Dictionary<MenuItem, IMenu> Menus = new(); private IMenu _adminMenu = null!; public readonly BaseAdmin BaseAdmin; public List<ChatMenuOption> MenuOptions => _adminMenu.MenuOptions; public MenuService(BaseAdmin baseAdmin) { BaseAdmin = baseAdmin; CreateMenu(); } public IMenu CreateMenu(string title) { return BaseAdmin.Config.UseCenterHtmlMenu ? new CenterHtmlMenu(title) : new ChatMenu(title); } public void AddMenuOptions(string display, Action<CCSPlayerController, ChatMenuOption> handler, bool disabled) { _adminMenu.AddMenuOption(display, handler, disabled); } public void AddMenuOptions(MenuItem type, string display, Action<CCSPlayerController, ChatMenuOption> handler, bool disabled) { if (!Menus.TryGetValue(type, out var menu)) return; menu.AddMenuOption(display, handler, disabled); } private void CreateMenu() { _adminMenu = CreateMenu(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu_title\\"]); _adminMenu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.players_control\\"], PlayersControlMenu); _adminMenu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.server_control\\"], ServerControlMenu); _adminMenu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.lock_control\\"], ); } private void ServerControlMenu(CCSPlayerController player, ChatMenuOption option) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } private void PlayersControlMenu(CCSPlayerController player, ChatMenuOption option) { var menu = CreateMenu(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.players_control\\"]); if (BaseAdmin.CheckingForAdminAndFlag(player, AdminFlag.Kick)) { menu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.players.kick_player\\"], (_, _) => PlayersHandle(player, controller => { controller.Kick(\\"Kick\\"); BaseAdmin.PrintToChatAll(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"player.kick\\", player.PlayerName, controller.PlayerName]); })); } if (BaseAdmin.CheckingForAdminAndFlag(player, AdminFlag.Slay)) { menu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.players.kill_player\\"], (_, _) => PlayersHandle(player, controller => { controller.PlayerPawn.Value?.CommitSuicide(true, true); BaseAdmin.PrintToChatAll(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"player.kill\\", player.PlayerName, controller.PlayerName]); })); } OpenMenu(player, menu); Menus.TryAdd(MenuItem.PlayerControl, menu); } private void LockControlMenu(CCSPlayerController player, ChatMenuOption option) { var menu = CreateMenu(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.lock_control\\"]); if (BaseAdmin.CheckingForAdminAndFlag(player, AdminFlag.Ban)) { menu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.lock.ban_player\\"], null!, true); } if (BaseAdmin.CheckingForAdminAndFlag(player, AdminFlag.Generic)) { menu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.lock.mute_player\\"], null!, true); } OpenMenu(player, menu); Menus.TryAdd(MenuItem.LockControl, menu); } private void PlayersHandle(CCSPlayerController player, Action<CCSPlayerController> handler) { var menu = CreateMenu(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.all_players\\"]); menu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.pick_player\\"], null!, true); foreach (var players in Utilities.GetPlayers().Where(u => u.IsValid)) { if (!BaseAdmin.PlayerImmunityComparison(player, players)) continue; menu.AddMenuOption(\\"{players.PlayerName} [{players.UserId}]\\", (_, _) => handler(players)); } OpenMenu(player, menu); } public void OpenMenu(CCSPlayerController controller, IMenu? menu = null) { menu ??= _adminMenu; if (BaseAdmin.Config.UseCenterHtmlMenu) MenuManager.OpenCenterHtmlMenu(BaseAdmin, controller, (CenterHtmlMenu)menu); else MenuManager.OpenChatMenu(controller, (ChatMenu)menu); } } хочу реализовать так чтобы я мог писать в отдельных классах PlayersControlMenu, ServerControlMenu, LockControlMenu и уже их тут открывать чтобы класс не был слишком огромен","output":"Чтобы разделить реализацию меню по разным классам и сделать ваш `MenuService` более чистым и модульным, вы можете следовать стратегии разделения ответственности, используя паттерн \\"Стратегия\\" или любую альтернативную структуру, подходящую под вашу архитектуру. Вот базовый пример того, как это может быть реализовано, используя интерфейс для общего определения \\"стратегии меню\\": 1. **Создайте интерфейс для стратегии меню**: ```csharp public interface IMenuStrategy { void ExecuteMenu(CCSPlayerController player); } ``` 2. **Реализуйте отдельные стратегии для каждого меню**: Пример для меню управления игроками: ```csharp public class PlayersControlMenuStrategy : IMenuStrategy { private readonly BaseAdmin _baseAdmin; public PlayersControlMenuStrategy(BaseAdmin baseAdmin) { _baseAdmin = baseAdmin; } public void ExecuteMenu(CCSPlayerController player) { // Ваш код для создания и обработки меню управления игроками здесь } } ``` 3. **Интегрируйте стратегии в ваш `MenuService`**: Для интеграции вы можете использовать следующий подход: ```csharp public class MenuService : IMenuService { private readonly Dictionary<MenuItem, IMenuStrategy> _menuStrategies; public MenuService(BaseAdmin baseAdmin) { BaseAdmin = baseAdmin; _menuStrategies = new Dictionary<MenuItem, IMenuStrategy> { { MenuItem.PlayerControl, new PlayersControlMenuStrategy(baseAdmin) }, { MenuItem.ServerControl, new ServerControlMenuStrategy(baseAdmin) }, { MenuItem.LockControl, new LockControlMenuStrategy(baseAdmin) } }; CreateMenu(); } private void OpenMenuStrategy(CCSPlayerController player, MenuItem menuItem) { if (_menuStrategies.TryGetValue(menuItem, out var strategy)) { strategy.ExecuteMenu(player); } } } ``` 4. **Используйте новую структуру в вашем коде**: Теперь, когда структура готова, вы можете изменить метод `CreateMenu` в `MenuService`, чтобы использовать новые стратегии: ```csharp private void CreateMenu() { _adminMenu = CreateMenu(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu_title\\"]); _adminMenu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.players_control\\"], (player, option) => OpenMenuStrategy(player, MenuItem.PlayerControl)); _adminMenu.AddMenuOption(BaseAdmin.Localizer[\\"menu.server_control\\"], (player, option) => OpenMenuStrategy(player, MenuItem.ServerControl)); // Добавьте другие опции меню здесь... } ``` Этот подход позволяет легко расширять и поддерживать ваш код, делая каждую часть меню независимой от других и упрощая тестирование и добавление новых пунктов меню."},{"instruction":"in the words of miyamoto muzashi write a 150 word poem on how to when a sword duel","output":"In the realm of steel and silence, Where swordsmen meet with deadly dance, Miyamoto Musashi speaks, a guidance, For the warrior\'s ultimate chance.

Atitudinea față de evrei în această perioadă a variat în funcție de loc, timp și circumstanțe politice, dar în mare parte, pot fi identificate câteva tendințe generale în ceea ce privește tratarea și percepția evreilor în Europa medievală. # Statutul legal și economic Evreii din Europa medievală se confruntau adesea cu restricții legale severe. În multe regiuni, li se interzicea să dețină pământ, ceea ce însemna că agricultura, o sursă principală de venit a vremii, le era în mare parte inaccesibilă. Prin urmare, mulți evrei s-au orientat către comerț, finanțe (inclusiv practica împrumuturilor cu dobândă, cunoscută sub numele de camătă, care era interzisă creștinilor de către Biserica Catolică), și meșteșuguri. Deși aceste ocupații le permiteau unor comunități evreiești să prospere, succesul lor economic a atras adesea invidie și ostilitate, ceea ce a dus la noi restricții și persecuții. De asemenea, în multe locuri, evreilor li se impuneau taxe grele și erau folosiți ca \\"servi ai camerei regale\\", fiind considerați proprietatea regelui. # Persecuții și violență Epoca medievală a fost martora unor valuri de persecuții antievreiești. Acestea variu de la predicile negative din partea clericilor, care îi descriau pe evrei ca fiind ucigașii lui Cristos și acuzațiuni de deicid, până la pogromuri violente și expulzări în masă. Un exemplu infam este acuzația de \\"crimă rituală\\", în care evreii erau acuzați că ucid copii creștini pentru a folosi sângele lor în ritualuri religioase, o calomnie complet nefondată. Expulzările în masă au avut loc în mai multe țări, inclusiv în Anglia (1290), Franța (în mai multe rânduri, dar definitiv în 1394), și Spania (1492). Aceste expulzări au forțat comunitățile evreiești să se relocheze și să își reconstruiască viețile în alte părți ale Europei sau în lumea islamică. # Ghetouri și restricții sociale În multe orașe europene, evreilor li se impunea să trăiască în ghetouri, zone separate și adesea mărginașe ale orașului. Aceste restricții rezidențiale erau însoțite adesea de obligația de a purta îmbrăcăminte distinctă, cum ar fi pălării sau insigne speciale, pentru a-i identifica ca evrei. Aceste măsuri aveau scopul de a izola comunitățile evreiești și de a le menține sub control. # Protecție și toleranță În ciuda persecuțiilor și restricțiilor, existau momente și locuri unde evreii se bucurau de o anumită măsură de protecție și toleranță. Unii monarhi, prinți, sau orașe-state recunoșteau valoarea economică pe care o aduceau evreii prin comerț și finanțe și, prin urmare, le ofereau protecție. De exemplu, în Imperiul Otoman și în unele orașe italiene, evreii puteau să trăiască cu o relativă libertate și securitate în comparație cu alte părți ale Europei. În concluzie, viața evreilor în Europa medievală era complexă și variată. Deși pe alocuri și momente au întâlnit protecție și prosperitate, în mare parte se confruntau cu ostracizare, restricții și chiar violență. Această istorie tumultuoasă a modelat profund comunitățile evreiești europene și a lăsat o amprentă adâncă asupra relațiilor interetnice și religioase din Europa până în zilele noastre."},{"instruction":"Write an advanced math AI in poe.

The key changes include integrating a math solving library or API, and adjusting the bot\'s response logic to handle math queries effectively. We\'ll use SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, to handle math operations. If there\'s a specific external API you\'d prefer for mathematical computations, you could integrate it similarly by making HTTP requests within the `get_response` method. For simplicity, this example will stick to SymPy, which should be installed alongside other requirements. Here\'s how you could write an advanced math AI in POE: ```python from __future__ import annotations from typing import AsyncIterable from modal import Image, Stub, asgi_app import fastapi_poe as fp import sympy as sp class AdvancedMathBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: # Process the incoming math query using SymPy try: # Parse the query to a sympy understandable format # Here assuming request.query is directly usable, may need adjustment result = str(sp.simplify(request.query)) except Exception as e: result = f\\"Error processing math query: {str(e)}\\" # Streaming the result back yield fp.PartialResponse(result=result) async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse: # Indicating this bot does not have external dependencies return fp.SettingsResponse(server_bot_dependencies={}) REQUIREMENTS = [\\"fastapi-poe==0.0.36\\", \\"sympy==1.10.1\\"] image = Image.debian_slim().pip_install(*REQUIREMENTS) stub = Stub(\\"advanced-math-example-poe\\") @stub.function(image=image) @asgi_app() def fastapi_app(): bot = AdvancedMathBot() app = fp.make_app(bot, allow_without_key=True) return app ``` In this example, `AdvancedMathBot` is modified to use SymPy for processing math queries. When a query is received, it attempts to simplify the expression or solve the math problem using `sp.simplify(request.query)`. This is a basic example of utilizing SymPy, and depending on your needs, you might want to leverage more specific functions from SymPy. Note: In real use, you might need to parse and sanitize the query before passing it to SymPy to ensure it\'s in a format SymPy can understand and to mitigate any potential security risks. Remember to adjust your requirements and dependencies based on your specific needs, such as if you decide to use an external API for math operations."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These can accelerate the decay of the others if left in contact. 2. **Wash Them Properly (Optional Before Storage):** Although it\'s often recommended to wash grapes before eating them, you might want to wait until you\'re ready to consume them to wash. Washing grapes before storage can add moisture, potentially promoting mold growth. If you choose to wash them before storing, ensure they are completely dry before refrigeration. - To wash, you can rinse them under cold running water for a few seconds. Or, for a more thorough clean, mix a solution of water and baking soda or use a vegetable wash. This can help in removing pesticides and wax. Ensure to rinse them thoroughly after. 3. **Store Appropriately:** Grapes should be stored in the refrigerator to maintain freshness. They do best in a part of the fridge that maintains a consistent temperature. Keeping them in a plastic bag that has some holes for air circulation or in a container that allows for moisture escape can help maintain their freshness. Avoid washing if you’re going to store them immediately after buying. 4. **Consume Within a Week:** Ideally, consume grapes within a week of purchasing them for the best taste and texture. The sooner, the better. 5. **Preparation Before Eating:** When you\'re ready to eat the grapes, wash them if you haven\'t already. You can then enjoy them fresh, add them to salads, freeze them for a cool snack, or use them in cooking and baking. 6. **Dry and Freeze (Optional):** If you have too many grapes or can\'t eat them fast enough, consider drying them to make raisins, or freeze them. To freeze grapes, wash, dry thoroughly, and spread them out on a baking sheet to freeze individually. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag or container. Frozen grapes make a tasty and healthy snack, especially in warm weather. Remember, grapes are a perishable commodity, so following these steps can help ensure you enjoy them while they\'re at their best."},{"instruction":"How to wash them with water and baking soda solution?","output":"Washing grapes with a water and baking soda solution can help remove pesticide residues and dirt more effectively than water alone. Here\'s a simple step-by-step guide on how to do it: # What You Need: - Baking soda - Water - A bowl or basin large enough to hold the grapes you intend to wash - A colander or strainer # Instructions: 1. **Prepare the Solution:** In your bowl or basin, mix approximately 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 2 cups of water. You can adjust this ratio based on the volume of grapes you\'re washing – the goal is to have enough solution to cover the grapes completely. 2. **Soak the Grapes:** Place the grapes in the bowl and ensure they are fully submerged in the baking soda solution. You might want to separate the grapes from the stem to ensure each grape gets cleaned thoroughly. 3. **Let Them Soak:** Allow the grapes to soak in the solution for about 15 minutes. This duration is generally considered enough time for the baking soda to help break down any surface pesticides and waxes. 4. **Agitate Gently:** Occasionally, gently stir or agitate the grapes with your hand or a utensil. This helps to dislodge any dirt or residues from the grapes. 5. **Rinse Thoroughly:** After soaking, transfer the grapes to a colander or strainer and rinse them under cold running water for a few seconds to a minute. Ensure that all the baking soda is washed off, as leaving residue can give the grapes a slightly salty taste. 6. **Dry the Grapes:** Before eating or storing the grapes, it’s important to dry them thoroughly to prevent mold growth. You can spread them out on a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and pat them dry gently. Alternately, let them air dry if you\'re not in a hurry. # Additional Tips: - **Test a Small Batch First:** If you\'re concerned about how your grapes might react to a baking soda wash, consider testing this method on a small batch first. This way, you can ensure there are no adverse effects on taste or texture. - **Organic Grapes:** Even if you buy organic grapes, washing them is still recommended to remove dirt and potential residues. - **Regular Washing Practice:** While the baking soda solution can be more effective for a thorough clean, regularly rinsing grapes under cold water just before consumption is usually sufficient for removing surface dirt. Washing grapes with a baking soda solution is a simple and effective way to clean them. However, ensure that you rinse and dry them properly to enjoy your grapes at their best."},{"instruction":"Опиши биографию персонажа по следующим пунктам: - Имя и Фамилия - Внешность - Характер - Рождение (Место и Семья (конкретные названия и имена)) - Детство (конкретные названия и имена) - Юность (конкретные названия и имена) - Подростковый возраст (конкретные названия и имена) - Взрослая жизнь (конкретные названия и имена) - Перемены в жизни (конкретные названия и имена) - Решение стать искателем приключений (конкретные названия и имена) - Долгосрочные цели (конкретные жизненные цели) - Среднесрочные цели (конкретные жизненные цели) - Краткосрочные цели (конкретные жизненные цели) Вот шаблон персонажа: Раса: Аасимар (Аасимары несут в себе дух небесного света.
