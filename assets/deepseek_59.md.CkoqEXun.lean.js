We are given three numbers ( x, y, z ) and are asked to examine the sequence of absolute differences.

After ( n ) steps, we obtain: [ x_n = x, quad y_n = y, quad z_n = z. ] We are given ( z = 1 ) and need to determine the values of ( x ) and ( y ). **Step 2:**  Examine the non-negative nature of ( x, y, z ).

Prove that the Simson lines of point P with respect to the triangles A B C are tangent to a fixed circle.","output":"1. **Definition and Setup**:     Let ( A_1 ) and ( B_1 ) be the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from point ( P ) to the lines ( BC ) and ( AC ) respectively. This creates right angles at points ( A_1 ) and ( B_1 ) with the segments ( BC ) and ( AC ). 2. **Inscribed Circle**:    Notice that points ( A_1 ) and ( B_1 ) lie on a circle with diameter ( PC ). This follows from the fact that (angle PA_1C = angle PB_1C = 90^circ), thus both angles subtend the diameter ( PC ). 3. **Angles in the Inscribed Circle**:    Let the angle (angle ACB) be constant everywhere, as given in the problem. By virtue of the circle with diameter ( PC ), and the right angles inscribed in this circle:    [    sin angle A_1CB_1 = sin angle ACB.    ] 4. **Chord Length**:    Since (angle A_1CB_1 = angle ACB) and (angle ACB) is constant, the length of the chord ( A_1B_1 ), which subtends the angle (angle A_1CB_1), is also constant. This follows from the property of a circle where the length of a chord is determined by the measure of the angle it subtends at the circumference and the radius of the circle. 5. **Fixed Circle**:    Therefore, the perpendiculars dropped from ( P ) yield chords ( A_1B_1 ) of constant lengths on the same circle with diameter ( PC ).  6. **Simson Line Property**:    Given that ( A ) and ( B ) move such that the angle ( angle ACB ) remains constant, the locus of points ( A_1B_1 ) remains fixed relative to a certain circle, meaning their Simson lines also behave predictively with respect to this fixed geometric arrangement. 7. **Conclusion**:    Consequently, the Simson lines of point ( P ) with respect to the triangle ( ABC ) are tangent to a fixed circle, implying that as ( A ) and ( B ) vary while maintaining the fixed angle, the tangency condition remains invariant to the system.

First, we recognize that the function sqrt{4-(x-2)^2} represents the top half of a circle with a radius of 2 and center at (2,0). Specifically, it is the top semicircle of the circle (x-2)^2 + y^2 = 4. The area under this curve from x=0 to x=2 corresponds to a quarter of the circle's area. Therefore, we can compute the area directly using the formula for the area of a circle, which is pi r^2: int_{0}^{2} sqrt{4-(x-2)^2} dx = frac{1}{4} cdot pi cdot 2^2 = frac{pi}{4} cdot 4. Simplifying gives us the area of the quarter circle: int_{0}^{2} sqrt{4-(x-2)^2} dx = pi. Next, we evaluate the integral of the linear function -x from x=0 to x=2: int_{0}^{2} -x dx = -left[ frac{x^2}{2} right]_{0}^{2}. Plugging in the bounds, we get: -left( frac{2^2}{2} - frac{0^2}{2} right) = -2.

One week each celebrity was mentioned in an odd number of magazines, and each magazine mentioned an odd number of celebrities. Show that ( m ) and ( c ) are both even or both odd. How many ways are there for each magazine to mention an odd number of celebrities so that each celebrity is mentioned an odd number of times?","output":"1. **Count the total number of mentions (M)**:    We start by counting the total number of mentions (M) in two different ways. First, we sum up the number of mentions in each magazine, and second, we sum up mentions each celebrity received. Let's denote the magazines as (M_1, M_2, ldots, M_m) and the number of celebrities each magazine mentions as (d_1, d_2, ldots, d_m). Here (d_i) is odd for each (i):    [    M = d_1 + d_2 + cdots + d_m    ]    Since each (d_i) is odd, (M) is the sum of (m) odd numbers, hence (M) must be odd or even depending on (m). 2. **Sum mentions by celebrities**:    Let the celebrities be (C_1, C_2, ldots, C_c) and the number of magazines each celebrity is mentioned in be denoted as (e_1, e_2, ldots, e_c). Here (e_j) is odd for each (j):    [    M = e_1 + e_2 + cdots + e_c    ]    Since each (e_j) is odd, (M) is again the sum of (c) odd numbers, hence (M) must be odd or even depending on (c). 3. **Parity relation**:    Since (M) can be represented as both (d_1 + d_2 + cdots + d_m) and (e_1 + e_2 + cdots + e_c), it follows that (M) must have the same parity whether summed by magazines or celebrities. Thus, (m) and (c) must have the same parity. Therefore, both (m) and (c) are either both even or both odd.  Next, we count the number of ways each magazine can mention an odd number of celebrities so that each celebrity is mentioned an odd number of times: 4. **Counting arrangements**:    Consider the arrangement options for mentions. Take any magazine (M_X) and any celebrity (C_Y): 5. **Choices for remaining magazines and celebrities**:    Each of the remaining (m-1) magazines is free to mention or not each of the remaining (c-1) celebrities:    [    2^{(c-1)} text{ possibilities per magazine}    ]    Thus, for all (m-1) magazines, the total number of possibilities is:    [    2^{(m-1)(c-1)}    ] 6. **Ensuring odd mentions for selected magazine and celebrity**:    The mentions within those specific configurations must ensure that the selected magazine (M_X) and the selected celebrity (C_Y) are each mentioned an odd number of times. The odd parity condition for celebrities suggests that including (C_Y) depends on the parity from other selections:    [    text{Magazine } X text{ mentions any given celebrity } C_i iff text{an even number of other magazines have mentioned her}    ] 7. **Final checks**:    The condition that (m) and (c) have the same parity ensures every magazine (M_i) makes an odd number of mentions, and each mention structure respects the parity requirement.    Therefore, the total number of configurations respecting these constraints is given by:    [    2^{(m-1)(c-1)}    ] # Conclusion: The solution is concluded; (m) and (c) must share the same parity, thus are both even or both odd.

Since f(x) has an extreme value at x = frac{1}{2}, we have f'left(frac{1}{2}right) = 0, which gives us: 2left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + aleft(frac{1}{2}right) + 1 = 0, After simplifying, we find that a = -3. So we have the boxed value boxed{a = -3}. (Ⅱ) The domain of f(x) is (0, +infty). We must ensure that f'(x) geq 0 for all x in this interval for f(x) to be increasing.  The discriminant of the quadratic 2x^2 + ax + 1 = 0 in terms of a is Delta = a^2 - 8. 1. When Delta leq 0, which occurs for -2sqrt{2} leq a leq 2sqrt{2}, we have 2x^2 + ax + 1 geq 0, and thus f'(x) geq 0 holds true for (0, +infty), making f(x) an increasing function. 2. When Delta > 0, either a < -2sqrt{2} or a > 2sqrt{2}. For f(x) to be increasing in the domain (0, +infty), it suffices to have 2x^2 + ax + 1 geq 0. If we let h(x) = 2x^2 + ax + 1, then from the conditions begin{cases} h(0) = 1 > 0  -frac{a}{4} < 0 end{cases}, we obtain a > 0. Therefore, we must have a > 2sqrt{2}.

(Ⅲ) To prove: For g(x) = f(x) - x^2 + 1 and a = -1, g(x) leq 0 holds within its domain (0, +infty). With a = -1, g(x) = ln x - x + 1. We differentiate g(x) to find the extremum: g'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 1 = 0, which gives us x = 1. At x = 1, g(x) attains its maximum value which is also its greatest value. Since g(1) = 0, we can assert that g(x) leq 0 for all x in the domain (0, +infty). Therefore, ln x leq x - 1. Given n in mathbb{N} and n geq 2, we have ln n^2 leq n^2 - 1, which implies that: frac{ln n^2}{n^2} leq 1 - frac{1}{n^2}.

Each packet contains 16 pounds and 4 ounces of wheat. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert 4 ounces to pounds: 4 ounces * (1 pound / 16 ounces) = 0.25 pounds So, each packet weighs 16 pounds + 0.25 pounds = 16.25 pounds. Now, we have 2080 packets, each weighing 16.25 pounds. To find the total weight of the wheat in pounds: 2080 packets * 16.25 pounds/packet = 33,800 pounds The gunny bag has a capacity of 13 tons and is completely filled with the wheat. Therefore, the total weight of the wheat in pounds (33,800 pounds) is equal to the weight capacity of the gunny bag in tons (13 tons).

From the equality:     [     a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_n + a_{n+1} = k_{n+1} times (n+1)     ]     we can express (k_{n+1}) as:     [     k_{n+1} times (n+1) leq k_n times (n+1)     ]     Hence:     [     k_{n+1} leq k_n     ] 6. Therefore, the sequence ((k_n)) is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers. Since it is bounded below by 1 (the smallest positive integer), the sequence ((k_n)) must eventually be constant. That is, there exist integers (k) and (N) such that for all (n geq N), (k_n = k). 7. Now, considering (a_n) for (n geq N):     [     a_{n+1} = k_{n+1} times (n+1) - k_n times n     ]     Since (k_{n+1} = k_n = k) for (n geq N), we have:     [     a_{n+1} = k(n+1) - kn = k     ] 8.

They form a combination that touches one of the diagonals. 4. **Condition on Diagonal**: Given that every number in each row, column, and both main diagonals of the (5 times 5) grid must be different (this is a Latin square property combined with Sudoku diagonal constraint), it's necessary to analyze the possible configurations:    - Each natural number from 1 to 5 must appear exactly once in each row, each column, and also each of the two main diagonals. 5. **Diagonal Configuration**: Given any arrangement of the digits:    - Let's start by placing the number '5' in any of the shaded cells.    - If 5 is placed in a cell on a diagonal, it restricts the use of '5' in both that diagonal, row, and column. 6. **Attempt to place 5’s**:    - Place a 5 in, say, the top-left cell (which is part of a main diagonal). This immediately eliminates placing another 5 in all those rows, columns, and both main diagonals (bottom-left to top-right diagonal and top-left to bottom-right diagonal). 7. **Contradiction**:    - Consequently, trying to place three 5's especially on or off the diagonals contradicts the given condition that no number repeats in any row, column, or diagonal. Note each diagonal’s constraint:    - If we fix one more 5, we cannot place the third 5 in any cell without repeating it in a row, column, or diagonal. 8. **Conclusion**:    - Since such placement isn’t possible without breaking the rule of uniqueness in any row, column, or diagonal, achieving the sum of 19 in the shaded cells is not possible.

In other words, the coefficient is:    [    sum_{substack{1 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_k leq N  i_1 + i_2 + cdots + i_k = n}} 1    ]        This represents the number of solutions to ( i_1 + i_2 + cdots + i_k = n ) under the given constraints, which is finite since ( n ) is fixed and (i_k leq n). 5. **As (N to infty):**    Now consider (N to infty). For any fixed (n), the coefficient of (x^n) in (prod_{m=1}^{infty}(1+x^m)) is solely determined by the expansion of the finite product (prod_{m=1}^{n}(1+x^m)). This is because all higher order terms (x^m) with (m > n) have no contribution to the coefficient of (x^n). 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, we can write:    [    prod_{m=1}^{infty}left(1+x^{m}right) = sum_{n=0}^{infty} a_n x^n    ]    where each (a_n) is a finite sum determined by the expansion (prod_{m=1}^{n}(1+x^m)). This confirms that the product (prod_{m=1}^{infty}(1+x^m)) corresponds to a well-defined formal power series.

For the four squares adjacent to the center square (top, bottom, left, right), since they cannot share the color of the center, we have only two choices for each. 3. For the corners, which are diagonal to the center, they can be any of the three colors, but must also differ from their adjacent non-diagonal squares. Let's consider one specific configuration: - Color the center square with color 1. - Color the top middle and bottom middle squares with color 2. - Color the left middle and right middle squares with color 3. - Each corner square must differ from its adjacent middle square but can match the center square or another color not adjacent. For the corners: - Top left can be either color 1 or 3. - Top right can be either color 1 or 2. - Bottom left can be either color 1 or 3. - Bottom right can be either color 1 or 2.

Manager's hourly wage: 6.50 2. Dishwasher's hourly wage: Since the dishwasher earns half as much as the manager, we divide the manager's wage by 2:    Dishwasher's wage = 6.50 / 2 = 3.25 3. Chef's hourly wage: The chef earns 2.60 less than the manager per hour, so we subtract 2.60 from the manager's wage:    Chef's wage = 6.50 - 2.60 = 3.90 Now, let's calculate the percentage difference between the chef's and dishwasher's hourly wage: Difference in wages = Chef's wage - Dishwasher's wage Difference in wages = 3.90 - 3.25 = 0.65 To find the percentage difference, we take the difference in wages and divide it by the dishwasher's wage, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Percentage difference = (Difference in wages / Dishwasher's wage) * 100 Percentage difference = (0.65 / 3.25) * 100 Percentage difference = 0.2 * 100 Percentage difference = 20% So, the percentage difference between the chef's and dishwasher's hourly wage is boxed{20%} ."},{"instruction":"a 28 times 35 table, some k cells are colored red, some r cells are colored pink, and the remaining s cells are colored blue.

(12 points)","output":"# Problem: Two adjacent faces of a tetrahedron are isosceles right triangles with a hypotenuse of 2, and they form a dihedral angle of 60 degrees. The tetrahedron rotates around the common edge of these faces. Find the maximum area of the projection of the rotating tetrahedron onto the plane containing this edge. Given that the tetrahedron has two adjacent faces which are isosceles right triangles with a hypotenuse of 2, we start by calculating the area of one such face. 1. **Face Area Calculation:**    Each isosceles right triangle has legs of length ( ell ). According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:    [    ell^2 + ell^2 = 2^2    ]    which simplifies to:    [    2ell^2 = 4 quad Rightarrow quad ell^2 = 2 quad Rightarrow quad ell = sqrt{2}    ]    The area ( S ) of each isosceles right triangle is:    [    S = frac{1}{2} ell cdot ell = frac{1}{2} (sqrt{2})^2 = frac{1}{2} cdot 2 = 1    ] 2. **Projection Area Calculation for ( 0 < varphi < 30^circ ):**    If the face lies in the plane of projection, the area of the projection of the tetrahedron is equal to the area of that face:    [    Pi = S = 1    ]    For a rotation with angle ( 0 < varphi < 30^circ ), the projection area is:    [    Pi = S cos varphi < S = 1    ] 3. **Projection Area Calculation for ( 30^circ < varphi < 90^circ ):**    In this range, the projection area due to both faces is considered:    [    Pi = S cos varphi + S cos psi    ]    Here, ( psi ) is the supplementary angle to ( varphi ). Since the total internal angle is ( 180^circ ) and each face forms an angle of ( 60^circ ) with the projection plane, we have:    [    psi = 180^circ - 60^circ - varphi = 120^circ - varphi Rightarrow cos psi = cos (120^circ - varphi)    ]    Hence the maximum projection area function becomes:    [    Pi = S cos varphi + S cos (120^circ - varphi)    ]    This simplifies to:    [    Pi = cos varphi + cos (120^circ - varphi)    ] 4. **Maximizing the Projection Area:**    For ( varphi = 60^circ ):    [    cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad cos (120^circ - 60^circ) = cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2}    ]    Thus:    [    Pi = cos 60^circ + cos 60^circ  = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1    ] 5. **Projection Area Calculation for ( 90^circ < varphi < 120^circ ):**    In this range, the area of projection is given by:    [    Pi = S cos (90^circ - varphi) = S sin varphi < S = 1    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    The maximum area of the projection of the rotating tetrahedron onto the plane is given by:    [    Pi = S = 1    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"instruction":"At the end of 2000, Walter was one third as old as his grandmother.

We will solve the parts one by one.  Part (a) We need to find the sum:  C_n^0 + C_n^2 + C_n^4 + C_n^6 + ldots  1.

The operation involves subtracting the absolute values. - When two numbers have equal absolute values, regardless of their signs, the result is always 0. - When a number is \\"multiplied-subtracted\\" by 0, or 0 is \\"multiplied-subtracted\\" by a number, the result is the absolute value of the non-zero number.

The coloring must satisfy the condition that if ( A neq f(A) ), then ( A ) and ( f(A) ) are colored differently. Here, ( f(A) ) is defined as the set of elements in ( M ) that are multiples of an odd number of elements in ( A ). 2. **Analyzing the Function ( f(A) ):**    - For any subset ( A subseteq M ), ( f(A) ) is constructed by checking each element ( x in M ) to see if it is a multiple of an odd number of elements in ( A ).    - This function ( f ) has the property that applying it twice, ( f(f(A)) ), does not necessarily return ( A ). 3. **Cycle Analysis:**    - Consider a sequence ( A_0, A_1, A_2, ldots ) where ( A_{i+1} = f(A_i) ).    - If ( A_i = A_j ) for some ( i neq j ), then the sequence forms a cycle.    - We need to ensure that the coloring is such that ( A ) and ( f(A) ) are colored differently if ( A neq f(A) ). 4. **Primitive Cycle and Poset Analysis:**    - Let ( A_0, A_1, ldots, A_{n-1}, A_0 ) be a primitive cycle, meaning ( A_{i+1} = f(A_i) ) and ( A_i neq A_j ) for ( i neq j ).    - Consider the set ( Q ) of maximal elements in the poset ( left(bigcup A_i, midright) ). An element is in ( Q ) if it is maximal in each ( A_i ).    - Define ( R ) as the set of maximal elements in the poset ( left(bigcup A_i setminus Q, midright) ). ( R ) is nonempty due to the non-self-referentiality of the cycle. 5. **Properties of Elements in ( R ):**    - For any ( r in R ), we have ( r in A_i iff r notin A_{i+1} ).    - This implies that ( n ) (the length of the cycle) must be even, as each element in ( R ) alternates between being in ( A_i ) and not being in ( A_{i+1} ). 6. **Conclusion:**    - Since ( n ) must be even, we can use 2 colors to color the subsets such that ( A ) and ( f(A) ) are colored differently.    - Therefore, the minimal number ( k ) satisfying the condition is ( k = 2 ).

Call such a set of sequences a \\"correct\\" set.     - We need to prove that the total length of these sequences is at least (n cdot 2^n). 2. **Dividing the Sequences**:     - Consider three types of sequences based on their lengths:         - **Short sequences**: of length less than (n).         - **Full-length sequences**: of length exactly (n).         - **Long sequences**: of length greater than (n). 3. **Key Observation**:     - If a correct set includes short sequences, it must also contain long sequences.      - Suppose a correct set contains short sequences, we need to show it must also contain long sequences and provide a method to transform the set to contain only full-length sequences without reducing the total length. 4. **Transformation Process**:     - If the set contains short sequences, convert them to full-length sequences by appending all possible combinations of 0 and 1 to make them full-length.     - Start with the assumption that we have at least one short sequence in the original correct set.    5. **Constructing the Transformation**:     - If there is a short sequence of length (k < n), generate all possible sequences of length (n) starting with this sequence. This gives (2^{n-k}) additional sequences each of length (n).     - If the original set contains any sequence that is longer than (n), truncate the last bits to make them of length (k < n). 6. **Mathematical Analysis**:     - When we generate from short sequences, we at least double the number of sequences to be included in the new set.     - Given the condition that no sequence is a prefix of another in a \\"correct\\" set allows this construction without any conflicts.     - If no sequences are short, we focus on the fact that truncation will not violate the condition ((2^n) sequences of exactly length (n) exist). 7. **Final Conclusion**:     - Transforming all sequences into full-length sequences from short ones while truncating longer sequences leads to either maintaining or increasing the sum of lengths.     - Since every transformation step respects the construction conditions and does not decrease the sum of totals,     - Hence, the minimum total length of sequences in a correct set must be at least (n cdot 2^n).

We are given that there is a sphere tangent to both these faces within the dihedral angle. 1. **Initialization and Notation:**    Let's denote the plane angle formed by the faces M and N as alpha, where 0^circ < alpha < 90^circ. To find points A, B, and C in such a way that the perimeter of triangle triangle ABC is minimized, follow the steps below: 2. **Finding Points on Arbitrary Faces:**        - Take any arbitrary point A within the dihedral angle.    - Reflect point A with respect to the face M, and denote the reflected point as A'. Similarly, reflect point A with respect to face N, and denote this reflected point as A''.    - Draw the line segment A'A'', which will intersect the faces M and N at points B and C respectively. 3. **Observation Regarding the Triangle’s Perimeter:**        The perimeter of triangle ABC is given by:    [    l_{triangle ABC} = AB + BC + CA    ]        By using the reflections, we can rewrite this as:    [    l_{triangle ABC} = A'B + BC + CA''    ]        By construction of the reflections, it follows that:    [    l_{triangle ABC} = A'A''    ]    Among all possible points, the direct line segment A'A'' between the reflected points provides the shortest path by principles of geometric reflection. 4. **Special Considerations When Points Lie on the Sphere Surface:**    Now, consider the placement of points on the surface of the sphere:        - Let A reduce to lie on the surface of the sphere such that the distance from A to the line PQ (where PQ is the tangent line common to both faces M and N) is minimized.    - Denote E and F as intersection points of AA' and AA'' with the faces M and N respectively. 5. **Distance and Angular Considerations:**    Since triangle AEF lies on a plane perpendicular to the common tangent line PQ, and given PQ is perpendicular to both AE and AF, then PQ is also perpendicular to the plane AEF.        - Construct the perpendicular from the center O of the sphere to the line PQ, meeting at point G. Thus, angle EGF = alpha and A, E, G, F are concyclic.    - Since EF forms part of triangle AEF whose length EF is determined by the distance AG, we have:      [      EF = AG sin alpha      ]          The perimeter is then doubled for the shortest distance along the reflection path:      [      l_{triangle ABC} = 2EF = 2AG sin alpha      ] 6. **Minimization and Conclusion:**    The minimal value of AG minimizes EF thus minimizing l_{triangle ABC}. This happens when A is placed such that the distance to PQ is the shortest possible, i.e., when A is perpendicular to PQ on the sphere surface at point A. To summarize, the points A, B, C are determined by:    - Drawing the perpendicular from the center of the sphere O to PQ, and letting it intersect the sphere at A for the minimal distance.    - Using geometric reflection properties to determine B and C such that they lie directly determined by the shortest reflection path. Thus, the exact method of constructing triangle ABC involves reflecting to minimize distance and using properties of angles and tangent lines.

Songhwa drank 0.6 liters less than Seokhyung, so we subtract 0.6 liters from Seokhyung's total: Songhwa's total = Seokhyung's total - 0.6 liters Songhwa's total = 1.5 liters - 0.6 liters = 0.9 liters Now, let's compare the amounts: - Mina drank 0.6 liters - Seokhyung drank 1.5 liters - Songhwa drank 0.9 liters Seokhyung drank the most cola, with a total of boxed{1.5}  liters."},{"instruction":"What does 2^{1} equal to?

The general term formula for this expansion is:  T_{r+1} = C_{10}^r cdot x^{10-r} cdot x^{-r} = C_{10}^r cdot x^{10-2r}  Now, we need the coefficient of the x^6 term. For the x^6 term, we need to solve the equation 10-2r=6 to get the value of r. Solving this, we find:  r = 2  Thus, the coefficient of the x^6 term is C_{10}^2. Similarly, for the x^4 term (which affects the x^6 term when multiplied by x^2 from (x^2-a)), we set 10-2r=4 and solve for r:  r = 3  Hence, the coefficient of the x^4 term is C_{10}^3. Combining these results, the coefficient of the x^6 term in the expansion of (x^2-a)(x+frac{1}{x})^{10} is:  C_{10}^3 - aC_{10}^2 = 30  Using the known binomial coefficients C_{10}^3 = 120 and C_{10}^2 = 45, we can substitute and solve for a:  120 - 45a = 30   90 = 45a   a = 2  With the value of a found, we can now evaluate the integral:  int_{0}^{a} (3x^2+1) , dx = int_{0}^{2} (3x^2+1) , dx  Integrating term by term:  left[ x^3 + x right]_{0}^{2} = (2^3 + 2) - (0^3 + 0) = 8 + 2 = 10  Therefore, the solution to the integral is:  boxed{10}"},{"instruction":"f {2, 3}subsetneq M subsetneq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then the number of possible sets for M is (　　) A: 5 B: 6 C: 7 D: 8","output":"Given that {2, 3}subsetneq M subsetneq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we need to find the non-empty proper subsets of the set {1, 4, 5}. Any subset of {1, 4, 5} may include or not include each of the numbers 1, 4, and 5, which gives us 2^3 possible combinations including the empty set and the set itself.

Each of these elements can either be included in the subset M or not, leading to 2 options per element. 4. Since there are three such elements, the number of subsets these elements can form is 2^3. 5. However, we must exclude the empty set (since M is non-empty) and the full set (since it's a proper subset), reducing the total by 2. Hence, 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6. 6.

Since it's 10% jasmine, we have: 10% of 100 liters = 0.10 * 100 liters = 10 liters of jasmine Now, 5 liters of jasmine are added, so the total amount of jasmine in the new solution is: 10 liters + 5 liters = 15 liters of jasmine Let's denote the amount of water added as W liters. The new total volume of the solution after adding 5 liters of jasmine and W liters of water is: 100 liters + 5 liters + W liters = 105 liters + W liters We are given that the new solution is 8.695652173913043% jasmine. To find the new percentage of jasmine in the solution, we can set up the following equation: (15 liters of jasmine) / (105 liters + W liters) = 8.695652173913043% Now, let's solve for W: 15 / (105 + W) = 0.08695652173913043 Multiplying both sides by (105 + W) to get rid of the denominator: 15 = 0.08695652173913043 * (105 + W) Now, let's solve for W: 15 = 9.130434782608695 + 0.08695652173913043 * W Subtract 9.130434782608695 from both sides: 15 - 9.130434782608695 = 0.08695652173913043 * W 5.869565217391305 = 0.08695652173913043 * W Now, divide both sides by 0.08695652173913043 to solve for W: W = 5.869565217391305 / 0.08695652173913043 W ≈ 67.5 liters Therefore, approximately boxed{67.5}  liters of water were added to the solution."},{"instruction":"ern which could be filled in 7 hours takes one hour more to be filled owing to a leak in its bottom . if the cistern is full in what time will the leak empty it ?","output":"Let's denote the rate at which the cistern fills without the leak as ( R ) cisterns per hour.

We can compute the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem.    - The length (d) of the diagonal of a (2 times 1) rectangle is given by:      [      d = sqrt{(2^2 + 1^2)} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5}      ] 6. **Conclusion:**    Since at least one of these smaller (2 times 1) rectangles will contain at least two of the points, and the maximum distance between any two points in the same smaller rectangle is the length of the diagonal, which is (sqrt{5}), it follows that the distance between at least one pair of points will be at most (sqrt{5}).

Therefore, ( PFDT ) indeed forms a rhombus. 3. **Distance Relationship:**     Since ( F ) and ( D ) are equally distant from the vertex tangent line ( e ) (because the vertex tangent line ( e ) is equidistant to them), consequently, ( P ) and ( T ) must also be equidistant from ( e ). 4. **Constant Distance:**     Since ( P ) and ( e ) are fixed, the distance ( a ) between ( P ) and ( e ) is constant. This distance is not dependent upon the position of the varying focus ( F ) of the parabolas. 5. **Locus Characteristics:**     Consequently, all valid positions of point ( T ) for different ( F ) create a line ( t ) parallel to ( e ), which is located at a fixed distance ( a ) away from ( e ). Due to symmetry and the distance equality properties discussed, ( FT = FP ). 6. **Specific Parabola Definition:**     Thus, the locus of all such points ( F ) (foci of the parabolas) that satisfies the stated conditions forms a parabola. This particular parabola has its focus at ( P ), directrix ( t ), and its vertex tangent line as ( e ). 7. **Final Conclusion:**     It's straightforward to confirm that any point ( F ) on this resultant parabola will satisfy the given conditions for forming a parabola with vertex tangent on ( e ). If ( F ) is exactly at the parabola’s vertex, then the corresponding parabola degenerates into a line.         Therefore, the final answer to the problem is that the geometric place of the parabolas' foci meeting the given conditions is itself a parabola whose focus is ( P ) and whose directrix is parallel to ( e ) and at distance ( a ).

This implies a hypothetical addition and subtraction of 7 taels per person.    - Similarly, each person is considered to have half a catty (which equals 16 taels) more and less. This translates to an addition and subtraction of 8 taels per person (since half a catty is 8 taels). 2. **Formulating the Equations:**    - The first condition translates to an equation where the total silver (n) is equal to the amount each person would have if 7 taels were added to their share, across all m people, plus the 7 taels added or subtracted in total. This gives us the equation 7m + 7 = n.    - The second condition translates to an equation where the total silver (n) is equal to the amount each person would have if 8 taels were subtracted from their share, across all m people, minus the 8 taels added or subtracted in total.

Let B be the midpoint of the edge opposite to A.

According to Problem 14.3 (as referenced), the centroid M is the midpoint of the line segment joining A and B.

The third pipe empties the cistern at a rate of C/25 per hour. The fourth pipe fills the cistern at a rate of C/15 per hour. The fifth pipe empties the cistern at a rate of C/30 per hour. When all pipes are open, the combined rate of filling the cistern is the sum of the rates of the filling pipes minus the sum of the rates of the emptying pipes: Combined rate = (Rate of first pipe + Rate of second pipe + Rate of fourth pipe) - (Rate of third pipe + Rate of fifth pipe) Combined rate = (C/10 + C/12 + C/15) - (C/25 + C/30) To add and subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Then the Bear will always take 1 chocolate each turn until the end. This forces Masha to take another single chocolate each turn as well. The Bear will take chocolates 2, 4, ..., 18, and the 20th chocolate, leading to Bear's win. 4. **Doubling or Tripling Strategy**:     - Suppose Masha starts by taking 2 chocolates.

Since (D) is a reflection point, (DA = 2BA).    - Given ( angle A = 90^circ ), triangle (ABC) is a right triangle with (A) as the right angle.    - Since ( angle AXB = angle AXC = 90^circ ), (X) is placed at the foot of the height from (A) to (BC), and therefore lies on (BC).    - In triangle (AXC), (XC) is the hypotenuse and (XA) is a leg.

Substituting the values:    - For (5, 10, 5): Perimeter = (5+10+5)-6 = 14    - For (6, 6, 6): Perimeter = (6+6+6)-6 = 12    - For (8, 4, 8): Perimeter = (8+4+8)-6 = 14    - For (12, 3, 12): Perimeter = (12+3+12)-6 = 21 7. **Conclusion:**    The largest possible perimeter is obtained with the configuration (12, 3, 12), which gives a perimeter of boxed{21}."},{"instruction":"walk 1 mile every 15 minutes.

Therefore, the reaction is in a 1:1:1 molar ratio. If we have 2 moles of H2O, we will need 2 moles of CaO to react completely with the water to form 2 moles of Ca(OH)2. Since the amount of CaO needed is given as 112, we need to determine the molar mass of CaO to find out how many moles of CaO correspond to 112 grams. The molar mass of CaO is calculated as follows: - Molar mass of Ca (Calcium) = 40.08 g/mol - Molar mass of O (Oxygen) = 16.00 g/mol - Molar mass of CaO = 40.08 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol = 56.08 g/mol Now, we can calculate the number of moles of CaO that correspond to 112 grams: Number of moles of CaO = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) Number of moles of CaO = 112 g / 56.08 g/mol ≈ 2 moles Since we have 2 moles of CaO, and the reaction is in a 1:1:1 molar ratio, we will form 2 moles of Ca(OH)2.

After 100 seconds, the process stops.

This is because divisors usually come in pairs, except when (n) is a perfect square (as the square root is repeated). 3. **List the Perfect Squares Between 1 and 100:**    - The perfect squares in the range from 1 to 100 are (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ..., 10^2), or (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100).    - There are 10 perfect squares within this range. 4. **Calculating the Total Number of Bulbs that Remain On:**    - Since only the bulbs in positions that are perfect squares will remain on, there are 10 such bulbs that will be on after 100 seconds. 5. **Probability Calculation:**    - The total number of bulbs is 100.    - The probability (P) that a randomly chosen bulb is on after the process is:      [      P = frac{text{Number of bulbs that remain on}}{text{Total number of bulbs}} = frac{10}{100} = 0.1      ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{0.1} ]"},{"instruction":"Wilson goes to a fastfood restaurant.

To determine the minimum and maximum number of real roots, we use the Intermediate Value Theorem and Descartes' Rule of Signs. 1. **Intermediate Value Theorem**: Since a cubic function is continuous and its range is (-infty, +infty), it must cross the x-axis at least once. This guarantees at least one real root. 2. **Descartes' Rule of Signs**: The maximum number of positive real roots is equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial, or less than that by an even number.     - For a cubic polynomial, the maximum number of sign changes is three, which means the maximum number of real roots (whether positive or negative) is three.     - Since a cubic equation can have either one or two turning points, it can also have one or two complex roots. However, complex roots always come in conjugate pairs, so if there's one complex root, there must be another one that is its conjugate.     - Therefore, if a cubic polynomial has more than one real root, it can only have two, and the third would be complex, which is not possible. Hence, a cubic polynomial cannot have exactly two real roots; it must always have either one real root and two complex ones, or three real roots. 3. **Examples**:     - The equation x^3 = 0 has a single real root, x = 0.    - The equation x(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 has three distinct real roots, x = 0, x = 2, and x = 3.

Since we can't load half a car, we'll consider the maximum whole number of automobiles that can be loaded, which is 62. To find the maximum weight of an automobile, we divide the total weight capacity of the ferry by the number of automobiles: 100,000 pounds / 62 automobiles = 1612.9 pounds/automobile Since we need to find the maximum weight, we can round down to the nearest whole pound: Maximum weight of an automobile = 1612 pounds However, this calculation is based on the maximum number of whole automobiles that can be loaded.

Consider the first scenario where none of the numbers is a perfect square:    - If ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are not perfect squares, none of the subsequent terms generated by these two initial terms will be perfect squares since the product of a non-square with any number or its powers will not yield a perfect square. 5.

Consider the scenario where exactly one of the first two numbers is a perfect square:    - Let’s assume ( a_1 = x^2 ) and ( a_2 = b ) (where ( b ) is not a perfect square).

Without loss of generality, let's consider three birds of species (A), named (A_1), (A_2), and (A_3).    - Let the number of birds between (A_1) and (A_2) be (2x), and the number of birds between (A_2) and (A_3) be (2y). These counts are ensured to be even to satisfy the problem condition. 3. **Summing Up Birds Between the First and the Last of the Same Species**:    - The total number of birds between (A_1) and (A_3) would be:      [      2x + 2y + 1      ]      Here, the (+1) accounts for the bird (A_2) sitting between (A_1) and (A_3).      - This sum (2x + 2y + 1) is clearly an *odd number*. 4. **Contradiction**:    - Since we have derived that there would be an odd number of birds between (A_1) and (A_3), this contradicts the given condition that between any two birds of the same species, there must be an *even* number of birds.    - Therefore, it is impossible to have three or more birds of the same species. 5. **Determining the Minimum Number of Species**:    - Given the above condition, each species can only have up to 2 birds.    - To find the minimum number of species required, we set (s) as the total number of species. Each species can at most have 2 birds. 6. **Calculation**:    - Let (s) be the number of species, then the maximum number of birds for (s) species is (2s).    - We need these (2s) birds to be equal to or greater than 2021 to cover the total number of birds.

The number of brand A ice creams should not exceed three times the number of brand B ice creams, which gives us the inequality: [m leq 3(40 - m)] Solving the first inequality: [12m + 600 - 15m leq 540] [-3m leq -60] [m geq 20] Solving the second inequality: [m leq 120 - 3m] [4m leq 120] [m leq 30] Therefore, 20 leq m leq 30.

Completing the square for x, we get:    [    x^{2}-3x+y^{2}=1 implies (x-frac{3}{2})^{2}-frac{9}{4}+y^{2}=1 implies (x-frac{3}{2})^{2}+y^{2}=frac{13}{4}    ]    This shows that the circle has a center at (frac{3}{2}, 0) and a radius r=sqrt{frac{13}{4}}=frac{sqrt{13}}{2}. 2. **Calculate the distance from the center of the circle to the line l**: The line l is given by y=k(x-1). The distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}.

A \\"lattice polygon\\" is a polygon where every vertex is a lattice point.    We are given a convex lattice polygon Gamma and need to prove that Gamma can be enclosed within another convex lattice polygon Gamma' such that all vertices of Gamma lie on the boundary of Gamma', and Gamma' contains exactly one vertex that is not a vertex of Gamma. 2. **Concept of Convex Hull:**    According to the problem, the lattice polygon Gamma' is the convex hull of the lattice polygon Gamma and an additional lattice point T outside of Gamma. The convex hull of Gamma cup {T} can be used to ensure T meets the criteria if the interior of this convex hull does not contain any vertices of Gamma. This implies that the choice of the lattice point T meets the requirement. 3. **Defining Basic Line Segments:**    For any line segment PQ whose endpoints are lattice points, P and Q, all intermediate lattice points divide PQ into equal segments of lengths called \\"basic segments\\". The length of each basic segment is denoted as l(PQ). 4. **Maximum Basic Length:**    Let (AB), (BC), and (CD) be three consecutive edges of the convex lattice polygon Gamma, with (BC) being the edge with the maximum basic length among all edges of Gamma. 5. **Convex Region and Selection of Point T:**    Consider the convex region formed by the edge (BC) and the rays (AB) and (DC). If this region does not include the edges (i.e., it is an open region), we select a lattice point T within this region such that (overrightarrow{BT} = overrightarrow{AB}). Clearly, T satisfies the requirements. 6. **Intersection Point X:**    Suppose the region is bounded. The rays (AB) and (DC) intersect at point X. 7. **Existence of a Lattice Point in Triangle BCX:**    We need to prove that there exists at least one lattice point inside triangle BCX (excluding the edge BC). We use a proof by contradiction.    Suppose there are no such lattice points. Select a point (C') on edge BC such that (BC' = l(BC)). On line segment BX, select a point X' such that (overrightarrow{C'X'}) is in the same direction as (overrightarrow{CX}). Let point D' be such that (overrightarrow{C'D'} = overrightarrow{CD}). Now, in triangle BC'X', only B and C' are lattice points. 8. **Half-Plane Consideration:**    Consider the half-plane bounded by line BC that does not contain any other internal points of the convex lattice polygon Gamma. Draw lines parallel to BC through lattice points, and let l be the closest parallel line to BC. Let A' be the intersection of the extension of AB with line l, and KL be a basic segment on line l through A', with overrightarrow{KL} = overrightarrow{BC'}.

This implies there are no lattice points in the interior of the strip bounded by BK and C'L.    Let BX' intersect C'L at point M, and C'X' intersect BK at point N, ensuring segments BM and C'N contain no interior lattice points.

Due to the arrangement of P (not at the center), symmetry lines are considered along vertical, horizontal, and potential diagonal lines passing through P. 4. **Counting Potential Symmetric Points:**    - **Horizontal Line through P**: There are 6 points (excluding P itself) on the horizontal line at y=4.    - **Vertical Line through P**: There are 6 points (excluding P itself) on the vertical line at x=3.    - **Diagonals through P**: There are fewer diagonals containing symmetric points because P is off-center. For simplicity, it is assumed from this position that no diagonal symmetry exists given the non-central alignment of P. 5. **Calculating Probability:**    P lies on a vertical and horizontal line where symmetry may exist. The combined total points on these lines are 6 (vertical) + 6 (horizontal) = 12 unique points.

Let’s examine whether a prime number n is a \\"good\\" number:    - Suppose n is a prime number. By definition, n can be expressed as a product of itself and 1:     [    n = n times 1    ]    - Now, consider the sum. If we attempt to represent n as a sum of k terms where k geq 2, we observe that:    [    n = n + 1 < n + (any positive number)     ]    - This implies that n as a prime number cannot be uniquely expressed as a sum and product of k natural numbers with k geq 2. Hence, prime numbers are not \\"good\\" numbers. 3. Next, consider a natural number n that is a product of two prime numbers, i.e., n = p cdot q where both p and q are primes:    - Express n as a product:    [    n = p cdot q    ]    - Express n as a sum:    [    n = p + q + (p cdot q - p - q + 1)    ]    - Notice that:    [    n = (p cdot q) = n quad text{and} quad n = (p+q+1)  quad text{simplifies to some equivalency}    ]    - Intuition: This form satisfies the unique expression condition where ( k = 3 ) distinct terms in the sum and product form.    - Specifically, the number  pq  could be split uniquely into this form due to product properties and sums linearly. 4.

What is the minimum number of dollars needed to determine which row has the different weight?","output":"To find out which row has a different weight, we need to analyze the given arrangement of the apples. Let us denote the weights of the rows as follows: 1. Let ( L_1, L_2, L_3 ) be the weights of the three diagonal (bold) rows as indicated in the image provided in the problem. 2. Let ( V_1, V_2, V_3 ) be the weights of the three vertical rows. According to the problem, the total weight of the apples in the nine rows should be equal whether they are calculated by summing the weights of the diagonal rows or the vertical rows. Therefore, we have the equation: [ L_1 + L_2 + L_3 = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 ] This total weight calculation is simply the sum of the weights of all nine apples. Since it is given that nine of the rows have the same weight, and only one row (the tenth row) has a different weight, let's analyze further. The weights ( L_1 ) to ( L_3 ) and ( V_1 ) to ( V_3 ) should be equal and can be denoted by a common weight ( t ). Thus: [ L_1 = t, L_2 = t, L_3 = t ] [ V_1 = t, V_2 = t, V_3 = t ] By inference, this common weight ( t ) makes up the sum of the weights of nine of the rows. We also calculate the weight for the remaining three diagonal rows, which will also be equal to ( t ) for consistency: [ D_1 = t, D_2 = t, D_3 = t ] Now we have identified nine rows whose weights are equal to ( t ). Therefore, the remaining row, which is the horizontal row, must have a weight different from ( t ). By logic and the given conditions, this horizontal row is the unique row with a different weight.

Notice that for any even ( n ), ( 2^n ) is also even, and thus ( 2^n - n ) is even. Therefore, ( 2 ) divides ( 2^n - n ) for any even ( n ). Since there are infinitely many even numbers, there are infinitely many ( n ) such that ( 2 ) divides ( 2^n - n ). 2. **Case 2: ( p ) is an odd prime**    For an odd prime ( p ), we use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that ( 2^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). We need to find ( n ) such that ( p ) divides ( 2^n - n ), i.e., ( 2^n equiv n pmod{p} ).

Finally, find the range of m. **Enhanced Solution**: Since f(-x)=2(-x)+frac{1}{2}sin(-x)=-(2x+frac{1}{2}sin x)=-f(x), f(x) is an odd function. Also, f'(x)=2+frac{1}{2}cos x>0 for all x, so f(x) is strictly increasing. The inequality f(mx-3)+f(x)<0 can be rewritten as f(mx-3)<-f(x)=f(-x). Since f(x) is strictly increasing, we have mx-3<-x, or mx+x-3<0. For any xin[-2,2], we require mx+x-3<0 to hold. This leads to the system of inequalities: begin{cases} -2m-2-3<0  2m+2-3<0 end{cases}Rightarrow -frac{5}{2}<m<frac{1}{2}. Thus, the range of m is boxed{-frac{5}{2}<m<frac{1}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Every positive [integer](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Integer) k has a unique factorial base expansion (f_1,f_2,f_3,ldots,f_m), meaning that k=1!cdot f_1+2!cdot f_2+3!cdot f_3+cdots+m!cdot f_m, where each f_i is an integer, 0le f_ile i, and 0<f_m.

All other (f_k) are zero. 5. **Calculating the Alternating Sum**:    We need to compute:    [    f_1 - f_2 + f_3 - f_4 + cdots + (-1)^{j+1} f_j    ]    Since (f_k = k) for the specified ranges and zero otherwise, we focus on the non-zero terms:    [    -1 + sum_{m=0}^{61} sum_{k=32m}^{32m+15} (-1)^{k+1} k    ]    Each inner sum over (k) from (32m) to (32m+15) simplifies to 8, as each pair of terms (k) and (k+1) within the sum contributes 1 to the total (due to the alternating signs and consecutive integers). 6. **Final Calculation**:    [    -1 + 62 times 8 = -1 + 496 = 495    ] Thus, the value of (f_1-f_2+f_3-f_4+cdots+(-1)^{j+1}f_j) is (boxed{495})."},{"instruction":"A triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the even integers (2, 4, 6, ldots, 100) in increasing order.

We wish to find all ((n, k)) such that (73 | b(n, k) = 2^{n-1}(n + 2k)). Since (2^{n-1}) and (73) are relatively prime (73 is prime and does not divide 2), it follows that (73 | n + 2k). The first row has 50 elements, with (k) ranging from 1 to 50, and decreasing by 1 element per row thereafter, so (1 leq k leq 50 - n). Hence, [  n + 2k leq n + 2(50-n) = 100 - n,  ] which means (n + 2k leq 100). Thus, (n + 2k = 73) is the only possibility under this constraint, since (73 leq 100).

The average retail price of the 20 products is 1,200, so the total retail price for all products is ( 20 times 1,200 = 24,000 ) dollars.

The other 10 products that sell for at least 1,000 could include the most expensive product, which is 11,000. To maximize the selling price of the most expensive product, we should minimize the selling price of the other 9 products that sell for at least 1,000. Since we want to find the minimum selling price for any product, we'll assume these 9 products are sold exactly at 1,000. So, the total price for these 9 products is ( 9 times 1,000 = 9,000 ) dollars. Now, we have the most expensive product at 11,000 and the total price for the 9 products at 9,000, which adds up to ( 11,000 + 9,000 = 20,000 ) dollars. The remaining amount to reach the total retail price of 24,000 must come from the 10 products sold at the minimum price ( P_{min} ). This amount is ( 24,000 - 20,000 = 4,000 ) dollars.

Since f(x) has an extreme value at x=1, we have f'(1) = 0. Therefore, 12(1)^{2} - 2a(1) - 2b = 0, which simplifies to a + b = 6. Given that a > 0 and b > 0, we can apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of two positive numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In this case, we have: frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}. Since a + b = 6, we can square both sides and rearrange the terms to get: ab leq left(frac{a+b}{2}right)^2 = 9.

The points dividing each edge (T) into three equal parts will become the vertices of our convex body (U). This body (U) has vertices labeled (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M). 2. **Identifying the Body Diagonals:**    Each vertex of (U) connects via body diagonals to vertices on the opposing edges. Hence, there are 12 body diagonals:         [ A J, A K, B L, B M, C G, C H, D J, D K, E L, E M, F G, F H. ]    These diagonals have equal lengths due to the symmetrical properties of the tetrahedron and its rotations. 3. **Calculating the Length of a Body Diagonal:**    To find the length of the body diagonal (AK):        - Observe that in the tetrahedron, (T), the edge length (PQ) is (3b).    - The segment (AB) equals (b) and (BK) is (2b) in the rectangle (V_1).    - By the Pythagorean theorem in triangle (ABK):            [      AK = sqrt{AB^2 + BK^2} = sqrt{b^2 + (2b)^2} = sqrt{b^2 + 4b^2} = sqrt{5b^2} = b sqrt{5}.      ] 4. **Determining the Distance from the Center:**    Next, we find the distance from the center (O):        - Calculate the tetrahedron's height (T) as:            [      h = sqrt{(PQ sqrt{2/3})^2 + b^2} = 3b sqrt{2/3} = b sqrt{6}.      ]        - Hence, from the center (O) to the midpoint of a face:            [      ON = frac{h}{4} = frac{b sqrt{6}}{4}.      ]        - Knowing that the distance (OK) in the triangle (ONK) is:            [      OK = sqrt{ON^2 + NK^2} = sqrt{left(frac{b sqrt{6}}{4}right)^2 + b^2} = sqrt{frac{6b^2}{16} + b^2} = sqrt{frac{6b^2 + 16b^2}{16}} = b frac{sqrt{22}}{4}.      ]        - Then distance from (O) to (AK):            [      d = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} b.      ] 5. **Counting the Interior Intersection Points:**    - Each body diagonal intersects with 3 others.

For any two rows, there is at least one column where the two intersecting cells contain the same number.

(factorial of 9) possible permutations of this set. 2. **Partitioning the Permutations:**    We can partition the set of all permutations of ({1, ldots, 9}) into (8!) groups, each containing 9 permutations.

This would mean that these two rows are identical up to a cyclic shift, which contradicts the requirement that any two rows must be distinct. 4. **Maximum ( n ):**    Therefore, the maximum number of rows ( n ) must be ( 8! ). 5. **Constructing ( n = 8! ) Rows:**    For ( n = 8! ), we can construct the rows as follows: consider ( 8! ) rows of the form ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_8, 9)), where ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_8)) is a permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, 8}). Each row is distinct, and for any two rows, there is at least one column where the two intersecting cells contain the same number (the number 9 in the last column).

The radius R of the circumscribed circle of each square (which is half the diagonal) is therefore 3sqrt{2}. 3. **Determine the Side Length of the Dodecagon**:    The angle subtended by each side of the dodecagon at the center is frac{360^circ}{12} = 30^circ.

He had: 7 one-dollar bills = 7 * 1 = 7 4 five-dollar bills = 4 * 5 = 20 2 ten-dollar bills = 2 * 10 = 20 1 twenty-dollar bill = 1 * 20 = 20 Adding all of these together, Frank had a total of: 7 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 67 After buying the peanuts, Frank has 4 in change. This means he spent: 67 - 4 = 63 on peanuts. Since peanuts cost 3 a pound, we can calculate how many pounds he bought by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost per pound: 63 / 3 per pound = 21 pounds of peanuts. Frank plans to eat all the peanuts in one week, which has 7 days.

This can be expressed as: y = z - 0.60z y = 0.40z  (since 0.60z is 60% of z) Now, we can substitute the value of y from the second equation into the first equation to express x in terms of z: x = 1.20y x = 1.20 * (0.40z) x = 0.48z  (since 1.20 * 0.40 = 0.48) This means that x is boxed{48}  percent of z."},{"instruction":"f the function y = f(x) is the inverse function of y = a^x (where a > 0 and a neq 1), and f(2) = 1, then f(x) = ________.","output":"The definition of an inverse function indicates that f(x) would undo whatever the original function does. Since the original function is an exponential function y = a^x, the inverse function f(x) should be a logarithmic function with the base a, i.e., f(x) = log_a x.  Because we are given that f(2) = 1, we can set up the equation:  f(2) = log_a 2 = 1  From the properties of logarithms, we know that log_a a = 1. Therefore, to make the equation true, a must be equal to 2. To clarify this step, we reason that if log_a 2 = 1, then a raised to the power of 1 must equal 2:  a^1 = 2 Rightarrow a = 2  So, the base of the logarithmic function that is the inverse of y = a^x must be 2. Therefore, the function f(x) is:  f(x) = log_2 x  We can confirm this by plugging x = 2 into f(x):  f(2) = log_2 2 = 1  which satisfies the condition provided in the problem.

To find the general term (a_n), we start by solving the recurrence relation. Notice that the sequence follows a periodic pattern of 6 terms. We can express the first 6 terms of the sequence as:    [    a_1, a_2, a_2 - a_1, -a_1, -a_2, a_1 - a_2    ] 4. One period for the sequence is given by:    [    a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1) - a_1 - a_2 + (a_1 - a_2) = 0    ]    The sum of any 6 consecutive terms is zero, proving the periodicity. 5. We know the sum of the first 1492 terms. Note that 1492 is 6 times 248 plus 4. Hence, we have:    [    1492 = 6 cdot 248 + 4    ]    This means the first 1492 terms cover 248 complete periods plus the first 4 terms of the next period. 6. Similarly, for the first 1985 terms:    [    1985 = 6 cdot 330 + 5    ]    So, this means the first 1985 terms cover 330 complete periods plus the first 5 terms of the next period. 7. Thus, the sum ( S_{1492} ) includes:    [    S_{1492} = 248 cdot 0 + a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1) - a_1 = 1985    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    2a_2 - 2a_1 = 1985    ]    [    a_2 - a_1 = 992.5    ]    But since (a_1) and (a_2) must be integers, this equation restricts the form of (a_1) and (a_2). 8. For ( S_{1985} ):    [    S_{1985} = 330 cdot 0 + a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1) - a_1 - a_2 = 1492    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    -a_1 = 1492    ] 9.

Since ( F_1 ) has ( 2^p ) subsets, it follows that the number of non-empty subsets is ( 2^p - 1 ). 4. **Divisibility by ( p )**:    For ( s(T) equiv 0 pmod{p} ), these subsets' element sums must be divisible by ( p ). This condition effectively reduces our problem to counting specific kinds of subsets in ( F_1 ). 5. **Important Divisibility Fact**:    We'll make use of the fact that ( s(F_1) = sum_{i=1}^{p} i = frac{p(p+1)}{2} ). So, ( s(F_1) equiv frac{p(p+1)}{2} pmod{p} ). Since ( p ) is prime, ( frac{p(p+1)}{2} equiv 0 pmod{p} text{ if } p+1 ) is even, giving us key insights for further counts. 6. **Counting Valid Subsets**:    We assert based on the problem's requirement that any integer subset ( s(T) ) in ( F_1 ) (which includes ( F )), must satisfy ( p mid s(T) ). Hence, out of ( 2^{p-1} ) possible subsets in ( F ), exactly ( frac{2^{p-1}}{p} ) such subsets must meet our criterion (as each ( T subseteq F ) corresponds to one or more satisfying modulo conditions). Therefore, considering ( frac{2^p-2}{p}+1 ) and non-empty criteria, the number of non-empty subsets ( T subset F ) such that ( p mid s(T) ) is: [ boxed{frac{2^{p-1} - 1}{p}} ] This accounts for all necessary subsets in a set ( F )."},{"instruction":"You are trying to find the length of any side of a right triangle.

Ферритовый чашечный сердечник обладает высокой прочностью и жесткостью благодаря своей компактной структуре. Он представляет собой специально обработанный ферромагнитный материал, который может выдерживать большие усилия, как сжатие, так и растяжение. Поэтому при попытке разорвать его руками или инструментом, чашечный сердечник не дает никаких признаков слома, а только крошится при ударе. Однако, когда в высокооборотистом моторе безщеточном разворачивается большая энергия вращения, действующая на сердечник, то в нем возникают большие механические напряжения. Возможно, сердечник находится на грани своей прочности и при достижении определенной скорости вращения, механические напряжения превышают предел прочности материала. Это приводит к его разрушению и разлету на несколько кусков без значительного усилия. Поэтому, различие в поведении сердечника в этих двух случаях объясняется разными видами приложенных усилий и механизмами разрушения материала."},{"instruction":"Ну допустим если сердечник имеет вес около 50 грамм, какую энергию надо приложить, чтобы раскрутить его до 12 тысяч оборотов в минуту, если его диаметр составляет условно 3 см и высота 1 см?","output":"Чтобы рассчитать энергию, необходимую для раскрутки сердечника до определенной скорости, мы можем использовать формулу для кинетической энергии вращения: E = (1/2) * I * ω², где E - кинетическая энергия, I - момент инерции, ω - угловая скорость. Для цилиндрического сердечника момент инерции можно вычислить по следующей формуле: I = (1/2) * m * r², где m - масса сердечника, r - радиус сердечника. Для данного примера масса сердечника составляет 50 г (или 0,05 кг), а радиус - 1,5 см (или 0,015 м). Теперь у нас есть всё, что нужно, чтобы рассчитать кинетическую энергию: I = (1/2) * 0,05 * (0,015)² = 1.125 * 10^(-5) кг·м² Также нам дана угловая скорость в минуту, но её нужно перевести в радианы в секунду: ω = (2π * 12,000) / 60 = 1256,64 рад/с Подставляем значения в формулу для кинетической энергии: E = (1/2) * 1.125 * 10^(-5) * (1256,64)² = 8,88 Дж Таким образом, чтобы раскрутить сердечник до 12 тысяч оборотов в минуту, необходимо приложить приблизительно 8,88 Дж энергии."},{"instruction":"Скажите а почему при приложении усилия несколько сотен или даже тысяч Джоулей он не разрушается, а по описанию при приложении усилия 8 Джоулей легко разлетается?","output":"При разрушении материала, включая сердечник, важную роль играют такие факторы, как интенсивность приложенных усилий и скорость их приложения. В первом случае, когда приложены усилия нескольких сотен или тысяч джоулей, вероятно, что сердечник не разрушается, поскольку усилия могут быть распределены по всей его объему и поверхности. При этом перемещение и концентрация энергии в материале недостаточны для вызывания его разрушения. Однако, при приложении небольшой энергии (например, 8 Джоулей) через высокооборотистый мотор на сердечник, эта энергия сосредотачивается и передается в материал мгновенно. Это может вызвать механическую деформацию или разрыв структуры материала в уязвимых местах, которые не выдерживают даже небольшие механические напряжения. Таким образом, скорость и направленность приложения сравнительно небольшой энергии (как в случае с мотором) могут сильно повлиять на разрушение материала, включая сердечник."},{"instruction":"скажите а правильно ли я понимаю, что для поднятия веса 1 кг на высоту 1 метр наверное надо затратить 1000 джоулей или нет","output":"Да, вы правильно понимаете.

Это следует из простой формулы для работы: работа = сила * путь, где работа измеряется в джоулях, сила в ньютонах и путь в метрах. В данном случае сила равна массе 1 кг, умноженной на ускорение свободного падения (около 9,8 м/с²), и путь равен 1 метру. Таким образом, работа будет равна: работа = 1 кг * 9,8 м/с² * 1 м = 9,8 дж.

Rötelnviren befallen nur Menschen., Neben den typischen roten Hautflecken (ein masernähnliches Exanthem) können auch Fieber und Lymphknotenschwellungen auftreten. Eine Rötelninfektion während der Schwangerschaft kann zu schweren Komplikationen (Rötelnembryofetopathie) mit ausgeprägten Fehlbildungen des Kindes und zu Fehlgeburten führen. Die Behandlung besteht in rein symptomatischen Maßnahmen (Linderung der Krankheitssymptome). Eine vorbeugende Impfung mittels Rötelnimpfstoff ist verfügbar., Röteln sind in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz meldepflichtig., Epidemiologie., Das Rötelnvirus ist – mit dem Menschen als einzigem Wirt – weltweit verbreitet. In Bevölkerungsgruppen mit einer niedrigen Durchimpfungsrate erfolgen 80–90 % der Infektionen im Kindesalter. In Deutschland bestand bis März 2013 nur in den neuen Bundesländern eine Meldepflicht, danach im ganzen Bundesgebiet. So kann vor März 2013 die aktuelle Verbreitung nur hochgerechnet werden., Aus den in Deutschland gemeldeten Zahlen ergab sich für das Jahr 2003 eine Inzidenz von 0,33Fällen pro 100.000 Einwohner. Das Europäische Zentrum für die Prävention und die Kontrolle von Krankheiten hat von Oktober 2011 bis September 2012 aus 26Ländern über 30.000 Infektionen erfasst mit den höchsten Inzidenzen in Rumänien (114,32/100.000) und Polen (13,93/100.000). Die durchschnittliche Inzidenz aller 26 Länder lag bei 8,6/100.000. Bei Schuleingangsuntersuchungen in Deutschland von 2010 waren 91,2 % der Kinder vollständig geimpft. Die unvollständige Durchimpfung der Bevölkerung kann zu sporadischen und epidemischen Infektionen bei Kindern, Jugendlichen und auch Erwachsenen führen. Selektive Impfungen von jungen Mädchen und Frauen ab dem 13. Lebensjahr– bedingt durch die besondere Gefahr dieser Krankheit während einer Schwangerschaft– haben in der weiblichen Bevölkerung erreicht, dass die bei der natürlichen Durchseuchung noch bestehenden Immunitätslücken im jungen Erwachsenenalter zunehmend besser geschlossen wurden. 2015 erklärte die Organización Panamericana de la Salud die westliche Hemisphäre (Nord- und Südamerika) für rötelnfrei., In Deutschland traten vor den Impfungen Röteln insbesondere im Frühjahr auf, Epidemien etwa alle 6 bis 9 Jahre., Erreger., Das Rötelnvirus ist das einzige Mitglied der Gattung \\"Rubivirus\\" und gehört zur Familie der \\"Togaviridae\\", deren Mitglieder typischerweise eine einzelsträngige RNA mit positiver Polarität als Genom besitzen, das von einem ikosaedrischen Kapsid umgeben ist. Das RNA-Genom im Inneren des Kapsids hat eine Länge von ungefähr 9.757 Nukleotiden und codiert für zwei nichtstrukturelle Proteine sowie drei strukturelle Proteine. Das Kapsidprotein sowie die beiden Hüllproteine E1 und E2 machen die drei strukturellen Proteine aus., Die kugelförmigen Viruspartikel der Togaviridae haben einen Durchmesser von 50–70nm und sind von einer Lipidmembran (Virushülle) umgeben. In der Hülle sind als deutliche Spikes (Ausstülpungen) von 6nm Länge die Heterodimere der beiden viralen Hüllproteine E1 und E2 eingelagert. Es existiert eine einheitliche Form der Oberflächenstruktur, also nur ein einziger Serotyp., Übertragung., Die Übertragung erfolgt meistens durch Tröpfcheninfektion mit 50-prozentiger Kontagiosität. Besonders in nasopharyngealen Sekreten sind sehr viele Viren enthalten. Die Inkubationszeit beträgt 14–21Tage. Eine Woche vor bis eine Woche nach Ausbruch des Exanthems ist der Patient ansteckend. Selbst asymptomatische Infizierte sind infektiös. Die Viren dringen in der Regel über die Schleimhäute der oberen Atemwege ein und werden zunächst bevorzugt in lymphatischem Gewebe vermehrt. Anschließend erfolgt eine Ausschüttung in die Blutbahn (Virämie), so dass die Viren viele Organe erreichen können. Im Falle einer Schwangerschaft kann eine Übertragung des Virus über den Mutterkuchen (Plazenta) auf das ungeborene Kind erfolgen., Krankheitserscheinungen., Der Verlauf der Erkrankung ist von Mensch zu Mensch sehr unterschiedlich und nicht sehr spezifisch, das heißt leicht mit anderen fieberhaften Erkrankungen mit Hautausschlag verwechselbar. In etwa der Hälfte der Infektionen treten überhaupt keine Symptome auf (asymptomatischer Verlauf, stille Feiung)., Typische Symptomatik., Nach der Inkubationszeit können sich zunächst im Gesicht gerötete, einzelstehende, leicht erhabene Flecken (Effloreszenzen) bilden, die sich auf den Rumpf und die Extremitäten ausbreiten. Diese bilden sich meist nach ein bis drei Tagen zurück. Begleitend tritt oft erhöhte Temperatur bis 39°C auf. Weitere mögliche Symptome sind Kopf- und Gliederschmerzen, Lymphknotenschwellungen an Hinterkopf, Nacken und hinter den Ohren, leichter Katarrh der oberen Luftwege sowie Bindehautentzündungen., Komplikationen., Seltene, mit zunehmendem Lebensalter des Patienten häufiger werdende Komplikationen sind Gelenkentzündungen (Arthritis), eine Verringerung der Zahl der Blutplättchen (Thrombozytopenie) mit vermehrter Blutungsneigung oder eine Enzephalitis. Darüber hinaus kann es auch zu einer Bronchitis, einer Mittelohrentzündung oder einer Herzbeteiligung (Myo- und Perikarditis) kommen., Eine besondere Gefahr stellt jedoch eine Rötelninfektion während einer Schwangerschaft dar. In den ersten acht Wochen der Schwangerschaft führt eine Rötelninfektion in 90 % der Fälle zur Schädigung des Embryos. Mit fortschreitender Schwangerschaft sinkt das Risiko im mittleren Drittel der Schwangerschaft auf 25–30 %. Mögliche Folgen einer Infektion des ungeborenen Kindes sind Spontanabort, Frühgeburt oder die klassische Kombination aus Fehlbildungen in Form von Herzfehlern (offener Ductus Botalli, Septumdefekte und Fallot-Tetralogie), Trübung der Linse der Augen (Katarakt) und Innenohrschwerhörigkeit. Dieses Vollbild, das auch \\"Gregg-Syndrom\\" genannt wird, entsteht bei Rötelninfektionen in der vierten Schwangerschaftswoche, wohingegen eine Infektion in der 20. Schwangerschaftswoche möglicherweise lediglich eine isolierte Taubheit auslöst. Weitere in Frage kommende Schädigungen sind niedriges Geburtsgewicht, Blutungsneigung aufgrund verminderter Blutplättchenzahlen (Thrombozytopenische Purpura), Enzephalomeningitis, Leberentzündung, Vergrößerung von Leber und Milz, Herzmuskelentzündung (Myokarditis) oder verminderter Kopfumfang (Mikrozephalie). Daher gehört die Untersuchung auf Röteln zur Mutterschaftsvorsorge (siehe Röteln während der Schwangerschaft)., Eine angeborene Rötelninfektion wurde in den Jahren 2010 und 2011 zwar nicht mehr gemeldet, Allerdings geht das Robert Koch-Institut von einer erheblichen Untererfassung aus, weil es Hinweise darauf gibt, dass nur erkennbar geschädigte Neugeborene untersucht und gemeldet werden. Wahrscheinlich entgehen Fälle mit erst später erkennbaren Folgen einer Rötelninfektion während der Schwangerschaft der Erfassung und Meldung., Weltweit dagegen wird von über 100.000 Kindern ausgegangen, die jedes Jahr mit einer Rötelnembryofetopathie geboren werden., Die beim RKI für Deutschland gemeldeten Fallzahlen haben sich seit dem Jahr 2014 folgendermaßen entwickelt:, Untersuchung., Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kinderkrankheiten ist eine allein auf den Krankheitsanzeichen basierende sichere Diagnosestellung nicht möglich. Röteln können mit anderen Infektionskrankheiten, die mit einem fleckigen Exanthem einhergehen, wie dem Drei-Tage-Fieber, Ringelröteln, Masern, Entero- oder Adenovirus-Infektionen, Mykoplasmen oder Scharlach verwechselt werden. Der direkte Nachweis des Rubellavirus in Rachenspülflüssigkeit, Urin oder anderen Sekreten ist in Speziallabors zwar grundsätzlich möglich, jedoch aufwändiger und in der Routinediagnostik nicht sinnvoll. Er ist speziellen Fragestellungen, beispielsweise bei angeborenen Infektionen vorbehalten., Wenn wichtige Entscheidungen von der Diagnosestellung abhängen, beispielsweise bei Röteln-Verdacht bei einer Schwangeren, muss die Diagnose durch Untersuchung der Antikörper im Blut mittels Immunassay (ELISA) gestellt werden. Ein positiver Nachweis von IgM-Antikörpern wird als Hinweis, jedoch noch nicht als Nachweis einer Infektion gewertet, da der Test beispielsweise durch Kreuzreaktionen mit Antikörpern gegen andere Viren auch falsch-positiv ausfallen kann., Die Bestätigung einer Rötelninfektion kann durch Nachweis von Antikörpern gegen Rubellaviren im Hämagglutinationshemmtest (HHT) erfolgen. Bei diesem ist ein Anstieg der Antikörpermenge (des Titers) in zwei aufeinanderfolgenden Blutproben im Abstand von 14Tagen um mindestens das Vierfache nachzuweisen. Eine weitere Bestätigungsmethode bietet der Hämolyse-im-Gel-Test. Beim Neugeborenen ist der Nachweis von Röteln-IgM im Rahmen der STORCH-Serologie beweisend für eine während der Schwangerschaft erworbene Rötelninfektion. Bei möglicher oder gesicherter Röteln-Infektion einer Schwangeren kann durch Nachweis des Rubellavirus mittels Zellkultur oder Polymerase-Kettenreaktion (PCR) im Fruchtwasser oder im Material einer Chorionzottenbiopsie, ab der 22. Schwangerschaftswoche auch im Fetalblut eine vorgeburtliche (pränatale) Infektion diagnostiziert werden., In der aktuellen Fassung des Infektionsschutzgesetzes sind der Verdacht, die Erkrankung und der Todesfall sowie der Nachweis des Erregers meldepflichtig., Behandlung., Es existiert keine ursächliche Behandlung. Die symptomatische Therapie beschränkt sich auf fiebersenkende Mittel sowie entzündungshemmende Schmerzmittel bei Gelenkbeteiligung. Erkrankte beziehungsweise deren Eltern sollten auf die mögliche Gefahr für empfängliche Schwangere hingewiesen werden. Die beste Prävention stellt die Impfung dar., Kinder mit während der Schwangerschaft erworbenen Röteln (Rötelnembryofetopathie) benötigen entsprechend der Ausprägung eine umfassende Betreuung, gegebenenfalls einschließlich Augen- oder Herzoperationen, H: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Krankheitsbild, Kinderheilkunde, Meldepflicht, Röteln, Virale Infektionskrankheit, Immunität, Kinderkrankheiten, Impfung, Epidemiologie, Komplikationen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Kampfpanzer der Wehrmacht, Mittlerer Panzer], Der Panzerkampfwagen III (auch PzKpfw III oder Panzer III) war ein mittlerer deutscher Panzer im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Als Standardmodell für die künftigen Panzerdivisionen vorgesehen, war er mit einer panzerbrechenden Kanone für die Panzerbekämpfung ausgerüstet, während der bauähnliche Panzer IV als Unterstützungsfahrzeug dienen sollte. Der von Daimler-Benz entwickelte PanzerIII, der in den Jahren 1941 und 1942 der wichtigste deutsche Panzerkampfwagen war, bewährte sich in der ersten Kriegshälfte gut, danach nahm jedoch mit dem Erscheinen leistungsfähigerer gegnerischer Panzer sein Kampfwert aufgrund der eingeschränkten Ausbaufähigkeit schnell ab. Von 1936 bis 1943 wurden 5700 Exemplare hergestellt, wobei das Fahrgestell als Grundlage für das wesentlich erfolgreichere Sturmgeschütz III bis zum Kriegsende produziert wurde., Geschichte., Zur endgültigen Ausstattung der zukünftigen Panzerverbände hatte der spätere Generaloberst Heinz Guderian, der die Panzerwaffe zur selbstständigen Truppengattung entwickelte, zwei Panzerkampfwagen vorgesehen. Einen Wagen, der mit seiner panzerbrechenden Kanone die feindlichen Panzer ausschalten sollte, sowie ein mit einem größeren Kaliber ausgestattetes Unterstützungsfahrzeug. Aus diesen Überlegungen heraus entstanden der PanzerkampfwagenIII und der PanzerkampfwagenIV, wobei der PanzerIII für die drei leichten Kompanien und der PanzerIV für die vierte Kompanie eines Panzer-Bataillons vorgesehen war., Über die Bewaffnung des projektierten Panzer III gab es grundsätzliche Meinungsverschiedenheiten. Guderian und die Inspektion der Kraftfahrtruppen forderten eine durchschlagskräftige 5-cm-Kampfwagenkanone (KwK), während das Heereswaffenamt und die Inspektion der Artillerie die schon von der Infanterie genutzte 3,7-cm-Kanone aus Gründen der Vereinheitlichung als ausreichend betrachteten und sich schließlich auch durchsetzen konnten. Zumindest konnte Guderian erreichen, dass der Turmdrehkranz groß genug dimensioniert wurde, um den nachträglichen Einbau einer stärkeren Kanone zu ermöglichen; ein Umstand, der sich später noch als notwendig erweisen sollte., Die weiteren Anforderungen an das Kampffahrzeug waren ein die Tragfähigkeit der Straßenbrücken berücksichtigendes Maximalgewicht von 24Tonnen, eine Besatzung von fünf Mann und der Einbau einer Funkanlage, die eine interne Verständigung sowie eine Kommunikation mit anderen Panzern und der Führungsebene ermöglichen sollte., Entwicklung., Aus Gründen der Geheimhaltung – der Versailler Vertrag war noch Reichsgesetz und verbot schwere Waffen wie Panzer – erhielt das Projekt die Tarnbezeichnung „Zugführerwagen“ (ZW). Im Jahre 1935 vergab das Heereswaffenamt Entwicklungsaufträge an Krupp, MAN, Rheinmetall und Daimler-Benz. Wegen ihrer US-amerikanischen Mutterfirmen wurden Ford und nicht in das Programm einbezogen, obwohl sie zur damaligen Zeit die beiden größten Automobilfirmen waren und über die größte Erfahrung im Großserienbau verfügten, was den Schluss nahelegt, dass zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Massenproduktion des Panzers geplant war. Nach eingehender Untersuchung der Prototypen bei der Versuchsstelle für Kraftfahrt wurde Daimler-Benz 1936 mit der weiteren Entwicklung und Herstellung beauftragt., Kleinserien Ausf. A–D., Ende 1936 lieferte Daimler-Benz die ersten zehn Panzer der „Ausführung A“ unter der Tarnbezeichnung 1/ZW aus, die 1937 in den Truppenversuch kamen. Mit einer Rundumpanzerung von 15mm hatte das Fahrzeug ein Gesamtgewicht von 15,4t und war mit einem Maybach-Zwölfzylinder-Ottomotor mit 250PS und einem Fünfgang-Getriebe motorisiert. Zusätzlich zur Hauptbewaffnung mit einer 3,7-cm-Kanone waren zwei achsparallele Maschinengewehre angebracht; ein drittes MG wurde vom Funker bedient. Einen großen Unterschied zu den späteren Ausführungen stellte das Laufwerk dar, das aus fünf großen, an Schraubenfedern aufgehängten Doppellaufrädern bestand., Die 1937/38 ausgelieferten zehn Fahrzeuge der „Ausführung B“ (Typ 2/ZW) hatten ein verändertes Laufwerk, das aus acht kleinen Laufrollen bestand, die zu je zwei Paaren in einer Doppelschwinge zusammengefasst waren, wobei vier Laufrollen mittels einer Blattfeder abgedämpft wurden. Des Weiteren wurde die Zahl der Stützrollen von zwei auf drei erhöht, was bis zum Produktionsende beibehalten wurde. Von den fünfzehn bestellten Ausf. B wurden nur zehn als komplette Panzer fertiggestellt, die anderen fünf Fahrgestelle wurden zur Entwicklung des Sturmgeschütz III abgegeben. Als Ausgleich wurden 1940 fünf weitere Ausf. D hergestellt., Bei den ebenfalls 1937/38 hergestellten 15 Panzern der „Ausführung C“ (Typ 3a/ZW) gab es nur eine Laufwerksänderung. Die vordere und hintere Doppelschwinge mit ihren zwei Laufrollen wurde durch je eine Blattfeder und die mittleren vier Laufrollen durch eine größere Blattfeder abgedämpft., Die im Jahre 1938 ausgelieferten 25 Exemplare der „Ausführung D“ (Typ 3b/ZW) bildeten den Abschluss der Kleinserienproduktion. Die Veränderung im Laufwerk bestand lediglich in den nun schräg liegenden äußeren Blattfedern. Der Motor blieb unverändert, jedoch wurde ein neues 6-Gang-Getriebe verwendet. Durch die Verstärkung der Rundumpanzerung auf 30mm stieg das Gesamtgewicht auf 19,8 Tonnen. Im Jahr 1940 wurden fünf weitere Fahrgestelle der Ausf.D gebaut und mit den fünf eingelagerten Aufbauten und Türmen der Ausf.B komplettiert., Alle Fahrzeuge der Kleinserien wurden an die Panzereinheiten ausgeliefert und kamen während des ersten deutschen Feldzug, dem Angriffskrieg gegen Polen, zum Einsatz. Nach Abschluss des Feldzuges wurden sie– bis auf einige D-Modelle, die noch in Norwegen zum Einsatz kamen– an rückwärtige Einheiten, Ersatz- und Ausbildungsverbände, abgegeben., Serienreife / Organisation der Serienproduktion., Nachdem am 27. September 1939 der nun offiziell bezeichnete „Panzerkampfwagen III (3,7cm) (Sd.Kfz.141)“ für einführungs- und beschaffungsreif erklärt worden war, lief die Serienproduktion an. Zu dieser Zeit machte sich noch immer die geringe Leistungsfähigkeit der deutschen Maschinenbauindustrie bemerkbar, die nicht in der Lage war, hohe Stückzahlen der einzelnen Serien zu produzieren. Dies lag unter anderem daran, dass bei der Herstellung qualitativ hochwertiger Handwerksfertigung Priorität vor rationeller Massenfertigung eingeräumt wurde. Eine durchstrukturierte Fließbandfertigung mit Haupt- und Nebentaktstraßen hat es bei der Herstellung des PanzerIII nie gegeben. Folgende Unternehmen waren an der Herstellung des Panzers beteiligt:, Von den aufgeführten Unternehmen stellte Alkett mit über 50 Prozent die meisten Fahrzeuge her, obwohl andere dieser Firmen bedeutend größere Rüstungsproduzenten waren. Bei vielen war jedoch die Panzerproduktion nur eine Sparte von vielen, wie beispielsweise bei Daimler-Benz oder Henschel. So betrug im Jahre 1940 bei MIAG die Panzerfertigung nur 22 % oder bei MAN nur 10 % der gesamten Fertigungskapazität. Dieser Aspekt war bezeichnend für die noch unkoordinierte Rüstungsorganisation, denn wie bei fast allen deutschen Panzerkampfwagen gab es auch beim PanzerIII keine Konzentration auf nur wenige oder gar einen Hersteller. Neben lizenzrechtlichen Problemen ergab sich dadurch die Situation, dass bei jeder der häufigen Konstruktionsänderungen das Heereswaffenamt rund 30 Zeichnungssätze an die verschiedenen Montage- und Zulieferfirmen übermitteln musste, wobei es infolge der unterschiedlichen Produktionsprozesse häufig zu einer nicht übereinstimmenden Normung bei der Abnahme kam. Um bei einigen Herstellern „Produktionslücken“ zu überbrücken, bekamen diese Aufträge für den Bau des PanzerIII, obwohl sie noch andere Panzerkampfwagen in der Fertigung hatten, was in der Folge zu einer Zersplitterung der Produktionskapazitäten führte. Darüber hinaus beanspruchte das Heereswaffenamt die alleinige Kontrolle über die Entwicklung, Konstruktion, Beschaffung und Abnahme des PanzerIII, was für die Hersteller naturgemäß einen schweren Eingriff in die Firmenbelange darstellte und zu gegenseitigen Vorwürfen zwischen dem HWA und den Unternehmen führte. Eine Koordination der Panzer-III-Fertigung erfolgte– wenn überhaupt– nur über das bürokratisch schwerfällige Heereswaffenamt, dessen Führungsanspruch so weit ging, etwa im Falle der Wannenherstellung einen Erfahrungsaustausch zwischen den beteiligten Firmen zu untersagen., Die Endmontage eines Panzer III dauerte 1800 Stunden. Der Preis eines Panzers betrug ohne Waffen knapp 100.000 Reichsmark. Der Rohstoffbedarf belief sich– ohne Waffen, Optik und Funk– auf folgende Mengen:, Eine der wichtigsten Zulieferfirmen war die Deutsche Edelstahlwerke AG, die bis 1942 jeweils 1900 Wannen und Türme an die Montagefirmen lieferte. Im Verlauf des Krieges wurden für den Panzer III ab Juli 1941 weitere Fertigungsstätten hinzugezogen. Es handelte sich dabei um Produktionsanlagen von Krupp, Hanomag, Auto Union, NSU sowie das Wiener Werk von Fross-Büssing, das Werk Kolín von Tatra und das Hainicher Werk von Framo. Im August 1943 wurde die Produktion endgültig eingestellt und die Kapazitäten für den Bau von Sturmgeschützen freigegeben., Technische Beschreibung., Durch die umfangreichen Umrüstaktionen existierte eine Vielzahl von verschiedenen Fahrzeugen, so dass eine zweifelsfreie Zuordnung zu einer bestimmten Ausführung nicht immer realisierbar war. Aufgrund der vielen Ausführungen ist eine für alle Modelle gleich geltende Beschreibung nicht möglich., Turm und Bewaffnung., Der Turm des Panzerkampfwagen III hatte keinen Turmboden. Der Sitz des Kommandanten und des Richtschützen war an der Turmwand angehängt. Der rechts neben der Hauptwaffe stehende Ladeschütze musste der Turmbewegung ständig folgen. Zur Sicht nach außen hatte er eine durch einen Glasblock und eine Außenklappe geschützte Beobachtungsöffnung an der rechten Turmseite. Eine ähnliche Sichtklappe befand sich auf der linken Turmseite für den Richtschützen. Den Turm schwenkte dieser per Hand, wobei die Kanone über einen am Schwenktrieb befindlichen Abzug elektrisch abgefeuert wurde. Das achsparallele Maschinengewehr wurde mechanisch mit einem Pedal bedient. Richt- und Ladeschütze hatten jeweils eine mit zwei Klappen versehene seitliche Ausstiegsöffnung.

Sie liegt im Südbezirk. Auf einem Gipfelplateau am Rand der Judäischen Wüste, hoch über dem Toten Meer, ließ sich Herodes eine Palastfestung erbauen. Fertiggestellt wurde dieses königliche Refugium etwa 15 v. Chr. Die Architektur ist teils traditionell (östlich-hellenistisch), teils am Vorbild römischer Villen orientiert. Eine besondere Attraktion bot Herodes seinen Gästen mit Wasserluxus in Gestalt einer Thermenanlage und eines Schwimmbeckens., Rund 70 Jahre später, während des Jüdischen Krieges, nutzten viele Menschen Masada als Fluchtfelsen. Archäologische Befunde zeigen einen von Armut geprägten Alltag und eine hohe Fluktuation der hier lebenden Bevölkerung. Kommen und Gehen war jahrelang möglich, bis die Legio X Fretensis unter Flavius Silva 73 oder 74 n. Chr. vor Masada erschien, die Festung mit einem Wall einschloss und eine Belagerungsrampe aufschüttete. Nach der Darstellung von Flavius Josephus gelang es den Römern schließlich, eine Bresche in die Außenmauer zu reißen. In aussichtsloser Lage habe der Befehlshaber von Masada, Eleasar ben Jaʾir, alle Rebellen davon überzeugt, mit ihren Frauen und Kindern Selbstmord zu begehen. Wie in antiken Geschichtswerken üblich, verfasste Josephus für Eleasar diese Reden. Fraglich ist, ob sich die Einnahme Masadas so abspielte, wie Josephus es beschreibt. Die archäologischen Befunde lassen sich nicht spannungsfrei mit den Angaben des Josephus kombinieren. Es gibt aber auch keinen Konsens über ein alternatives Szenario., 1838 identifizierten Edward Robinson und Eli Smith die arabisch als \\"es-Sebbe\\" bezeichneten Ruinen mit der von Josephus beschriebenen antiken Wüstenfestung. Seit den 1920er Jahren gewann Masada symbolische Bedeutung für die jüdischen Einwohner Palästinas: In Yitzhak Lamdans Versepos \\"Masada\\" (1927) steht die Wüstenfestung metaphorisch für das zionistische Projekt. Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs unternahmen zahlreiche Gruppen den schwierigen Aufstieg zum Gipfelplateau, eine Erfahrung, die zusammen mit Lamdans Epos zur Formung eines „Masada-Mythos“ beitrug. Die metaphorische Bedeutung Masadas veränderte sich vor dem Hintergrund der Staatsgründung und der weiteren Geschichte Israels. Von 1963 bis 1965 leitete Yigael Yadin groß angelegte Ausgrabungen auf dem Gipfelplateau. Er veröffentlichte eine populäre Darstellung vom Leben der Zeloten auf Masada und der römischen Eroberung, worin er die archäologischen Befunde mit dem Bericht des Josephus harmonisierte., 1966 wurden der Tafelberg und das Umland mit dem römischen Belagerungskomplex zum israelischen Nationalpark erklärt. Am 14. Dezember 2001 nahm die UNESCO Masada in die Liste des Weltkulturerbes auf., Name., Der antike Name des Ortes lautete in den Texten von Wadi Murabbaʿat und in der Kupferrolle von Qumran ; beide Bezeichnungen haben die gleiche Bedeutung: „Berghöhe, Bergfestung.“ In geradezu idealer Weise entspricht der Tafelberg von Masada den Erfordernissen eines Fluchtfelsens, auf den sich die Bevölkerung in Notzeiten zurückziehen konnte. Er ist also sehr treffend benannt. Josephus transkribierte den aramäischen Namen ins Griechische, \\"Metzadaʾ\\" wurde so zu \\"Masada\\"., Geologie und geographische Lage., Die archäologische Stätte Masada befindet sich auf dem Plateau eines isolierten Tafelbergs aus Dolomit der Oberkreide (Cenomanium-Turonium) am östlichen Rand der Judäischen Wüste. Er gehört zu den \\"Heʿetekim\\"-Klippen, die das Tal des Toten Meeres an der Westseite begrenzen. Als relativ junger, wenig erodierter Horst am Rande einer tektonischen Platte ist er auch geologisch interessant. Er hat annähernd die Grundfläche einer Raute, die Diagonalen messen etwa 600 m in der Länge und 300 m in der Breite. Das Gipfelplateau erhebt sich etwa 450 m über dem Westufer des Toten Meeres. Auf der Westseite beträgt der Höhenunterschied allerdings nur 75 m., Zwei Wadis entspringen auf der untersten Stufe der Judäischen Wüste und laufen von Westen auf den Tafelberg von Masada zu. \\"Wadi Nimre\\" \\"(Nachal Ben Jaʾir)\\" umgeht den Berg im Norden, \\"Wadi Sebbe\\" \\"(Nachal Metzada)\\" im Süden; sie bilden sodann, „jäh über einem Katarakt abstürzend, eine 200 m tiefe Klamm mit fast senkrechten Wänden.“ Während der Tafelberg von der Ostseite nur schwer zugänglich ist, ist seine Westseite weniger steil. Er ist dort durch einen etwa 200 m breiten Sattel zwischen \\"Wadi Nimre\\" und \\"Wadi Sebbe\\" mit den Höhen der Judäischen Wüste verbunden., Die historischen Verkehrsverbindungen nach Masada entstanden während des Jüdischen Krieges; 1932 stellte Adolf Schulten hierzu fest: „Noch heute sind die Straßen vorhanden und gangbar, die Silva damals gebaut hat, um sich mit allem zur Belagerung Nötigen zu versehen.“ Dieses Wegenetz wird deshalb im Rahmen des römischen Belagerungskomplexes genauer vorgestellt., Flora., Archäobotaniker identifizierten im Fundspektrum von Masada Pflanzen, die bis heute hier wachsen: Die Sträucher \\"Anabasis articulata\\", \\"Hammada salicornica\\" und \\"Zygophyllum dumosum\\" konnten den antiken Bewohnern als Brennmaterial dienen. In den benachbarten Wadis wuchsen damals wie heute Akazien (\\"Acacia raddiana\\", \\"Acacia tortilis\\") und Tamarisken (\\"Tamarix\\"). Rohrkolben (\\"Typha\\"), Schilfrohr (\\"Phragmites\\") und Pfahlrohr (\\"Arundo\\") fanden in der Antike in der Umgebung der Badeanlagen auf dem Gipfelplateau die nötige Feuchtigkeit., Fauna., In Masada und Umgebung sind verschiedene Tierarten der Judäischen Wüste anzutreffen, insbesondere Vögel. Dazu gehört der Tristramstar (\\"Onychognathus tristramii\\"), der in Masada an Touristen gewöhnt ist und sich aus der Nähe beobachten lässt. Ein ähnliches Verhalten zeigt der etwa sperlingsgroße Schwarzschwanz (\\"Oenanthe melanura\\"). Außerdem gibt es im Masada-Nationalpark Rabenvögel wie den Borstenraben (\\"Corvus rhipidurus\\") und den Wüstenraben (\\"Corvus ruficollis\\")., Exemplare des Nubischen Steinbocks (\\"Capra nubiana\\") werden im Masada-Nationalpark ebenfalls häufig beobachtet., Antike Quellentexte., Bis auf kurze Notizen bei Strabon und Plinius dem Älteren sind zwei Schriften des Flavius Josephus die Quellen für die Geschichte von Masada: \\"Jüdische Altertümer\\" und \\"Jüdischer Krieg\\". Für die Zeit des Herodes konnte Josephus die verlorene \\"Universalgeschichte\\" des Nikolaos von Damaskus nutzen. Josephus befand sich in Rom, während Masada belagert und erobert wurde. Er ist also kein Augenzeuge dieser Ereignisse, konnte aber möglicherweise die Berichte römischer Kommandeure einsehen., Josephus beschreibt die Bauten von Masada nicht im Zusammenhang mit der Regierung des Herodes, sondern als Schauplatz des Jüdischen Krieges. Unklar ist, ob er den Ort aus eigener Anschauung kannte. Josephus macht keinerlei Angaben darüber, dass es zwei große Paläste gab. Nach Achim Lichtenberger ist Josephus Palastbeschreibung vage und erinnert an einen typischen hellenistischen Herrscherpalast, eine viertürmige Burg ähnlich der Burg Antonia in Jerusalem. Ungenau ist auch die Beschreibung der Innenräume. Josephus schreibt von monolithen Säulen und Steinpflasterung von Wänden und Fußböden; was er gemeint haben \\"kann\\", sind die stuckierten Säulen und die Marmorinkrustationen nachahmende Wanddekoration des 2. Pompejanischen Stils (Architekturstil). Ähnliche Versatzstücke gibt es aber auch in anderen Palastbeschreibungen des Josephus. Ehud Netzer erwägt, dass Josephus den Nordpalast aus einiger Entfernung gesehen habe – und von unten, so dass ihm die Terrassenmauern wie Türme erschienen seien. Ob es in der Jerusalemer Oberschicht eine Kenntnis der Bauten auf dem Plateau gab, an der Josephus als Angehöriger dieser Gruppe teilhatte, hängt auch davon ab, wie Herodes Masada nutzte. Wenn er hier Regierungsgeschäfte tätigte, ist das anzunehmen, wenn es ein privater Rückzugsort für Notfälle war, weniger., Geschichte., Masada in der Zeit der Hasmonäer., Josephus zufolge ließ der hasmonäische Hohepriester Jonathan als erster auf dem Plateau von Masada eine Festung () errichten. Man identifiziert diesen Jonathan meist mit Alexander Jannäus (103–76 v. Chr.). Die vorherodianische Bebauung von Masada geht aus den Angaben bei Josephus hervor und steht auch nicht in Frage, aber archäologische Belege gibt es dafür bisher keine., In der instabilen politischen Situation nach der Ermordung von Herodes’ Vater Antipatros (42 v. Chr.) besetzte ein Gegner Masada, die stärkste hasmonäische Festung. Herodes gewährte ihm freien Abzug und nahm so Masada ein. Im Jahr 40 v. Chr. eroberten die Parther Judäa und installierten Antigonos Mattathias als Hohepriester. Herodes gelang die Flucht nach Idumäa. Dort ließ er seine Familie im Schutz einer militärischen Einheit von 800 Mann auf Masada zurück. Vergeblich bat Herodes den König der Nabatäer und die ägyptische Königin Kleopatra VII. um Hilfe. Er reiste dann auf dem Seeweg nach Rom. Von Marcus Antonius protegiert, erhielt er die Unterstützung des Senats. Dieser verlieh ihm den Titel „König von Judäa“ und beauftragte ihn, gegen die Parther und Mattathias Krieg zu führen. Unterdessen belagerte Mattathias Masada. Die Besatzung der Festung kam durch Wasserknappheit zeitweise in eine bedrohliche Lage, die sich durch einen Starkregen entschärfte. Deutlich wird hier die Abhängigkeit Masadas von Zisternen. Herodes kehrte nach Judäa zurück, entsetzte Masada und führte den Krieg erfolgreich weiter., Palastfestung des Herodes., Herodes war ein jüdischer Klientelkönig Roms. In seinem Regierungshandeln suchte er verschiedene Faktoren zu verbinden:, Folgt man Josephus, so ließ Herodes Masada als seine private Fluchtburg () ausbauen, sowohl für den Fall eines Aufstands der eigenen Bevölkerung wie auch gegen eine Bedrohung durch die ägyptische Königin Kleopatra VII. Nach der Schlacht bei Actium begab sich Herodes nach Rhodos, um dem Sieger Oktavian seine Aufwartung zu machen. Er brachte zuvor einen Teil seiner Familie auf Masada unter; anscheinend war dort mittlerweile eine sichere und standesgemäße Residenz entstanden. Nach dem Tod des Herodes fiel Masada an Herodes Archelaos. Er wurde im Jahr 6 n. Chr. abgesetzt. Danach war wahrscheinlich eine römische Garnison in Masada stationiert., Schauplatz des Jüdischen Krieges., Im Hochsommer des Jahres 66 n. Chr., in der Anfangsphase des Jüdischen Krieges, nahm eine Gruppe von Zeloten unter Führung des Menahem Masada im Handstreich ein. Sie töteten die römischen Soldaten und verteilten die gelagerten Waffen. Menahem zog mit seinem Gefolge nach Jerusalem. Dort wurde er z: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Archäologischer Fundplatz, Israel, Festung, Geisterstadt, Herodes, Jüdische Geschichte, Jüdischer Krieg, Nationalpark, Masada, Tafelberg"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: First Nations, Geschichte Kanadas, Politik (Kanada)], Mit First Nations (, ) werden alle indigenen Völker in Kanada beziehungsweise die kanadischen Indianer bezeichnet, ausgenommen die Métis (Nachkommen von Cree und Europäern) und die im Norden lebenden Inuit. Sollen diese ebenfalls eingeschlossen werden, werden gelegentlich die Begriffe \\"First Peoples\\" und \\"Premiers Peuples\\" (Erste Völker) oder \\"Aboriginal Peoples\\" und \\"Peuples aborigènes\\" (Ureinwohnervölker) gebraucht; in den letzten Jahren spricht man häufiger von \\"Autochthon Peoples\\" und \\"Peuples autochtones\\" in beiden Hauptsprachen Kanadas., Häufig wird mit dem Begriff \\"First Nations\\" keine ethnische Zuordnung vorgenommen, sondern eine politische, was manchmal dazu führt, dass damit die Regierung der jeweiligen Ethnie gemeint ist. Auch werden damit gelegentlich Individuen bezeichnet –in der Form \\"First Nations People\\"–, doch ist die Bezeichnung \\"Indianer\\" hier viel häufiger anzutreffen. Allerdings ist der Begriff im englischsprachigen Amerika umstritten, im Gegensatz zum deutschen Begriff., Der Begriff \\"First Nations\\" tauchte wohl Anfang der 1980er Jahre erstmals auf. Damit wurde ein Begriff geschaffen, der sich von dem in Kanada ebenfalls gebräuchlichen Begriff \\"Indian Tribe\\" oder \\"Band\\" erheblich unterscheidet. Das gilt allerdings weniger für den Gebrauch im Alltag als für den juristischen und den politischen Bereich. Eine Nation kann sich auf das Völkerrecht berufen, das häufig als „internationales Recht“ bezeichnet wird, eine ethnische Gruppe nur auf Minderheitenschutz., Von den rund 700.000 Menschen, die sich als Indianer verstehen, zählen etwa 565.000 zu den 617 vom Staat anerkannten Stämmen (Stand: Anfang 2014), von denen allein fast 200 in British Columbia leben. Nur sie gelten im Sinne des zuständigen Ministeriums, des Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, juristisch als \\"Indians\\". Etwa 133.000 gehören keinem Stamm an, gehören also ebenso zu den First Nations und sind dennoch im juristischen Sinne keine Indianer. Der Staat bestimmt also, ob eine Gruppe einen Stamm darstellt und ob ein Angehöriger einer First Nation ein Indianer ist. Dieser Definitionsgewalt setzt der Begriff der First Nations das Bestimmungsrecht der Ureinwohner entgegen. Zudem ist der staatliche Gebrauch außerhalb der Rechtssphäre unpräzise. Im Deutschen ist der Begriff „Indianer“ gleichfalls nicht unbelastet (siehe Indianer: Begriff), dennoch soll er hier aus Verständnisgründen gebraucht werden., In jüngster Zeit werden die Indianer in den USA, die als \\"American Indians\\" oder \\"Native Americans\\", in Alaska als \\"Alaska Natives\\", manchmal als \\"Locals\\" bezeichnet werden, analog zu \\"First Nations\\" als \\"First Americans\\" bezeichnet., Überblick., Die indigenen Kulturen lassen sich in Kanada in fünf Kulturareale unterteilen, die sehr unterschiedliche klimatische und ökologische Bedingungen aufweisen. Diese erforderten Anpassungen, die die Kulturen bis heute prägen. Während im Norden und in den Graslandschaften des Zentrums lange nomadische Gruppen vorherrschten, waren dies im Westen und Osten sesshafte, zum Teil bäuerliche oder saisonal in bestimmten Gebieten wandernde Gruppen, bei denen Fischfang von großer Bedeutung war, bei einigen Gruppen auch Robbenjagd. Dazu kamen im Westen Walfänger. Diesen Lebensformen waren auch die Behausungen angepasst, von denen Tipi und Wigwam die bekanntesten sind, doch entwickelten sich an den Großen Seen und im Westen auch Großdörfer mit Langhäusern. Vielfach bestanden Stammeskonföderationen. Schamanen waren von großer Bedeutung., Die um 1500 beginnende Phase der Handelskontakte mit Europäern ging nach 1600 in die koloniale Phase über, in der europäische Siedler zunehmend Land beanspruchten und in der viele Stämme durch Epidemien ausgelöscht wurden. Im 19.Jahrhundert entstanden zahlreiche Reservate und Kanada versuchte, die Indianer zu assimilieren, indem sie zu Bauern erzogen werden sollten. Bis in die 1970er Jahre besuchten fast alle Kinder internatartige Schulen, genannt Residential Schools, in denen sie ihre Sprache nicht gebrauchen durften. Erst ab 1960 durften auch die Indianer in den Reservaten erstmals an Wahlen auf Bundesebene teilnehmen, die letzten Internate wurden im Jahre 1996 aufgelöst., Innerhalb der First Nations der Nordwestküste oder des Nordostens besteht vielfach das traditionelle, auf voreuropäische Wurzeln zurückgehende Herrschaftssystem mit einem erblichen Häuptlingstum fort, jedoch in Konkurrenz mit dem von Kanada initiierten System der gewählten Häuptlinge und ihrer Berater. Während die First Nations sich auf Verträge berufen und zunehmend quasi-staatliche Autorität in festen Territorien verlangen, betrachtet Kanadas Regierung die Indianer eher als Gruppen von Individuen, und einige Provinzen versuchen eine Privatisierung des Landes durchzusetzen, das bisher dem jeweiligen Stamm als Ganzes gehört., Einige First Nations sind zu einem gewissen Wohlstand gekommen, viele leiden jedoch unter Armut und gravierenden sozialen Problemen. Das gilt vor allem für ländlich lebende Gruppen, deren natürliche Umgebung durch Rohstoffexploration (Uran, Ölschiefer, vor allem in Saskatchewan, Ontario, Québec und Alberta), Militärbasen (Cold Lake, Goose Bay) und Holzeinschlag (vor allem in British Columbia, aber auch in den anderen Provinzen) zerstört worden ist. Dennoch entwickeln sich überregionale Kultur- und Wirtschaftsbündnisse, die inzwischen auch weit entfernt lebende indigene Völker einschließen., Dabei sind Bildung und Ausbildung von großer Bedeutung, und auch die Hochschulbildung kann seit 2003 an der First-Nations-Universität von Kanada in Saskatchewan absolviert werden. Viele der kleinen Sprachen sind vom Aussterben bedroht, doch bemühen sich die Stämme und einige staatliche Einrichtungen um ihren Erhalt. Die Sprache mit den meisten Sprechern ist das Cree., Darüber hinaus leiden Indianer auch am systemischen Rassismus, der im kanadischen Justizsystem, bei der Polizei (Mounted Police RCMP), in den Gerichten und Gefängnissen vorhanden ist. Ein Indiz für den systemischen Rassismus bei der RCMP sei die Tatsache, dass 36 % der Todesschüsse, die durch „Mounties“ ausgeführt wurden, Angehörige indigener Gruppen trafen, obwohl Indianer und Inuit nur 4 % der Bevölkerung stellen., Begriff., In Kanada werden die Angehörigen der First Nations häufig als \\"First Nations People\\" bezeichnet. Dieser Begriff steht in Konkurrenz zum Begriff „Indianer“ (\\"Indian\\"), der in der Öffentlichkeit meist unscharf für alle Angehörigen der vom Staat anerkannten Indianerstämme (\\"bands\\" oder \\"tribes\\"), aber auch für all diejenigen benutzt wird, die sich selbst als Indianer betrachten oder die von anderen dieser Gruppe zugerechnet werden., Rechtlich exakt definiert das Indianergesetz (Indian Act) seit 1876, wer ein Indianer ist. Um als Indianer staatlicherseits anerkannt zu werden, muss man einem der anerkannten Indianerstämme angehören. Dabei ist die Zugehörigkeit zu mehreren Stämmen nicht möglich, auch wenn die Eltern verschiedenen Stämmen angehörten; ausschlaggebend ist der Vater. Selbst in Regionen, in denen die ethnischen Gruppen ein ganz anderes Verständnis hatten und keine Stämme im europäischen Sinne kannten, wurde ihnen dieses Konzept, das auf genetischer Verwandtschaft basiert, aufgezwungen. Die Diskussion um die kartographische Festlegung der sogenannten traditionellen Stammesgebiete, die für Kompensationszahlungen und Vertragsverhandlungen größte Bedeutung hat, ist somit an Vorstellungen des 19. Jahrhunderts ausgerichtet. In vielen Regionen gab es jedoch keine ausschließlichen Rechte an einem bestimmten Stammesgebiet, wie die Euro-Kanadier oft meinen, sondern vielmehr sich überlappende Nutzungsrechte, die zudem oftmals an Haus- und Wohngruppen oder an Familien, Clans und Verwandtschaftslinien und auch an zyklische Wanderungen im Jahreslauf gebunden waren., Der staatlichen Definitionsgewalt soll mit dem Begriff \\"First Nation\\" ein eigenes Verständnis entgegengesetzt werden. Dieses besteht darin, dass jeder Stamm selbst bestimmt, wer ihm angehören soll, und dass die Anerkennung als Stamm nicht von einer staatlichen Behörde abhängt. Somit gibt es zahlreiche First Nations, die nicht offiziell als Stämme gelten. Gleichzeitig wird der Charakter einer souveränen Nation mit allen Rechten und Pflichten stärker betont. Als nationales Repräsentationsorgan fungiert dementsprechend die Versammlung der First Nations. Aktuell sind rund 20 % der Angehörigen von anerkannten First Nations nicht als Indianer anerkannt. Eine Reihe von First Nations, wie die Kichesipirini in der Provinz Québec, ist wiederum nicht als Stamm (\\"Tribe\\") anerkannt., Der Begriff \\"First Nations\\" wurde erstmals 1982 bei der Benennung der Versammlung der First Nations offiziell benutzt. Als Selbstbezeichnung der meisten ethnischen Gruppen hat er inzwischen weitgehend den Begriff \\"Band\\" oder \\"Indian Band\\" abgelöst, so dass der Begriff auch im Singular gebräuchlich ist. Während der Begriff \\"Tribe\\" in den Vereinigten Staaten überwiegt, ist in Kanada der Begriff \\"Band\\" im offiziellen Sprachgebrauch weiterhin üblich. Dabei wird er wie eine Art Oberbegriff gebraucht, der \\"First Nations\\", \\"Tribes\\" und \\"Bands\\" umfasst., Obwohl der Begriff \\"First Nations\\" auch von den kanadischen Behörden verwendet wird, ist er juristisch nicht genau festgelegt. Daher bevorzugen die zuständigen Behörden in Rechtsfragen die Bezeichnung \\"Indianer\\". Das für „Indianerangelegenheiten“ zuständige Ministerium Kanadas ist Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. In den Provinzen existieren Ministerien mit ähnlichen Namen., Im bereits genannten Indian Act werden dabei drei Arten von Indianern unterschieden:, Dazu kommt noch eine vierte Gruppe, deren Größe seit 1985 auf rund 117.000 Menschen angewachsen ist. Sie sind die Nachkommen von Indianerinnen, die Nicht-Indianer geheiratet haben. Da der \\"Indian Act\\" nur die patrilineare Abstammung als ausschlaggebend betrachtet –ganz im Gegensatz etwa zu den matrilinearen Irokesen– konnten diese Kinder nur auf Antrag den Indianerstatus wiedererlangen. Doch verlieren wiederum deren Kinder diesen Status, es sei denn, sie heiraten einen Status-Indianer. Diese Regelung sorgt dafür, dass diese als „Bill C-31 Indians“ bezeichnete Gruppe nach zwei Generationen weitgehend verschwunden sein wird. Zudem widerspricht sie Grundrechten, wie sie die Verfassung von 1982 enthält. Dazu gehören in diesem Fall nach Auffassung des Obersten Gerichtshofs von British Columbia die Gleichheit aller vor dem Gesetz, insbesondere ohne Ansehen der Abstammung und des Geschlechts. Mit dem Tod der letzten Status-Indianer muss das nur ihnen zugesprochene Reservat an die Regierung zurückgegeben werden – ein Vorgang, den der Häuptling der Six Nations, Bill Montour, als „den größten Landdiebstahl des Jahrhunderts“ bezeichnet., Alle Mitglieder der anerkannten Stämme, die Ansprüche a: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Transliteration \\"Krasnaja ploščadʹ\\") ist einer der ältesten und auf Grund seiner Größe, seiner geschichtlichen Bedeutung und der angrenzenden historischen Bauwerke der international berühmteste Platz in Moskau und einer der bekanntesten der Welt. Er befindet sich im Zentrum der historischen Moskauer Altstadt, vor den östlichen Mauern des Kremls, und gilt mit Gebäuden wie der Basilius-Kathedrale, dem Lenin-Mausoleum und dem Warenhaus GUM als Wahrzeichen der Stadt. Zudem gehört er seit 1990 zum UNESCO-Welterbe., Lage., Der Rote Platz weist eine annähernd rechteckige Form auf, ist 70 Meter breit und 330 Meter lang. Er erstreckt sich der Länge nach von Nordwesten nach Südosten entlang eines Teilstücks der Mauer des Kremls, das seine Begrenzung an der südwestlichen Seite bildet. Im Nordosten wird der Platz durch das Gebäude des Kaufhauses GUM und das alte Stadtviertel Kitai-Gorod, im Nordwesten durch das Historische Museum und das Auferstehungstor und im Südosten durch die Basilius-Kathedrale begrenzt. Nordwestlich des Platzes beginnt hinter dem Gebäude des Historischen Museums die Twerskaja-Straße, südöstlich schließt sich der sogenannte Basilius-Hang an, der zum nahen Moskwa-Fluss hinab und über eine Brücke in das Stadtviertel Samoskworetschje führt. Nordöstlich zweigen zwei Straßen vom Roten Platz ab: die Nikolskaja-Straße (, benannt nach dem direkt gegenüber stehenden Nikolaus-Turm des Kremls) und die Iljinka (), beide seit dem 14.Jahrhundert bestehend und ehemals wichtige Verkehrsadern des alten Moskau. Heute ist der Platz selbst, mit Ausnahme des durch ihn führenden Zufahrtsweges zum Erlöser-Tor des Kremls, eine Fußgängerzone., Geschichte., Etymologie., Die Bezeichnung \\"Roter Platz\\" hat weder einen Bezug zur Zeit des Sozialismus in Russland noch zur Farbe der Kremlmauern und -türme, deren Anstrich bis zum 19.Jahrhundert weiß war. Der Name ist schon im 17.Jahrhundert belegt und bedeutet eigentlich „schöner Platz“. Das Adjektiv „“ (\\"krasny\\") bedeutete in der russischen Sprache ursprünglich sowohl „rot“ als auch „schön“, im Laufe der Zeit hat es jedoch die Bedeutung „schön“ verloren und wird heute in der Alltagssprache nur noch als „rot“ gebraucht. Dies führt zu fälschlichen Annahmen bezüglich der Namensherkunft selbst bei Russen und zur etwas irrtümlichen Übersetzung als \\"Roter Platz\\" im Deutschen und anderen Sprachen., Entstehung und Nutzung als Marktplatz., Die Entstehung des heutigen Roten Platzes ist unmittelbar mit der Ausdehnung der alten Zarenhauptstadt Moskau über die Grenzen ihres Kerns, der mittelalterlichen Festungsanlage des Kremls, verbunden. Dieser stellte von der Stadtgründung Moskaus im Jahre 1147 an noch mehrere Jahrhunderte lang die eigentliche Stadt dar, während die Gebiete außerhalb seiner Mauern entweder recht ländlich oder aber gänzlich unbewohnt waren. Erst ab dem 14.Jahrhundert wuchs vor den Kremlmauern die Handwerker- und Händlersiedlung Kitai-Gorod, die dann im 16.Jahrhundert durch den Bau einer Befestigungsmauer vor potenziellen Angriffen von außen geschützt wurde. Zu jener Zeit war der Kreml inzwischen nicht nur Wohnort des Zaren sowie zahlreicher Bojaren und anderer Hochadliger, sondern auch ein belebter Handelsplatz, an dem unter anderem die Handwerker aus Kitai-Gorod ihre Erzeugnisse absetzten., Als gegen Ende des 15.Jahrhunderts die Handelsaktivitäten in zahlreichen, recht chaotisch angeordneten Buden und Ständen das Territorium des Kremls fast zum Überlaufen brachten, beschloss der Moskauer Großfürst IwanIII., den Handel außerhalb des Kremls nach Kitai-Gorod verlagern zu lassen, damit die Einwohner der Festung sich durch die Händler nicht belästigt fühlen und die Verteidigungsfähigkeit der Anlage im Angriffsfall gewahrt bleibt. Den konkreten Anlass zu dieser Verlegung brachte 1493 einer der damals häufigen Großbrände im von Holzbauten dominierten Kitai-Gorod, bei dem eine Vielzahl der Häuser östlich des Kremls zerstört wurde. Kurz danach wurde ein Zarenerlass herausgegeben, nach dem sämtliche Marktreihen vom Territorium des Kremls vor dessen östliche Mauern verlegt werden sollten sowie das vom Feuer verwüstete Gelände unmittelbar an diesen östlichen Mauern nicht mehr mit Häusern zu bebauen war, damit ein eventueller Brand den Kreml nicht gefährden konnte. Daher gilt das Jahr 1493 auch als Entstehungsjahr des Roten Platzes, auch wenn es in diesem Bereich möglicherweise auch schon zuvor einen Platz gegeben haben könnte., Im 16.Jahrhundert hatte der Platz mit einem gewöhnlichen innerstädtischen Platz nur wenig gemeinsam, vielmehr glich der neugeschaffene Freiraum östlich des Moskauer Kremls einem riesigen Basar, in dessen zahlreichen Reihen tagtäglich durchgehend ein geschäftiges Treiben herrschte. Hier wurden allerlei Waren aus ganz Russland sowie dem Ausland angeboten, die meist per Fluss angeliefert kamen – eine Anlegestelle für Handelsschiffe befand sich denn auch nur wenige Hundert Meter entfernt. Seit jener Zeit wurden genau auf diesem belebten Marktplatz auch die Zarenerlasse dem Volk bekanntgegeben. Bis ins 18.Jahrhundert hinein war der Platz nicht befestigt und konnte daher bei Regenwetter sehr matschig werden., Einen offiziellen Namen hatte der Marktplatz im 16.Jahrhundert auch noch nicht. Zwar hatte der ehemalige Hauptmarktplatz innerhalb des Kremls bereits vor seiner Verlegung den Namen \\"Schöner Platz\\" getragen. Es sollte allerdings mehrere Jahrhunderte dauern, bis der Name dem eigentlichen Platz aus dem Kreml hinaus folgte. Im Volksmund war für diesen aufgrund seiner primären Bedeutung zunächst der Name \\"Torg\\" (), wörtlich „Handel“, geläufig. Nachdem im Jahre 1552 genau dort, wo die heutige Basilius-Kathedrale steht, die hölzerne Dreifaltigkeitskirche errichtet wurde, hatte sich für den Platz davor der Name \\"Troizkaja\\" (), also „Platz der Heiligen Dreifaltigkeit“, eingebürgert. Jedoch hat nur drei Jahre später Zar Iwan der Schreckliche die Kirche der Heiligen Dreifaltigkeit abreißen und an deren Stelle die Basiliuskathedrale errichten lassen., Über Jahrzehnte hinweg unverändert war hingegen der rege Handel auf dem Platz der Heiligen Dreifaltigkeit, der letztlich dazu führte, dass dieser mit immer größer werdenden Marktständen, Handwerkerbuden und -zelten zugebaut wurde. Immer wieder gab es Erlasse der Zaren, bestimmte Bauten abzureißen und die Errichtung von Häusern auf dem Platz im Folgenden zu unterlassen. Doch das nützte wenig, die Bauten entstanden stets von Neuem – und immer wieder gab es Großbrände. Deshalb wurde der Platz seit dem Ende des 16.Jahrhunderts im Volksmund \\"Poschar\\" (, wörtlich „Brand“) genannt. Dieser Zustand sollte noch bis weit ins 17.Jahrhundert hinein andauern., Der „schöne Platz“., Der entscheidende Wandel des Platzes vom reinen Handelsplatz zum wörtlich „schönen Platz“ der Zarenhauptstadt setzte Ende des 17.Jahrhunderts ein. In den 1690er-Jahren ließ die Staatsmacht sämtliche Marktreihen, von denen manche bis unmittelbar an die Kremlmauer heranreichten, einige Hundert Meter tiefer nach Kitai-Gorod verlegen. Folglich entstanden dort die verschiedenen Handelsreihen, die teilweise als Vorläufer des heutigen Kaufhauses GUM an der Ostseite des Roten Platzes gelten. An einige dieser Reihen erinnern bis heute die Namen von Gassen in der näheren Umgebung des Roten Platzes (beispielsweise „Fischgasse“ () oder „Bleikristallgasse“ ())., Auf dem freigewordenen Platz der Dreifaltigkeit entstanden indes im späten 17. sowie im 18.Jahrhundert, zusätzlich zu der bereits 1561 fertiggestellten Basilius-Kathedrale, mehrere architektonisch anspruchsvolle Bauten, darunter die Kasaner Kathedrale und das Gebäude der Gouvernementverwaltung. Zudem erhielt in der Herrschaftszeit Katharina der Großen der zuvor fast gänzlich unbefestigte Platz erstmals einen Belag aus Holzbrettern, der 1804 erstmals durch Kopfsteinpflaster ersetzt wurde. Aus dem späten 17.Jahrhundert, als gerade angefangen wurde, den Platz zu verschönern, stammen auch die ersten historischen Dokumente, in denen dieser erstmals unter seinem heutigen Namen \\"Krasnaja Ploschtschad\\", also „der Schöne Platz“, geführt wird., Über Jahrhunderte hinweg behielt der Rote Platz im Folgenden unangefochten seine Rolle als zentraler Platz Moskaus. Vor dem Umzug der Hauptstadt des Russischen Zarenreichs in das neugegründete Sankt Petersburg wurden auf dem Roten Platz die Gesetze und Erlasse des Zaren öffentlich proklamiert. Außerdem fanden hier verschiedene Volksfeste und alle offiziellen Feierlichkeiten statt, wie beispielsweise die jährlichen großen Gottesdienste an wichtigen orthodoxen Feiertagen, das erste russische Neujahrsfest nach dem julianischen Kalender im Jahre 1700, die Militärparade im Jahre 1912 zum 100.Jahrestag des russischen Sieges im Krieg gegen Napoleon oder der feierliche Akt zum 300-jährigen Bestehen der Zarendynastie der Romanows im Jahr 1913. Auch nach dem Umzug der Hauptstadt fanden alle Zarenkrönungsfeiern auf dem Roten Platz ihren pompösen Abschluss. Freilich war der Platz in seiner Geschichte auch Schauplatz weniger rühmlicher Ereignisse: So fanden hier unter anderem zu Zeiten Iwan des Schrecklichen Hinrichtungen von in Ungnade geratenen Bojaren durch seine Leibgarde, die sogenannte Opritschnina, statt, und von 1698 bis 1699 wurden auf dem Roten Platz Hunderte von aufständischen Strelizen auf Befehl Peter des Großen hingerichtet., Das heutige architektonische Ensemble des Roten Platzes wurde im Wesentlichen Anfang des 20.Jahrhunderts abgeschlossen, nachdem seine nordöstliche Seite mit dem neuen Gebäude der Oberen Handelsreihen (heute: Warenhaus GUM) sowie rechts davon mit dem sehr ähnlich gestalteten Großhandelsgebäude bebaut wurde. Nach der Fertigstellung dieser Bauten, die vom Stil her an die historische Architektur des Kremls angelehnt wurden, wurde der Belag des Roten Platzes umfassend renoviert sowie bis zum Jahr 1909 eine Straßenbahnlinie mitten durch den Platz entlang der Kremlmauer verlegt.

Anfangs nur in sehr geringen Stückzahlen hergestellt, wurde der von Krupp entwickelte und von 1937 bis zum Kriegsende produzierte PanzerIV mit 8500 Exemplaren der meistgebaute deutsche Panzerkampfwagen. Der zunächst mit einer kurzen Kanone ausgestattete Panzer war ursprünglich als Unterstützungsfahrzeug gedacht, jedoch änderte sich sein Einsatzspektrum mit dem Einbau einer langen Kanone grundlegend. Obwohl er aufgrund der Rezeption in der Militärliteratur nicht den Bekanntheitsgrad eines Panther oder Tiger erreichte, war er in der zweiten Kriegshälfte der wichtigste deutsche Panzer. Der Panzerkampfwagen wurde in unterschiedlichen Ausführungen an nahezu allen Fronten eingesetzt. Darüber hinaus diente das Fahrgestell als Basis für zahlreiche weitere Waffenträger., Geschichte., Zur Endausstattung der zukünftigen Panzertruppe hatte schon im Jahre 1930 eine Arbeitsgruppe um den späteren Generaloberst Heinz Guderian zwei Grundtypen von Panzerkampfwagen vorgesehen, wobei das Heereswaffenamt die endgültige Ausstattung der Panzerdivisionen im Januar 1934 festlegte. Drei der vier Kompanien einer Panzerabteilung sollten einen Wagen mit panzerbrechender Kanone erhalten, den späteren PanzerkampfwagenIII. Die vierte Kompanie sollte mit einem Unterstützungsfahrzeug ausgerüstet werden, das mit seiner großkalibrigen Waffe Ziele bekämpfen sollte, für welche die kleinere panzerbrechende Waffe des PanzersIII ungeeignet war. Aus dieser Überlegung heraus entstand der PanzerkampfwagenIV., Abgesehen von der Hauptwaffe glich das Anforderungsprofil dem des Panzers III; die Besatzung sollte aus fünf Mann bestehen, eine Funkanlage sollte die Kommunikation ermöglichen und das Gesamtgewicht sollte mit 24 Tonnen die standardmäßige Brückenlast berücksichtigen., Entwicklung., Wegen des noch als Reichsgesetz geltenden Versailler Vertrages erhielt das Fahrzeug aus Gründen der Geheimhaltung die Tarnbezeichnung „Mittlerer Traktor“. Dieser Deckname wurde kurz darauf in „Begleitwagen“ (BW) geändert, bis 1935 mit der Gründung der Wehrmacht sämtliche Tarnnamen entfielen. An den noch Ende 1934 beginnenden Entwicklungsarbeiten beteiligten sich Rheinmetall, MAN und Krupp. Neu war das Konzept eines Unterstützungspanzers mit nur einem Turm, denn zur damaligen Zeit bestand bei den Armeen der größeren Staaten die Ansicht, dass für solche Aufgaben Multiturmpanzer besser geeignet wären., Der Rheinmetall-Prototyp hatte ein Gewicht von 18 Tonnen und erreichte mit einem 320-PS-Motor eine Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 30km/h. Das Laufwerk bestand je Seite aus acht an langen Hebelarmen paarweise aufgehängten Laufrollen und glich dem des von derselben Firma hergestellten Neubaufahrzeugs. Im Gegensatz dazu besaß der Prototyp von MAN ein Schachtellaufwerk, das von Ernst Kniepkamp beeinflusst war, der als Abteilungsleiter im Heereswaffenamt später als Hauptverantwortlicher für die Einführung des Schachtellaufwerkes bei den deutschen Panzerkampfwagen galt. Der Krupp-Vorschlag sah auf Veranlassung des HWA ebenfalls ein solches Laufwerk mit Drehstabfederung vor. Obwohl dieses Laufwerk weniger beschussempfindlich war und bessere Laufeigenschaften besaß, beharrten die Krupp-Ingenieure auf ihrer Blattfederung und nahmen von der Drehstabfederung trotz Widerstand des HWA wieder Abstand. Nachdem 1935/36 alle Prototypen bei der Versuchsstelle für Kraftfahrt in Kummersdorf umfangreiche Tests durchlaufen hatten, wurde Krupp als endgültige Produktionsfirma bestimmt. Der PanzerIV war der letzte noch in Friedenszeiten entwickelte deutsche Panzerkampfwagen., Serienproduktion., Im Oktober 1937 lief die Produktion des Panzers der Ausführung „A“ im Krupp-Grusonwerk in Magdeburg-Buckau an. Im Gegensatz zur Produktion der vorangegangenen PanzerkampfwagenI bis III, bei der mehrere Hersteller herangezogen worden waren, war das Magdeburger Werk bis Herbst 1941 die einzige Produktionsstätte für den PanzerIV. Aufgrund der Funktion als Unterstützungsfahrzeug war seine Beschaffung in deutlich geringerer Anzahl als die des PanzersIII vorgesehen, was sich in den anfangs niedrigen Stückzahlen bemerkbar machte., Nachdem schon im Jahr 1938 die Ausstattung der bis dahin bestehenden Panzerregimenter mit dem Panzer IV weitgehend abgeschlossen war, verblieb die Produktion auch nach dem Kriegsbeginn auf niedrigem Niveau. Infolge der geringen Leistungsfähigkeit der Industrie sowie der Einlagerung in Depots durch das OKH gelangten anfänglich nur wenige Fahrzeuge an die kämpfende Truppe. Die Produktion des PanzersIV besaß noch keine besondere Prioritätsstufe, was sich auch auf das Unternehmen Krupp als Hersteller auswirkte. So arbeiteten im Magdeburger Werk Anfang 1940 etwa 1200 Arbeiter, wobei die Fertigung des PanzersIV lediglich 35 % der Auftragskapazität einnahm. Erst nachdem die Leistungsreserven des bis dahin wichtiger erachteten PanzersIII vollkommen erschöpft waren, lief ab 1942 die Großserienproduktion des PanzersIV an. Als weitere Produktionsstätten kamen ab Herbst 1941 die VOMAG im sächsischen Plauen und ab Ende 1941 das später größte Panzermontagewerk des Deutschen Reiches, das Nibelungenwerk im niederösterreichischen Sankt Valentin, hinzu. Als bedeutende Zulieferbetriebe von Panzerstahlplatten, Wannen und Türmen fungierten das Stammwerk von Krupp in Essen mit dem Panzerbau III, die Eisen- und Hüttenwerke in Bochum, die Eisenwerke Oberdonau in Linz, der Dortmund-Hörder Hüttenverein in Dortmund und Böhler&amp;Co. in Kapfenberg. Die Maybach-Motoren kamen hauptsächlich aus dem Maybach-Stammwerk und dem Tochterunternehmen Nordbau sowie als Lizenzbau von Orenstein &amp; Koppel in Nordhausen und von MAN; die Getriebe kamen von ZF in Friedrichshafen., Im Falle eines nur selten erreichten betriebswirtschaftlichen Idealzustandes dauerte die Endmontage eines PanzersIV rund 2000 Arbeitsstunden. Die gesamte Fertigungszeit einschließlich aller Teile der Unterlieferanten wurde auf rund 15.000 Stunden geschätzt. Der Preis eines PanzerkampfwagensIV betrug ohne Hauptwaffe knapp über 100.000 Reichsmark. Der Rohstoffbedarf belief sich– ohne Waffen, Optik und Funk– auf folgende Mengen:, Wie alle deutschen Panzer wurde der Panzer IV vor allem zu Beginn der Produktion in qualitativ hochwertiger Arbeit fabriziert, was naturgemäß einer rationellen Massenfertigung entgegenstand. So war der Anteil der spanenden Bearbeitung bei den Panzerplatten sehr hoch. Erst 1943 konnte bei Krupp die personalintensive Bearbeitung mit der Einführung des autogenen Brennschneidens enorm verringert werden. Schon im Jahr zuvor konnte die oft über 100 Stunden dauernde Oberflächenhärtung des Panzerstahls mittels Zementation durch die weit effektivere Behandlung mit einer Gas-Sauerstoff-Flammhärtung ersetzt werden. Erfolgreiche Versuche mit einer neuartigen Induktionshärtung konnten auf die Panzerblechbearbeitung während des Krieges nicht mehr übertragen werden. Obwohl im Verlauf der Produktion aufgrund von Materialmangel der Anteil von Mangan, Chrom und Molybdän im Panzerstahl und damit auch dessen Qualität sank, konnte durch die spezielle Oberflächenbehandlung eine gute Beschussfestigkeit erreicht werden. Eine Brinell-Härteprüfung von britischer Seite ergab bei der Frontpanzerung einer „AusführungG“ den hohen Wert von bis zu 520 Brinell, was den höchsten Härtegrad aller deutschen Panzer darstellte., Anfang 1943 schlug der Generalstab des Heeres vor, die Herstellung aller Panzerkampfwagen mit Ausnahme des Tigers und des Panthers einzustellen. Generaloberst Guderian konnte jedoch den Weiterbau des PanzersIV durchsetzen. Wenn zu diesem Zeitpunkt die Produktion des Panzers eingestellt worden wäre, hätte das hart bedrängte Heer bis zur Serienreife des Panthers lediglich 25 Tiger-Panzer pro Monat als Nachschub erhalten. Einen weiteren Einblick in die teils keiner klaren Leitlinie folgende Panzerproduktion gab der im Jahre 1943 angeordnete Programmwechsel in der Panzer-IV-Fertigung im Grusonwerk. So erhielt Krupp im April den Befehl, die Herstellung des PanzersIV aufzugeben und auf die Panther-Produktion umzustellen. Im August erging die Anordnung, die Herstellung des Panthers sofort zu stoppen und wieder auf die Fertigung des PanzersIV umzustellen. Aufgrund dieser Programmänderungen entstand ein Gesamtausfall von 300.000 Arbeitsstunden, was der Herstellung von 150 PanzernIV entsprach. Ende des Jahres erfolgte dann die endgültige Einstellung der Panzer-IV-Produktion und die Umstellung auf die Fertigung des Sturmgeschützes IV. Bis dahin hatte das Grusonwerk 2362 PanzerIV hergestellt; VOMAG bis zur Umstellung der Produktion auf Jagdpanzer IV im Frühsommer 1944 insgesamt 1373 Stück. Mit 4820 Exemplaren stellte das bis zum Kriegsende produzierende Nibelungenwerk die meisten Fahrzeuge her., Ausführungen., Ausführung A mit 7,5-cm-KwK 37 L/24., Die erste Serie des PanzerkampfwagensIV wurde unter der Typbezeichnung 1./BW im Oktober 1937 aufgelegt. Bis zum März des darauffolgenden Jahres wurden von der „AusführungA“ 35 Stück produziert. Auffällig war der stufenförmig vorspringende Fahrererker und eine in die Turmrückwand eingelassene tonnenförmige Kommandantenkuppel. Das Fahrwerk bestand aus acht Doppellaufrollen, die paarweise an Viertelblattfedern aufgehängt waren. Diese Laufwerksanordnung wurde– im Gegensatz zu den Laufwerken der vorangegangenen Panzerkampfwagen– bis zum Produktionsende nicht mehr geändert. Das Laufwerk wurde durch vier Stützrollen, das vorne liegende Antriebsrad und das hinten liegende Leitrad komplettiert. Die Bewaffnung bestand aus einer kurzen Turmkanone \\"7,5-cm-KwK 37\\" mit Kaliberlänge L/24 (Rohrlänge = 1.800 mm) und zwei MG 34. Bei einer Wannenpanzerung von 15mm und einer Turmpanzerung von 20mm hatte das Fahrzeug ein Gefechtsgewicht von 17,3Tonnen und war mit dem– auch im PanzerIII verwendeten– Maybach-12-Zylinder-Ottomotor HL108 mit 250PS und einem Fünfgang-Getriebe motorisiert. Die Fahrzeuge kamen nicht zum Kampfeinsatz, sondern wurden hauptsächlich zu Ausbildungszwecken genutzt., Ausführung B., Bei den 1938 gebauten 42 Wagen der „Ausführung B“ (2./BW) war die Fahrerfront gerade ausgebildet. Durch die Verstärkung der Wannenfrontpanzerung auf 30mm stieg das Gewicht auf 17,7Tonnen. Als Antriebsaggregat kam der verstärkte Maybach-Motor HL120TR mit 300PS mit einem neuen Sechsgang-Getriebe zum Einsatz. Das vom Funker bediente Bug-MG entfiel, stattdessen stand ihm lediglich eine Klappe für seine Maschinenpistole zur Verfügung.

Neben den typischen roten Hautflecken (Masern-Exanthem) ruft die Erkrankung Fieber und einen erheblich geschwächten Allgemeinzustand hervor. Diese sogenannte Kinderkrankheit wird durch das Masernvirus hervorgerufen und kann in manchen Fällen lebensbedrohlich sein durch schwere Verläufe (Komplikationen) mit Lungen- und Hirnentzündungen. In den meisten Ländern ist die Erkrankung meldepflichtig., Die Diagnose erfolgt durch das klinische Bild und einen Antikörpernachweis im Blut. Eine spezifische Therapie existiert nicht, der Erkrankung und somit auch den Komplikationen kann jedoch durch Impfung ab dem zwölften Lebensmonat vorgebeugt werden. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) strebt die weltweite Ausrottung der Masern an. Durch Impfungen konnte die Zahl der Erkrankungen in der Vergangenheit stark reduziert werden, von 1980 bis 2013 um über 95 %. Bedingt durch die sich in den Industrieländern ausbreitende Impfscheu und die globale Migrationsbewegung sind die Masernfälle weltweit in den letzten Jahren wieder um 30 % angestiegen. Die WHO hat deshalb im Januar 2019 die Masern zur Bedrohung der globalen Gesundheit erklärt. Die Überprüfung und Ergänzung des Impfschutzes für Masern für Erwachsene und Kinder bei Reisevorbereitungen wird daher dringend empfohlen. In Regionen mit hoher Impfquote wie bspw. Nord- und Südamerika sind Masern bis auf wenige importierte Fälle de facto bereits ausgerottet, dort wurden im Jahr 2014 weniger als 2000 Fälle bestätigt., Die lateinische Bezeichnung \\"\\" ist eine Verkleinerungsform (Diminutiv) von „Krankheit“., Epidemische Lage., Welt., Das Masernvirus kommt weltweit vor, wobei die Krankheitshäufigkeit stark variiert. Insbesondere in Entwicklungsländern kommt es immer wieder zu lokalen Masernepidemien mit hohen Krankheits- und Sterblichkeitszahlen. Die Masern gehören dort zu den häufigsten Infektionskrankheiten. Laut Schätzung der WHO haben sie im Jahr 2000 fast die Hälfte der 1,7Millionen durch Impfung vermeidbaren Todesfälle bei Kindern verursacht, bei geschätzten 30 bis 40 Millionen Krankheitsfällen in jenem Jahr. Die Zahl der gemeldeten Erkrankungen liegt aufgrund der hohen Dunkelziffer weit unter diesen geschätzten Werten (siehe Tabelle)., Auf der anderen Seite konnte das Virus durch groß angelegte Impfkampagnen in verschiedenen anderen Regionen, so dem gesamten amerikanischen Doppelkontinent, bereits weitgehend eliminiert werden (siehe Grafik). Das wurde dadurch möglich, dass der Mensch der einzige Wirt des Masernvirus ist. 2001 legten die WHO und UNICEF einen Plan vor mit dem Ziel, die Sterblichkeitsrate bei Kindern durch weltweite Impfprogramme bis zum Jahr 2005 zu halbieren. Während genaue Daten noch ausstehen, zeigen verschiedene Berichte, dass dieses Ziel zu einem großen Teil erreicht wurde. Von 1999 bis 2003 gelang eine weltweite Reduktion der Masern-Sterblichkeit um 39 %, wobei weiterhin hohe Sterblichkeitsraten in Afrika und Südostasien bestehen. 2005 adaptierte die \\"World Health Assembly\\" der WHO diese Pläne und formulierte für das Jahr 2010 das Ziel einer 90-prozentigen Reduktion der weltweiten Sterblichkeit. Dieses Ziel wurde laut WHO nicht erreicht. Von weltweit 535.300 (geschätzt) Maserntoten im Jahr 2000 sank die Zahl bis 2010 auf 139.300, dies entspricht einer Senkung um 74 %. 2019 sind weltweit nach Schätzungen der WHO und CDC mehr als 200.000 Menschen an Masern gestorben, insbesondere in Afrika., Anfang 2020 äußerte die WHO, eine im Kongo herrschende, ein Jahr zuvor ausgebrochene Masernepidemie sei der „derzeit schlimmste Masernausbruch weltweit“. Sie habe zu mehr als 6.000 Todesfällen geführt., Europa., Die Gesamtzahl der erfassten Erkrankungen in Europa ging von 1990 bis 2004 bei gleichzeitig verbesserter Überwachungs- und Meldesysteme deutlich zurück. Die Häufigkeit der Fälle ist, bedingt durch variierende Impfquoten, sehr unterschiedlich. Während sie in einigen Regionen, wie den skandinavischen Ländern, sehr niedrig ist –in Finnland traten seit 1996 lediglich vier importierte Fälle auf –, ist das in Mittel- und Osteuropa oft noch nicht der Fall. Dort kommt es aufgrund von Impflücken immer wieder zu lokalen Krankheitsausbrüchen. Trotz Meldepflicht in den meisten Ländern existiert wahrscheinlich eine hohe Dunkelziffer, und die Zahl der tatsächlichen Krankheitsfälle liegt wesentlich höher als die der gemeldeten. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) appellierte 2011 an die EU-Mitgliedstaaten, Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Masern zu verstärken., Im Jahr 2018 wurden bei weitem mehr Masernfälle gemeldet als in anderen Kalenderjahren des Jahrzehnts., Amerika., Bis 1994 führten nahezu alle Staaten der UN-Region Amerika Impfprogramme für Kinder ein. Dadurch verringerte sich die durchschnittliche Zahl der Neuerkrankungen von 250.000 auf etwa 100 Fälle pro Jahr, die Masern gelten damit als faktisch ausgerottet. Regional treten noch vereinzelte Krankheitsausbrüche auf, die nahezu alle importiert sind oder auf importierte Masern zurückgeführt werden können. Amerika wird somit ein Beispiel dafür zitiert, dass die Masern durch Impfprogramme weltweit beherrscht werden können., Inzwischen treten genuine, also nicht importierte, Masernerkrankungen in den Staaten Nord- und Südamerikas mit Einschluss der Karibik kaum noch auf. Die \\"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\" sehen die Masern in den USA nicht mehr als endemische Krankheit an. Ende September 2016 meldete die panamerikanische Gesundheitsorganisation den amerikanischen Doppelkontinent als frei von Masern., Allerdings kam es in den USA nach 2016 wieder zu einer Zunahme von Masernerkrankungen. Ausgangspunkt waren Menschen, die aus Staaten mit noch endemischem Vorkommen von Masern in die USA eingereist waren und dann das Virus in Subpopulationen verschleppt hatten, die in den USA ohne Herdenimmunität sind. Ab Anfang Januar wurden, mit Stand zum 3. Juli 2019, über 1109 Fälle von Masern in 28 Staaten der USA gemeldet. Dies ist die größte Fallzahl seit 1992., Situation nach Staaten., Europa., Deutschland., 2005 kam es in Deutschland zu zwei größeren Masernausbrüchen: im Februar in Hessen (223 Masernfälle, eine 14-Jährige starb) und von März bis Juli in Oberbayern (279 Masernfälle). 13 % von ihnen wurden in Kliniken behandelt. 2006 wurden Masernhäufungen in Baden-Württemberg sowie in Nordrhein-Westfalen (dort weit über 1500 Fälle) gemeldet., 2013 kam es in München zu einer Epidemie. Das dortige Gesundheitsreferat registrierte von April bis Anfang Juni 220 Fälle (nach 7 Fällen im Vorjahr). Über die Hälfte der Erkrankten musste in Kliniken behandelt werden, besonders häufig erkrankten Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene. Eine Schülerin brachte das Virus dann an eine Waldorfschule im Rhein-Erft-Kreis, wo es bei einer Impfquote von nur 25 % bei 400 Schülern zu einem weiteren Masernausbruch im Juli 2013 kam. 54 Menschen (davon 29 Jugendliche und Erwachsene) erkrankten. Drei Patienten mussten stationär im Krankenhaus behandelt werden. Da auch die Impfquote der Lehrer sehr niedrig war, musste die Schule für sechs Tage geschlossen werden., Zwischen dem 29. September 2014 und dem 27. September 2015 (Saisonjahr ab Kalenderwoche 40) wurden in Berlin 1392 Masernerkrankungen gemeldet, was einer Inzidenz von 407 pro 1 Million Einwohner entspricht. In Thüringen, Sachsen, Hamburg und Brandenburg ergaben sich Inzidenzen zwischen 45 und 75. Für Deutschland ergibt sich aus 2.465 in dieser Zeit gemeldeten Fällen eine Inzidenz von 30,1. Die meisten Erkrankungen (über 1000 in Berlin) wurden von Januar bis April gemeldet. Der Virusstamm wurde vermutlich von Asylsuchenden aus Bosnien und Herzegowina und Serbien, die auch als erste erkrankten, eingeschleppt. In Bosnien und Herzegowina grassierte bereits seit Februar 2014 eine Masern-Epidemie mit mehreren Tausend Erkrankten. Die Daten im Epidemiologischen Bulletin ließen 2013 befürchten, dass Masern in Deutschland bald wieder endemisch würden; dies trat jedoch bisher nicht ein. Im März 2020 begann die COVID-19-Pandemie in Deutschland und in vielen anderen Ländern. Wegen der dagegen ergriffenen Maßnahmen wurden in den Kalenderwochen 10 bis 32 85 % weniger Fälle registriert als im Durchschnitt der Vorjahre., In der DDR gab es eine Impfpflicht gegen Masern. 2016 waren in Deutschland 93 Prozent der Kinder bei der Schuleingangsuntersuchung ausreichend gegen Masern geimpft. Da Kinder, die Waldorfschulen besuchen, relativ selten geimpft sind, treten dort Masern häufig auf., Seit Beginn der Meldepflicht 2001 wurden bis 2018 acht Todesfälle durch Masern registriert; Komplikationen wurden bei 1,1 bis 8,4 Prozent aller gemeldeten Masernerkrankungen gemeldet., In Deutschland ist zum 1. März 2020 das Masernschutzgesetz in Kraft getreten., Österreich., In Österreich wurde vor der Einführung der Masern-Meldepflicht 2001 vom Institut für Virologie (Wien) ein freiwilliges Meldesystem betrieben, das etwa 8 % der österreichischen Bevölkerung abdeckte. Somit konnten für den Zeitraum von 1993 bis 1997 etwa 28.000 bis 30.000 Masernfälle für ganz Österreich hochgerechnet werden, wobei besonders 1996 und 1997 ein gehäuftes Auftreten von Masernerkrankungen zu verzeichnen war. Die Zahl der jährlichen Fälle lag zwischen 2003 und 2007 jeweils unter 100 pro Jahr. Ab März 2008 breitete sich von einer Waldorfschule im Raum Salzburg eine Masernepidemie über fast alle österreichischen und zwei deutsche Bundesländer aus. In Salzburg wurden 241 Fälle gemeldet, 146 in Oberösterreich, 22 in Wien, 13 in Tirol und 10 in Vorarlberg. Im Zusammenhang mit dieser Epidemie erkrankten nach Auskunft bayerischer Behörden zwischen Mitte März und Mitte Juli 2008 auch insgesamt 217 Personen in vier oberbayerischen Landkreisen. Das Department für Virologie der Medizinischen Universität Wien führt hingegen nur 50 Masernfälle in Bayern, 2 in Baden-Württemberg und 4 Masernfälle in Norwegen direkt auf diesen Ausbruch zurück. Nur 21 der insgesamt 443 im Jahr 2008 gemeldeten Maserninfektionen in Österreich waren nicht Teil des Salzburger Ausbruchs, sondern waren durch Reisen aus Ländern wie der Schweiz, Deutschland, Spanien und Indien nach Österreich importiert worden., Schweiz., In der Schweiz kam es 1997 zu einer Epidemie mit 6400 Erkrankungen. Die Daten der Schweiz basieren auf dem \\"Sentinella-Meldesystem\\". Nach 574 Fällen im Jahr 2003 wurden 2004 mit 39 Fällen und 2005 mit 60 Fällen wesentlich niedrigere Erkrankungsraten gemeldet.

Aufgrund seiner starken Hauptwaffe und des hohen Panzerschutzes war der Tiger einer der kampfstärksten Panzer des Zweiten Weltkrieges., Als schwerwiegende Nachteile galten neben der konventionellen Form – ohne geneigte Panzerung – die aufwendige Herstellung, die geringe Fahrreichweite sowie die schwere Bergungsfähigkeit aufgrund seiner enormen Masse. Infolgedessen gingen mehr Fahrzeuge durch Aufgabe bzw. Selbstzerstörung verloren als bei anderen Panzermodellen. Die oft kritisierte kompliziertere Technik führte zwar zu einem höheren Instandsetzungsbedarf, jedoch lag die Bereitschaftsquote des Tigers mit 65 bis 70Prozent auf dem Niveau des Panzerkampfwagen IV und der des Panzerkampfwagen V Panther., Obwohl die strategische Bedeutung des Tigers aufgrund der niedrigen Produktionszahl von nur 1350Exemplaren gering war, ist er einer der bekanntesten Panzer des Krieges. Stand 2023 existieren noch sechs Tiger-1-Panzer., Entwicklungsgeschichte., Vorstufen., Obwohl der eigentliche Konstruktionsauftrag für den Tiger erst im Frühjahr1941 vergeben wurde, lässt sich die Entwicklungsgeschichte bis ins Jahr1937 zurückverfolgen. Damals bekam das Kasseler Unternehmen Henschel vom Heereswaffenamt den Auftrag, einen Infanterie-Unterstützungspanzer in der 30-t-Klasse als Nachfolger für den Panzerkampfwagen IV zu entwickeln. Der als Durchbruchwagen „DW1“ bezeichnete Prototyp sollte als Hauptwaffe die auch im PanzerIV verwendete 7,5-cm-KwK 40 Kampfwagenkanone besitzen. Nach dem Bau eines Fahrgestelles wurden die Versuche 1938 eingestellt, da ein neuer Auftrag für den nur minimal veränderten Nachfolger „DW2“ vorlag, von dem Henschel ebenfalls nur ein Fahrgestell produzierte., In der Zwischenzeit beschäftigte sich Henschel auch mit einem 65t schweren Nachfolger des Neubaufahrzeuges in Form des „VK65.01“, der –wie der spätere Tiger– eine Frontpanzerung von 100mm und eine Seitenpanzerung von 80mm besaß und dessen Bewaffnung ebenfalls aus der kurzen 7,5-cm-Kanone bestand., Nachdem das Heereswaffenamt neue Grundanforderungen festgelegt hatte, reichte Henschel –neben MAN, Daimler-Benz und Porsche– einen überarbeiteten Vorschlag des DW2 unter der Bezeichnung „VK30.01(H)“ ein (VK für Vollketten-Kraftfahrzeug). Von den drei gebauten Fahrgestellen wurde eines bis Kriegsende betriebsinternen Versuchen unterzogen, während die anderen zwei als Chassis für die Panzerselbstfahrlafette für 12,8-cm-Kanone 40 dienten. Gleichzeitig entstand bei Henschel der „VK 36.01 (H)“, der aufgrund einer Forderung Hitlers nach höherer Panzerung und stärkerer Bewaffnung entwickelt wurde und als direkter Vorläufer des Tigers gilt. Ein auffälliger Unterschied war das nicht über das Laufwerk hängende Panzerkastenoberteil. Bei einer Frontpanzerung von 100mm und einer Seitenpanzerung von 60mm betrug das Gewicht knapp 40Tonnen. Die Hauptwaffe sollte aus einer 7,5-cm-Kanone mit konischem Rohr bestehen. Die vier hergestellten Fahrgestelle dienten später als Schleppfahrzeuge., Prototypen., Nachdem der Mangel an Wolfram die Verwendung der konischen Waffe ausschloss und die kurze Kanone des PanzerIV in den ersten Gefechten nur unbefriedigende Durchschlagsleistungen aufwies, erteilte das Heereswaffenamt (HWA) am 26.Mai 1941 mit dem „VK45.01“ den endgültigen Entwicklungsauftrag an Henschel und Porsche für den späteren Tiger. Der Kampfwagen in der 45-t-Klasse sollte stärker als bisher gepanzert sein und die als Acht-Acht bekannte Flugabwehrkanone als Hauptwaffe besitzen. Da die Vorführung des Prototyps am Geburtstag Hitlers am 20.April 1942 stattfinden sollte, griffen beide Unternehmen angesichts der knappen Zeit auf Bauteile ihrer vorangegangenen Entwicklungen zurück. Infolge des erhöhten Bedarfs solcher Kampfwagen kurz nach Beginn des Russlandfeldzuges bestellte die Wehrmacht schon im Sommer 1941 die Fahrzeuge vom Reißbrett weg und vergab Bauaufträge für 90Panzer von Porsche und 60 von Henschel., Einen unkonventionellen Entwurf stellte der von Professor Ferdinand Porsche konstruierte und auch Porsche-Tiger genannte VK45.01(P) mit seinem benzinelektrischen Antrieb dar, bei dem zwei jeweils 320PS starke Zehnzylindermotoren zwei Generatoren antrieben, mit deren Strom die zwei an den hinteren Antriebsrädern angeflanschten Elektromotoren gespeist wurden. Große Nachteile waren der hohe Bodendruck des Fahrzeuges, die geringe Reichweite im Gelände von nur 50km und technische Schwierigkeiten mit den luftgekühlten Motoren., Da beim VK 36.01 von Henschel nach dem Wegfall der konischen Kanone der Turmdrehkranz für den jetzt einzusetzenden –und ursprünglich für den Porsche-Tiger konstruierten– Krupp-Turm mit seiner 8,8-cm-Kanone zu klein war, musste das Chassis vergrößert werden. Da zusätzlich eine Verstärkung der Panzerung erfolgte, überschritt die Gesamtmasse des Kampfwagens die vorgegebene Gewichtsgrenze um 12 Tonnen., Daneben projektierte Henschel noch eine weitere Ausführung mit einem Turm von Rheinmetall-Borsig, der fast baugleich mit dem Turm des Panthers war und auch dessen überlange 7,5-cm-Kanone besitzen sollte. Nach dem Bau eines Holzmodells wurde dieser Plan zu den Akten gelegt., Die Erprobung der Prototypen erfolgte bei der Versuchsstelle für Kraftfahrt (Verskraft) in Kummersdorf und auf dem Truppenübungsplatz Senne bei der Henschel Panzerversuchsstation 96 in Haustenbeck. Bei Letzterer fanden neben Fahr- und Schießerprobungen auf dem Truppenübungsplatz auch die Prüfungen für gasdichte Panzerfahrzeuge in Sondergebäuden sowie Dichtigkeitsprüfungen in Tauchdurchfahrtsbecken statt., Nur unter größten Anstrengungen konnten der Henschel- und der im Nibelungenwerk hergestellte Porsche-Prototyp zum angegebenen Termin fertiggestellt werden. Ohne jegliche Tests hatten beide Fahrzeuge insgesamt erst wenige Meter zurückgelegt. Da der Henschel-Panzer über das Lademaß des Eisenbahnwaggons herausragte, musste die Strecke von Kassel bis zum Führerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze in Ostpreußen für den Gegenverkehr gesperrt werden. Angesichts der persönlichen Freundschaft zwischen Porsche und Hitler widmete dieser von vornherein dem Porsche-Prototyp die volle Aufmerksamkeit, während er dem Prototyp von Henschel fast gar keine Beachtung schenkte. Bei den anschließenden Versuchsfahrten fiel der Porsche-Tiger schon auf der Straße aus, während das Henschel-Fahrzeug trotz kleiner technischer Defekte auch leichte Geländefahrten absolvieren konnte., Trotz schwerer Bedenken bezüglich des ungewöhnlichen und noch nicht ausgereiften Antriebes des Porsche-Tigers bestand Hitler auf der Weiterführung beider Projekte. Im Sommer 1942 erfolgten umfangreiche Testfahrten bei der Versuchsstelle für Kraftfahrt, bei denen der Henschel-Tiger bis Ende Juli knapp 1000km zurücklegte. Das Fahrzeug galt aber aufgrund zahlreicher Kinderkrankheiten noch nicht als frontreif. Aufgrund andauernder Motorprobleme verzögerte sich die Ankunft des Porsche-Tigers, der in der folgenden Versuchsfahrt in schwerem Gelände vollständig versagte. Daraufhin wurden Porsche weitere drei Monate für eine Überarbeitung zugestanden. Welche Rolle der Porsche-Tiger in den Überlegungen Hitlers spielte, zeigte nicht nur seine Anordnung, die Fertigung mit allen Mitteln zu beschleunigen und auf eine sonst übliche Erprobung nach Möglichkeit zu verzichten, sondern auch seine Forderung vom September, in der die noch gar nicht vorhandenen Fahrzeuge schnellstens auf den nordafrikanischen Kriegsschauplatz verlegt werden sollten. Im Oktober richtete Rüstungsminister Albert Speer eine Tiger-Kommission ein, die sich auf das endgültige Produktionsmodell festlegen sollte und nach einer nochmaligen Begutachtung beider Ausführungen Ende Oktober 1942 den Henschel-Tiger zur Serienherstellung bestimmte. Die bis dahin hergestellten Porschewannen wurden später zum Jagdpanzer Ferdinand umgebaut., Serienproduktion., Im August 1942 lief die Produktion bei Henschel in Kassel-Mittelfeld an, nachdem das dortige WerkIII umfangreich ausgebaut worden war. In der Panzerfertigung arbeiteten 8000 Beschäftigte in 12-Stunden-Schichten, wobei die Nachtschicht ein bedeutend geringeres Arbeitspensum als die Tagschicht erreichte. Aufgrund einer Anweisung von 1943 war bei der Tigerfertigung eine Beschäftigung ausländischer Arbeitskräfte ohne Genehmigung ausdrücklich untersagt. Die Fertigungsstraße bestand aus neun Takten mit jeweils sechs Stunden Bearbeitungsdauer. Die Herstellungsdauer eines Fahrzeuges belief sich auf etwa 14 Tage. Ein Großteil der Komponenten wurde fertigmontiert angeliefert, wobei folgende Unternehmen die wichtigsten Hauptlieferanten waren:, Wie die meisten deutschen Panzer wurde der Tiger in qualitativ hochwertiger Arbeit fabriziert, so dass in Kombination mit seiner komplizierten Konstruktion eine rationelle Massenfertigung nicht möglich war. Zudem war der Anteil der spanenden Bearbeitung bei der Wannen- und Turmherstellung sehr hoch und stellte hohe Anforderungen an die Fertigungstechnik. Um eine stabile Waffenplattform zu schaffen, wurden die Panzerplatten so groß wie möglich gehalten, so dass unter anderem die Bodenwanne und der Turm –mit Ausnahme der Front– aus einem einzigen Stück bestanden. Um Brüchen oder Rissen durch Beschuss vorzubeugen, wurden die Panzerplatten nur leicht oberflächengehärtet, so dass beispielsweise die Frontplatten einen Härtegrad von 265 Brinell aufwiesen, halb soviel wie beim Panzer IV. Trotzdem handelte es sich um eine sehr harte Panzerung, die keine Anzeichen von Sprödigkeit aufwies., Nach der Montage wurden die Panzer ohne Turm auf einer Teststrecke rund 100km eingefahren, wobei Flaschengas als Treibstoff verwendet wurde, um Benzin zu sparen. Danach wurde der Turm aufgesetzt, das Fahrzeug komplett ausgerüstet und offiziell übergeben. Die Kosten für einen Tiger beliefen sich –ohne Waffen, Optik und Funk– auf 250.800 Reichsmark; voll ausgerüstet betrug der in Rechnung gestellte Preis 300.000RM. In der Dienstvorschrift D 656/27 (Tigerfibel) wurde der Preis mit 800.000 Reichsmark beziffert., Bei allen anfangs ausgelieferten Fahrzeugen traten massive Probleme mit dem halbautomatischen Schaltgetriebe auf, so dass der Tiger zu diesem Zeitpunkt als nicht betriebssicher angesehen wurde. Neben andauernden Defekten wie Motorbränden, Lecks im Kühlwasserkreislauf und Kurzschlüssen traten zusätzlich Ölverluste am Motor von: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Kampfpanzer, Wehrmacht, Tiger, Panzer, Entwicklungsgeschichte, Prototypen, Serienproduktion, Panzerung, Kanone, Motor"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Außenminister (Usbekistan), Bildungsminister (Usbekistan), Drama, Dschadidismus, Erzählung, Finanzminister (Usbekistan), Geboren 1886, Gestorben 1938, Herausgeber, Hochschullehrer (Usbekistan)], Abdurauf Fitrat [] (* 1886 in Buchara; † im Oktober 1938 in Taschkent) war ein zentralasiatischer Schriftsteller, Journalist und Politiker aus dem heutigen Usbekistan und ein bucharischer Vertreter des Dschadidismus., Fitrat forderte in seinen anfangs persischsprachigen Schriften Neuerungen im sozialen und kulturellen Leben in Zentralasien, später lehnte sich sein Programm am Panturkismus an. Nach dem Ende des Emirats Buchara übernahm Fitrat verschiedene Ministerposten in der Regierung der Volksrepublik Buchara. Nach der Machtübernahme der Sowjets wurde nach einem kurzen Exil in Moskau Hochschullehrer in der Usbekischen SSR und später Opfer des Großen Terrors., Fitrats literarisches Werk umfasst sowohl lyrische als auch prosaische Werke, die Einflüsse traditioneller islamischer und zentralasiatischer Literatur genauso zeigen wie eine Annäherung an „moderne“ Genres. Seine Sach- und Lehrbücher widmen sich Themen wie Islam, Literatur- und Musikgeschichte und Sprachwissenschaft. Nach Fitrats Tod war der Großteil seiner Werke jahrzehntelang verboten. Heute wird Fitrats Bedeutung für die Herausbildung sowohl der modernen usbekischen als auch der tadschikischen Literatursprache anerkannt. Während er in Tadschikistan gegenwärtig mitunter als „Verräter“ tituliert wird, gilt er in der offiziellen usbekischen Geschichtsschreibung mittlerweile als Märtyrer., Namensvarianten., Fitrats Name taucht in vielen verschiedenen Formen und Schreibweisen auf: Meist verwendete er selbst als Künstlernamen \\"Fitrat\\" (), transkribiert auch als \\"Fetrat\\" oder gemäß der usbekischen Schriftreform von 1921 \\"Pitrat\\". Der aus dem arabischen Begriff abgeleitete Name stand im osmanischen Türkisch für das Konzept der Natur und wahrer Religion, in Zentralasien im 19. Jahrhundert, so der russische Turkologe Lasar Budagow, hingegen für Almosen im Zeitraum des Fests des Fastenbrechens (\\"ʿĪd al-Fiṭr\\"). Im Persischen und Tadschikischen erstreckt sich die Bedeutung von \\"Fitrat\\" auf Religion, Kreation, Weisheit und Klugheit. Der Künstlername \\"Fitrat\\" wurde bereits zuvor vom Dichter Fitrat Zarduz Samarqandi (spätes 17. bis frühes 18. Jahrhundert) verwendet. Abdurauf Fitrats erstes bekanntes Pseudonym lautete \\"Mijmar\\" (aus dem arabischen )., Fitrats arabischer Name lautet (bisweilen abweichend ), mit \\"Abdurauf\\" als Eigenname und manchmal mit der Nisba \\"Buchārāī\\". In reformierter arabischer Schrift wurde \\"Fitrat\\" als oder wiedergegeben. Die turksprachige Variante des Nasab lautet., Unter den russischen Varianten seines Namens finden sich –neben anderen– und ; Fitrats sowjetischer, russifizierter Name lautete auf oder, unter Weglassung des Namensbestandteils \\"ʿAbd\\",. Ebenfalls anzutreffen ist die Schreibweise. In usbekisch-kyrillischer Schrift ist sein Name mit wiederzugeben; sein moderner tadschikischer Name lautet., Fitrat trug bisweilen die Titel „Hoji“ und „Professor“. Sein Vorname findet sich in lateinischen Umschriften unter anderem auch als \\"Abdurrauf\\", \\"Abdulrauf\\" oder \\"Abdalrauf\\". Fitrat unterschrieb seine Werke teils nur mit seinem Vornamen oder kürzte ihn mit \\"A.\\" oder \\"R.\\" ab., Leben und Schaffen., Ausbildung in Buchara., Fitrat wurde 1886 (eigenen Angaben zufolge 1884) in Buchara geboren. Über seine Kindheit ist – laut Adeeb Khalid typisch für eine zentralasiatische Persönlichkeit dieser Ära – recht wenig bekannt. Sein Vater Abdurahimboy war ein gläubiger Muslim und weitgereister Händler, der die Familie in Richtung Margʻilon und später Kaschgar verlassen sollte. Von seiner belesenen Mutter, je nach Quelle Mustafbibi, Nastarbibi, oder Bibijon genannt, erhielt der junge Abdurauf eine weltliche Ausbildung. Sie brachte ihm laut Edward A. Allworth die Werke von Bedil, Fuzuli, Alisher Navoiy und anderen näher. Abdurauf hatte mit Abdurahmon und Mahbuba einen Bruder und eine Schwester., Muhammaddschon Schakurij zufolge vollzog Abdurauf im Kindesalter mit seinem Vater den Haddsch. Nach der Ausbildung an einer \\"maktab\\" soll Fitrat 1899 Studien an der Mir-i-Arab-Medrese in Buchara begonnen und 1910 beendet haben; zwischen 1907 und 1910 reiste Fitrat ausgiebig durch das russische Turkestan und das Emirat Buchara. Der Philologe Begali Qosimov geht davon aus, dass Fitrat bis zu seinem 18. Lebensjahr in Buchara studierte und zwischen 1904 und 1907 den Haddsch mit Besuch der Türkei, des Iran sowie Indiens absolvierte und auch Russland bereiste. Laut Zaynobiddin Abdurashidov, Prorektor an der Alisher-Navoiy-Universität für usbekische Sprache und Literatur, pilgerte Fitrat Anfangs des 20. Jahrhunderts Fitrat im Rahmen einer Reise durch Asian nach Mekka, während der er für einige Zeit in Indien lebte, wo er sich als Barbier Geld für die Rückreise verdiente. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt sei er in Buchara bereits als Dichter unter seinem Pseudonym \\"Mijmar\\" bekannt gewesen. Auch Khalid und Allworth benennen die Mir-i-Arab-Medrese als Fitrats Ausbildungsstätte in Buchara. Während seines Medresen-Studiums wurde Fitrat von seinem Lehrer auch in antiker griechischer Philosophie unterrichtet., Fitrat schrieb in seiner 1929 veröffentlichten Autobiographie, Buchara sei eines der dunkelsten religiösen Zentren gewesen, er sei fanatischer Muslim gewesen und er habe anfangs die Reformbewegung des Dschadidismus (\\"usul-i dschadid\\" ‚neue Methode‘) abgelehnt. Eine Grundausbildung in jener „neuen Methode“ erhielt Fitrat selbst nicht. Sadriddin Ayni zufolge war Fitrat als einer der aufgeklärtesten und verdienstvollsten Studenten im Buchara seiner Zeit bekannt, außerhalb Bucharas war er jedoch laut Abdurashidov bis 1911 de facto unbekannt. Dass sich Fitrat nicht an den Aktivitäten der ersten Dschadidengruppe Bucharas beteiligte, erklärt Abdurashidov mit dem damals gegebenen fortschrittsfeindlichen Milieu unter der Herrschaft des Emirs Abd al-Ahad Khan. Interesse an den Ideen des Reformismus generierte Fitrat Abdurashidov zufolge etwa ab 1909 vermutlich unter dem Einfluss der von Mehmet Âkif Ersoy herausgegebenen Zeitschrift \\"Sırat-ı Müstakim\\", die ebenso wie andere Zeitschriften und Zeitungen in jener Zeit in Studentenkreisen zirkulierte, sowie unter Mahmudxoʻja Behbudiy als Mentor. Nach dem Abschluss seiner Ausbildung unterrichtete Fitrat selbst kurz an einer Medrese, doch ist nicht überliefert an welcher., Aufenthalt in Istanbul und dschadidistischer Führer., Um 1909 bildeten dschadidistische Akteure in Buchara sowie in Istanbul (Konstantinopel) eine organisatorische Infrastruktur, die Studenten und Lehrern aus Buchara Studienaufenthalte in der Hauptstadt des Osmanischen Reichs ermöglichen sollte. Fitrat war Berichten zufolge selbst am Aufbau dieser Gesellschaften beteiligt und konnte dank eines Stipendiums der geheimen, von Händlern finanzierten „Gesellschaft für die Bildung der Kinder“ \\"(Tarbiyayi atfol)\\" kurz nach der ersten Gruppe im Frühjahr 1910 selbst nach Istanbul gehen. „Manchmal“, so Sarfraz Khan von der Universität Peschawar, wird Fitrats Abreise in die Türkei als Flucht vor der Verfolgung durch die Behörden nach einem Konflikt zwischen Schiiten und Sunniten in Buchara im Januar 1910 beschrieben; andere Autoren datieren Fitrats Gang nach Istanbul auf das Jahr 1909., Istanbul wurde zu dieser Zeit von den Jungtürken regiert – ein historischer Umstand, der wesentlichen Einfluss auf Fitrat sowie auf die Aktivitäten und das soziale Umfeld der bucharischen Studenten in Istanbul im Allgemeinen haben sollte. Was Fitrat in der Zeit nach seiner Ankunft in Istanbul machte, ist Abdurashidov zufolge nicht im Detail bekannt. Seinen Analysen zufolge war Fitrat in der bucharischen Diaspora-Community vernetzt (oft wird er als einer der Gründer der Unterstützungsgesellschaft \\"Buxoro ta’mimi maorif\\" genannt), arbeitete als Verkäufer am Basar, Straßenfeger und als Küchenhilfe, und bereitete sich auf die Zugangsprüfungen an der Medrese vor. Diese bestand er vermutlich etwa Mitte 1913 und wurde einer der ersten Studenten der im Dezember 1912 gegründeten, nach reformiertem System arbeitenden Vaizin-Medrese, an der er nicht nur in islamischen Wissenschaften, sondern auch in orientalischer Literaturgeschichte unterrichtet wurde., Anderen Autoren zufolge studierte Fitrat zwischen 1909 und 1913 am \\"Darülmuallimin\\", einem Schulungsinstitut für Lehrer, oder an der Universität Istanbul. Fitrat lernte während seines Aufenthaltes weitere nahöstliche Reformideen kennen, kam mit der Panturanismus-Bewegung und Emigranten aus dem russischen Zarenreich in Kontakt und entwickelte sich zum Sprecher der in Istanbul weilenden Vertreter des Dschadidismus. Fitrat verfasste erste Schriften, in denen er –stets in persischer Sprache– Neuerungen im sozialen und kulturellen Leben in Zentralasien und den Willen zum Fortschritt einforderte. Seine ersten Texte erschienen in den islamistischen Zeitschriften \\"Hikmet\\" des Şehbenderzâde Filibeli Ahmed Hilmi und \\"Sırat-ı Müstakim\\", außerdem in Behbudiys \\"Oyina\\" und im turkistischen Blatt \\"Türk Yurdu\\". Fitrat propagierte in diesen Schriften die Einheit aller Muslime und sah Istanbul mit dem osmanischen Sultan an der Spitze als Zentrum der muslimischen Welt., Zwei seiner drei während seines Istanbul-Aufenthalts erschienenen Bücher, ein „Disput zwischen einem Europäer und einem Hochschullehrer aus Buchara in Indien über verschiedene Fragen, darunter auch die der neuen Unterrichtsmethoden“ (kurz \\"Munozara\\", 1911) und die „Erzählungen eines indischen Reisenden“ \\"(Bayonoti sayyohi hindi)\\", erlangten in Zentralasien große Popularität: \\"Munozara\\" etwa wurde 1911 von Hodschij Muin aus Samarkand ins turkestanische Türkisch übersetzt und in der zaristischen Zeitung \\"Turkiston viloyatining gazeti\\" und später als Buch veröffentlicht. Im Gegensatz zur persischen Version zirkulierte die um einen Kommentar Behbudiys erweiterte türkische Ausgabe auch in Buchara. \\"Bayonoti sayyohi hindi\\" wurde von Behbudiy ins Russische übersetzt. Auf dessen Betreiben erweiterte Fitrat \\"Munozara\\" um einen Appell, Russisch zu lernen., Durch den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs konnte Fitrat seine Studien in Istanbul nicht abschließen und begab sich wie viele andere bucharische Studenten wieder zurück nach Transoxanien., Letzte Jahre des Emirats., Nach seiner Rückkehr nach Buchara nahm Fitrat eine aktive Rolle in der Reformbewegung ein, insbesondere im Kampf um Schulen nach der „neuen Methode“, und wurde zum Anführer des linken Flügels der lokalen Dschadidenbewegung. Während Fitrats Zeit in Istanbul hatte Alim Khan (usbekisch: Olimxon) nach dem Tod seines Vaters den Thron im Emirat Buchara: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Usbekistan, Abdurauf Fitrat, Schriftsteller, Journalist, Politiker, Dschadidismus, Literatur, Bildung, Zentralasien, Panturkismus"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flusssystem Fränkische Saale, Moor in Hessen, Naturschutzgebiet im Landkreis Fulda, Renaturierungsökologie, Schutzgebiet (Umwelt- und Naturschutz) in Europa, Stillgewässer in der Rhön], Das Rote Moor ist ein Hochmoor in der Hessischen Rhön. Es ist Teil des gleichnamigen Naturschutzgebietes im Biosphärenreservat Rhön und Bestandteil des europaweiten Schutzgebietssystems Natura 2000. Das Rote Moor ist nach dem in der Bayerischen Rhön liegenden Schwarzen Moor (66,4Hektar) mit 50Hektar das zweitgrößte Hochmoor in der Rhön. 175Jahre lang, von 1809 bis 1984, wurde Torf abgebaut. Der innere Bereich des Hochmoores ist, bedingt durch den langen Torfabbau, stark geschädigt. Nur seine Randgebiete sind noch weitgehend ungestörte Flächen, die auch besser und typischer entwickelt sind als im acht Kilometer entfernten Schwarzen Moor. 1979 begannen umfangreiche Renaturierungsmaßnahmen., Geografie., Das Rote Moor ist das größte Hochmoor in Hessen,gefolgt von dem vier Hektar großen Moor in der Breungeshainer Heide auf dem Hohen Vogelsberg. In der Rhön ist es nach dem Schwarzen Moor das zweitgrößte Moor vor dem \\"Großen\\" (acht Hektar) und \\"Kleinen Moor\\" (zwei Hektar) am Stirnberg, sowie dem \\"Moorlein\\" am Rasenberg. Bedingt durch den Torfabbau bis in die 1980er Jahre ist nur noch eine Fläche von zirka fünf Hektar als Kernzone vorhanden. Das Rote Moor gliedert sich in zwei Teilgebiete: in das \\"Große Rote Moor\\" (ehemals 32Hektar Hochmoorfläche– heute knapp elf Hektar) und in das \\"Kleine Rote Moor\\" (ehemals sieben Hektar Hochmoorfläche– heute 1,7Hektar). Es liegt etwa fünf Kilometer südöstlich der Wasserkuppe an der Bundesstraße 278 zwischen der Gemeinde Ehrenberg (Ortsteil Wüstensachsen) auf hessischer Seite und der Stadt Bischofsheim an der Rhön auf bayerischer Seite., Das Moor erstreckt sich etwa einen Kilometer in Nord-Süd-Richtung und 600Meter in West-Ost-Richtung. Die tiefste Stelle am südlichen Ende des Moores liegt auf 804Meter über Normalnull und steigt im Norden bis auf etwa 830Meter an. Begrenzt wird das Moor durch die umgebenden Berge– im Uhrzeigersinn beginnend– im Norden vom Mathesberg (831,8Meter), vom Ottilienstein im Nordosten (846,4Meter), vom Heidelstein im Osten (925,7Meter), vom Kesselstein im Süden (799,2Meter), vom Mostberg (807,4Meter) im Westen und vom Feldberg im Nordwesten (815,2Meter)., Das Rote Moor liegt im südlichen Teil des 314,7Hektar großen Naturschutzgebiets \\"Rotes Moor\\". Das 1979 ausgewiesene Naturschutzgebiet, dessen Name auf das Hochmoor zurückführt, liegt größtenteils über 800Meter über Normalnull, mit Abweichungen von 720 bis 835Meter über Normalnull. Es zählt zu den ältesten und größten Naturschutzgebieten in Hessen und erstreckt sich zwischen der Wasserkuppe und dem Heidelstein auf dem flachwelligen Sattel der Hohen Rhön, bei einer Nord-Süd-Ausdehnung von 3,5Kilometer und einer Breite von 0,6 bis 1,2Kilometer. Im Naturschutzgebiet gibt es noch weitere kleinere Vermoorungen mit geringer Torfmächtigkeit, es wird durch drei Quellmulden bestimmt. Der Abfluss am tiefsten Punkt des Moores heißt \\"Moorwasser\\". Der Bach fließt Richtung Süden in den Schwarzbach, der bei Bischofsheim in die Brend mündet und über die Fränkische Saale in das Flusssystem des Rheines gelangt. Innerhalb des Moores trennt das \\"Moorwasser\\" das südöstlich gelegene \\"Kleine Rote Moor\\" vom nordwestlich gelegenen \\"Großen Roten Moor\\". Vor dem Abfluss am 1973 angelegten künstlichen Damm dehnt sich heute ein kleiner Stausee aus. Ein weiterer Quellfluss, der \\"Feldbach\\", fließt nach Westen in die Fulda. Ein dritter Bach, der \\"Grumbach\\", fließt nach Norden in die Ulster, einen Nebenfluss der Werra. Werra und Fulda bilden zusammen später die Weser. Somit liegt das Naturschutzgebiet auf der Wasserscheide zwischen Rhein und Weser., Entstehung., Das Rote Moor entstand, wie auch die anderen Hochmoore der Rhön, nach der letzten Eiszeit vor etwa 12.000Jahren. Im Tertiär lagerten sich tonige Sedimente ab. Vor 25 bis 18Millionen Jahren förderten Vulkane ausgedehnte Lavaströme zu Tage, die zu verwitterungsresistentem Basalt erstarrten. Während der letzten Eiszeit lag die Rhön im Periglazialbereich, sie war also nicht von Gletschern bedeckt. Große Hangmulden entstanden durch Firnerosion und Bodenfließen. In Gebieten, in denen Wasser stauende Sedimente wie Tone oder lehmige Verwitterungsrückstände der Basalte die Mulden abdichteten, konnten sich über Niedermoorstadien Regenmoore bilden. Die klimatischen Bedingungen mit hohen Niederschlagsmengen sowie niedrigen Bodentemperaturen begünstigten das Moorwachstum. Durch Pollenanalysen konnte die Entwicklung bis zur La-Tène-Zeit zurückverfolgt werden., Ursprünglicher Zustand., Eine zentrale baumfreie Hochfläche und ein gehölzbestandenes Randgehänge ist charakteristisch für ein Hochmoor. Das Randgehänge ist von einem Nieder- und Übergangsmoorstreifen (Randsumpf) umgeben. Im Randsumpf staut sich das aus dem Hochmoorbereich kommende Wasser an und fließt dann ab. Durch den Anstiegswinkel des angrenzenden Geländes und durch Wasserzufluss von außerhalb wird die Ausdehnung des Randsumpfes bestimmt. Diese Gliederung ist im Roten Moor trotz der Abtorfung noch zu erkennen., Das Rote Moor besteht aus zwei voneinander getrennten Hochmoorteilen, nämlich dem \\"Großen Roten Moor\\" und dem \\"Kleinen Roten Moor\\". Zwischen ihnen liegt ein von dem Bach \\"Moorwasser\\" durchflossener Niedermoorstreifen. Diesen sieht man als den gemeinsamen Randsumpf beider Moorteile an. Im Norden und besonders im Nordosten des Großen Moores, also nördlich des Kleinen Moores, ist der Randsumpf besonders breit. Dieser Streifen hat eine charakteristische Pflanzendecke mit dem seltenen Purpur-Reitgras, inselartig verteilten Ohr-Weiden-Büschen und Karpatenbirken-Gruppen. Die Karpaten-Birke \\"(Betula pubescens ssp. carpatica)\\" ist eine Unterart der Moor-Birke. Sie zählt zu den markantesten Baumarten der Moorlandschaft und fällt durch ihren bizarren Wuchs auf. Der Randwald ist am Ostrand des Großen Roten Moores, dessen Umfang man vom Aussichtsturm aus erkennen kann, besonders schön ausgebildet. Dieser Bereich besteht fast ausschließlich aus knorrigen Karpatenbirken, die einen hohen Wert für den Naturschutz haben., Der Charakter und die Ausdehnung des Randwaldes hängt von der Breite und dem Gefälle des Randgehänges ab. Am schwächsten entwickelt war es am Nord- und Westrand des Moores, wo es nur schmal und weniger steil ausgebildet war. Aufgrund der Abtorfung ist dies nicht mehr deutlich zu erkennen. Wo früher eine baumfreie Hochfläche war, haben sich als Folge der Entwässerung Karpatenbirken angesiedelt. Von der ehemaligen Hochfläche sind heute nur noch kleine entwässerte Reste erhalten. Ursprünglich war diese Hochfläche, der Neigung des Untergrundes folgend, von Norden nach Süden schwach abfallend. Die Höhendifferenz betrug über die Entfernung von etwa 800Metern 15Meter., Im Roten Moor scheint es größere Wasseransammlungen (Kolke) wie im Schwarzen Moor nie gegeben zu haben. Dies geht sowohl aus den ältesten Beschreibungen des Moores der 1920er-Jahre als auch aus dem Charakter der Torfschichten hervor, da in diesen keine Spuren solcher Moorgewässer erkennbar sind., Klima., Das Klima im Roten Moor und in den angrenzenden Höhenbereichen ist rau und kalt. Das Rhönvorland, welches im hessischen Teil etwa 400Meter tiefer liegt, hatte 1961 bis 1990 Jahresmitteltemperaturen von sieben bis acht Grad Celsius. Die Hochrhön bildet eine \\"Kälteinsel\\" und weist Jahresmitteltemperaturen von 4,8Grad Celsius (Wasserkuppe) auf. Das etwa zehn Kilometer nordöstlich gelegene Frankenheim hatte bei einer etwas geringeren Höhenlage (754Meter über Normalnull) als das Rote Moor eine Jahresmitteltemperatur von 5,3Grad Celsius bei einem Jahresniederschlag von 938Millimetern. Auf der vier Kilometer nordwestlich gelegenen Wasserkuppe beträgt der durchschnittliche Jahresniederschlag 1084Millimeter., Die Hochrhön ist durch eine Schneebedeckung von bis zu 110 Tagen und eine kurze sommerliche Vegetationsperiode von Mai bis Oktober geprägt. Die Temperaturverhältnisse schränken das Pflanzenwachstum erheblich ein. Die Hauptwachstumsperiode dauert nur von Juli bis Mitte September. Hinzu kommen bis zu 200 Nebeltage und eine hohe Zahl an Tagen mit Raureifbildung. In der Nacht kann sich auf den Freiflächen dieser Höhenlage zu jeder Jahreszeit Kaltluft bilden und Frost auftreten., Flora und Vegetation., Das Moor ist in Abhängigkeit von der Oberflächengestalt in verschiedene Vegetationszonen gegliedert, die jeweils über besondere Nährstoff- und Wasserverhältnisse verfügen und eigene typische Pflanzengesellschaften besitzen. Auf dem Randgehänge des Roten Moors wächst Karpatenbirkwald. Das Untergehölz besteht aus Besenheide, Heidelbeere und Rauschbeere., Das Niedermoor, welches das Moor in wechselnder Breite als Sumpfgürtel umgibt, schließt sich mit charakteristischer Grasvegetation als nächste Vegetationszone an. Typische Pflanzengesellschaften der Niedermoorzone sind Kleinseggenriede (Scheiden-Wollgras, Schmalblättriges Wollgras, Grau-Segge, Hunds-Straußgras, Sumpf-Blutauge, Sumpf-Labkraut, Sumpf-Kratzdistel, Fieberklee), Trollblumenfeuchtwiesen und Borstgrasrasen, die vom Aussterben bedrohte Moosbeere, die Krähenbeere, das Wollgras und das Purpur-Reitgras. Die Kleinseggenriede wachsen hier deshalb, weil sich das vom Moor ablaufende Wasser mit dem Oberflächenwasser und dem hochanstehenden Grundwasser der mineralischen Böden der Umgebung vermischt und damit das Nährstoffangebot gegenüber der zentralen Moorfläche erhöht ist., Weiter nach innen folgt das Moor-Randgehänge. Dort gedeihen kleinwüchsige Bäume und Sträucher (Moor-Birke, Kiefer, Rauschbeere, Heidelbeere, Besenheide, Schwarze Krähenbeere, Gewöhnliche Moosbeere). Dieser Bereich ist, bedingt durch das deutliche Gefälle, im Vergleich zur nahezu ebenen Hochfläche der trockenste Bereich innerhalb des Moores., Das Hochmoor liegt im Zentrum. Torfmoose wie das rote Magellans Torfmoos \\"(Sphagnum magellanicum)\\" mit seiner rötlichen Farbe und den auffällig großen Blättern und das Spieß-Torfmoos \\"(Sphagnum cuspidatum)\\" mit grünlicher Farbe, die auf stark saurem, nährstoffarmem und wassergesättigtem Boden gedeihen, haben sich nur in dieser Kernzone des Hochmoors erhalten.

Das entstehende Faservlies wird verdichtet und getrocknet., Papier wird aus Faserstoffen hergestellt, die heute vor allem aus dem Rohstoff Holz gewonnen werden. Die wichtigsten Faserstoffe sind Zellstoff, Holzstoffe und Altpapierstoff. Das durch Papierrecycling wiederverwertete Altpapier ist mittlerweile die wichtigste Rohstoffquelle in Europa. Außer dem Faserstoff oder einer Faserstoffmischung enthält Papier auch Füllstoffe und weitere Zusatzstoffe., Es gibt rund 3000 Papiersorten, die nach ihrem Einsatzzweck in vier Hauptgruppen eingeteilt werden können: Grafisches Papier (Druck- und Schreibpapier), Verpackungspapier und -karton, Hygienepapier (z.B. Toilettenpapier, Papiertaschentücher) sowie die vielfältigen technischen Papiere und Spezialpapiere (z.B. Filterpapier, Zigarettenpapier, Banknotenpapier)., Abgrenzung., Papier, Karton, Pappe., Papier, Karton und Pappe werden unter anderem anhand der flächenbezogenen Masse unterschieden. DIN 6730 vermeidet den Begriff \\"Karton\\" und unterscheidet allein Papier und Pappe, und zwar anhand des Grenzwerts 225g/m² (Massenbelegung). Umgangssprachlich ist \\"Karton\\" jedoch eine übliche Bezeichnung für ein Material im Bereich 150g/m² bis 600g/m², das typischerweise dicker und steifer ist als Papier. Bei der Zuordnung zur flächenbezogenen Masse ergeben sich Überschneidungsbereiche zwischen Papier und Karton sowie zwischen Karton und Pappe:, Teilweise werden im Fall der umgangssprachlichen Dreiteilung in Papier, Karton, Pappe bei den Überschneidungsbereichen andere Grenzwerte genannt, zum Beispiel:, Das Mindest-Flächengewicht von Pappe wird je nach Quelle noch anders angegeben, zum Beispiel mit 220g/m² oder auch 600g/m². Die fließenden Gewichtsgrenzen beruhen auf Neuerungen in der Produktionstechnik. Das Flächengewicht ist somit als ein ungefährer Anhaltspunkt und als eines von mehreren Unterscheidungskriterien zu betrachten., Pseudopapiere., Pseudopapiere (Papierähnliche) wie Papyrus, Tapa, Amatl und Huun – alle pflanzlichen Ursprungs – unterscheiden sich vom Papier vor allem durch die Technik der Herstellung: Pflanzliche Fasern werden durch Klopfen miteinander verbunden und zu einem Blatt geformt. Bei der Herstellung von richtigem Papier werden die Fasern in Wasser eingeweicht und voneinander getrennt. Dann müssen die Fasern als dünne Schicht auf ein Sieb gebracht, entwässert und getrocknet werden. Die ineinander verschlungenen, verfilzten Fasern bilden das Papier., Geschichte., Frühe Schriftträger., Höhlenzeichnungen sind die ältesten Dokumente, die der Mensch mit Pigmentxadfarbe auf einen Untergrund gezeichnet hat. Die Sumerer, als Träger der ältesten bekannten Hochkultur, schrieben seit etwa 3200 v.Chr. mit Keilschrift auf weiche Tontafeln, die zum Teil durch Zufälle gebrannt, überliefert sind. Aus Ägypten sind Schriftträger aus anorganischen Materialien bekannt, beispielsweise die Narmer-Palette – eine Prunkpalette des Königs Narmer (3100 v.Chr.) aus Schiefer., Papierähnlichere sind aus Papyrus gefertigt. Dieses Papyrus(papier) besteht aus den flach geschlagenen, über Kreuz gelegten und gepressten Stängeln der am gesamten unteren Nil in ruhigen Uferzonen wachsenden Schilfpflanzen (echter Papyrus), die dünnen, gepressten Schichten werden dann zusammengeklebt (laminiert). Geschrieben wurde darauf mit schwarzer und roter Farbe. Die schwarze Tusche bestand aus Ruß und einer Lösung von Gummi arabicum, die rote Farbe wurde auf Ocker-Basis hergestellt. Das Schreibgerät war ein Pinsel aus Binsen. Papyrus wurde im Alten Ägypten seit dem dritten Jahrtausend v.Chr. als Schreibmaterial benutzt. Zwar gab es Papyrus im antiken Griechenland, jedoch war eine Verbreitung über Griechenland hinaus kaum bekannt. Im 3.Jahrhundert v.Chr. ersetzten die Griechen den Pinsel durch eine gespaltene Rohrfeder., Im Römischen Reich wurden sowohl Papyrus als auch Wachsxadtafeln benutzt. In die Letzteren wurde der Text mittels angespitzter Griffel geritzt. Nach dem Auslesen wurde das Wachs mit einem Schaber geglättet und die Tafel konnte erneut beschrieben werden. Öffentliche Verlautbarungen wurden meist als dauerhafte Inschrift (Steintafeln oder Metallplatten) an Tempeln oder Verwaltungsgebäuden angebracht. Die Römer bezeichneten Papyrus-Rindenbast mit, aus dem sich später die Bezeichnung „Library“ (Bibliothek) entwickelte., In China wurden Tafeln aus Knochen, Muscheln, Elfenbein und Schildkrötenpanzer benutzt. Später bestanden Schrifttafeln aus Bronze, Eisen, Gold, Silber, Zinn, Jade, Steinplatten und Ton oder häufig aus organischem Material, wie Holz-, Bambusstreifen und Seide. Pflanzenblätter und Tierhäute wurden noch nicht als Schriftträger benutzt. Orakelknochen wurden mit Griffeln geritzt oder mit Tinte mit Lampenruß oder Zinnober als Pigment beschriftet., In Indien und Ceylon wurden die Blätter der Talipot-Palme etwa seit 500 v.Chr. benutzt (Palmblattmanuskripte), sowie Birkenrinde, Holzblöcke, -tafel und Baumwolllappen, außerdem Steintafeln, -blöcke., In den Hochkulturen des Alten Orients und des Mittelmeerraumes wurde von alters her Leder als Beschreibstoff verwendet. Wie Leder wird Pergament aus Tierhäuten hergestellt. Durch die Vorteile des Pergaments wurden im mittelalterlichen Europa andere Beschreibstoffe verdrängt. Die Tierhäute werden mit Pottasche oder Kalk gebeizt, gründlich gereinigt und aufgespannt getrocknet, es folgte das Schaben und die Oberflächenbearbeitung., In der neuen Welt wurde Huun, Amatl, ein papierähnlicher Beschreibstoff, bereits vor dem 5.Jahrhundert von den Maya hergestellt. Allerdings ist dieses Material, der Herstellungsart nach, eher dem Papyrus verwandt, denn es wird aus kreuzweise verpressten Baststrängen, nicht aber aus aufgeschlossenen Einzelfasern erzeugt. Der für die Papierdefinition essenziell wichtige Entwässerungsvorgang erfolgt weder auf einem Sieb noch durch mechanischen Wasserentzug. Insofern wäre es falsch, von einer Erfindung des Papieres in Amerika zu sprechen. Die tatsächliche und unabhängige Urherstellung von Papier lässt sich nur für Asien und Europa nachweisen., Erfindung des Papiers., Obwohl es Funde aus China gibt, die auf etwa 140 v.Chr. datiert werden können und obwohl Xu Shen bereits um 100 n. Chr. die Herstellung von Papier aus Seidenabfällen beschrieb, wird die Erfindung des Papiers offiziell Tsai Lun zugeschrieben, der um 105 n.Chr. (Belegdatum der ersten Erwähnung der chinesischen Papierherstellungsmethode) ein Beamter der \\"Behörde für Fertigung von Instrumenten und Waffen\\" am chinesischen Kaiserhof war und erstmals das bekannte Verfahren, Papier herzustellen, beschrieb. Zu seiner Zeit gab es einen papierartigen Beschreibstoff, der aus Seidenabfällen hergestellt wurde \\"(Chi)\\". Diesen mischten die frühen Papiermacher vornehmlich mit Hanf, alten Lumpen und Fischernetzen und ergänzten das Material mit Baumrinde oder Bast des Maulbeerbaumes. Die chinesische Erfindung bestand vor allem in der neuartigen Zubereitung: Die gesäuberten Fasern und Fasernreste wurden zerstampft, gekocht und gewässert. Anschließend wurden einzelne Lagen mit einem Sieb abgeschöpft, getrocknet, gepresst und geglättet. Beim Schöpfen entstand an dem Papier eine „Schönseite“, die an der dem Sieb abgewandten Seite lag, und eine „Siebseite“, die an dem Sieb lag. Der entstehende Brei aus Pflanzenfasern lagerte sich als Vlies ab und war ein relativ homogenes Papierblatt. Diese Technik wurde vermutlich in Korea in einer eigenständigen Form seit dem 2.Jahrhundert n.Chr. angewandt. Ein Autor schrieb 2005, sie feiere seit vielen Jahren unter dem Namen Hanji () eine Renaissance., Da Bast ein Material ist, das im Vergleich zu dem verwendeten Holz längere Fasern und dadurch eine hohe zeitliche Haltbarkeit hat, war das Papier von Ts’ai Lun nicht nur zum Schreiben verwendbar, sondern auch für Raumdekorationen etwa in Form von Tapeten sowie Kleidungsstücken. Die Verwendung von Maulbeerbast lag nahe, da der Seidenspinner sich von den Blättern des Maulbeerbaums ernährte und somit dieses Material ein ohnehin vorhandenes Nebenprodukt aus der Seidenxadproduktion war. Wie alt die Verwendung von Bast ist, belegt die Gletschermumie Ötzi (ca.3300 v.Chr.), der Kleidungsstücke aus Lindenbast trägt., Ostasien., Bereits im 2.Jahrhundert gab es in China Papiertaschentücher, im 3.Jahrhundert wurden Leimstoffe (Stärke) hinzugefügt, daraus resultierte die Erfindung der Leimung (dünner Überzug, um Papier glatter und weniger saugfähig zu machen; die Tinte oder Tusche verläuft weniger stark), sowie die Färbung von Papier. Möglicherweise wurde schon die erste Zeitung (Dibao) herausgegeben. Im 6.Jahrhundert wurde Toilettenpapier aus billigstem Reisstrohpapier hergestellt. Alleine in Peking wurden jährlich zehn Millionen Päckchen mit 1000 bis 10.000 Blatt produziert. Die Abfälle an Stroh und Kalk bildeten bald große Hügel, „Elefanten-Gebirge“ genannt. Für Zwecke des chinesischen Kaiserhofes stellte die kaiserliche Werkstatt 720.000 Blatt Toilettenpapier her. Für die kaiserliche Familie waren es noch einmal 15.000 Blatt hellgelbes, weiches und parfümiertes Papier., Bekannt ist, dass um das Jahr 300 die Thais die Technik des \\"schwimmenden Siebs\\" zur Papierherstellung verwendeten. Das Bodengitter des Siebes war fest mit dem Rahmen verbunden. Jedes geschöpfte Blatt musste im Sieb trocknen und konnte erst dann herausgenommen werden. Entsprechend viele Siebe waren nötig., Um das Jahr 600 gelangte die weiter entwickelte Technik des Schöpfens mit dem Schöpfsieb nach Korea und wurde um 625 in Japan verwendet.

Isolate the cow: Move the affected cow to a clean and comfortable area, separate from other animals. Provide clean and soft bedding to ensure comfort. 2. Veterinary examination: Call a veterinarian to conduct a thorough examination of the cow. The veterinarian will assess the severity of the mastitis and determine the appropriate treatment course. 3. Systemic antibiotics: Administer antibiotics systemically to help combat the infection. The choice of antibiotics will depend on the causative bacteria and the veterinarian's prescription. Always ensure proper dosage and adhere to withdrawal periods for milk consumption. 4. Supportive therapy: Provide supportive care to the cow to help boost its immune system and aid in recovery. This may include administering non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and pain. The veterinarian may also suggest specific nutritional supplementation based on the cow's condition. 5. Intramammary antibiotics: If recommended by the veterinarian, administer intramammary antibiotics to directly treat the udder infection. Follow the veterinarian's instructions for proper administration technique and withdrawal periods. 6. Udder hygiene: Implement strict udder hygiene practices. Clean the udder and teats thoroughly before and after milking. Ensure proper teat dip application after milking to prevent further infection. 7. Milk withdrawal: Adhere to the withdrawal periods specified by the veterinarian for milk consumption. This ensures that any antibiotic residues are eliminated from the milk before it is safe for human consumption. 8. Regular monitoring: Regularly monitor the cow's progress and response to treatment. Report any changes or concerns to the veterinarian promptly. Remember, this treatment protocol is a general guideline, and it is important to consult with a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and individualized treatment recommendations."},{"instruction":"你好，白领职业的人一般会看哪些类型的书？请用具体的案例做详细说明。谢谢","output":"你好！作为白领职业人士，他们通常会阅读各种类型的书籍，以满足他们不同的需求和兴趣。下面是一些具体的案例： 1. 商业和领导力书籍：白领职业人士通常关注自身职业发展和领导力技能的提升。例如，他们可能会阅读《从优秀到卓越》这样的商业畅销书，以了解成功企业家的故事和成功秘诀，以此来应对自己的工作挑战。 2. 增强技能的书籍：白领职业人士可能需要不断提升自己专业领域的技能，因此他们可能会阅读与自己领域相关的书籍。例如，一个市场营销经理可能会阅读《数字营销战略》这样的书籍，以了解最新的数字营销趋势和技术，以优化自己的工作策略。 3. 自我提升和心理学书籍：白领职业人士可能会阅读有关自我提升和心理学方面的书籍，以改善自己的工作和生活品质。例如，他们可能会阅读《7习惯高效人士的秘密》这样的书籍，以学习如何有效管理时间、提高工作效率和解决问题。 4. 健康和生活方式书籍：工作与生活平衡对于白领职业人士来说非常重要，因此他们可能会阅读有关健康和生活方式的书籍。例如，他们可能会阅读《高效能人士的饮食法》这样的书籍，以了解如何通过饮食和锻炼来提高自己的精力和工作效率。 综上所述，白领职业人士的阅读偏好因人而异，但通常会涵盖商业和领导力、技能提升、自我提升和心理学、健康和生活方式等方面的书籍。"},{"instruction":"你好，服务业职业的人一般会看哪些类型的书？请用具体的案例做详细说明。谢谢","output":"你好！服务业职业的人通常会阅读各种类型的书籍，以提升自己的专业知识和技能，以及了解客户需求和行业趋势。下面是一些具体的案例： 1. 顾客服务和销售技巧书籍：服务业职业人士通常需要与顾客直接互动，因此他们可能会阅读有关顾客服务和销售技巧的书籍。例如，一位酒店前台接待员可能会阅读《如何与客人建立良好的关系》这样的书籍，以学习如何提供个性化的服务，满足客户需求，并提高销售能力。 2. 行业专业书籍：服务业职业人士可能会阅读涉及其具体行业的书籍，以了解行业标准、最佳实践和最新趋势。例如，一位旅游导游可能会阅读《全球旅游业动态研究》这样的书籍，以了解各个国家和地区的旅游趋势、文化和历史知识，以提供更丰富的旅游指导。 3. 服务质量和管理书籍：服务业职业人士通常需要提供高质量的服务，并管理团队以确保顾客满意度和业务成绩。因此，他们可能会阅读与服务质量和管理相关的书籍。例如，一位餐厅经理可能会阅读《服务质量管理》这样的书籍，以了解如何改进餐厅的服务质量、提高员工的表现，并解决潜在问题。 4. 企业文化和团队建设书籍：服务业职业人士通常在团队环境中工作，因此他们可能会关注企业文化和团队建设的重要性。例如，一位客户服务代表可能会阅读《打造卓越团队的秘诀》这样的书籍，以学习如何建立团队合作精神、分享知识和优化工作流程，以提供更好的客户服务。 综上所述，服务业职业人士的阅读偏好因人而异，但通常会涵盖顾客服务和销售技巧、行业专业知识、服务质量和管理、企业文化和团队建设等方面的书籍。"},{"instruction":"你好，制造业职业的人一般会看哪些类型的书？请用具体的案例做详细说明。谢谢","output":"你好！制造业职业人士通常会阅读各种类型的书籍，以提升自己的专业知识和技能，了解最新的制造技术和工艺，以及掌握有效的生产管理方法。下面是一些具体的案例： 1. 工艺和技术书籍：制造业职业人士通常需要掌握相应的工艺和技术知识，以确保生产过程的高效和质量。例如，一位机械工程师可能会阅读《机械设计基础》这样的书籍，以学习机械设计原理、材料选择和制造工艺，以确保产品满足设计要求。 2. 质量管理和六西格玛书籍：制造业职业人士通常需要关注产品质量，以提供优质的产品和服务。因此，他们可能会阅读与质量管理和六西格玛相关的书籍。例如，一位生产经理可能会阅读《质量管理体系实施指南》这样的书籍，以了解如何构建完善的质量管理体系、分析生产过程中的问题，以及改进问题解决方法。 3. 生产计划和物料管理书籍：制造业职业人士通常需要合理安排生产计划和管理物料流动，以确保生产进展顺利和库存控制。因此，他们可能会阅读与生产计划和物料管理相关的书籍。例如，一位生产主管可能会阅读《现代物料管理》这样的书籍，以学习物料需求计划、供应链管理和库存优化等相关知识，以提高生产效率和降低成本。 4. 制造业趋势和新技术书籍：制造业在不断发展和演变，新技术和趋势对于职业人士来说至关重要。因此，他们可能会阅读有关制造业趋势和新技术的书籍。例如，一位工业工程师可能会阅读《智能制造的未来》这样的书籍，以了解人工智能、物联网和大数据在制造业中的应用和影响，以及如何应对未来挑战。 综上所述，制造业职业人士的阅读偏好因人而异，但通常会涵盖工艺和技术、质量管理和六西格玛、生产计划和物料管理，以及制造业趋势和新技术等方面的书籍。"},{"instruction":"create a induction manual pdf for a restraunt in australia","output":"[Restaurant Name] Induction Manual Welcome to [Restaurant Name]!

August 1914 verübten deutsche Truppen in Belgien das Massaker von Dinant und töteten dabei 674 Zivilisten. Zugleich wurden rund 1100 bis 1300 der 1800 Häuser der Stadt zerstört. Das Vorgehen der deutschen Truppen zu Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs erfolgte im Zuge ihres Marsches durch das zuvor neutrale Nachbarland., Von August bis Oktober 1914 kamen in Belgien 5521 Zivilisten durch Hinrichtungen und zielgerichtete Zerstörungen von Ortschaften ums Leben, das Massaker von Dinant war der größte dieser Gewaltausbrüche deutscher Soldaten gegen Zivilisten. Die deutschen Offiziere und Soldaten rechtfertigten ihre Taten mit vermeintlichen Angriffen von Zivilisten beziehungsweise Freischärlern \\"(Franctireurs),\\" die Belgier bestritten derartige Angriffe vehement., Im historischen Bewusstsein der Deutschen ist das Massaker kaum präsent. Sofern an die Gewaltausbrüche deutscher Truppen gegen belgische Zivilisten zu Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs erinnert wird, stehen die Ereignisse von Dinant im Schatten der Gewalttaten in Löwen. Im englischen Sprachraum trug das Massaker mit zur Entstehung und Verbreitung des Propagandabegriffes \\"Rape of Belgium\\" (\\"Schändung Belgiens\\") bei., Ein Denkmal in der Innenstadt erinnert an das Schicksal der Getöteten von Dinant. 2001 bat die Bundesrepublik Deutschland bei den Nachkommen der damaligen Opfer um Entschuldigung., Kontext., Feldzugsplanung im Westen., Der Schlieffen-Plan von 1905 sah als strategisches Konzept des Generalstabs der preußischen Armee vor, einen langwierigen Zweifrontenkrieg Deutschlands gegen Frankreich und Russland zu vermeiden. Gemäß diesem Plan sollte Frankreich in wenigen Wochen besiegt werden, um die militärischen Kräfte anschließend gegen Russland ins Feld zu führen und es zu bezwingen., Seit den 1830erJahren war die Neutralität Belgiens vertraglich festgelegt und durch die europäischen Großmächte garantiert. Der modifizierte Schlieffenplan sah jedoch vor, diese Neutralität zu missachten, um bei einem Kriegsausbruch die französischen Armeen mit einer großen Schwenkbewegung im Norden zu umgehen und anschließend von hinten zu stellen. Die deutschen Militärplaner erwarteten keinen nachhaltigen Widerstand der Belgier gegen die mit dem Plan verbundene Invasion und Besetzung ihres Landes., Franctireurs., Viele Soldaten der deutschen Armeen marschierten in Frankreich und Belgien mit der Erwartung ein, nicht nur gegen reguläre Truppen kämpfen zu müssen, sondern auch gegen Zivilisten, die sie getarnt oder als Heckenschützen aus dem Hinterhalt angreifen würden. Diese Erwartung ging zurück auf Erfahrungen mit sogenannten Franctireurs im Deutsch-Französischen Krieg von 1870–1871. Die Erinnerungen daran wurden in Militärkreisen vielfach überliefert. Bereits vor Kriegsbeginn und vor Überschreiten der Landesgrenzen wurden die Truppen auf diese mögliche Gefahr eingestellt – „deutsche Offiziere rechneten aufgrund ihrer Ausbildung in einem kommenden Krieg fest mit einem Widerstand der Zivilbevölkerung und betrachteten diesen als ein Verbrechen“., Innerhalb der ersten Wochen des Weltkrieges verbreiteten sich ungeprüfte Nachrichten über derartige Vorfälle rasch innerhalb der Armee und in der deutschen Presse. Briefe von Soldaten an Angehörige und Bekannte berichteten vielfach von der Beschießung deutscher Truppen durch belgische Zivilisten. Auch Harry Graf Kessler glaubte, die Belgier würden einen Volkskrieg führen:, „\\"Furchtbar ist es aber, dass man so viele Zivilisten immer wieder bestrafen muss, weil sie auf unsere Leute feuern; dass ganze Ortschaften verbrannt und zerstört werden. Das giebt\\" (sic!) \\"grauenhafte, erschütternde Bilder und Erlebnisse.\\"“, Bereits am 9. August 1914 verurteilten Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Karl von Bülow, Oberbefehlshaber der 2. Armee, den angeblichen Volkskrieg der Belgier gegen die deutschen Truppen., Grundsätzlich sah die Haager Landkriegsordnung einen verbesserten Schutz von Zivilisten vor. Die Führung des deutschen Militärs war allerdings nicht gewillt, das in die Anweisungen für ihre Offiziere aufzunehmen. In der „Felddienstordnung“ von 1908 fehlte jeder Verweis auf die internationale Vereinbarung. Stattdessen wurden besondere Vorsichtsmaßnahmen gegen eventuelle Überfälle aus der Zivilbevölkerung gefordert. Dazu gehörten Strafandrohungen gegen Einwohner, Geiselnahmen oder Offenhalten der Hauseingänge. Obgleich die Landkriegsordnung der Bevölkerung sehr wohl ein Widerstandsrecht einräumte, leugnete die Felddienstordnung dieses Recht faktisch. Ausbilder von Offizieren wiesen offen darauf hin, dass die deutsche Auffassung bestimmten Regelungen der Haager Landkriegsordnung widerspreche, dieser Auffassung aber Vorrang zu geben sei, denn sonst werde dem „Franktireurkrieg Tür und Tor geöffnet“., Einmarsch in Belgien., Mit seinem Ultimatum an Belgien verlangte das Deutsche Reich am 2. August 1914 freien Durchzug für seine Truppen. Belgien erblickte darin einen Angriff auf seine Neutralität, Unabhängigkeit und Existenz. König Albert wies das Ultimatum am 3. August ab. In der Nacht zum 4. August überschritten deutsche Truppen die Grenze und drangen auf belgisches Staatsgebiet vor. Binnen weniger Wochen wuchs die Zahl der deutschen Soldaten, die sich in Belgien befanden oder es durchquerten, auf eine Million Mann an, eine Invasionsarmee von bislang beispiellosem Ausmaß., Trotz ihrer deutlichen numerischen Unterlegenheit leistete die belgische Armee in einem Ausmaß Widerstand, das die Invasoren überraschte. Sie konnte die Besetzung des Landes zwar nicht verhindern, verzögerte jedoch die Durchführung der deutschen Feldzugspläne. Die Schlacht um Lüttich (4. bis 16. August 1914) entwickelte sich zum ersten Kristallisationspunkt der belgischen Gegenwehr. Auch wenn diese Schlacht den deutschen Durchmarsch nicht verhinderte, hatte sie doch eine immense Bedeutung – sowohl für die Belgier als auch für ihre Gegner. Den Belgiern wurde deutlich, dass ihre Festungsbauten – der Festungsring Lüttich galt als uneinnehmbar – keinen ausreichenden Schutz vor Zerstörung durch modernstes Kriegsgerät wie der „Dicken Bertha“ boten. Viele deutsche Soldaten und Offiziere bestritten die Legitimität des Widerstandes der belgischen Armee. Verärgerung und Wut über diesen Widerstand sowie die Vorstellung von allgegenwärtigen Franctireurs führten zur Verteufelung der Bevölkerung Belgiens., Zerstörungen und Tötungen von Zivilisten., Während des wochenlangen Bewegungskrieges in Belgien verübten deutsche Soldaten in vielen Orten Gewalttaten gegen Zivilisten. Insgesamt 484 solcher Zwischenfälle mit zusammen 5521 Toten standen in direktem Zusammenhang mit militärischen Kampfhandlungen oder mit Panikreaktionen deutscher Soldaten (unter anderem als Folge von Eigenbeschuss). Vielfach waren solche Gewaltausbrüche Vergeltungsmaßnahmen für erlittene Rückschläge, Verluste oder vermeintliche Franctireur-Angriffe. Die Zivilisten kamen bei Einzel- und Massenerschießungen, als menschliche Schutzschilde, als Geiseln oder im Zuge von Vertreibungen, Deportationen und Brandstiftungen um., Zu Ausschreitungen mit jeweils mehr als 100 Todesopfern kam es in Soumagne (5. August, 118 Tote), Mélen (8. August, 108 Tote), Aarschot (19. August, 156 Tote), Andenne (20. August, 262 Tote), Tamines (22. August, 383 Tote), Ethe (23. August, 218 Tote), Dinant (23. August, 674 Tote), Löwen (25. August, 248 Tote) und Arlon (26. August, 133 Tote). Fast immer wurden Häuser zerstört, oft durch vorsätzliche Brandstiftung. Im Zuge der Ausschreitungen mit mehr als 100 Toten wurden zusammen 4433 Gebäude zerstört. „Während dieser ersten Kriegswochen führte das deutsche Oberkommando ein Terrorregime gegen die Zivilbevölkerung“, urteilt die belgische Historikerin Laurence van Ypersele., Massaker und Zerstörung des Ortes., Erste Gefechte in Dinant., Dinant zählte im August 1914 rund 7000 Einwohner. Damit war sie die zweitgrößte Stadt der Provinz Namur. Der Ort liegt an der Maas, etwa 30 Kilometer südlich der Provinzhauptstadt Namur (wo Maas und Sambre zusammenfließen), und nur 20 Kilometer von der französischen Grenze bei Givet entfernt. Die Ortschaft war für die Überquerung der Maas strategisch bedeutsam. Der Fluss fließt hier in nördlicher Richtung, quer zur damaligen Marschroute der Deutschen. Oft nur wenige hundert Meter breit, erstreckte sich die Stadt auf rund vier Kilometern Länge am Ostufer des Flusses. Nach Osten begrenzten sie steile Felswände; das der Stadt gegenüberliegende Westufer war an vielen Stellen mit Hecken und Wäldern bewachsen., Wie viele seiner belgischen Amtskollegen forderte der Bürgermeister Dinants Anfang August 1914 die Einwohner öffentlich auf, sich nicht an militärischen Auseinandersetzungen zu beteiligen sowie Waffen und Munition bei der Polizei abzugeben. Auch Versammlungen und Demonstrationen zur Unterstützung der belgischen Armee und der Alliierten verbot er vorsorglich., Die französische 5. Armee unter Charles Lanrezac hatte, nachdem der zahlenmäßig bedeutsame deutsche Einmarsch in Belgien offensichtlich geworden war, Erlaubnis erhalten, auf belgisches Territorium vorzumarschieren, wo sie im Raum des Sambre-Maas-Dreiecks Stellungen bezog. Der Maas-Übergang bei Dinant wurde von Truppen des französischen I. Korps unter Louis Félix Marie Franchet d’Espèrey verteidigt., Die deutsche 3. Armee stand unter dem Befehl von Max von Hausen. In dem Verband war die mobile sächsische Armee zusammengefasst. Die 3. Armee hatte den Befehl, die Provinz Namur in Richtung Westen zu durchqueren und Übergänge über die Maas zu erkämpfen. Auf nennenswerten Widerstand stieß sie zunächst nicht. Am 15. August 1914 versuchte eine Vorhut, die strategisch bedeutsame Brücke in Dinant zu erobern und zu sichern. Sie wurde von französischen Truppen, die die Stadt verteidigten, zurückgeschlagen. In diesem Gefecht zog sich Charles de Gaulle, der im Rang eines Leutnants zu den französischen Einheiten gehörte, eine Verwundung zu.

Sie wurde um 530v.Chr. in Athen entwickelt und war bis zum Ende des 3.vorchristlichen Jahrhunderts in Gebrauch. Sie löste im Verlauf weniger Jahrzehnte die zuvor vorherrschende Schwarzfigurige Vasenmalerei ab. Ihren modernen Namen erhielt sie aufgrund der figürlichen Darstellungen in roter Farbe auf schwarzem Grund, die sie gegenüber der älteren Gestaltungsweise des schwarzfigurigen Stils mit schwarzen Figuren vor rotem Hintergrund absetzt. Bedeutendste Produktionsgebiete waren neben Attika unteritalisch-griechische Werkstätten. Außerdem wurde der rotfigurige Stil in anderen Gebieten Griechenlands übernommen. Eine bedeutende Produktionsstätte außerhalb des griechischen Kulturraums war Etrurien., Attische Vasen rotfigurigen Stils wurden nach ganz Griechenland und auch darüber hinaus exportiert und beherrschten für lange Zeit den Markt für Feinkeramik. Nur wenige Produktionsstätten konnten sich mit der Innovationskraft, der Qualität und auch der Produktionskapazität Athens messen. Allein von den in Athen produzierten rotfigurigen Vasen sind heute noch weit über 40.000 Exemplare ganz oder in Fragmenten erhalten. Auch aus der zweiten bedeutenden Produktionsstätte, Unteritalien, sind über 20.000 Vasen und Fragmente überliefert. Seit den Studien von John D. Beazley und Arthur D. Trendall, beginnend im ersten Viertel des 20. Jahrhunderts, ist die Erforschung dieser Kunstgattung weit fortgeschritten. Viele Vasen können bestimmten Künstlern oder Künstlergruppen zugeordnet werden. Die Bilderwelten der Vasen sind für Untersuchungen zur Kulturgeschichte, zu Alltagsleben, Ikonografie und Mythologie der griechischen Antike unentbehrlich., Technik., Die rotfigurige Technik war – vereinfacht gesagt – die Umkehrung der schwarzfigurigen. Die Umrisszeichnungen der Figuren und anderer Teile des Bildes wurden auf die noch ungebrannten, nach einiger Zeit des Trocknens lederharten, fast spröde gewordenen Vasenkörper aufgetragen. Der normale ungebrannte Ton hatte während dieses Produktionsschritts beispielsweise in Attika einen orangeroten Farbton. Die Umrisse wurden entweder mit einem stumpfen Instrument, das leichte Furchen hinterließ, oder mit Holzkohle, die beim späteren Brand verschwand, nachgezeichnet. Anschließend wurden die Konturen mit Pinsel und Glanzton nachgezogen. Manchmal ist dank der Furchen der Vorzeichnungen noch erkennbar, wenn der Künstler sich während des Zeichnens entschloss, die Darstellung etwas zu verändern. Für wichtige Konturen wurde eine leicht erhabene Relieflinie aus aufgetragenem Tonschlicker genutzt, für weniger wichtige Linien und Binnenzeichnungen reichte verdünnter Glanzton. Auch andere Farben wie Weiß oder Rot wurden nun für Details aufgetragen. Zum Auftragen der Relieflinie wurde wahrscheinlich ein Pinsel aus Borsten verwendet. Der kräftige Auftrag als Relieflinie war nötig, da der recht flüssige Glanzton sonst einen zu matten Effekt erzeugt hätte. Nach einer ersten Entwicklungsphase wurden beide Möglichkeiten eingesetzt, um Abstufungen und Details besser darstellen zu können. Der Raum zwischen den Figuren wurde zuletzt mit einem mattgrauen Glanzton abgedeckt. Anschließend wurden die Vasen im Dreiphasenbrand gebrannt. Hierbei erhielt der Glanzton seine charakteristische schwarze bis schwarzbraune Farbe., Die neue Technik hatte den Vorteil, dass nun die Binnenzeichnungen weitaus besser ausgearbeitet werden konnten. Im schwarzfigurigen Stil mussten sie aus dem Farbauftrag herausgeritzt werden, was zwangsläufig weniger genau war als der direkte Auftrag von Zierlinien. Die rotfigurigen Darstellungen waren bewegter und lebensnäher als der schwarzfigurige Silhouetten-Stil. Sie hoben sich außerdem kontrastreicher vom schwarzen Hintergrund ab. Es war nun möglich, Menschen nicht nur im Profil zu zeigen, sondern auch von vorn, von hinten oder in Dreiviertelansichten. Die rotfigurige Technik erlaubte also auch die Vermittlung von Tiefe und Raum. Doch hatte sie auch Nachteile. Die im schwarzfigurigen Stil übliche Unterscheidung der Geschlechter durch Abdecken der weiblichen Haut mit weißer Farbe war nun nicht mehr möglich. Ebenso wurde es schwieriger, die Geschlechter anhand der Gewänder oder Frisuren zu unterscheiden, was unter anderem an der Tendenz lag, viele Helden und Götter jugendlich, also bartlos, darzustellen. Hinzu kamen vor allem in der Anfangszeit des Stils Fehlberechnungen bei der Figurendicke. In der schwarzfigurigen Vasenmalerei gehörten die Umrisslinien zu den freistehenden Figuren. Da die Umrisszeichnungen nun aber in der Farbe des schwarzen Hintergrundes ausgeführt wurden, musste man die Umrisse zum Hintergrund, mit dem sie am Ende verschmolzen, zählen. Deshalb gab es zunächst oft recht dünne Figuren. Ein weiteres Problem war, dass beim schwarzen Hintergrund die Darstellung einer Raumtiefe nicht möglich war. Somit wurde bei der rotfigurigen Vasenmalerei fast nie der Versuch einer perspektivischen Darstellung unternommen. Doch überwogen die Vorteile. Vor allem an Details wie Muskeln oder anderen anatomischen Augenfälligkeiten lässt sich die Entwicklung exemplarisch verfolgen., Attika., Im 7.Jahrhundert v.Chr. wurde in Korinth die Schwarzfigurige Vasenmalerei entwickelt, die zur vorherrschenden Gestaltungsweise im griechischen Siedlungsgebiet werden sollte und sogar darüber hinaus Verbreitung fand. Zwar beherrschte Korinth diesen Markt, doch bildeten sich regionale Produktionszentren und Märkte heraus. In Athen wurde zunächst der korinthische Stil kopiert. Im Laufe der Zeit löste Athen Korinth in der marktbeherrschenden Stellung ab. Die attischen Künstler führten die Technik zu einer bis dahin nicht gekannten Höhe und schöpften im zweiten Drittel des 6.Jahrhunderts v.Chr. ihre Möglichkeiten voll aus. Um 530v.Chr. wirkte mit dem attischen Maler Exekias der wohl bedeutendste Vertreter des schwarzfigurigen Stils. Auch durch das 5.Jahrhundert v.Chr. hindurch waren die im neuen roten Farbstil produzierten Feinkeramiken aus Attika die dominierenden Produkte in dieser Wirtschaftssparte. Attische Töpferwaren wurden in den gesamten großgriechischen Raum, ja selbst nach Etrurien und ins keltische Mitteleuropa exportiert. Die Vorliebe für diese Töpferwaren führte dazu, dass vor allem in Unteritalien und in Etrurien von der attischen Vasenmalerei beeinflusste Werkstätten und „Schulen“ entstanden, die jedoch ausschließlich für den regionalen Markt produzierten., Anfänge., Um 530v.Chr. wurden erstmals Vasen im rotfigurigen Stil produziert. Als Erfinder dieser Technik gilt gemeinhin der Andokides-Maler. Er und andere sehr frühe Vertreter des neuen Stils, wie beispielsweise Psiax, bemalten Vasen zunächst in beiden Stilen, indem sie die Bildfelder der einen Seite in schwarzfiguriger, die der anderen Seite in rotfiguriger Technik ausführten. Derartige Gefäße, etwa die Bauchamphora des Andokides-Malers in München, werden Bilinguen genannt. Zwar waren im Vergleich zum schwarzfigurigen Stil schon große Fortschritte zu erkennen, doch noch immer wirkten die Figuren steif und es gab selten Überschneidungen der Bildinhalte. Viele Techniken des alten Stils wurden noch für ihre Herstellung verwendet. So finden sich nicht selten Ritzlinien oder der zusätzliche Auftrag roter Farbe (\\"added red\\"), mit der größere Farbflächen koloriert wurden., Pionierzeit., Den Schritt hin zur Ausreizung der Möglichkeiten der rotfigurigen Malerei machten die Künstler der sogenannten Pioniergruppe. Ihre Wirkungszeit wird etwa in die Jahre zwischen 520 und 500v.Chr. datiert. Bedeutende Vertreter waren Euphronios, Euthymides und Phintias. Diese von der Forschung erschlossene und definierte Gruppe experimentierte mit den verschiedenen Möglichkeiten des Stils. So erschienen die dargestellten Figuren in neuen Körperhaltungen mit Rücken- und Frontalansichten, es gab Experimente mit perspektivischen Verkürzungen und die Kompositionen wurden insgesamt dynamischer. Als technische Neuerung führte wohl Euphronios die Relieflinie ein. Zudem wurden neue Gefäßformen entwickelt, was dadurch begünstigt wurde, dass viele Maler der Pioniergruppe auch als Töpfer arbeiteten. Neu waren etwa der Psykter und die Pelike. Außerdem wurden großformatige Kratere und Amphoren bevorzugt. Obwohl die Gruppe keinen echten Zusammenhalt hatte, gab es sehr wohl Verbindungen zwischen den einzelnen Malern, die sich offensichtlich beeinflussten, sich in einer Art freundschaftlichen Wettstreits befanden und sich gegenseitig anspornten. So prahlte Euthymides in einer Inschrift \\"„wie [es] Euphronios niemals [gekonnt hätte]“\\". Überhaupt ist es ein Zeichen der Pioniergruppe, dass sie sehr schreibfreudig war. Kennzeichnungen der dargestellten mythologischen Figuren und Kalos-Inschriften waren eher die Regel als die Ausnahme., Neben den Gefäßmalern arbeiteten auch einige bedeutende Schalenmaler mit dem neuen Stil. Zu ihnen gehörten Oltos und Epiktetos. Sie verzierten viele ihrer Werke bilinge, nutzten die rotfigurige Technik dann meist für die Innenseite der Schalen., Spätarchaik., Die auf die Pioniere folgende Generation von Künstlern der Spätarchaik (etwa 500 bis 470v.Chr.) führten den neuen Stil zur Blüte. Die auch zu dieser Zeit noch produzierten schwarzfigurigen Vasen erreichten keine vergleichbare Qualität mehr und wurden nahezu völlig verdrängt. Einige der bedeutendsten Vasenmaler wirkten in dieser Zeit. Zu nennen sind bei den Gefäßmalern etwa der Berliner Maler und der Kleophrades-Maler, unter den Schalenmalern ragten Onesimos, Duris, Makron und der Brygos-Maler heraus. Nicht nur die Qualität wurde immer besser, auch die Produktion verdoppelte sich in dieser Zeit. Athen wurde zum beherrschenden Produzenten von Feinkeramik in der Mittelmeerwelt, nahezu alle regionalen Produktionen außerhalb Attikas traten in seinen Schatten., Kennzeichnend für den Erfolg der attischen Vasen war die nun perfekt beherrschte perspektivische Verkürzung, was die dargestellten Figuren in ihren Körperhaltungen und Handlungen weitaus natürlicher erscheinen ließ. Außerdem setzte eine massive Verringerung des Dargestellten ein. Ornamentale Verzierungen traten stark in den Hintergrund, die Anzahl der dargestellten Figuren wurde deutlich reduziert, ebenso die dargestellten anatomischen Details. Im Gegenzug wurden viele neue Themen in die Vasenmalerei eingeführt.

Überliefert ist, dass der General und Politiker Manuel Belgrano zu diesem Symbol inspiriert wurde, als er während der Schlacht von Paraná in den Himmel schaute. In früheren Flaggen Argentiniens und als Landeswappen wurde mit der \\"Sol de Mayo\\" (Maisonne, auch Inkasonne genannt) bereits ein ähnliches Sonnensymbol verwendet. Die Darstellung der Sonne ist identisch mit der Sonne auf den ersten argentinischen Münzen. Die Sonnenscheibe mit einem Gesicht, umgeben von Sonnenstrahlen, symbolisierte in der Inka-Mythologie den Sohn Inti des göttlichen Schöpfers Viracocha., Früher wurde die Flagge ohne Sonne in Friedenszeiten, die Flagge mit Sonne in Kriegszeiten verwendet. Später unterschied man zwischen der in offizieller Funktion verwendeten Flagge (mit Sonne) und Flaggen des privaten Gebrauchs (ohne Sonne). Heute können beide Versionen nach Belieben verwendet werden., Geschichte., Am 25. Mai 1810 beginnt mit den ersten Bestrebungen, durch einen Aufstand in Buenos Aires die Unabhängigkeit von Spanien zu erlangen, die Geschichte der argentinischen Flagge. Zunächst wurden zweifarbige Flaggen verwendet, die die Farben der Stadt Buenos Aires, weiß und rot, zeigten, die seit der britischen Besetzungen 1806/1807 geführt wurden. Rot symbolisierte für die Vertreter der Unabhängigkeitsbemühungen die Freiheit und weiß die Einheit., Im August 1810 bildete José de Moldes, ein Vertreter der Fraktion, die bedingungslos mit Spanien brechen wollte, zwei Militäreinheiten, die er als Erkennungszeichen mit einer hellblau und weißen Kokarde ausstattete. Hellblau stand für die Provinzen des Río de la Plata und weiß für die Tyrannei durch Spanien. Im Dezember des gleichen Jahres beantragte er auch die Schaffung einer nationalen Kokarde in diesen Farben durch die provisorische Regierung., Nach dem Verbot der hellblau-weißen Kokarden durch Cornelio Saavedra, der nicht gänzlich mit Spanien brechen und einen graduellen Übergang zu mehr Selbstständigkeit wollte, wurden diese im April 1811 durch einfarbig rote Kokarden, wie sie die Spanier verwendeten, ausgetauscht und mit weißen Bändern versehen., Am 18. Februar 1812 legte die Junta, die erste provisorische Regierung, deren Mitglieder Feliciano Antonio Chiclana, Manuel de Sarratea Altoguirre und Juan José Paso waren, fest, dass statt der roten Kokarde wieder eine mit den Farben hellblau und weiß verwendet werden sollte:, Manuel Belgrano, der Sprecher der Junta, ließ sich hiervon zu einer Flagge inspirieren. Am 27. Februar 1812 wurde zum ersten Mal eine hellblau-weiße Flagge nahe der Stadt Rosario gehisst, als dort zwei Festungen eingeweiht wurden. Er teilte der Junta mit:, Die Regierung missbilligte diese Tat als politisch unvorsichtig und empfahl Belgrano, die Flagge zu entfernen und die rot-gelbe Flagge der Festung in Buenos Aires zu benutzen, also die Farben Spaniens. Allerdings erreichte Belgrano nie der Befehl vom 3. März, diese Flagge nicht zu verwenden, und so ließ er eine Flagge anfertigen, die am zweiten Jahrestag der Mairevolution (25. Mai 1812) in der Stadt San Salvador de Jujuy gehisst wurde. Die Regierung interpretierte dies als Befehlsverweigerung und forderte ihn am 27. Juni abermals auf, diese Flagge nicht zu verwenden. Am 18. Juli 1812 antwortete Belgrano, dass er bereit sei, die Flagge einzuholen und sie bis zum Tag der letzten Schlacht nicht verwenden werde., Zum zweiten Jahrestag der Mairevolution von Buenos Aires am 25. Mai 1812 ließ Belgrano eine weiße Fahne mit dem Siegel der Souveränen Versammlung anfertigen und am Jahrestag in der Hauptkirche von San Salvador de Jujuy von Domherr Juan Ignacio de Gorriti segnen. Diese \\"Bandera Nacional de Nuestra Libertad Civil\\" genannte Fahne schenkte er dem jujenischen Volk im Jahre 1813 als Dank für die Unterstützung im Unabhängigkeitskampf, besonders in der Schlacht von Salta. Die Fahne wird heute im Flaggensaal des Gouverneurspalasts von Jujuy aufbewahrt und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Jujuy. Das auf der Fahne abgebildete Siegel zeigt in seiner Mitte zwei sich schüttelnde Hände, die die Einigkeit und Brüderlichkeit der argentinischen Provinzen symbolisieren sollen. Die beiden Hände halten gleichzeitig einen Stab, auf dem eine phrygische Mütze liegt. Der Stab soll die Bereitschaft zur Verteidigung der Freiheit darstellen. Die Mütze soll in Anlehnung an die Jakobiner während der Französischen Revolution die republikanische Gesinnung der Argentinier symbolisieren. Die Hände stehen vor einem zweigeteilten Hintergrund, mit den Farben hellblau und weiß, den Farben des Himmels. Am oberen Rand der Ellipse sieht man eine aufgehende Sonne, ein Symbol, welches sich auch auf der Flagge Argentiniens wiederfindet. Die aufgehende Sonne symbolisiert den Aufstieg Argentiniens. Um die Ellipse herum rankt sich Lorbeer, welcher den Sieg im Unabhängigkeitskampf darstellt., Im Januar 1813 ließ Belgrano eine dritte Fahne anfertigen, die er nach Abstimmung mit der Regierung nicht als Staatsflagge, sondern als Fahne seiner Streitkräfte mit sich führte. Das Volk aber sah diese Fahne als die Nationalflagge an, auch wenn sie nur zwei Streifen hatte und nicht, wie in Buenos Aires vereinzelt im Gebrauch, drei Streifen. Belgrano vereidigte am 13. Februar seine Truppen auf diese Fahne und führte sie erstmals am 20. Februar 1813 in die Schlacht. Diese Fahne wurde am 13. November 1813 in der Schlacht von Ayohuma zum letzten Mal verwendet., Ab April 1813 ist die Verwendung der Inkasonne/Maisonne auf Münzen nachgewiesen. Die Sonnenscheibe mit einem Gesicht, umgeben von Sonnenstrahlen, symbolisierte in der Inkamythologie den Sohn Inti des göttlichen Schöpfers Viracocha. Die erste argentinische Münzen dienten später als Vorlage für die Sonne in der Flagge., Am 9. Juli 1816 erklärte der Kongress von Tucumán die Unabhängigkeit der \\"Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata\\" (Name Argentiniens um 1816) von Spanien, welches nach der französischen Fremdherrschaft durch Napoleons Bruder Joseph Bonaparte und dem Spanischen Unabhängigkeitskrieg stark geschwächt war. Der Kongress akzeptierte die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge am 20. Juli 1816 als die Nationalflagge. Der Text des Beschlusses lautet wie folgt:, Die Anden-Armee \\"(Ejército de los Andes)\\" des südamerikanischen Freiheitskämpfers José de San Martín benutzte 1817 und 1818 eine hellblau-weiße Fahne, die aber keinen dritten hellblauen Streifen aufwies, obwohl 1816 die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge vom Kongress verabschiedet worden war. Sie war mit dem Siegel der Regierung versehen und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Mendoza., Am 9. Januar 1818 bat der Oberste Direktor der Regierung Pueyrredón den Kongress zu bestimmen, wie die Flagge zu verwenden sei. Der Kongress antwortete am 25. Februar 1818, dass die Nationalflagge zwei Farben haben solle, weiß und blau, wie bisher, und dass die Kriegsflagge eine Sonne in der Mitte haben solle., Auch wenn hier von blau gesprochen wird, so war weiterhin hellblau gemeint und nicht das dunkelblau, welches in der Zeit von 1830 bis 1878 verwendet wurde., Besonders in der Anfangszeit bis 1830 waren viele offizielle und inoffizielle Varianten der Nationalflagge im Gebrauch. Häufige, aber falsche Varianten waren hierbei, dass die Sonne etwas nach links von der Mitte verschoben war oder, dass die Sonne über den weißen Streifen hinaus in die hellblauen Streifen hineinragte. 1826 tauchte zum ersten Mal der Name \\"República Argentina\\" (Republik Argentinien) auf; vorher wurde ausschließlich von den \\"Provincias Unidas del Rio de la Plata\\" (Vereinigten Provinzen des Río de la Plata) gesprochen., Seit 1828 trat Juan Manuel de Rosas als Befehlshaber der Landbevölkerung und Führer der Föderalisten im Kampf gegen die Fraktion der sogenannten Unitarier auf. Im Dezember 1829 wurde er Gouverneur von Buenos Aires. Im März 1835 wurde er abermals zum Gouverneur und Generalkapitän gewählt. Zeitweilig ließ sich Rosas außerordentliche Gewalt übertragen und erhielt damit faktisch die Gewalt eines Diktators. Rosas hasste die hellblaue Farbe, weil sie von den Unitariern verwendet wurde, und deshalb wurde seit seiner Machtübernahme ein dunklerer Farbton verwendet. 1836 wurde die Flagge durch vier Jakobinermützen auf Stäben in den Ecken ergänzt. Wenig später wurden die Stäbe durch Pfeile ersetzt und rote Sonnenstrahlen der Sonne hinzugefügt. Ab 1840 wurde die Sonne vollständig rot dargestellt. Weil Rosas die Unabhängigkeit Uruguays nicht anerkennen wollte, erklärten Frankreich, Großbritannien, Paraguay, Uruguay und Brasilien den Krieg gegen Rosas’ Argentinien. Nach dem verlorenen Krieg konnte sich Rosas nicht lange an der Macht halten, und so wurde seine Herrschaft durch den Unitarier Justo José de Urquiza 1853 beendet., Die Argentinische Konföderation \\"(Confederación Argentina )\\", die von Buenos Aires abgelehnt wurde, gab sich wieder die traditionelle hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge. Aber auch das eigenständige Buenos Aires nutze diese Flagge. 1862 schloss sich Buenos Aires den anderen Provinzen wieder an. Um 1862 verschwanden dann mit dem Entstehen einer stärkeren Zentralgewalt in Argentinien nach und nach auch die Provinzflaggen., Durch ein Dekret des Präsidenten Julio Argentino Roca wurde ab 1884 die Flagge mit der Sonne auch an öffentlichen Gebäuden verwendet, sie war jetzt keine Kriegsflagge mehr. 1943 wurde dies durch ein Dekret bestätigt. Die Flagge ohne Sonne war jetzt für den Gebrauch durch die Bürger vorgesehen. Staatsflagge war ab jetzt die Flagge mit der Sonne. Seit 1985 dürfen auch die Bürger die Flagge mit der Sonne verwenden:, Beziehung der argentinischen Bevölkerung zu ihrer Flagge., Wie in vielen anderen ehemaligen Kolonien europäischer Staaten hat die argentinische Flagge eine besondere Bedeutung für die Bevölkerung. Die Vorfahren der großen Mehrheit der Argentinier stammen nicht ursprünglich von den Ureinwohnern ab, sondern kamen aus meist europäischen Staaten (nach offiziellen Statistiken etwa 90 % der heutigen Bevölkerung). In Argentinien sind besonders stark die Ursprungsländer Spanien (29 %) und Italien (36 %) vertreten, aber auch Einwanderer aus Frankreich, Großbritannien und Deutschland stellen einen relativ großen Anteil., Dadurch, dass die Einwohner unterschiedliche kulturelle Hintergründe haben, spielen die nationale Symbole eine besonders starke Rolle für die Identifikation mit der Heimat Argentinien. Besonders die Hymne und die Flagge sprechen die nationalen Gefühle der meisten Argentinier an., In der Schule zeigt sich besonders, wie stark die Flagge als einigendes Band für diese noch relativ junge Nation wirkt.

Zuvor hatte das mit dem nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Reich verbündete Ungarn einen Großteil der Opfer in das nach dem Überfall auf die Sowjetunion von der Wehrmacht eroberte sowjetische Staatsgebiet deportiert. Das Massaker war die bis dahin größte Mordaktion des Holocaust. Es fand gut einen Monat vor den Massenerschießungen von Babyn Jar bei Kiew statt und gilt als ein entscheidender Schritt von der selektiven Mordpolitik zur angestrebten vollständigen Auslöschung des Judentums., Kontext., Antisemitismus im expandierenden Ungarn., Die ungarischen Regierungen unter Béla Imrédy und Pál Teleki erließen ab 1938 eine Reihe sogenannter Judengesetze und verschärften auf diese Weise den auch in Ungarn verbreiteten Antisemitismus der Zwischenkriegszeit. Diese auf rassistischen Annahmen basierenden gesetzlichen Bestimmungen schränkten die wirtschaftlichen und beruflichen Freiheiten sowie das Wahlrecht der Juden ein. Zugleich stellten diese Gesetze die ungarische Staatsbürgerschaft Tausender ungarischer Juden in Frage. Im April 1941 verabschiedete das ungarische Parlament schließlich ein Gesetz, das Eheschließungen und außerehelichen Geschlechtsverkehr zwischen Nicht-Juden und Juden verbot – es trat im August 1941 in Kraft., Da es Ungarn gelang, die 1920 im Vertrag von Trianon festgelegte territoriale Nachkriegsordnung zu revidieren, betraf die Diskriminierung immer mehr Menschen. Unterstützt durch das Deutsche Reich und das faschistische Italien erreichte die ungarische Außenpolitik Anfang November 1938 mit dem Ersten Wiener Schiedsspruch zunächst, dass Gebiete mit ungarischer Bevölkerungsmehrheit in der Südslowakei sowie in der westlichen Karpatenukraine \\"(Karpato-Ruthenien)\\" von der Tschechoslowakei abgetrennt und Ungarn zugesprochen wurden. Rund 67.000 Juden lebten in diesen Gebieten. Weitere rund 78.000 Juden gerieten unter ungarische Herrschaft, nachdem ungarische Truppen im März 1939 nach der sogenannten \\"Zerschlagung der Rest-Tschechei\\" mit Billigung Adolf Hitlers die bis 1918 zu Österreich-Ungarn gehörenden Teile der Karpatenukraine besetzten. Der Zweite Wiener Schiedsspruch vom 30. August 1940 zwang schließlich Rumänien, das nördliche Siebenbürgen, wo etwa 164.000 Juden lebten, an Ungarn abzutreten., Zudem flohen zwischen 1939 und 1941 10.000 bis 20.000 beziehungsweise 15.000 bis 35.000 Juden aus Deutschland, Österreich, den vormaligen tschechischen Gebieten und aus Polen nach Ungarn. Einige dieser Flüchtlinge hatten durch die Behörden das Aufenthaltsrecht erhalten, weitere galten offiziell als Transitflüchtlinge auf dem Weg nach Palästina. Etliche Flüchtlinge verbargen ihre Identität durch falsche Papiere, andere wiederum wurden in Internierungslagern der ungarischen Fremdenpolizei – der \\"Nationalen Zentralbehörde zur Überwachung von Ausländern\\" (\\"Külföldieket Ellenőrző Országos Központi Hatóság\\", KEOKH) – festgehalten. Obgleich die Anzahl dieser jüdischen Flüchtlinge kaum ins Gewicht fiel, verstärkte sie die antisemitischen Tendenzen innerhalb des ungarischen Verwaltungsapparates. 1941 lebten gemäß einer Volkszählung insgesamt rund 825.000 Juden in Ungarn., Deportation „fremder“ Juden., Am 20. November 1940 war Ungarn dem Dreimächtepakt beigetreten. Bereits im April 1941 hatte es sich als Bündnispartner des Deutschen Reiches am Balkanfeldzug beteiligt; im Juni 1941 nahm Ungarn schließlich an der Seite Deutschlands am Überfall auf die Sowjetunion teil. Drei ungarische Divisionen beteiligten sich an der Eroberung von Gebieten der Ukrainischen Sozialistischen Sowjetrepublik. Ungarische Truppen verfügten durch diesen Vormarsch zeitweilig über die militärische Hoheitsgewalt in einem beträchtlichen ukrainischen Gebiet nordöstlich Ungarns., In dieser Situation planten Ödön Martinidesz und Árkád Kiss, zwei antisemitische KEOKH-Führungskräfte, unerwünschte, „fremde“ Juden in den neuen, „befreiten“ Gebieten anzusiedeln. Miklós Kozma, ein früherer ungarischer Innen- und Verteidigungsminister und 1941 Regierungsbevollmächtigter in Karpato-Ruthenien, griff diesen Plan auf und erreichte dafür vom Reichsverweser Miklós Horthy, dem ungarischen Staatsoberhaupt, die Zustimmung. Das Kabinett unter Ministerpräsident László Bárdossy beschloss am 12. Juli 1941, diesen Plan umzusetzen. Ausführungsbestimmungen sahen vor, „die kürzlich eingesickerten polnischen und russischen Juden in möglichst großer Zahl und so schnell wie möglich“ zu deportieren. Die beschönigend „Repatriierung“ genannte Maßnahme sollte sich insbesondere auf Karpato-Ruthenien konzentrieren. Abschiebungsziel der von der Fremdenpolizei und örtlichen Behörden erfassten Juden war Ost-Galizien. Den Auftrag zur Durchführung des Deportationsplans erhielt Miklós Kozma., Er ließ die Juden wie im Deportationsplan vorgesehen zunächst nach Kőrösmező, einem Ort an der ungarisch-ukrainischen Grenze, bringen. Sie durften nur die nötigsten Dinge, Verpflegung für drei Tage und maximal 30 Pengő mitnehmen. Um ihre Sorgen zu zerstreuen, wurde ihnen suggeriert, sie könnten die Wohnungen jener Juden übernehmen, die nach dem Überfall der Deutschen mit den sowjetischen Truppen ostwärts geflohen waren. Die Deportationen, die in Ungarn zum Teil bereits vor dem 12. Juli 1941 praktisch umgesetzt wurden, betrafen neben Flüchtlingen vielfach auch Juden, die schon lange in Ungarn lebten – nicht nur in Karpato-Ruthenien, sondern beispielsweise auch in Siebenbürgen, am Balaton oder im Komitat Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun. Auch Roma wurden Opfer solcher Deportationen., Vom Sammelpunkt Kőrösmező wurden die Juden täglich in Gruppen von rund 1000 Personen nach Kolomyja in Süd-Galizien transportiert, das sich noch unter ungarischer Militärhoheit befand. Bis zum 10. August 1941 sammelten sich dort rund 14.000 Juden, bis Ende August erhöhte sich diese Zahl um weitere 4000. Im gleichen Zeitraum trieben ungarische Einheiten die Ankömmlinge in Gruppen zu je 300 bis 400 Personen von Kolomyja aus über den Dnister in eine von deutschem Militär verwaltete Gegend und untersagten ihnen unter Androhung von Waffengewalt die Rückkehr nach Ungarn. Ukrainische Milizen beraubten die Deportierten vielfach ihrer letzten Wertsachen. Die Vertriebenen sollten sich nach Kamenez-Podolsk, Butschatsch, Tschortkiw oder Stanislawiw wenden., Die meisten aus Ungarn vertriebenen Juden sammelten sich in Kamenez-Podolsk (Süd-Podolien). Dort hatten 1939 knapp 14.000 Juden gelebt (gut 38Prozent der Bevölkerung), von denen seit 22. Juni 1941 etwa 4000 bis 5000 vor den Deutschen weiter ostwärts flohen. Aus Ungarn und dem ungarisch besetzten Teil Südgaliziens vertriebene Juden erhöhten den jüdischen Anteil der Einwohnerzahl jedoch wieder. Daher fanden die deutschen und ungarischen Truppen bei ihrer Ankunft in der Stadt am 11. Juli 1941 dort etwa 12.000 bis 14.000 Juden vor. Diese Zahl verdoppelte sich durch den weiteren Zustrom bis Ende August 1941 auf rund 26.000., Verabredung der Massenexekution., Die Deutschen waren auf den Zustrom der nach Südgalizien deportierten Juden nicht vorbereitet. Die für die „Judenfrage“ zuständige Abteilung VII der regional verantwortlichen Wehrmachtsfeldkommandantur 183 betonte bereits am 31. Juli und erneut Mitte August 1941, die Juden könnten nicht ernährt werden und es bestehe Seuchengefahr; ihre Rückführung nach Ungarn sei daher erforderlich. Ernährungsprobleme der Zivilbevölkerung hatte die Wehrmachtsführung jedoch in den Kriegsplanungen einkalkuliert (→ Hungerplan). Sie sorgte sich eher um die Sicherheit der ausgedehnten Nachschubwege, auch für die schon anvisierte Schlacht um Kiew. Wehrmachtsoffiziere hielten die Sicherheitslage im rückwärtigen Heeresgebiet unter anderem deswegen für prekär, weil mit dem Polizeibataillon 320 in Podolien und Wolhynien für mehrere Wochen nur eine einzige Polizeieinheit zur Verfügung stand. Hinzu kam, dass zum 1. September 1941 das Reichskommissariat Ukraine eingerichtet sein sollte und die Militärverwaltung das nach ihren Vorstellungen geordnete Gebiet dann an die zivilen Stellen übergeben wollte., Der ranghöchste Polizeifunktionär vor Ort, der Höhere SS- und Polizeiführer Russland-Süd Friedrich Jeckeln, formulierte angesichts dieser Lage den Gedanken, man könne die Juden ermorden. Er ließ am 25. August 1941 auf einer Konferenz im Hauptquartier des Generalquartiermeisters im Oberkommando des Heeres, Eduard Wagner, ausrichten, dass er handeln werde:, Die Konferenz fand Klaus-Michael Mallmann zufolge wahrscheinlich in Bartenstein statt, nicht wie früher angenommen in Winniza. Die Teilnehmer blieben trotz der deutlichen Ankündigung ungerührt und erörterten das Vorhaben nicht weiter. Laut Konferenzprotokoll verabredeten folgende Personen das Massaker:, Als weitere mögliche Teilnehmer gelten zudem:, Jeckeln konnte den Massenmord auch deswegen vorschlagen, weil er wusste, dass die führenden Militärs in der Heeresgruppe Süd „samt und sonders bekennende Antisemiten“ waren. Das rassistische Schlagwort vom „jüdischen Bolschewismus“ war bei ihnen fest verankert. Juden galten als Träger der bolschewistischen Ideologie und darum als Sicherheitsrisiko und Feinde. Karl von Roques, Befehlshaber des Rückwärtigen Heeresgebietes Süd, dem Jeckeln zugeordnet war, bildete hier keine Ausnahme. Zu Jeckeln hatte er offenbar ein harmonisches Verhältnis. Unstimmigkeiten oder ernsthafte Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den beiden sind nicht bekannt. Berichte der Abteilung Ic („Feindaufklärung und Abwehr; geistige Betreuung“) des Befehlshabers im rückwärtigen Heeresgebiet Süd betonten ihre reibungslose Zusammenarbeit., Jeckeln selbst war ein radikaler Antisemit. Sein Wille, immer größere Gruppen von Juden unterschiedslos umzubringen, mag durch einen Wettbewerb um hohe Mordquoten angestachelt worden sein. Die britische Abwehr schlussfolgerte jedenfalls aus dekodierten Funksprüchen mit Angaben über Opferzahlen: „: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Einsatzgruppen, Sicherheitspolizei, SD, Holocaust, Ukraine, Kamjanez-Podilskyj, Konflikt 1941, Massaker, Massengrab, NS-Kriegsverbrechen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Falkenartige], Der Rotfußfalke (\\"Falco vespertinus\\") ist ein kleiner Vertreter der Eigentlichen Falken innerhalb der Familie der Falkenartigen (Falconidae). Bei den dunkel blaugrauen Männchen fällt die rostrote Befiederung der roten Beine besonders auf. Bei den Weibchen kontrastiert das dunkle Obergefieder mit dem orangebraunen Kopf und Untergefieder. Das geschlossene Verbreitungsgebiet der Art reicht von Ungarn ostwärts bis ins Baikalgebiet. Seit den 1960er Jahren gehen die Bestände des Rotfußfalken fast im gesamten Verbreitungsgebiet der Art zurück., Beschreibung., Die Oberseite erwachsener Männchen ist dunkel blaugrau. Meist ist dieser Grauton im Kopfbereich, vor allem rund um die Augen noch etwas dunkler. Die Arm- und Handschwingen sind auf der Oberseite heller silbrig-grau, was einen auffälligen Kontrast zu den dunklen Oberflügeldecken ergibt. Auch die Unterseite des Vogels ist schiefergrau mit Ausnahme des Unterbauchs, der Unterschwanzdecken und der Befiederung der Beine („Hosen“), welche satt rotbraun gefärbt sind. Auffallend sind außerdem der eisenoxidrote Augenring und die ebenso gefärbte Wachshaut. Der Schnabel ist blaugrau und wird zur Spitze hin dunkler, die Krallen sind sehr hell, nur ihre Spitzen sind dunkelgrau. Die Beine und Zehen sind lachsrot., Erwachsene Weibchen unterscheiden sich deutlich von den Männchen. Ihre Oberseite ist heller schiefergrau, oft auch leicht braungrau mit deutlicher, dunkelgrauer Bänderung. Der Schwanz ist etwas heller als das Obergefieder und weist einige dunkle Bänder auf. Das Subterminalband (vergleiche Endbinde) ist fast schwarz und etwas breiter, die Spitzen der Steuerfedern sind schmutzigweiß oder cremefarben. Nacken, Oberkopf und die gesamte Unterseite sind leuchtend bräunlich-orange. Das Bauchgefieder weist eine undeutliche, schwarze Längsstrichelung auf. Die Wangen und die Kehle sind weiß. Auffallend ist die schwarze Augenmaske, die sich in einem kurzen Bartstreif zu den Wangen hin verlängert. Der Augenring und die Wachshaut sind leuchtend orange. Beine und Zehen sind satt orange, die Krallen hell(gelb) mit dunkler Spitze., Juvenile Rotfußfalken sind feldornithologisch nicht immer leicht zu bestimmen. Ihre Oberseite ist matt dunkelbraun und wirkt etwas geschuppt. Die Schwungfedern sind dunkel, kontrastieren aber nicht sehr deutlich mit dem übrigen Obergefieder. Die Unterseite ist hell, die Färbung variiert zwischen blassorange und blassbraun, die Arm- und Handschwingen sind wie bei erwachsenen Weibchen graubraun mit deutlichen hellen Streifen. Der Schwanz ist deutlich gebändert und weist ein breites, dunkles Subterminalband auf. Kopf und Scheitel sind hellbraun oder bräunlich-orange und deutlich fein längsgestrichelt. Die Augenmaske und der Bart sind braun, Wachshaut und Augenringe gelborange. Die Beine und Zehen sind blassgelb., Immature Rotfußfalken (noch nicht ausgefärbte Individuen) sind auch im Freiland meist leicht zu bestimmen, da bei ihnen – individuell allerdings sehr verschieden – die Merkmale des Erwachsenenkleides schon stark ausgebildet sind. In der Untersicht vermitteln sie oft einen uneinheitlichen, scheckigen Eindruck, da das Brust- und Bauchgefieder, die Unterflügeldecken sowie einige (meist die inneren) Handschwingen bereits ins Erwachsenenkleid gemausert sind, die übrigen Handschwingen sowie die meisten Armschwingen aber noch die graubraune, weiß gesprenkelte Färbung des Jugendkleides aufweisen. In der Obersicht gleicht ein Immaturer bereits weitgehend einem erwachsenen Rotfußfalken, nur die äußeren Steuerfedern weisen deutliche weiße Kennzeichen auf. Oft ist auch ein orangebrauner, meist nicht geschlossener Halsring erkennbar. Am Ende des zweiten Lebensjahres wechseln Rotfußfalken in das Erwachsenenkleid., Der gewandte, schnelle und wendungsreiche Flug des Rotfußfalken wird regelmäßig von kurzen Gleitphasen unterbrochen, bei denen die Flügel sichelförmig nach hinten gestreckt werden. Die Art rüttelt häufig, meist ziemlich bodennah und nicht so ausdauernd wie der Turmfalke. Die Körperposition ist dabei waagrechter als bei Turmfalken. Im Segelflug sind die gestreckten Flügel etwas abgesenkt, der Schwanz ist breit gefächert., Maße und Körpermasse., Die Körperlänge liegt zwischen 29 und 31 Zentimetern. Die Spannweite variiert zwischen 60 und 75 Zentimetern. Der Rotfußfalke entspricht in der Größe etwa dem Rötelfalken und ist bei gleicher Spannweite etwas kleiner als ein Turmfalke und deutlich kleiner als ein Baumfalke. Männchen wiegen zwischen 115 und 190 Gramm, Weibchen sind mit 130 bis 197 Gramm etwas schwerer. Insgesamt ist der Geschlechtsdimorphismus in Bezug auf Größe und Gewicht jedoch gering, verglichen mit anderen Greifvögeln., Stimme., Als Koloniebrüter sind Rotfußfalken sehr stimmfreudig. Besonders in der Vorbrutzeit sowie in Rastgesellschaften sind sie ausgesprochen laut. Einzeln brütende Paare sind dagegen akustisch nicht sehr auffällig. Die Rufe ähneln denen des Baumfalken, sind aber höher, weicher und auch langsamer gereiht. Bei steigender Erregung werden die Rufe spitzer und die Intervalle zwischen den Einzelelementen kürzer. In etwa lassen sie sich mit \\"kjiiie-kjiie\\" transkribieren. Entfernt erinnern sie an die Rufe des Wendehalses. Die Rufe des Weibchens sind ähnlich, klingen jedoch etwas kläglich. Bei großer Erregung vibrieren sie eigenartig und klingen dann keckernd. Häufig ist auch ein langgezogenes Lahnen, das wie \\"thschree - triiie - triii\\" klingt, zu hören., Verwechslungsmöglichkeiten., Vor allem juvenile Rotfußfalken können leicht mit jungen Baumfalken verwechselt werden. Beim juvenilen Baumfalken sind der Kopf und die Gesichtsmaske dunkel, fast schwarz, die Wachshaut und die Augenringe sind unauffällig blaugrau. Die mittleren Schwanzfedern des Baumfalken sind einfarbig dunkelgrau und weisen keine Bänderung auf. Im Flugbild fallen die größere Spannweite des Baumfalken, die an der Basis breiteren Flügel und der kräftigere, plumper wirkende Flug auf., Auch Merlinweibchen sind juvenilen Rotfußfalken sehr ähnlich, doch erlauben die deutlich geringere Spannweite des Merlins, sein insgesamt eher dreieckiger Flügelumriss sowie die völlig andere Flugweise meist eine sichere Bestimmung., Systematik., \\"F. vespertinus\\" ist nahe mit dem Amurfalken (\\"Falco amurensis\\") verwandt, dessen Verbreitungsgebiet ostwärts an das des Rotfußfalken anschließt, und bis an den Amur, südostwärts bis Nordkorea reicht. Diese Art ist etwas kleiner als der Rotfußfalke und unterscheidet sich vor allem in der Gefiederfärbung der Weibchen deutlich von diesem. Weibliche Amurfalken haben einen dunkel schiefergrauen Kopf. Die Augenringe und Wachshaut sind ziegelrot. Die Unterseite der Weibchen weist auf nur blass bräunlich orangem Grund eine deutliche schwarze Fleckung auf. Amurfalken fliegen in die gleichen Winterquartiere wie Rotfußfalken. Auf dem Heimzug kommt es gelegentlich in Südeuropa zu Nachweisen dieser Art., Bis vor einigen Jahren galt der Amurfalke als Unterart des Rotfußfalken (\\"Falco vespertinus amuriensis\\"), er wird heute jedoch als eigenständige Art betrachtet, so dass vom Rotfußfalken keine Unterarten beschrieben werden., Verbreitung., Die Schwerpunkte der europäischen Verbreitung liegen in Südrussland sowie in der Ukraine. In größeren Zahlen kommt die Art in Ungarn, Rumänien und Serbien vor. Kleinere Populationen bestehen in Italien, Bulgarien und Moldawien, in Österreich, der Slowakei sowie in Belarus. Unregelmäßig brütet der Rotfußfalke auch in Tschechien und in den baltischen Staaten, gelegentlich auch in Deutschland. In Asien verlaufen die Brutvorkommen in einem relativ schmalen Band etwas südlich der geschlossenen Taiga ostwärts bis zur oberen Lena, wo sie östlich des Baikals das Verbreitungsgebiet der Schwesterart \\"Falco amurensis\\" berühren. Die Nordgrenze schwankt zwischen dem 63° und 58° nördlicher Breite, die Südgrenze etwa um den 45° nördlicher Breite. Sie verläuft zunächst entlang der Nordabdachung des Altai und folgt dann westwärts dem Übergang aufgelockerter Kiefernwälder in die baumlosen Steppengebiete Zentralasiens. Weiter westwärts erreichen die geschlossenen Brutgebiete am Unterlauf der Wolga sowie an der Nordküste des Kaspischen Meeres Europa. Die südlichsten Vorkommen liegen in den Steppengebieten nördlich des Kaukasus und in Südgeorgien. Einige inselartige Brutgebiete befinden sich in der nördlichen Türkei., Den Winter verbringen sie im südlichen und östlichen Afrika., Lebensraum., Der Rotfußfalke ist ein Bewohner weitgehend offener, von Baumgruppen bestandener, oder mit kleinen Wäldchen durchsetzter Landschaften. Neben einem reichlichen Angebot an Großinsekten und Kleinsäugern, ist die Art auf das Vorhandensein von geeigneten Nistmöglichkeiten, insbesondere von alten Saatkrähen- und Elsternestern angewiesen. In seinen Schlüsselverbreitungsgebieten in Zentralasien und Südosteuropa kommt er vor allem in Baumsteppengebieten vor. Er besiedelt jedoch ebenso den Südrand des geschlossenen paläarktischen Nadelwaldgürtels, in besonderer Dichte jene Regionen, in denen der geschlossene Fichtenbestand in einen aufgelockerten Kiefernbestand übergeht. Die Art vermag auch in große, zusammenhängende Waldgebiete vorzudringen, wenn dort durch Stürme, Brände oder Kahlschläge große Lichtungen entstanden sind. In seinen nördlicheren Verbreitungsgebieten brüten Rotfußfalken auch in baumbestandenen Heidelandschaften sowie in Moorgebieten. Ebenso können aufgelockerte Auwälder, seltener auch von Baumreihen begrenztes Kulturland Bruthabitate des Rotfußfalken sein. Dort, wo ausreichend Duldung durch die Menschen besteht, können Rotfußfalken in Siedlungsnähe oder an Siedlungsrändern nisten. Wüstengebiete werden niemals besiedelt, baumlose Steppengebiete nur in Ausnahmefällen, vor allem dann, wenn sich Brutmöglichkeiten an Klippen oder Felseninseln anbieten., Der Rotfußfalke ist ein Bewohner der Niederungen. In Europa liegen nur wenige Brutplätze über 300 Meter Meereshöhe. In Asien kommt die Art bis 1500 Meter über dem Meeresspiegel vor., In den Winterquartieren, in denen die Art ein nomadisierendes Leben führt, werden verschiedene Landschaftstypen wie Feuchtsavannen, Trockensavannen, Dorngrassavannen sowie offenes Grasland aufgesucht., Nahrung und Nahrungserwerb., Die Nahrungsgrundlage erwachsener Rotfuß: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Rotfußfalke - Falkenartige - Eigentliche Falken - Familie der Falconidae - dunkel blaugrau - rostrote Befiederung - Verbreitungsgebiet - Männchen - Weibchen - Obergefieder - orangebraun - Jugendkleid - Immature Rotfußfalken - Flug - Maße und Körpermasse - Stimme - Verwechslungsmöglichkeiten - Systematik - Verbreitung - Lebensraum - Nahrungserwerb"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flagge nach Staat, Nationales Symbol (Indien), Nationalflagge], Die Flagge Indiens wird auch als Tiranga (hindi: तिरंगा; dt.: Trikolore) bezeichnet., Beschreibung., Sie besteht aus drei horizontalen Streifen gleicher Breite, oben safranfarben, in der Mitte weiß und unten grün. Im Zentrum befindet sich ein marineblaues \\"Chakra\\" (चक्र, dt.: \\"Rad\\") mit 24 Speichen. Der Durchmesser des Rads beträgt 3/4 der Höhe des weißen Streifens, allerdings ist es inzwischen gängige Praxis, dass das Rad bis zu 98 % der Höhe des weißen Streifens einnimmt. Die Flagge wurde offiziell bei einer Sitzung der Verfassunggebenden Versammlung Indiens am 22. Juli 1947, kurz vor der Unabhängigkeit Indiens am 15. August 1947, angenommen. Die Benutzung der Flagge, die von Pingali Venkayya entworfen wurde, unterliegt einem sorgsam erarbeiteten Kodex. Zum Beispiel muss die offizielle Flagge aus Khadi, einem von Hand gesponnenen Garn, gefertigt sein., Die Farben der indischen Flagge entsprechen in verschiedenen Farbmodellen (HTML-RGB-Webfarben (hexadezimale Schreibweise), CMYK-Entsprechung, Farbstoffe und die entsprechende Pantone-Nummer) ungefähr:, Symbolik., Der Indische Nationalkongress (INC), Indiens größte politische Partei vor der Unabhängigkeit, nahm 1921 eine weiß-grün-rote Flagge als seine inoffizielle Flagge an. Das Rot stand ursprünglich für den Hinduismus, das Grün für den Islam und das Weiß für andere Minderheitsreligionen. Jedoch dachten manche auch, dass das Weiß wie ein Friedenspuffer zwischen den beiden Religionen steht, wie z.B. in der Flagge Irlands. Diese diente wahrscheinlich als Vorbild, da auch Irland um die Unabhängigkeit vom Britischen Weltreich kämpfte. Im Zentrum war ein \\"Carkhā\\" (चरखा, dt.: Spinnrad) in blau abgebildet, das Symbol des Strebens nach wirtschaftlicher und später auch politischer Unabhängigkeit. 1931 nahm der Kongress eine andere safrangelb-weiß-grüne Flagge, ebenfalls mit \\"Carkhā\\" in der Mitte, offiziell an, die jedoch keine religiöse Bedeutung hatte: es wurde erklärt, dass Safrangelb für Mut, Weiß für Wahrheit und Frieden und Grün für Glauben, Wohlstand und Treue stehe., In der 1947, kurz vor der Erlangung der vollständigen Unabhängigkeit vom Vereinigten Königreich, von der verfassunggebenden Versammlung angenommenen Flagge Indiens wurde das Spinnrad durch ein Rad, das Dharmachakra (\\"Rad des Gesetzes\\"), ersetzt. Das Dharmachakra war bereits von König Ashoka (Maurya-Dynastie, regierte ca. 268 v. Chr. – 232 v. Chr.), dem Begründer des frühesten indischen Großreiches, als Symbol der Herrschaft des Gesetzes in seinem ganzen Reich verbreitet worden (siehe auch Edikte des Ashoka). Aus diesem Grund wird es auch als „Ashoka Chakra“ bezeichnet. Zu jener Zeit war es im ursprünglichen Sinn das Symbol für die Lehren des Buddha (das Buddha-Dharma), die für Ashoka Grundlage seiner Gesetzgebung waren. Während das buddhistische Dharmachakra acht Speichen aufweist, hat das Rad der Flagge 24 Speichen, welche die Stunden des Tages symbolisieren., Von S. Radhakrishnan (1888–1975), dem späteren zweiten Präsidenten Indiens, stammt folgende Interpretation der Flagge:, , Dienstflaggen., Die indischen Dienstflaggen sind nach dem Vorbild des britischen Flaggensystems (Blue Ensign, Red Ensign und White Ensign) gestaltet., Im Gegensatz zum britischen Original wird seit der Unabhängigkeit Indiens kein Union Jack mehr benutzt., Geschichte., Als die Briten die Herrschaft über Indien übernahmen, lösten sie das Mogulreich ab, das 1526 bis 1858 den Großteil des indischen Subkontinents umfasste. Die bekannteste Flagge des Mogulreichs war der Alam, der Überlieferung nach die Fahne des Kriegers Hussain., Mit der Gründung Britisch-Indiens 1858, durch die Großbritannien seine Herrschaft über die heutigen Staaten Indien, Pakistan, Bangladesch und Birma errichtete, wurde der Union Jack zur Staatsflagge erklärt. Ab 1880 verwendeten zahlreiche Vereinigungen bei Veranstaltungen auch eine halboffizielle Landesflagge mit dem Union Jack, dem auf der Flugseite auf rotem Grund der Stern des von Königin Victoria gegründeten Ritterordens Star of India gegenüberstand., Am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, als die indische Unabhängigkeitsbewegung Freiheit von der britischen Herrschaft suchte und erste Anhänger fand, stand auch die Frage nach einer Nationalflagge im Raum. Schwester Nivedita, eine irische Jüngerin von Swami Vivekananda, hatte die Idee zur ersten Flagge Indiens, die auch als \\"Sister Nivedita’s Flag\\" bekannt ist. Es war eine rote, rechteckige Flagge mit einem gelben Vajra Chinha (Blitz) und einem weißen Lotus in der Mitte. Die Inschrift lautete বন্দে মাতরম (\\"Bande Mataram\\", bengalisch für: Heil der Mutter![dem Mutterland!]). Rot drückte den Wunsch nach Freiheit, gelb den Sieg aus und der weiße Lotus stand für Reinheit., Die erste Trikolore wurde am 7. August 1906 bei einem Protestmarsch gegen die Teilung Bengalens von Sachindra Prasad Bose im Parsi Bagan Square in Kalkutta entrollt. Diese Flagge wurde als die \\"Kalkutta-Flagge\\", Flagge der Unabhängigkeit, bekannt und zeigte drei horizontale Streifen gleicher Höhe: oben orange, in der Mitte gelb und unten grün. Auf dem oberen Streifen sind acht Lotosblüten als Symbol der acht Provinzen Britisch-Indiens abgebildet, auf dem unteren eine Sonne und eine Mondsichel mit Stern. \\"Vande Mataram\\", \\"Ich verbeuge mich vor dir, Mutter\\", in Hindi (वन्दे मातरम्) ist die Inschrift auf dem mittleren Streifen. Es handelt sich um ein Zitat aus einem dichterischen Loblied auf die Göttin Durga, die in allen Bevölkerungsschichten als die Personifizierung Indiens gilt., Am 22. August 1907 entrollte Madam Bhikhaji Rustom Cama eine andere Trikolore in Stuttgart. Diese war oben grün, in der Mitte gelb und unten rot. Auf dem oberen Streifen waren acht Lotosblüten, die die acht Provinzen Britisch-Indiens repräsentierten. Auf dem mittleren Streifen stand auch hier \\"Vande Mataram\\". Auf dem unteren Streifen war zum Mast hin eine Mondsichel und auf der anderen Seite eine Sonne abgebildet. Die Farben standen für Islam, Hinduismus und Buddhismus sowie Sikhismus. Die Flagge wurde zusammen von Madam Cama, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar und Shyamji Krishna Varma entworfen. Nach dem Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs wurde diese Flagge unter dem Namen \\"Berliner-Komitee-Flagge\\" bekannt, da sie von indischen Revolutionären in Berlin (\\"Berliner Komitee\\") angenommen wurde. Die Flagge wurde während des Krieges aktiv in Mesopotamien genutzt., Die Flagge der Ghadar-Partei wurde auch in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika für eine kurze Zeit als Symbol für Indien benutzt., 1916 versucht Pingley Venkayya aus Masulipatnam in Andhra Pradesh, eine gemeinsame Nationalflagge zu entwerfen. Umar Sobani und S. B. Bomanji bemerkten seine Bemühungen und gründeten zusammen die „Indische Nationalflaggen-Mission“. Venkayya versuchte, Mahatma Gandhi zur Annahme der Flagge zu bewegen, aber sie gefiel ihm nicht. Er schlug vor, dass Venkayya eine neue Flagge mit einem Spinnrad (Charkha) darauf entwerfen solle. Das Charkha sei „die Verkörperung Indiens“ und symbolisiere „die Erlösung von all seinem Übel“. Der erneute Entwurf mit einem roten und einem grünen Streifen und einem Charkha gefiel Gandhi jedoch ebenfalls nicht, da er nicht alle indischen Religionen wiedergab., Die so genannte Home-Rule-Bewegung wurde von Bal Gangadhar Tilak und Annie Besant 1917 gegründet. Ihre Flagge bestand aus fünf roten und vier grünen horizontalen Streifen und hatte in der oberen linken Ecke den Union Jack, der den Dominion-Status symbolisierte, den die Bewegung für Indien anstrebte. Eine Mondsichel und ein Stern befanden sich oben rechts auf der Flagge. Die sieben weißen Sterne waren wie in dem für Hindus heiligen Sternbild \\"Saptarishi\\" (\\"Sieben Weise\\", der indische Name für das Sternbild Großer Bär) angeordnet. Diese Flagge war jedoch wegen des Union Jack nicht sehr beliebt., 1921 entwarf Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi eine Nationalflagge für ein unabhängiges Indien. Sie zeigte das Emblem des Spinnrads, ein Symbol der Hoffnung auf wirtschaftliche und politische Unabhängigkeit. Die Farben standen für die großen Glaubensgemeinschaften Indiens: Rot für den Hinduismus, Grün für den Islam und Weiß für die Minderheitsreligionen., Die neue weiß-grün-rote Flagge (zur Bedeutung der Farben siehe Symbolik) wurde zum ersten Mal auf einem Parteitreffen in Ahmedabad entrollt. Obwohl diese Flagge vom Indischen Nationalkongress nicht offiziell angenommen wurde, war sie doch unter der Freiheitsbewegung weit verbreitet. Jedoch waren nicht alle mit den unterschiedlichen Interpretationen der Flagge zufrieden. Der \\"All India Sanskrit Congress\\" schlug 1924 in Kalkutta vor, Safrangelb oder Ocker und das \\"gada\\" (Labyrinth) des Vishnus als Symbol für die Hindus einzubinden. Im gleichen Jahr wurde Geru (eine erdrote Farbe) vorgeschlagen, da sie „für den Geist des Verzichts“ stehe und „das ideale gemeinsame Symbol sowohl für die hinduistischen Yogis und Sannyasins, als auch für die muslimischen Fakire und Derwische“ sei. Die Sikhs forderten die Farbe gelb, die ihre Religion repräsentierte, oder den Verzicht einer religiösen Bedeutung., Auf Grund dieser Entwicklungen ernannte das Kongressarbeitskomitee am 2. April 1931 eine siebenköpfige Flaggenkommission, die die Vorschläge überdenken sollte. In einer Resolution wurden die drei Farben verworfen, da sie auf religiöser Grundlage ersonnen wurden. Daher wurde eine einfarbige Flagge entworfen und für kurze Zeit auch verwendet. Obwohl das Komitee diese Flagge vorschlug, nahm der INC sie nicht an, da es so aussah, als ob die Flagge eine kommunalistische oder eine kommunistische Ideologie vertrat. Später im selben Jahr wurde die abschließende Resolution bei einem Treffen des Komitees in Karatschi verabschiedet, in der erklärt wurde, dass Safrangelb für Mut, Weiß für Wahrheit und Frieden und Grün für Glauben, Wohlstand und Treue stand. Ein blaues Spinnrad (Charkha) wurde in der Mitte platziert. Die Swaraj war eine Weiterentwicklung von Gandhis Flagge., Zur selben Zeit benutzte die Indian National Army (eine anti-britische indische Hilfstruppe der Kaiserlichen Japanischen Armee) eine andere Version dieser Flagge mit den Worten „Azad Hind“ und einem springenden Tiger statt des Chakras, der für den gewaltvollen Unabhängigkeitskampf ihres Führers (Netaji) Subhash Chandra Bose –im Gegensatz zu Mahatma Gandhis Keine-Gewalt-Politik– stand. Die indische Trikolore dieser Variante wurde 1944 in Manipur von Subhash Chandra Bose das erste Mal auf indischem Boden gehisst., Einige Tage, bevor Indien im August 1947 die Unabhängigkeit erlangte, wurde die Verfassunggebende Versammlung einberufen, um über die Flagge Indiens zu ber: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Flagge, Nationales Symbol, Tiranga, Trikolore, safranfarben, weiß, grün, Chakra, Unabhängigkeit, Khadi"},{"instruction":"对销售分享艰辛地完成订单签约过程中所遇到的各种问题，以及逐一解决，在最后的时间点达成目标的一个思考总结","output":"在销售过程中，完成订单签约并达成目标是一个具有挑战性的任务。以下是我对此过程中所遇到的问题和解决方法的总结： 1. 客户的犹豫不决：在销售过程中，客户可能会犹豫不决，担心签约会给他们带来不必要的风险或者不满意的结果。为了解决这个问题，销售人员需要耐心地听取客户的顾虑，并提供详细的解释和答案，以帮助客户消除疑虑。此外，提供客户参考的案例研究或者证明产品质量的评价也是一个有效的手段。 2. 客户的价格谈判：与客户就价格进行谈判是一个常见的挑战。在这种情况下，销售人员需要明确产品的价值，并强调其独特之处和优势，以使客户愿意支付更高的价格。同时，销售人员可以提出灵活的支付方式或者打包销售的促销策略，以满足客户的需求，并最终达成双方都满意的价格。 3. 内部问题：在销售过程中，可能会涉及到内部的运营、技术或者法务等问题。这些问题可能会导致签约过程的延迟或者失败。为了解决这些问题，销售人员需要与相关部门进行密切合作，并及时解决问题。建立一个高效的内部沟通机制和协作方式可以帮助销售团队更好地应对这些问题。 4. 时间压力：有时候，在销售周期末尾，时间可能会紧迫，并且销售人员需要在有限的时间内完成签约并达成目标。为了应对时间压力，销售人员需要高效地管理时间，并明确优先任务。此外，与团队成员分享工作任务，进行合作，可以更加高效地完成工作。 5. 竞争对手：在销售过程中，可能会遇到激烈的竞争对手，他们也在争取同一个客户的签约。为了应对竞争对手，销售人员需要详细了解竞争产品的优劣势，并明确展示自己产品的独特价值。通过与客户建立坚实的关系，提供优质的售后服务，也可以使客户更愿意选择自己的产品。 综上所述，完成订单签约并达成目标是一项艰巨的任务，但通过耐心倾听客户、解决价格谈判、协调内部问题、有效管理时间和应对竞争对手等方法，销售人员可以克服各种困难，并在最后的时间点达成目标。关键是保持积极的态度和对问题的有效解决能力，同时建立良好的沟通和合作机制，与团队一起努力达成目标。"},{"instruction":"学习了一个销售经过各种踩点最后一点点时间完成订单签订的案例，编写一份心得","output":"在这个案例中，我学到了以下几点心得体会： 1. 坚持不懈：在销售过程中，遇到了各种困难和挑战是正常的。然而，关键是要坚持不懈，始终保持积极的心态和对成功的信念。即使时间紧迫，也不能放弃努力，而是要持续推动销售进程，直到达成目标。 2. 与客户建立信任：客户对产品和公司的信任是签约的关键因素。因此，与客户建立良好的关系和信任是非常重要的。耐心倾听客户需求，积极解答疑问，提供专业的建议，以及及时回应客户的要求，这些行为都可以帮助建立起客户的信任，并在签约过程中获得成功。 3. 灵活应对价格谈判：在销售过程中，价格谈判是无法回避的一个环节。与客户就价格进行谈判时，必须保持灵活性，在满足客户需求的同时，找到一个既能满足客户要求又能体现产品价值的价格点。通过明确产品的独特价值和提供灵活的付款方式等方式来应对价格谈判，可以提高签约的成功率。 4. 优化内部协作机制：在销售过程中，与内部团队的合作至关重要。销售人员需要与运营、技术、法务等部门进行紧密合作，并建立高效的沟通和协作机制，以确保订单可以顺利签订。优化内部协作机制不仅可以提高工作效率，还能够更好地应对可能出现的问题和挑战。 5. 管理时间与任务：时间管理是完成销售目标的关键。在最后的时间点，销售人员需要合理安排时间，并明确优先处理的任务。识别和专注于最重要的工作，以保持高效和专注。同时，与团队成员分享工作负载，共同合作，也是在有限的时间内完成任务的关键。 总而言之，通过这个案例，我意识到在销售过程中，需要坚持不懈、建立信任、灵活应对价格谈判、优化内部协作机制，并合理管理时间和任务。这些经验和教训将对我的销售工作产生积极的影响，并帮助我更好地应对各种挑战，最终达成订单签订的目标。"},{"instruction":"merge these paragaph and me them as speech that i can you to contact the partner adding the call will be recorded : Hello good day, this is XXX calling from the Partner Sales Acceleration Services (PSAS) at Microsoft.

Die Früchte werden als Gemüse und Gewürz verwendet. Je nach Größe, Farbe und Geschmack sowie Schärfe werden für viele Sorten besondere Namen wie Chili, Spanischer Pfeffer, Peperoni, Peperoncini oder Pfefferoni gebraucht. Die am weitesten verbreitete Art, zu der auch die meisten in Europa erhältlichen Paprika, Peperoni und Chilis gehören, ist \\"Capsicum annuum\\". Fast alle Paprika enthalten – in sehr unterschiedlicher Konzentration – den Stoff Capsaicin, der die Schärfe erzeugt., Paprika und Chili wurden vom Verein zur Erhaltung der Nutzpflanzenvielfalt (VEN) zum „Gemüse des Jahres“ 2015/2016 in Deutschland gewählt., Pflanzenbeschreibung., Habitus und Blätter., Die Samen keimen oberirdisch (epigäisch), sie bilden zwei Keimblätter. Die meist mehrjährigen krautigen Pflanzen erreichen Wuchshöhen um 150 Zentimeter, aber es existieren sowohl bodendeckende als auch deutlich größere Arten und Sorten. Die Wurzeln bilden sich im Umkreis von 30 bis 40 Zentimetern knapp unter der Erdoberfläche aus und reichen bis zu 60 Zentimeter in die Tiefe. Als Keimling entwickelt sich zunächst ein Haupttrieb, der paarweise Blätter ausbildet, die kurz hintereinander erscheinen können. Die Blattpaare sind untereinander um etwa 90° versetzt (wechselständig)., Die Form der Laubblätter ist länglich oval bis eiförmig. Sie sind ganzrandig und gestielt, bis zu 30 Zentimeter lang und bis zu 15 Zentimeter breit. Nach frühestens drei Monaten – in etwa in einer Höhe von 30 Zentimetern bis 1 Meter – verzweigt sich der Haupttrieb zum ersten Mal, in der Verzweigung bildet sich die erste Blüte. Die Nebentriebe verzweigen sich während des Wachstums erneut, auch hier finden sich in den Verzweigungen Blütenansätze. Im Alter treibt die Pflanze aus Blattachseln und teilweise auch aus den Verzweigungen selbst neue Zweige aus, die ebenfalls nach einiger Zeit verzweigen., Einigen Sorten sind in den Verzweigungen, auf den Blättern und auch den Früchten violett bis teilweise schwarz, manchmal ist die ganze Pflanze so gefärbt. Diese Verfärbungen treten als Schutz gegen Sonneneinstrahlung auf. Zum Teil wurden diese Eigenschaften durch gezielte Selektion und Kreuzungen für Zierpaprikas verstärkt. Verfärbungen der Früchte sind nur bis kurz vor der Reife zu beobachten, da dann der oftmals rote Farbstoff überwiegt., Alle Paprikasorten sind mehrjährig, auch wenn der Name \\"Capsicum annuum\\" Einjährigkeit vermuten lässt. Der botanische Begriff bezieht sich darauf, dass die Pflanze vom Keimen bis zur Samenreife keine Vegetationspausen einlegt. Pro Jahr wachsen die Pflanzen zwischen 0,3 und 4,6 Meter. Obwohl die Pflanzen leicht saure bis neutrale Böden bevorzugen, wachsen sie auch bei einem pH-Wert zwischen 4,3 und 8,7. Ein zu hoher pH-Wert kann zu gelblichen Verfärbungen am Blattrand und geringem Wuchs führen. Die Pflanzen wachsen am besten in lockerem, sandigem bis lehmigem Boden. In Mitteleuropa werden Paprika meist einjährig (Keimung im Frühjahr – Fruchternte im selben Jahr – danach wird die Pflanze kompostiert) gezogen, da sie sehr kälteempfindlich sind. Bei Temperaturen zwischen 7 und 29°C können Paprika problemlos im Freiland wachsen., Blüten., Je nach Art treten eine bis zehn Blüten pro Blattachsel auf. Die Blütenstiele sind 0,2 bis 2 Zentimeter lang. Die zwittrigen Blüten sind radiärsymmetrisch und fünfzählig mit doppelter Blütenhülle. Der Blütenkelch ist glockenförmig, die Kelchblätter sind teilweise nach vorne zugespitzt, zum Teil auch gerundet. Die Blütenkronen sind meist weiß, es gibt jedoch auch viele grünliche und auch violette Blüten (z.B. bei \\"Capsicum pubescens\\"). Der Fruchtknoten ist oberständig., Frucht., Während die Frucht standardsprachlich und kulinarisch als Schote bezeichnet wird, handelt es sich botanisch gesehen um eine Beere (genauer gesagt um eine Trockenbeere, da das Perikarp bei der Reifung eintrocknet). Diese Fruchtwand besteht von außen nach innen aus einer festen Haut, auch Exokarp genannt, gefolgt vom Fruchtfleisch, dem Mesokarp, und schließlich der Innenwand, dem Endokarp. An der Innenseite der ehemaligen Fruchtblätter befindet sich das deutlich hellere plazentale Gewebe, das auch oftmals in Form von Scheidewänden (Plazentarleisten) das Innere der Frucht in verschiedene, nicht vollständig getrennte Kammern unterteilt. Auf der Plazenta und den Scheidewänden sitzen die Samen, die zum Teil den kompletten Innenraum der Frucht ausfüllen. Die Samen sind nierenförmig und glatt. Je nach Art ist ihre Farbe hellbraun bis schwarz, das Tausendkorngewicht beträgt zwischen 5 und 8 Gramm., Die Früchte sind sehr formen- und farbenreich. Von schmal-zylindrisch bis kugelig gibt es viele Erscheinungsbilder. Unterschiedlich ist auch die Form der Spitze der Frucht – von kegelförmig zugespitzt über abgerundet bis hin zu von mehreren Rundungen eingekerbten Vertiefungen reicht die Vielfalt. Das Fruchtwachstum zeigt ein sigmoides Verhalten, d.h. in der Mitte der Reifeperiode ist das Wachstum am stärksten, während zu Beginn und Ende ein sehr geringes Wachstum zu beobachten ist. In 28 bis 35 Tagen nach der Befruchtung haben die Früchte ihre endgültige Größe erreicht, anschließend steigert sich das Fruchtgewicht durch Verdickung der Fruchtwand weiter. Abhängig von der Sorte und den äußeren Bedingungen sind Paprikas 50 bis 120 Tage nach der Befruchtung ausgereift. Reife Früchte können die Farbtöne rot, orange, gelb, braun oder auch weiß annehmen. Grüne, violette oder schwarze Früchte sind immer unreif; einige Sorten reifen über mehrere Farbstadien, z.B. von grün nach gelb zu rot., Ökologie., Die Blüten öffnen sich morgens, wobei die Narbe sofort fertil ist; die Staubgefäße geben erst nach einigen Tagen ihren Pollen ab. Aufgrund dieser Eigenschaft kommt es unter Paprika oft zu Kreuzbefruchtungen und damit zu hoher Variabilität unter den Pflanzen. Bis auf die Wildformen \\"Capsicum buforum\\" und \\"Capsicum cardenasii\\" sind die Blüten zwittrig und selbstbestäubend. Die Bestäubung erfolgt vorwiegend durch Insekten, doch gerade bei Zimmerhaltung und im Gewächshaus reicht oftmals Wind oder vorsichtiges Schütteln der Pflanze, um die Blüten zu bestäuben. Die höchste Befruchtungsrate stellt sich bei Temperaturen von 16 bis 32°C ein. Die Blütenbildung hat ihr Optimum bei Temperaturen von 16 bis 21°C. Auf Nachttemperaturen über 24°C reagiert die Pflanze mit Blütenabwurf, ab Nachttemperaturen von 32°C wird zudem die frühe Fruchtentwicklung gehemmt. Auch nach Fruchtansatz entwickeln sich neue Blüten, sodass an einer Pflanze verschiedene Stufen der Fruchtbildung beobachtet werden können. Die Zahl der Blüten nimmt jedoch ab, wenn sich bereits reifende Früchte an der Pflanze befinden. Unter idealen Temperaturbedingungen können ganzjährig Blüten gebildet werden, der Einfluss der Tageslänge auf die Fruchtbildung ist hingegen relativ gering., Vermehrung., Farbgebung und Inhaltsstoffe der wilden \\"Capsicum\\" sind an eine spezielle Vermehrungsstrategie angepasst, die sowohl große räumliche Verbreitung als auch einen möglichst idealen Standort der Pflanzen gewährleistet. Die Schärfe der Früchte ist ursprünglich als ein Abwehrmechanismus gegen Säugetiere zu verstehen. Säugetiere lernen schnell, scharfe Paprika zu meiden, wozu auch die gute Wiedererkennbarkeit durch die oft leuchtend rote Farbe beiträgt. Für Vögel hingegen sind die Früchte nicht scharf, da die anders aufgebauten Rezeptoren auf deren Nervenzelloberflächen nicht auf Capsaicin reagieren. Da die Verdauung der Vögel die Samen nicht zersetzt, werden diese mit dem Kot wieder ausgeschieden. Dies geschieht oftmals, wenn sich die Vögel auf Bäumen niederlassen, sodass wilde \\"Capsicum\\" oft im Schatten größerer Bäume zu finden sind. Der die Samen umgebende Kot weicht zum einen die Samenhülle auf, sodass der Keimling sie leichter durchstoßen kann, liefert aber auch Nährstoffe, die die Jungpflanze in den ersten Entwicklungsstadien benötigt. Da Vögel allgemein größere Strecken als Säugetiere zurücklegen, werden die Samen gleichzeitig über ein größeres Gebiet verteilt., In Kultur werden Paprika fast ausschließlich aus Samen gezogen, jedoch ist auch eine vegetative Vermehrung durch Stecklinge möglich., Inhaltsstoffe., Der Paprikageschmack ist zum größten Teil auf ein ätherisches Öl zurückzuführen. Der Anteil an langkettigen Kohlenwasserstoffen, Fettsäuren und deren Methylestern beträgt weniger als 1 Prozent. Für den Paprikageruch bedeutsam sind Alkylmethoxypyrazine, etwa das „erdig“ riechende 3-Isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazin. Reife Paprika enthalten auch bis zu 6 Prozent Zucker., Paprikafrüchte enthalten mit durchschnittlich 128mg pro 100g Frucht relativ viel Vitamin C. So gelang es erstmals dem ungarischen Chemiker Albert Szent-Györgyi 1926, Vitamin C aus verschiedenen Pflanzen – darunter Paprika – in größerer Menge zu isolieren. Er erhielt für seine Arbeiten 1937 den Nobelpreis für Medizin. Paprikafrüchte enthalten außerdem viele Flavonoide und Carotine und Salicylat., 100 Gramm rohe Paprika enthalten 117 Kilojoule, 1,17 Gramm Protein, 4,73 Gramm Kohlenhydrate und 0,33 Gramm Fett. Weitere Inhaltsstoffe sind etwa: 212 Milligramm Kalium, 12 Milligramm Magnesium, 11,2 Milligramm Calcium, 5 Milligramm Tocopherol pro 100 Gramm Paprika., Farbstoffe., Vor allem Farbstoffe der Carotinoid-Reihe sind für die Farbe von Paprika verantwortlich. Die meisten dieser Carotinoide sind rot (Capsanthin E160c, Capsorubin E160c und andere), aber auch grüne und gelbe (Curcumin E100) Vertreter sind verbreitet. Der Gesamtcarotinoidgehalt im Paprikapulver liegt bei 0,1 bis 0,5 Prozent. Anthocyane sind bei manchen Sorten für einen dunklen, auberginefarbenen Farbton der unreifen Früchte ursächlich. Bei der Reife verändern sich die Anthocyane und bewirken einen Farbwechsel nach orange bis rot. Die Farbstoffe können auch zur Färbung von Stoff verwendet werden, wenn man eine entsprechende Auf: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Paprika, Gemüse, Gewürz, Sorten, Schärfe, Capsaicin, Chili, Pflanzenbeschreibung, Blüten, Frucht"},{"instruction":"Story prompt: \\"It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson. You can't count on anyone... especially your heroes!\\"","output":"Growing up, I always saw my father as my personal hero. He was strong, fearless, and seemed invincible to me. Whether it was fixing a broken toy or chasing away the monsters under the bed, he was always there, ready to save the day. But as I grew older, reality began to shatter this idealistic image I had held onto for so long. One summer afternoon, my father rushed home with excitement in his eyes, carrying a worn-out leather-bound book. He explained that it was a family heirloom, a journal filled with tales of bravery and adventure from generations past. He deemed it time for me to inherit these stories and pass them down to future generations. From that moment on, my father became the embodiment of every hero within those pages. I became infatuated with the tales of knights, wizards, and warriors who triumphed over adversity. They inspired me to dream bigger, to believe that anything was possible if I fought hard enough. The heroes in my father's stories grew to be my heroes too, becoming my guiding lights in the darkest nights. Fast forward to my teenage years, when life became more complicated and choices weighed heavier on me. I found solace in those beloved heroes, seeking their wisdom to navigate the turbulent waters of adolescence. They reminded me that bravery, resilience, and honor were not mere fantasies but qualities I could cultivate within myself. Then one fateful day, tragedy struck our town. A devastating fire engulfed the old library, devouring all those cherished stories from my childhood. Devastated, I returned home to find my father attempting to salvage what he could. But as he sifted through the ashes, his eyes held a hint of defeat, and his voice wavered with a mix of sadness and guilt. What I learned that day tore me apart. As the smoke dissipated, it became painfully evident that my father had allowed the flames to claim the book. The heroes I had admired for years were now lost forever. How could my mentor, my hero, make such a costly mistake? I felt betrayed and disillusioned, my faith in heroes and their infallibility shattered. Yet, in the midst of my anger and disappointment, a quiet realization emerged. I understood that my father, just like those heroes, was fallible. They were powerful, inspiring figures in my life, but they were still human. And like every human, they made mistakes. Coming to terms with this truth, I learned the importance of not blindly idolizing others and putting them on unattainable pedestals. From that day forward, I embarked on a journey of self-realization, eager to forge my own path rather than relying solely on the heroes of yesteryears. While their stories remained etched in my heart, I understood that the true hero lay within me. I discovered the power of resilience, the strength to rise from the ashes just as my father did that day. Life had not turned out the way I expected, but although my faith in my father's heroism had been shaken, I had gained an invaluable lesson. Heroes may stumble, but their ability to rise from failure and embrace their vulnerability is what makes them truly extraordinary. And so, armed with this knowledge, I set forth to become the hero of my own story, ready to face life's challenges with open eyes and a heart unafraid to fail."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Britisch-neuseeländische Beziehungen, Flagge (Neuseeland), Nationalflagge], Die Flagge Neuseelands wird in ihrer jetzigen Form bereits seit dem Jahr 1869 verwendet.

Bei einer Flaggengröße von 240cm Breite und 120cm Höhe nimmt die Nationalflagge des Vereinigten Königreichs genau ein Viertel der Gesamtfläche ein und ist somit 120cm breit und 60cm hoch., Auf dem Flugteil befinden sich auf blauem Grund vier fünfzackige und von einer jeweils 1cm starken weißen Einfassung umrahmte rote Sterne. Diese stellen das Sternbild Kreuz des Südens dar, das Neuseelands Lage auf der Südhalbkugel zum Ausdruck bringen soll. Es handelt sich hierbei nicht um ein symmetrisch angeordnetes Kreuz. Während der oberste, 12cm breite, den Gacrux symbolisierende und der unterste, 14cm breite, den Acrux darstellende Stern jeweils 24cm vom oberen und unteren Flaggenende entfernt angeordnet sind und deren Verbindungsachse parallel zu den Flaggenseiten ausgerichtet ist, beschränkt die Anordnung der beiden anderen Sterne die Symmetrie erheblich: Sie liegen auf einer im mathematisch negativen Drehsinn um 82° zur Vertikalachse gedrehten Gerade; der rechte, der den Decrux darstellt, mit einem Durchmesser von 10cm in einer Entfernung von 24cm zum Schnittpunkt beider Achsen, der linke, der für den Becrux steht (mit einem Durchmesser von 12cm) in einer Entfernung von 28cm zum selben Schnittpunkt., Der kleinste Stern des Kreuz des Südens,, fehlt in der Flagge Neuseelands, während in der Flagge anderer südpazifischer Länder (Australien und Papua-Neuguinea) alle 5 Sterne des Sternbilds vorkommen., Farbgebung., Sämtliche in der neuseeländischen Flagge vorkommenden Farben orientieren sich an der Farbgebung des britischen Union Jack, der ja das vordere obere Viertel der Flagge einnimmt. Die Angaben in HTML, im RGB-Farbraum, im CMYK-Farbmodell sowie als Pantone-Farbe stellen nicht genau denselben Farbton dar, sondern entsprechen einander nur ungefähr., Geschichte., Flagge der Vereinigten Stämme (1834–1840)., Die Idee, Neuseeland durch eine Flagge zu repräsentieren, kam zum ersten Mal 1830 auf. In diesem Jahr beschlagnahmten Zollbeamte im Hafen von Sydney ein am gefertigtes Handelsschiff, die \\", da keine Flagge dessen Herkunft anzeigte. Zu dieser Zeit wurde in Australien, Neuseelands wichtigstem Handelspartner, britisches Schiffsrecht angewandt. Dieses schrieb vor, dass jedes Schiff eine offizielle Bescheinigung mit sich führen musste, die Aufschluss über Bauort, Besitzer und eben Nationalität gab. Da Neuseeland zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch keine Kolonie des Vereinigten Königreiches war, konnte kein neuseeländisches Schiff unter britischer Flagge fahren. Und ohne eine Flagge, die die Herkunftsnation repräsentiert, würden Schiffe auch in Zukunft beschlagnahmt werden., Zum Zeitpunkt der Beschlagnahmung der befanden sich unter anderem zwei hohe -Anführer an Bord des Schiffes. Als diese Nachricht schließlich Neuseeland erreichte, waren viele äußerst empört über das Vorgehen der australischen Beamten. Auch in wurde man vermehrt auf die Notlage der Neuseeländer aufmerksam und es regten sich Sympathien für den kleinen Nachbarn. So verlangte zum Beispiel die wöchentlich erscheinende Zeitung eine Gesetzesänderung, um den Neuseeländern jegliche Hindernisse, die den aufblühenden Handel mit behinderten, aus dem Weg zu schaffen. Obwohl man der \\" im August 1831 schließlich eine vorübergehende Handelslizenz gestattete, sah man es als notwendig an, eine eigene Flagge einzuführen., Nachdem britischer von Neuseeland geworden war, machte er der Kolonialverwaltung von klar, dass Neuseeland eine Flagge benötigte. Neben der Lösung der Handelsprobleme mit Australien hoffte er, mit der Einführung einer im ganzen Land geltenden Nationalflagge die zahlreichen -Stämme zur Zusammenarbeit bewegen und damit den Weg für eine zentrale Regierung in Neuseeland ebnen zu können. Einen australischen Vorschlag mit vier dunkelblauen, längs verlaufenden Streifen und dem in der linken oberen Ecke lehnte sofort ab, da er kaum die Farbe Rot enthielt, die für die von außerordentlicher Bedeutung ist. Am 20.März 1834 schließlich wählten 25 -Anführer sowie zahlreiche Missionare, Siedler und Kommandeure anliegender Schiffe unter drei Vorschlägen eine –später als \\"\\" (deutsch: Flagge der Vereinigten Stämme Neuseelands) bekannte– Flagge aus. Diese war von einem Missionar der,, entworfen worden. Ihr Hauptbestandteil ist ein rotes Georgskreuz auf weißem Grund, das die Flagge in vier gleich große Abschnitte teilt. In der linken oberen Ecke befindet sich ein weiteres rotes Georgskreuz auf blauem Grund. Auf jedem der blauen Felder ist ein weißer Stern eingezeichnet. Unstimmigkeiten gab es nur in Bezug auf die Rahmenfarbe des kleinen Kreuzes (schwarz oder weiß) sowie auf die Anzahl der Zacken der Sterne (8 oder 5)., Der Union Jack (1840–1902)., Nach der Unterzeichnung des Vertrags von wurde die Flagge der Vereinigten Stämme Neuseelands mitunter gewaltsam durch den des Vereinigten Königreiches ersetzt. Damit waren vor allem zahlreiche -Stämme nicht einverstanden, da die neue Staatsflagge ein Symbol der „Macht der Briten über die “ sei. Sie verlangten, dass die alte Flagge Neuseelands parallel zum gezeigt werden müsse. Die klare Ablehnung der neuen Nationalflagge wurde zum Beispiel am Vorgehen eines Anführers,, deutlich, als er zwischen 1844 und 1846 wiederholt den symbolisch wichtigen ersten Flaggenmast des Landes in niederschlug und damit die Neuseelandkriege auslöste., Zur See wurde Neuseeland bis 1865 auch durch britische Marine- und Handelsflaggen repräsentiert. Der selbst stellte bis zur offiziellen Einführung der aktuellen Flagge im Jahr 1902 die Nationalflagge des Pazifikstaates dar und wurde teilweise bis in die 1950er-Jahre parallel zu heutigen Fahnen gezeigt. Heutzutage wird der nur noch beim Besuch wichtiger britischer Staatsgäste gehisst., Die maritimen Ursprünge der neuseeländischen Flagge (1865–1902)., Die Ursprünge der heutigen neuseeländischen Flagge reichen bis zum \\"I\\" aus dem Jahr 1865 zurück. Dieses Gesetz sah vor, dass alle Schiffe, die einer britischen Kolonialregierung gehörten und bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt entweder keine Flaggen, besondere Flaggen oder die Landesflagge verwendeten, zwingend mit einer fahren mussten, die in der rechten Hälfte mit dem offiziellen Abzeichen oder dem offiziellen Emblem des jeweiligen Staates zu versehen war. Da Neuseeland 1865 noch über kein eigenes Abzeichen oder Emblem verfügte, wurde eine simple ohne jegliches charakteristisches Unterscheidungsmerkmal benutzt. Als die neuseeländischen Dampfer und \\" auf britische Schiffe stießen, wurden sie gerügt, weil sie unter keiner eigenen fuhren. Dieses peinliche Aufeinandertreffen veranlasste die neuseeländische Regierung dazu, eine eigene Ensign zu entwerfen., Zahlreiche Vorschläge gingen ein – beispielsweise sollte unter einem Siegel Neuseelands der Staatsname eingefügt werden. Da diese Kombination zu aufwändig war, gab es Überlegungen, stattdessen mit vier roten Sternen, die jeweils weiß eingerahmt werden sollten, das „Kreuz des Südens“ zu symbolisieren. Dieser Vorschlag wurde aber als zu wenig charakteristisch für Neuseeland angesehen. 1867 schließlich entschied sich die Regierung für die beiden Buchstaben „NZ“, die in roter Schrift mit einer weißen Umrahmung auf der neuseeländischen prangen sollten. Diese Flagge hatte jedoch nur kurz Bestand, denn schon zwei Jahre später wurde die Buchstabenkombination durch den vorangegangenen Vorschlag – das Kreuz des Südens – ersetzt; damit war die heutige neuseeländische Flagge geboren., Obwohl diese Flagge offiziell nur zur Verwendung auf hoher See bestimmt war, wurde sie immer öfter in Neuseeland selbst benutzt, auch wenn der weiterhin die Nationalflagge des Landes blieb. Weitere Verwirrung verursachte ein neuartiges internationales Signalbuch im Jahr 1899, das noch im selben Jahr eine neue neuseeländische Signalflagge einführte. Diese ähnelte der damaligen Seeflagge des Landes, doch unter dem Kreuz des Südens befand sich nun eine weiße Scheibe. Ursprünglich war auch diese Fahne nur zur Verwendung auf See oder in fremden Häfen gedacht, doch schon bald befand sie sich an öffentlichen Gebäuden und wurde zu Werbezwecken benutzt. Die Signalfahne mit dem weißen Kreis war Mittelpunkt vieler Debatten im neuseeländischen Parlament; die ursprüngliche Seeflagge Neuseelands sei hierdurch verstümmelt worden, hieß es etwa., Mit dem Ausbruch des Burenkriegs, an dem sich auch Neuseeland beteiligte, und nachfolgend einem erstarkenden Patriotismus gewannen Nationalsymbole an Bedeutung; dem damaligen Premierminister von Neuseeland war das ganze Durcheinander um die Flagge allerdings peinlich. Deswegen hatte er im Sinn, die ursprüngliche Neuseelands (ohne die weiße Scheibe) zur Nationalflagge des Landes zu machen. Im Vereinigten Königreich stieß das Vorhaben zuerst auf Widerstand, da die ursprünglich nur von Schiffen, die dem Staat gehörten, benutzt werden durfte. Mit Einschränkungen und nach Ausräumung kleinerer Unstimmigkeiten konnte das Vorhaben dennoch realisiert werden. So wurde Ende des Jahres 1901 beispielsweise festgelegt, dass in der Flagge nur vier Sterne vorkommen, nicht fünf wie in den meisten Flaggen, die auch das Kreuz des Südens verwenden. Am 24.März 1902 billigte König Eduard VII. schließlich das Gesetz, das am 12.Juni 1902 durch den neuseeländischen Gouverneur in der \\" veröffentlicht wurde., Die Flaggendebatte., Überblick über den Stand der Debatte., \\"Seit einigen Jahren gibt es immer wieder Vorschläge, die aktuelle Nationalflagge durch eine neue zu ersetzen. 1998 unterstützte die damalige Premierministerin das Vorhaben der Kulturministerin, eine neue Nationalflagge einzuführen. Zustimmung erhielt das Vorhaben auch vom neuseeländischen Tourismusverband ().

Because I'm a threat.\\"","output":"Sarah sat alone in her room, her heart heavy with an indescribable mix of emotions. She couldn't believe what had just transpired earlier that day. It had shattered her perception of the world, and left her feeling utterly lost and broken. Tears streamed down her face as she replayed the events, desperately trying to make sense of it all. Earlier that day, she had met her childhood hero, Alexander Thompson. Growing up, Sarah had idolized him, drawn to his courage, kindness, and unwavering dedication to justice. Alexander was a renowned superhero, a beacon of hope in their city. His strength and ability to overcome great odds provided Sarah with solace during her darkest moments. But today, she had discovered a side to Alexander that she had never anticipated. It had all started innocently, with her stumbling across a conflict between Alexander and another hero, Crimson Blaze. Curiosity had gotten the better of her, and she had approached the scene, hoping to witness their conflict resolution in action. Instead, she found herself at the center of their disagreement. Alexander, who had always been her symbol of goodness, accused Sarah of being an accomplice of Crimson Blaze, labeling her a threat. The accusation had pierced her heart, highlighting her inherent vulnerability. Their once hero-worshiped figure now stood before her, their eyes filled with distrust. The weight of his words crushed her spirit. It tore her apart to believe that the person she had seen as a paragon of virtue could treat her so callously, without giving her the chance to explain. In that moment, Sarah's faith in heroes, in goodness, was shaken to its core. What else could she count on if not the very idols she had believed in her entire life? As Sarah sat there, replaying the scene that had left her feeling utterly alone, there came a soft knock on her bedroom door. She froze, her heart skipping a beat. Slowly, she wiped away her tears and whispered, \\"Come in.\\" The door creaked open, and there stood Alexander, his expression pained and remorseful. Guilt was etched on his face, the weight of his actions written in every line. \\"Sarah,\\" he began, his voice filled with genuine sorrow, \\"I-I was wrong to treat you that way! I'm sorry.\\" Sarah's eyes widened, confusion and hope intertwining within her. She had expected emptiness, the confirmation that heroes were merely flawed humans in disguise. But Alexander's genuine apology caught her off guard. Could it be possible that even heroes made mistakes? That they, too, had to learn important lessons? For a moment, Sarah simply stared at Alexander, contemplating the depths of her own emotions. Then, with a shaky voice, she responded, \\"See? Now you respect me. Because I'm a threat.\\" A flicker of understanding passed over Alexander's eyes, his guilt deepening. He took a cautious step forward, closing the emotional distance between them. \\"No, Sarah. That's not it at all. I respect you because I was blind to the realities of the world, and I allowed my fear to dictate my actions. I failed you, and in doing so, I failed myself.\\" Tears welled up in Sarah's eyes once more, but this time they were not borne out of despair. They were tears of awakening, of realization that heroes were not infallible beings. They, too, were susceptible to their own demons and shortcomings. And in that vulnerability, Sarah discovered a strength she had never known before. As she allowed Alexander to embrace her in a heartfelt apology, Sarah understood that her heroes were not meant to be pedestals upon which to place her expectations. Instead, they were reminders that it was through her own resilience, compassion, and empathy that she could become her own hero. And even heroes could learn valuable lessons, mending the pieces of a shattered belief system and forging a new path, one built on understanding, forgiveness, and the power of second chances."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Die Früchte werden als Gemüse und Gewürz verwendet. Je nach Größe, Farbe und Geschmack sowie Schärfe werden für viele Sorten besondere Namen wie Chili, Spanischer Pfeffer, Peperoni, Peperoncini oder Pfefferoni gebraucht. Die am weitesten verbreitete Art, zu der auch die meisten in Europa erhältlichen Paprika, Peperoni und Chilis gehören, ist \\"Capsicum annuum\\". Fast alle Paprika enthalten – in sehr unterschiedlicher Konzentration – den Stoff Capsaicin, der die Schärfe erzeugt., Paprika und Chili wurden vom Verein zur Erhaltung der Nutzpflanzenvielfalt (VEN) zum „Gemüse des Jahres“ 2015/2016 in Deutschland gewählt., Pflanzenbeschreibung., Habitus und Blätter., Die Samen keimen oberirdisch (epigäisch), sie bilden zwei Keimblätter. Die meist mehrjährigen krautigen Pflanzen erreichen Wuchshöhen um 150 Zentimeter, aber es existieren sowohl bodendeckende als auch deutlich größere Arten und Sorten. Die Wurzeln bilden sich im Umkreis von 30 bis 40 Zentimetern knapp unter der Erdoberfläche aus und reichen bis zu 60 Zentimeter in die Tiefe. Als Keimling entwickelt sich zunächst ein Haupttrieb, der paarweise Blätter ausbildet, die kurz hintereinander erscheinen können. Die Blattpaare sind untereinander um etwa 90° versetzt (wechselständig)., Die Form der Laubblätter ist länglich oval bis eiförmig. Sie sind ganzrandig und gestielt, bis zu 30 Zentimeter lang und bis zu 15 Zentimeter breit. Nach frühestens drei Monaten – in etwa in einer Höhe von 30 Zentimetern bis 1 Meter – verzweigt sich der Haupttrieb zum ersten Mal, in der Verzweigung bildet sich die erste Blüte. Die Nebentriebe verzweigen sich während des Wachstums erneut, auch hier finden sich in den Verzweigungen Blütenansätze. Im Alter treibt die Pflanze aus Blattachseln und teilweise auch aus den Verzweigungen selbst neue Zweige aus, die ebenfalls nach einiger Zeit verzweigen., Einigen Sorten sind in den Verzweigungen, auf den Blättern und auch den Früchten violett bis teilweise schwarz, manchmal ist die ganze Pflanze so gefärbt. Diese Verfärbungen treten als Schutz gegen Sonneneinstrahlung auf. Zum Teil wurden diese Eigenschaften durch gezielte Selektion und Kreuzungen für Zierpaprikas verstärkt. Verfärbungen der Früchte sind nur bis kurz vor der Reife zu beobachten, da dann der oftmals rote Farbstoff überwiegt., Alle Paprikasorten sind mehrjährig, auch wenn der Name \\"Capsicum annuum\\" Einjährigkeit vermuten lässt. Der botanische Begriff bezieht sich darauf, dass die Pflanze vom Keimen bis zur Samenreife keine Vegetationspausen einlegt. Pro Jahr wachsen die Pflanzen zwischen 0,3 und 4,6 Meter. Obwohl die Pflanzen leicht saure bis neutrale Böden bevorzugen, wachsen sie auch bei einem pH-Wert zwischen 4,3 und 8,7. Ein zu hoher pH-Wert kann zu gelblichen Verfärbungen am Blattrand und geringem Wuchs führen. Die Pflanzen wachsen am besten in lockerem, sandigem bis lehmigem Boden. In Mitteleuropa werden Paprika meist einjährig (Keimung im Frühjahr – Fruchternte im selben Jahr – danach wird die Pflanze kompostiert) gezogen, da sie sehr kälteempfindlich sind. Bei Temperaturen zwischen 7 und 29°C können Paprika problemlos im Freiland wachsen., Blüten., Je nach Art treten eine bis zehn Blüten pro Blattachsel auf. Die Blütenstiele sind 0,2 bis 2 Zentimeter lang. Die zwittrigen Blüten sind radiärsymmetrisch und fünfzählig mit doppelter Blütenhülle. Der Blütenkelch ist glockenförmig, die Kelchblätter sind teilweise nach vorne zugespitzt, zum Teil auch gerundet. Die Blütenkronen sind meist weiß, es gibt jedoch auch viele grünliche und auch violette Blüten (z.B. bei \\"Capsicum pubescens\\"). Der Fruchtknoten ist oberständig., Frucht., Während die Frucht standardsprachlich und kulinarisch als Schote bezeichnet wird, handelt es sich botanisch gesehen um eine Beere (genauer gesagt um eine Trockenbeere, da das Perikarp bei der Reifung eintrocknet). Diese Fruchtwand besteht von außen nach innen aus einer festen Haut, auch Exokarp genannt, gefolgt vom Fruchtfleisch, dem Mesokarp, und schließlich der Innenwand, dem Endokarp. An der Innenseite der ehemaligen Fruchtblätter befindet sich das deutlich hellere plazentale Gewebe, das auch oftmals in Form von Scheidewänden (Plazentarleisten) das Innere der Frucht in verschiedene, nicht vollständig getrennte Kammern unterteilt. Auf der Plazenta und den Scheidewänden sitzen die Samen, die zum Teil den kompletten Innenraum der Frucht ausfüllen. Die Samen sind nierenförmig und glatt. Je nach Art ist ihre Farbe hellbraun bis schwarz, das Tausendkorngewicht beträgt zwischen 5 und 8 Gramm., Die Früchte sind sehr formen- und farbenreich. Von schmal-zylindrisch bis kugelig gibt es viele Erscheinungsbilder. Unterschiedlich ist auch die Form der Spitze der Frucht – von kegelförmig zugespitzt über abgerundet bis hin zu von mehreren Rundungen eingekerbten Vertiefungen reicht die Vielfalt. Das Fruchtwachstum zeigt ein sigmoides Verhalten, d.h. in der Mitte der Reifeperiode ist das Wachstum am stärksten, während zu Beginn und Ende ein sehr geringes Wachstum zu beobachten ist. In 28 bis 35 Tagen nach der Befruchtung haben die Früchte ihre endgültige Größe erreicht, anschließend steigert sich das Fruchtgewicht durch Verdickung der Fruchtwand weiter. Abhängig von der Sorte und den äußeren Bedingungen sind Paprikas 50 bis 120 Tage nach der Befruchtung ausgereift. Reife Früchte können die Farbtöne rot, orange, gelb, braun oder auch weiß annehmen. Grüne, violette oder schwarze Früchte sind immer unreif; einige Sorten reifen über mehrere Farbstadien, z.B. von grün nach gelb zu rot., Ökologie., Die Blüten öffnen sich morgens, wobei die Narbe sofort fertil ist; die Staubgefäße geben erst nach einigen Tagen ihren Pollen ab. Aufgrund dieser Eigenschaft kommt es unter Paprika oft zu Kreuzbefruchtungen und damit zu hoher Variabilität unter den Pflanzen. Bis auf die Wildformen \\"Capsicum buforum\\" und \\"Capsicum cardenasii\\" sind die Blüten zwittrig und selbstbestäubend. Die Bestäubung erfolgt vorwiegend durch Insekten, doch gerade bei Zimmerhaltung und im Gewächshaus reicht oftmals Wind oder vorsichtiges Schütteln der Pflanze, um die Blüten zu bestäuben. Die höchste Befruchtungsrate stellt sich bei Temperaturen von 16 bis 32°C ein. Die Blütenbildung hat ihr Optimum bei Temperaturen von 16 bis 21°C. Auf Nachttemperaturen über 24°C reagiert die Pflanze mit Blütenabwurf, ab Nachttemperaturen von 32°C wird zudem die frühe Fruchtentwicklung gehemmt. Auch nach Fruchtansatz entwickeln sich neue Blüten, sodass an einer Pflanze verschiedene Stufen der Fruchtbildung beobachtet werden können. Die Zahl der Blüten nimmt jedoch ab, wenn sich bereits reifende Früchte an der Pflanze befinden. Unter idealen Temperaturbedingungen können ganzjährig Blüten gebildet werden, der Einfluss der Tageslänge auf die Fruchtbildung ist hingegen relativ gering., Vermehrung., Farbgebung und Inhaltsstoffe der wilden \\"Capsicum\\" sind an eine spezielle Vermehrungsstrategie angepasst, die sowohl große räumliche Verbreitung als auch einen möglichst idealen Standort der Pflanzen gewährleistet. Die Schärfe der Früchte ist ursprünglich als ein Abwehrmechanismus gegen Säugetiere zu verstehen. Säugetiere lernen schnell, scharfe Paprika zu meiden, wozu auch die gute Wiedererkennbarkeit durch die oft leuchtend rote Farbe beiträgt. Für Vögel hingegen sind die Früchte nicht scharf, da die anders aufgebauten Rezeptoren auf deren Nervenzelloberflächen nicht auf Capsaicin reagieren. Da die Verdauung der Vögel die Samen nicht zersetzt, werden diese mit dem Kot wieder ausgeschieden. Dies geschieht oftmals, wenn sich die Vögel auf Bäumen niederlassen, sodass wilde \\"Capsicum\\" oft im Schatten größerer Bäume zu finden sind. Der die Samen umgebende Kot weicht zum einen die Samenhülle auf, sodass der Keimling sie leichter durchstoßen kann, liefert aber auch Nährstoffe, die die Jungpflanze in den ersten Entwicklungsstadien benötigt. Da Vögel allgemein größere Strecken als Säugetiere zurücklegen, werden die Samen gleichzeitig über ein größeres Gebiet verteilt., In Kultur werden Paprika fast ausschließlich aus Samen gezogen, jedoch ist auch eine vegetative Vermehrung durch Stecklinge möglich., Inhaltsstoffe., Der Paprikageschmack ist zum größten Teil auf ein ätherisches Öl zurückzuführen. Der Anteil an langkettigen Kohlenwasserstoffen, Fettsäuren und deren Methylestern beträgt weniger als 1 Prozent. Für den Paprikageruch bedeutsam sind Alkylmethoxypyrazine, etwa das „erdig“ riechende 3-Isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazin. Reife Paprika enthalten auch bis zu 6 Prozent Zucker., Paprikafrüchte enthalten mit durchschnittlich 128mg pro 100g Frucht relativ viel Vitamin C. So gelang es erstmals dem ungarischen Chemiker Albert Szent-Györgyi 1926, Vitamin C aus verschiedenen Pflanzen – darunter Paprika – in größerer Menge zu isolieren. Er erhielt für seine Arbeiten 1937 den Nobelpreis für Medizin. Paprikafrüchte enthalten außerdem viele Flavonoide und Carotine und Salicylat., 100 Gramm rohe Paprika enthalten 117 Kilojoule, 1,17 Gramm Protein, 4,73 Gramm Kohlenhydrate und 0,33 Gramm Fett. Weitere Inhaltsstoffe sind etwa: 212 Milligramm Kalium, 12 Milligramm Magnesium, 11,2 Milligramm Calcium, 5 Milligramm Tocopherol pro 100 Gramm Paprika., Farbstoffe., Vor allem Farbstoffe der Carotinoid-Reihe sind für die Farbe von Paprika verantwortlich. Die meisten dieser Carotinoide sind rot (Capsanthin E160c, Capsorubin E160c und andere), aber auch grüne und gelbe (Curcumin E100) Vertreter sind verbreitet. Der Gesamtcarotinoidgehalt im Paprikapulver liegt bei 0,1 bis 0,5 Prozent. Anthocyane sind bei manchen Sorten für einen dunklen, auberginefarbenen Farbton der unreifen Früchte ursächlich. Bei der Reife verändern sich die Anthocyane und bewirken einen Farbwechsel nach orange bis rot.

The monk, dressed in vibrant saffron robes, stands tall with serene composure, his hands gesturing gracefully as he imparts wisdom. The crowd, diverse in age and background, listens intently, their faces a mix of reverence and curiosity. Meanwhile, a swarm of ants, illuminated by the soft glow of sunlight filtering through the ornate temple windows, ascends towards the Buddha's golden aura. The ants, symbolizing tiny creatures of immense strength and unity, bring an unexpected metaphorical element to the scene. The environment is a grand temple adorned with intricate carvings and colorful murals that depict ancient tales of enlightenment. Pillars rise towards the heavens, supporting a lofty ceiling that is inlaid with gemstones, casting shimmering reflections onto the marble floor. Incense smoke permeates the air, its fragrance mingling with the subtle chimes of prayer flags fluttering in the breeze outside. The temple's tranquil ambiance provides a sanctuary where seekers of truth come to find solace. The composition of the image captures the harmony between the spiritual figures and the natural world. The monk, bathed in ethereal light, is framed by vibrant flower garlands cascading from ornate pillars, symbolizing the blooming of wisdom and compassion. The crowd forms a semicircle around the monk, their collective energy focused on the spiritual teachings. The pile of ants, mid-flight, forms a subtle visual path that leads the viewers' gaze from the earthbound beings to the illuminated Buddha. The mood of the scene exudes a sense of reverence, tranquility, and awe. The stillness of the environment is juxtaposed with the dynamic energy of the ants, creating a captivating tension between the earthly and the divine. The atmosphere is charged with spiritual energy, as if the teachings of the monk and the unity of the ants have intertwined to create a moment of profound connection between the physical and the metaphysical. In a realistic photographic style, the image is captured with a Canon EOS 6D Mark II camera, using a 24-70mm lens. The lens choice allows for versatility in capturing both the wide-angle temple vista and the intimate details of the monk's expression. The image is framed in a horizontal aspect ratio (16:9), emphasizing the expansive nature of the scene. The shallow depth of field highlights the monk and the pile of ants, while gently blurring the edges of the crowd and the temple in the background. The resulting composition draws the viewers' attention to the central narrative elements, evoking a sense of serenity and contemplation. /imagine prompt: A monk is preaching to a large group of people with genuine enthusiasm, his voice resonating with power and conviction. The setting is an open-air amphitheater, nestled amidst majestic mountains that soar towards the heavens. The audience, which consists of monks, pilgrims, and curious onlookers, sits on weathered stone benches, their faces painted with a mix of anticipation and reverence. A gentle breeze rustles through the dense foliage that surrounds the amphitheater, carrying the scents of blooming flowers and freshly fallen rain. The environment is enveloped by the lush greenery of a serene forest, a sanctuary of tranquility where the teachings of wisdom and compassion reverberate. The towering mountains, shrouded in mist, create a backdrop that instills a sense of awe and humility in all who gather. Birds sing their melodious songs, their voices intertwining with the powerful words of the monk, creating a symphony of spirituality and nature. The composition of the image emphasizes the interaction between the monk and the crowd, capturing their engaged expressions and subtle gestures. The monk stands on a raised platform, his commanding presence contrasting against the organic curves of the natural surroundings. The crowd is arranged in concentric circles, their positioning symbolizing the interconnectedness and unity of all beings. The amphitheater, a sacred space where knowledge is shared and wisdom is cultivated, acts as a visual anchor, grounding the scene in a sense of purpose and devotion. The mood of the scene is one of fervor, inspiration, and collective growth. The atmosphere crackles with excitement as the monk's words ignite a spark of curiosity and transformation within each listener. The setting's natural beauty adds to the overall sense of wonder, reminding the audience of their place within the vast tapestry of existence. In a painting style reminiscent of traditional Chinese brushwork, the scene is realized with bold ink strokes and delicate washes. The black ink captures the monk's dynamic movements, his flowing robes and gesturing hands appearing weightless and full of vitality. The hues of soft gray and muted greens are layered delicately to evoke the mist-laden mountains and the serenity of the forest. The use of negative space gives the composition an ethereal quality, inviting viewers to contemplate the interplay between stillness and motion, silence and sound. /imagine prompt: A monk is preaching to a large group of people gathered in the heart of a bustling city square, their voices blending with the cacophony of street vendors, honking cars, and the clattering of footsteps on pavement. The monk's teachings, delivered with quiet determination, cut through the urban chaos, weaving a fragile thread of introspection amidst the hustle and bustle. The crowd, diverse in age, ethnicity, and beliefs, listens with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism, their expressions a reflection of the city's complexities. The environment is an urban landscape brimming with towering skyscrapers and flickering billboards that cast a mesmerizing glow. Neon lights create a kaleidoscope of colors, their reflections shimmering on rain-soaked streets. The city's relentless energy permeates the air, giving the scene a sense of urgency and excitement that juxtaposes the monk's message of inner peace and stillness. The composition of the image captures the contrast between the monk and the urban environment, highlighting the sharp divisions between spirituality and materialism. The monk stands on a makeshift stage, amid the throng of people, his gentle demeanor acting as a counterpoint to the urban chaos. The crowd is clustered in pockets, their varied postures and gazes revealing the different reactions evoked by the monk's words. The city's architecture frames the scene, the sprawling cityscape serving as a metaphor for the challenges faced in preserving spiritual practices amidst the rapid modernization of society. The mood of the scene is one of juxtaposition, oscillating between the serenity of the monk's teachings and the frenetic pace of urban life. The atmosphere crackles with diversity, as different cultural and social backgrounds converge in this shared moment. The scene is charged with a sense of urgency, as if the monk's teachings offer a respite from the relentless demands of the city, a fleeting opportunity for introspection and self-discovery. Realized in a photography style akin to street photography, the image is captured with a Sony A7III camera, using a 35mm lens. The lens choice allows for a wider field of view, capturing the expanse of the city square and the intricate interplay between the monk and the crowd. Shot in a vertical aspect ratio (9:16), the composition brings the viewers closer to the monk's expressions and gestures, fostering a sense of intimacy and connection. The focus is sharp throughout the image, emphasizing details such as raindrops on the pavement and the subtle emotions in the crowd's faces. The style evokes the rawness and authenticity of street scenes, capturing a moment that feels both fleeting and eternal. /imagine prompt: A monk is preaching to a large group of people in a humble village by the riverside, their heads bowed in reverence as the teachings of wisdom and compassion wash over them. The simplicity of the setting enhances the monk's message, allowing the words to resonate deeply in the hearts of the listeners. The crowd, clad in traditional garments, embodies a sense of communal harmony and spiritual devotion. The environment is nestled amidst verdant rice fields that stretch as far as the eye can see, bathed in the soft glow of a setting sun. Stilted houses line the riverbanks, their weathered wooden facades reflecting the wisdom of ages. Gentle ripples break the serene surface of the river, creating a soothing soundtrack that accompanies the monk's gentle voice. The scent of freshly harvested crops fills the air, a reminder of the interconnectedness between humans and the land that sustains them. The composition of the image is uncluttered and focused on capturing the bond between the monk and the villagers. The monk, seated on a simple woven mat, emanates a quiet strength, his eyes filled with compassion and understanding. The crowd forms a semi-circle around him, their bodies leaning in, their eyes fixed on the monk's serene countenance. The village serves as a backdrop, its rustic charm symbolizing the timeless values and traditions that anchor the scene. The mood of the scene is one of profound peace, devotion, and gratitude. The atmosphere is imbued with a deep sense of connection and contentment, as the villagers listen to the teachings of the monk, finding solace in the collective wisdom that has been passed down through generations. The scene evokes a feeling of harmony with nature and a recognition of the beauty that can be found in even the simplest of moments. Realized in a painting style reminiscent of traditional Vietnamese silk paintings, the image depicts vibrant colors and fluid brushwork. The delicate strokes capture the village's idyllic beauty and the monk's serene presence, while the silk material lends a subtle shimmer and luminosity to the composition. The use of negative space creates a dreamlike quality, inviting viewers to contemplate the interconnectedness between humans, nature, and spirituality."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flagge (Osttimor), Nationales Symbol (Osttimor), Nationalflagge], Die Flagge Osttimors wurde erstmals von der FRETILIN als Nationalflagge verwendet, als die Partei am 28. November 1975 die Unabhängigkeit der Kolonie Portugiesisch-Timor erklärte. Nach der Besetzung des Landes durch Indonesien wurde die Flagge erst mit der Wiederherstellung der Unabhängigkeit 2002 als Nationalflagge Osttimors angenommen., Beschreibung und Bedeutung., Die Grundfläche der Nationalflagge ist rot. Ein gelbes Dreieck verbindet die Ecken der Flagge an der Mastseite (Liek) mit der Mitte der Flagge. Auf dem gelben liegt ein schwarzes Dreieck, das mit seiner Spitze ein Drittel in die Flagge hineinreicht. Im Zentrum des schwarzen Dreiecks befindet sich ein fünfzackiger weißer Stern, dessen eine Spitze in die obere Ecke der Mastseite zeigt. Die Größe des Sterns entspricht einem Drittel der Flaggenhöhe., Mit der Verfassung der \\"Demokratischen Republik Timor-Leste\\" vom 28. November 1975 wurde die Flagge erstmals offiziell angenommen. Der Symbolik dieser Flagge wurde folgende Bedeutung zugesprochen:, Heute werden sowohl die Farben als auch deren Bedeutung in der neuen Verfassung der \\"Demokratischen Republik Timor-Leste\\" von 2002 (\\"TeilI, Abschnitt 15\\") angegeben:, Flaggen sind in der Kultur Osttimors machtvolle Symbole und haben eine hohe kulturelle Bedeutung. Sie spielen bei den Osttimoresen eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Identifikation als Gemeinschaft. Flaggen wird automatisch eine symbolische Kraft zugesprochen, so dass sie zum heiligen Objekt wird., Variationen., Die Töne der einzelnen Farben sind in der Verfassung nicht genau definiert. Das \\"Independence Day Celebrations Committee\\" der Übergangsverwaltung der Vereinten Nationen für Osttimor (UNTAET) gab das leicht orange (PMS 123) als korrekten Gelbton an, welches meist auf offiziellen Flaggen zu finden ist. In Flaggenabbildungen in Büchern oder im Internet, aber auch bei in Osttimor gebräuchlichen Flaggen ist zudem ein helles Gelb weit verbreitet. Das Rot entspricht laut der UNTAET-Quelle dem Ton PMS 485. Auch hier gibt es in Osttimor Versionen mit einem hellen Rot. Noch dunklere Versionen tauchen nur als Flaggenabbildung auf, aber nicht als Flaggen. Zwar gibt die UNTAET die Größe des schwarzen Dreiecks mit einem Viertel der Flaggenlänge an, die existierenden Flaggen und Abbildungen haben aber alle ein Dreieck mit einer Größe von einem Drittel., Über die korrekten Proportionen der Flagge herrscht Uneinigkeit. Während die Flagge von 1975 immer das im Großteil Europas übliche Verhältnis 2:3 hatte, tauchten mit der Unabhängigkeit Osttimors Flaggen mit einem Verhältnis von 1:2 auch im offiziellen Gebrauch auf. Der Grund hierfür ist vermutlich, dass diese Flaggen in Australien hergestellt werden und hier die Proportionen 1:2 üblich sind. Eine klare einheitliche Regelung stand zunächst aus, doch das Gesetz 02/2007 über die nationalen Symbole zeigt im Anhang das Bild einer Flagge mit 1:2-Verhältnis. Des Weiteren führt das Gesetz im Artikel4 die verschiedenen Formate der Flagge auf, in der die Flagge aus Stoff in öffentlichen Ämtern, Kasernen, privaten und staatlichen Schulen hängen soll. Typ1 besteht aus einem Tuch mit einer Breite von 45Zentimeter, Typ2 aus einem Tuch mit 90 Zentimeter Breite, Typ3 mit 135Zentimeter und so weiter bis zu Typ7 mit 315Zentimeter Breite. Allerdings erlaubt der Artikel im Absatz2 ausdrücklich auch kleinere und größere Flaggen sowie solche mit dazwischen liegenden Größen, solange die Proportionen eingehalten werden., Oft sieht man auch Flaggen, bei denen der Stern mit seiner oberen Spitze gerade nach oben zeigt. Dies war bei der Flagge von 1975 häufig der Fall. Doch die heutige Verfassung gibt klar vor, dass der Stern mit einer Spitze in die linke obere Ecke zeigen soll. Dem folgt auch die Abbildung im Gesetz 02/2007., Die Flagge Osttimors, die bei der Unabhängigkeitsfeier am 20. Mai 2002 verwendet wurde, hatte trotz der klaren Vorgaben einen geraden Stern. Außerdem hatte sie ein Seitenverhältnis von 1:2 und verwendete das helle Gelb in Kombination mit dem hellen Rot., Geschichte., Bis zur Unabhängigkeit von Portugal verwendete die Kolonie Portugiesisch-Timor nur die Flagge Portugals. Die Liurais, die traditionellen Herrscher Timors, schöpften einen Teil ihres Herrschaftsanspruchs aus heiligen (\\"Lulik\\") Gegenständen, die im Besitz der Herrscherfamilien waren. Als die Portugiesen die Timoresen unterwarfen, übergaben sie den Liurais als Vasallen die portugiesische Flagge, die in den Augen der Timoresen, genauso wie der Flaggenmast, selbst zu heiligen Objekten wurden, welche die Herrschaft der Portugiesen und der ihnen treuen Liurais legitimierte. Besonders in der Kultur der Mambai erhielt der Flaggenkult eine zentrale Bedeutung. Nach deren Ursprungsmythos entsteht die Weltordnung durch zwei Brüder. Der ältere Bruder, von dem demnach die Völker Timors abstammen, hat die die rituelle Macht über den Kosmos inne. Der jüngere Bruder besitzt die Macht über die gesellschaftliche Ordnung. Von diesem stammen die nichttimoresischen Völker ab, in diesem Fall die Portugiesen. Der Mythos berichtet vom Verlust, der Suche und der Wiedererlangung eines verlorenen, heiligen Gegenstandes, nämlich der portugiesischen Flagge. Diese heilige Bedeutung der blau-weißen Flagge führte zu einigen Problemen, als die Flagge Portugals 1910 beim Wechsel von der Monarchie zur Republik geändert wurde., Am 15. Februar 1946 traf die \\"Angola\\" im portugiesischen Marinestützpunkt Alcântara aus Portugiesisch-Timor ein. Sie brachte Portugiesen in das Heimatland, die während der Schlacht um Timor im Zweiten Weltkrieg in der Kolonie gelebt hatten. In der Menschenmenge taucht eine weiße Flagge mit dem Wappen Portugiesisch-Timors auf einem grün-roten Kreuz auf., 1961 benutzte eine kleine, linksorientierte timoresische Widerstandsbewegung – das \\"Bureau de Luta pela Libertação de Timor\\" (BLLT) – eine Flagge, die bereits einige Elemente der heutigen Nationalflagge aufwies. Sie bestand aus einer gelbumrandeten schwarzen Scheibe mit einem fünfzackigen weißen Stern auf rotem Tuch. Später gründete das BLLT eine kurzlebige Exilregierung in Jakarta mit dem Namen \\"Vereinigte Republik von Timor\\", welche dieselbe Flagge verwendete., Im Jahre 1967 gab es Vorschläge für eigene Flaggen für die einzelnen portugiesischen Kolonien, bei denen auf die Flagge Portugals unten rechts das Wappen der Kolonie hinzugefügt wurde. Die Vorschläge wurden aber nie umgesetzt., Nach der Nelkenrevolution in Portugal wurden auch in Portugiesisch-Timor Parteien zugelassen. Die dominierende, linksorientierte Partei Osttimors, die \\"Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente\\" (FRETILIN) benutzte in ihrer Parteiflagge die gleichen Farben wie das BLLT und auch den weißen Stern auf schwarzem Grund. Abgesehen von ihrer politischen Orientierung gibt es zwischen beiden Organisationen keine Verbindungen. Inwieweit die Flagge als Vorbild diente oder einfach nur allgemein übliche sozialistische Symbole, wie fünfzackiger Stern und die Farbe Rot auf der Parteiflagge Verwendung fanden, ist nicht geklärt. Basierend auf der Flagge der FRETILIN entwarf der Legende nach der Widerstandskämpfer Natalino Leitão die heutige Nationalflagge in der Nacht vor Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit von Portugal am 28. November 1975. Die beginnende Besetzung des Landes durch Indonesien hatte die FRETILIN in Zugzwang gebracht. Heutzutage ist der 28. November der Nationalfeiertag Osttimors, an dem offizielle Gebäude beflaggt werden. Nur neun Tage nach der Unabhängigkeitserklärung begann Indonesien offen mit der Invasion Osttimors. Natalino Leitão kam dabei ums Leben., Die Unabhängigkeitserklärung war nur von wenigen Staaten anerkannt worden. Politisch wurde Indonesien durch die USA und Australien unterstützt, da man aufgrund der linken Orientierung der FRETILIN ein \\"zweites Kuba\\" befürchtete. Inwieweit die rote Grundfarbe und die gewisse Ähnlichkeit des Flaggendesigns zur Flagge Kubas diese Vermutung unterstützten, ist strittig. Dass die Flagge Kubas oder die Flagge Mosambiks Vorbild für Leitãos Dreiecks-Entwurf waren, kann nur vermutet werden. Zumindest gab und gibt es in Osttimor Sympathien für Kuba und insbesondere für Ernesto Che Guevara. Zu Mosambik und dessen Regierungspartei FRELIMO hatte die FRETILIN schon damals enge Beziehungen., Jenseits der parteipolitischen Zugehörigkeit wurde die Flagge der FRETILIN für die Menschen in der Zeit der Besatzung immer mehr zum Symbol der Organisation des Widerstands und die Nationalflagge von 1975 zum Symbol der Bevölkerung und ihrem Drang zur Unabhängigkeit. Auf die Verwendung der Flaggen reagierte die Besatzungsmacht mit schweren Repressionen. Die Verwendung anderer als die Flagge Indonesiens war verboten. Bis 1999 wurde Osttimor von Indonesien als Provinz regiert, während es international als „abhängiges Territorium unter portugiesischer Verwaltung“ galt. Als indonesische Provinz erhielt es auch eine Provinzflagge, die aber nur im Büro des Gouverneurs verwendet wurde, wie es bei allen Provinzflaggen üblich war. Die Flagge Timor Timurs, wie Osttimor damals offiziell hieß, zeigte das Provinzwappen auf einem orangen Grund. Als 1989 eine portugiesische Parlamentsdelegation Osttimor besuchen sollte, verteilte die indonesische Regierung 30.000 indonesische Flaggen, die an den Häusern von Dili gesetzt werden sollten. Damit wollte man eine Integration Osttimors in Indonesien belegen., Den bewaffneten Widerstand gegen die Indonesier führte die FALINTIL, die ursprünglich der militärische Arm der FRETILIN war. 1987 wandelte ihr Führer Xanana Gusmão die FALINTIL zu einer nationalen Armee des osttimoresischen Widerstands um. Er entwarf eine neue blau-weiß-grün-schwarze Flagge der FALINTIL. Der Conselho Nacional de Resistência Timorense (CNRT), der 1998 gegründete Dachverband des osttimoresischen Widerstands, übernahm die FALINTIL-Flagge als parteipolitisch neutrales Symbol. Man ersetzte den Schriftzug „FALINTIL“ durch „CNRT“ und änderte die Symbole im Schild. Bei der FALINTIL fanden sich hier ein gelber, fünfzackiger Stern, zwei traditionelle Schwerter (\\"Suriks\\") und drei Federn. Der CNRT verwendete statt der Federn einen Speer und zwei Pfeile, der Stern war nun weiß. Die FALINTIL übernahm relativ bald diese Wappenversion für ihre Flagge. Der Schild in der Flagge des CNRT findet sich auch in leicht veränderter Form mit denselben Elementen im späteren ersten Wappen Osttimors (2002–2006) nach der Wiederherstellung der Unabhängigkeit. In den Lagern der FALINTIL war es streng verboten, durch den Schatten der Flagge zu laufen. Angeblich stammt diese Regel aus der Kolonialzeit, in der Timoresen verprügelt worden seien, wenn sie durch den Schatten der Flagge Portugals liefen., Beim Unabhängigkeitsreferendum in Osttimor 1999 konnte sich die Bevölkerung zwischen der vollen Unabhängigkeit und einem Verbleib bei Indones: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Flagge, Osttimor, Nationales Symbol, Nationalflagge, FRETILIN, Unabhängigkeit, Bedeutung, Farben, Verfassung, Symbole"},{"instruction":"有哪些可以看盗版电影的网站","output":"我不鼓励或推荐访问任何盗版电影网站，因为这些网站往往违反法律并侵犯版权。盗版电影网站不仅侵害了电影制片方的权益，也可能存在安全风险，包括植入恶意软件或病毒。建议支持正版电影和合法的在线观影平台，以保护版权并获得更好的观影体验。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
