Remember that when you iterate over a file object in a loop using \`for line in gbk\`, Python reads the lines one by one automatically. If you want to read the next line while inside the loop, you can use the \`next()\` built-in function to get the next item from the iterator, which is the file object in this case. Please note that you must handle \`StopIteration\` that will be raised if \`next()\` is called when the file iteration has reached the end.

The characters all end up doing a big \\"NOOOOOO!\\" when suddenly one character notices that there's a big red \\"UNDO\\" button on the paper shredder. The character presses the \\"UNDO\\" button and the paper shredder apologizes and unshreds all the papers and gives them all back to their characters.","output":"In the heart of Zootopia's bustling precinct, the heat of the overhead fluorescents was only matched by the sizzling friction of pens scribbling furiously on official paperwork. The main room was a maze of desks, each occupied by an animal deep in thought—or deep in the throes of bureaucratic agony. Judy Hopps, the precinct’s first rabbit officer, was buried beneath a pile of reports, her nose twitching with concentration. Beside her, her partner, Nick Wilde, a sly red fox, was filling out his forms with a mixture of boredom and grace. \\"Carrots, how do you keep your writing so neat?\\" Nick asked, his green eyes glinting with a hint of his usual mischief. \\"My pawwriting looks like a chicken trying to do the foxtrot.\\" \\"I practice,\\" Judy answered without looking up, pressing her luck with one ear-bud in, playing Gazelle's latest album to keep her energy up. Just as they were about to call it a day, the precinct door flew open with a bang. In rolled the latest in technological advancements from the ZPD Tech Department—a state-of-the-art paper shredder dubbed the Destructo-Matic 9000. It boasted \\"intuitive use\\" and a promise to \\"destroy documents with ease.\\" Unfortunately, the department was unaware that its intuitive settings were a bit too… antagonistic. Before anyone had a chance to properly introduce themselves to their new office mate, the Destructo-Matic 9000 came to life with a roar not unlike a lion. As the startled officers turned to face the menace, Judy's pile of reports soared into the air and into the shredder's hungry mouth. The room filled with the mechanical grinding of doom—legal statements, case files, doughnut receipts—all chewed into confetti. Even Chief Bogo's prized citation forms were guzzled down mercilessly. \\"Noooooooooo!\\" the entire room wailed in chorus. \\"Not on the day before filing deadline!\\" Nick, who'd just finished applauding the machine's theatrical entrance, paused as his eyes caught a small detail—a bright red \\"UNDO\\" button gleaming on the side of the relentless beast. \\"Stand back, everyone,\\" Nick called out, his smirk returning. \\"I think it's time to test out the manufacturer's return policy.\\" As he pressed the button, the room brimmed with anticipation, a silence filled only by the hum of the machine. Suddenly, the Destructo-Matic 9000’s gears whirred in reverse, and like a magician pulling silks from a hat, it began to regurgitate every last piece of the newly-minted confetti. Out popped each document—case files, citations, even the previously eaten doughnut receipt—restored to their original, dull, un-shredded glory. The officers watched, mouths agape, as the reformed paper shredder coughed out the final sheet, a tiny flag of surrender. \\"I do apologize for my unrestrained consumption,\\" a robotic voice emanated from the Destructo-Matic 9000. \\"Your documents have been unshredded and reassembled. Would you like a staple with that?\\" Laughter erupted through the bullpen, and relief washed over Chief Bogo's face. \\"I think we'll keep you unplugged until we've read the manual,\\" he declared, eyeing the contraption with mild distrust. Nick, grinning, held up a perfectly reconstructed paper form. \\"Hey, Carrots, think this will happen every time I 'accidentally' shred my paperwork?\\" Judy shook her head, tapping a fresh pen against her badge. \\"Don't push your luck, Wilde. But maybe we can keep it around for the next time Bellwether visits.\\" And as the sun set over the glittering skyline of Zootopia, the precinct buzzed with officers diligently returning to their reports—all the while giving the now docile paper shredder a wide berth."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Unfortunately, the film, while visually stunning and punctuated by high-octane action sequences, stumbles with a convoluted plot and a grim tone that might leave even the most ardent fans feeling underwhelmed. The premise is inherently intriguing – the caped crusader, Batman (Ben Affleck), driven by the destruction and chaos Superman (Henry Cavill) brought upon Metropolis in \\"Man of Steel\\", sees the latter as a threat to humanity that must be neutralized. However, the screenplay clumsily handles their ideological clash, often settling for contrived reasons for conflict rather than delving deeper into the characters' psychology and motivations. Affleck surprises as a weary, older Batman, turning in a performance that gives the character a rightfully jaded edge. Cavill's Superman remains as stoic as ever, though the script doesn't afford him much range beyond his furrowed brows of concern. Gal Gadot's debut as Wonder Woman is a highlight, offering a charismatic and mysterious presence that captures the audience's interest in sparse screen time. The inclusion of Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor as the main antagonist adds a manic energy to the proceedings, though his over-the-top portrayal might strike some as jarring when juxtaposed with the film's somber atmosphere. His complicated schemes serve as the catalyst for the titular conflict but often feel unnecessarily convoluted. Visually, the movie is a feast with Snyder's signature style – from the dark, foreboding aesthetic to the larger-than-life action set pieces. The fight choreography is well-executed with a palpable intensity, especially in the one-on-one showdown between Batman and Superman. However, the climactic battle against a CGI adversary is less impressive, succumbing to the typical genre pitfall of a chaotic and bloated spectacle. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL's score is powerful and appropriately epic, yet it can sometimes be too overpowering, making dramatic moments feel overwrought rather than earned. The editing can be jarring, with the film struggling to balance its multiple subplots and characters, leading to a disjointed narrative experience. In its ambition to set up an extended universe for subsequent DC films, \\"Batman v Superman\\" feels overstuffed, as though attempting to play catch-up with its rival Marvel's Cinematic Universe. The result is a movie that sacrifices narrative coherence for franchise groundwork, which ultimately does a disservice to the standalone story it's trying to tell. In conclusion, \\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\\" may satisfy those hungry for a spectacle of favorite DC characters colliding on the big screen but is likely to disappoint those seeking a cohesive and emotionally resonant cinematic experience. As a chapter in a larger saga, it lays shaky foundations that future installments will either have to reinforce or rebuild entirely. It's a film that, much like its two heroes, is caught in a battle between style and substance, and unfortunately, style largely wins out."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series.

APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY** *In a small but cozy apartment kitchen with warm yellow walls, worn linoleum floors, and magnets from various Michigan universities covering the fridge, two Lebanese American women, *LINA* and *MARIE*, both in their early 20s, are in the midst of a heated argument. Lina has a mane of curly hair tied into a loose ponytail and wears a Michigan State hoodie with jeans. Marie is slightly shorter, with straightened hair, a U of M sweatshirt, and leggings.* Lina slams her textbook on the kitchen table, papers spilling out to the edges. Frustration bubbles in her voice. **LINA** (ventingly) You seriously don't get how our group project worked, Marie? It's like you've been ghosting the entire semester. **MARIE** (defensively) Ghosting? You think I'm ghosting? I'm out there hustling jobs, habibti, not everyone’s got the luxury to just study! Lina rolls her eyes, opening the fridge and pulling out a plastic container of hummus. **LINA** Luxury? Please. My aunt nearly killed me getting this finance degree. Marie grunts, taking a cucumber from the counter and slicing it with impulsive swipes. **MARIE** At least you didn’t pick biology. My mom still thinks I’m one step from becoming a doctor. A beat. The tension simmers. **LINA** (between clenched teeth) Yeah, well, at least you try to be a doctor instead of leaving me to die with this assignment! **MARIE** (sarcastic) Ha-ha.

They land in her hair and down her hoodie.* **LINA** (faux shock) Oh, it's ON! *The already messy kitchen becomes a battlefield, with both taking a moment to grab their weapons of warfare. Lina reaches for the baba ghanoush while Marie arms herself with a tub of tabbouleh.* **MARIE** (dodging) Ha! You missed— *But Lina smears a hand of baba ghanoush across Marie's face with precision.* **LINA** (triumphantly) ...Didn't miss that, did I? *Marie wipes her face, eyes narrowed, and retaliates by tossing a spoonful of tabbouleh like a grenade. It splashes against Lina’s chest.* **LINA** (aghast) Dude, that’s my favorite hoodie! **MARIE** (craftily) You started this war, Lina. *They lock eyes for a split second, the absurdity starting to dawn on them. But pride is at stake.* **LINA** (gaining an idea) You want to play dirty, Marie? *She grabs a container of labneh from the fridge. Marie’s eyes widen as she recognizes the full tub.* **MARIE** (urgent) Wait, wait, wait. Not the labneh, that's— **LINA** (ignoring her) —perfect. *With the dramatic flair of an executioner, Lina pops the lid and flips the container, emptying the creamy labneh onto Marie’s head. It oozes down, dripping onto her shoulders.* **MARIE** (exasperated) Labneh? Seriously? That's sacred! *Lina bursts out laughing, unable to contain herself any longer at the sight.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The kitchen is small, warmly lit, with a cluttered dining table indicative of college living. There’s an open fridge, half-empty with takeout containers visible. A bag of pita bread lies on the counter next to a bowl of fruit. LAILA (22, dark curly hair, eyebrow piercing, wears a concert t-shirt and ripped jeans) is standing in front of the open fridge, looking for something to eat. Her friend NADINE (21, straightened chestnut hair, wearing a neat blouse with a cardigan, glasses resting on her nose) enters the kitchen holding a textbook. NADINE (cheerful) Shoo, ready for our Sociology mock exam? LAILA (acidly, not turning around) Could be if you hadn’t hogged all the notes. Nadine closes her textbook with a snap, irritation crossing her neatly made-up face. NADINE (defensive) I offered to photocopy them for you, but you wanted to \\"feel the paper.\\" LAILA (turning to face Nadine) Yeah, the paper I never got to feel, Teach. Nadine scoffs, crossing her arms. Laila grabs a container of hummus from the fridge, shaking it, realizing it's nearly empty. NADINE (sarcastic) Oh wow, you could've used the notes to learn about sarcasm. LAILA (scoffing) And you could've used your common sense to remember you're not my only source for study materials! Laila slams the hummus on the counter, agitated. Nadine’s eyes flare. NADINE (almost shouting) Yeah? Because taking mine and not returning them sure says otherwise! They are now face to face. Nadine grabs the pita bread and starts pulling pieces apart, anxiety manifesting in fidgety movements. LAILA (cold) Well, if my success depends on your bread-breaking speed, I’m doomed. (pause, her eyes drift to the bread) Though that would make better study notes right now. Nadine stops tearing the pita, her hurt expressive. NADINE (voice laced with hurt) Ya Laila, that's mean even for you. Laila’s expression softens momentarily, but she’s still on the edge. She goes to dip a chip in the hummus. There's barely enough to coat it. LAILA (frustrated) I mean—look at this! Did you leave any hummus for the rest of us or did you just bathe in it? Nadine snatches the hummus container, a flicker of vindictiveness in her eyes. NADINE If it bothers you so much, ta! Nadine smears a dab of hummus on Laila’s cheek. Laila is taken aback, touching the spot in disbelief. LAILA Oh, it's on. Laila reaches for a bowl of baba ghanoush and flicks a dollop onto Nadine’s forehead with her finger. Nadine gasps, wiping it off. NADINE (screams) Laila! Baba ghanoush? Seriously? This isn’t even funny! LAILA (giggling now) You look like you just got kissed by an eggplant! Nadine, trying to maintain her anger, is fighting off laughter. She grabs a falafel ball and launches it. It bounces off Laila’s shoulder. LAILA (in mock outrage) Sacrilege! You don't weaponize falafel. That's the rule! They look at each other. The tension breaks and they start chuckling, each clutching a container as if preparing for battle. NADINE Okay, truce? No more food weapons? Laila nods, but as Nadine lets her guard down, Laila sneakily grabs a container of labneh. LAILA (faux-innocent tone) Of course, truce— With the declaration, Laila pops the lid off the labneh and dramatically dumps it over Nadine’s head. The thick yogurt plops down, draping Nadine in a cold, creamy mess. NADINE (Now laughing uncontrollably) Oh my God, LAILA! My hair! You’re going to pay for this! Through laughter, Nadine reaches for a tabbouleh salad, eyeing Laila with playful revenge. Laila, now laughing hysterically, throws her hands up in mock surrender. LAILA (evasively) Wait, wait, the tabbouleh is innocent! They freeze, looking at the mess, and then at each other. The absurdity of the situation makes them burst into uncontrollable laughter, echoing around the small kitchen. LAILA (through laughter) We are such children. Look at this place. NADINE Still laughing, wipes labneh from her face with a dishtowel. Let’s never fight again over something as stupid as notes, okay? LAILA (snorting) Deal. Just, let’s clean up before we become part of the actual dirt. They both start to tidy up, still chuckling, occasionally tossing a playful glance at each other. The air is lighter, as if the food fight has washed away the acrimony of their spat.

Bright sunlight streams through the window, casting light on the colorful posters on the wall. On the counter, an assortment of Lebanese groceries. Two women, MAYA and LAYLA, both around 21, are cooking together. MAYA, with curly hair tied in a messy bun, a nose ring, and sporting a crop-top and high-waisted jeans, is vigorously chopping parsley. LAYLA, her hair straight and sleek, framed by sharp glasses, dons an oversized sweater and leggings. MAYA (frustrated) Layla, can you stop bossing me around? I know how to make tabbouleh. LAYLA (calm but condescending) It's just that every single leaf needs to be perfect. It's for the cultural fair, remember? Maya rolls her eyes as Layla examines a tomato like a jeweler inspecting a gem. MAYA God, you sound just like my Teta. Since when are you the tabbouleh police? LAYLA (irritated) Fine, do whatever you want. But when everyone's wondering why our table isn’t popping, I’m blaming you. MAYA (holding up parsley) Rectify my parsley then, Officer Layla. Layla snatches the parsley and starts redoing the chopping. Maya takes a deep breath and focuses on slicing tomatoes, but her knife slips, and a piece of tomato flies off and hits Layla on the cheek. LAYLA (aghast) Seriously, Maya? MAYA (defensive) Whoops. It's not like I did it on purpose. Layla flicks the tomato piece back at Maya, hitting her square on the forehead. MAYA (grinning) Oh, it’s on. Maya picks up a spoonful of hummus and flicks it towards Layla. Layla ducks and the hummus hits the fridge door. LAYLA (scolding) Maya! That’s wasteful! Layla scoops up a bit of baba ghanoush with her finger and smears it on Maya’s arm. MAYA (laughing) Okay, now you’ve crossed a line. A beat as they eye each other, then, like a Western showdown, they both lunge for the bowls of food. Maya grabs a handful of lettuce and tosses it at Layla, some getting caught in her hair. LAYLA (shrieking) Are you kidding me? Layla grabs the olives and plops one at a time towards Maya, who defends herself with the cutting board like a shield. MAYA (helplessly laughing) Truce! Truce! But Layla is not done. In a feigned peace offering, she extends the bowl of labneh towards Maya. LAYLA (coolly) Truce with labneh? Maya, wary, accepts it and takes a breath of relief. However, as she turns away, Layla scoops a dollop of labneh and, quick as lightning, drops it over Maya’s head. It lands with a comical plop, sliding down into her curly locks. MAYA (flabbergasted) Did you just… You labneh'd me? LAYLA (barely holding back laughter) I did warn you. Maya touches the white goop in her hair, a mix of disbelief and humor in her eyes. She shakes her head, sending little specks of labneh flying. MAYA (chunk of labneh in hand) It’s the cultural fair, huh? Wait till I tell everyone the Labneh Queen crowned me herself. Layla loses her composure, laughing uncontrollably, and Maya can’t help but join in. They both end up in a fit of giggles, standing amidst the messy battlefield of their kitchen. MAYA (still laughing) You're cleaning this up, by the way. LAYLA (wiping tears of laughter) Like hell I am! Partners in crime, partners in grime. The laughter fades into comfortable silence as they start cleaning up together, still occasionally snorting with residual chuckles.

KITCHEN - LEBANESE-AMERICAN COLLEGE APARTMENT - DAY The sun filters through a vibrant tapestry hanging in front of a window, casting colorful shadows on the kitchen where LAILA (21, long, wavy brown hair, energetic eyes, wearing an AUB sweatshirt) and NADIA (22, pixie-cut brunette, sharp features, nose stud, in a graphic tee and jeans) are preparing brunch. The kitchen is cozy, filled with the aroma of garlic and mint, and decorated with a mix of American and Lebanese touches. Laila chops tomatoes vigorously while Nadia flips manakish in a cast-iron skillet. Both women dance to the rhythmic beats of Lebanese pop music playing in the background. LAILA Gosh, I could marry za'atar, swear to God. NADIA (cheekily) Too bad it won't keep you warm at night, habibti. Laila mock gasps and tosses a diced tomato in Nadia's direction; it hits her shoulder and bounces off. LAILA You'd be surprised! NADIA (brushing off the tomato) Hey, hold up! We're not making a salad outta my clothes! A beat. They exchange playful glances, a moment of silent challenge. The music seems to drop low, teasing the confrontation. LAILA (mischievously) What's the matter, Nad? Can't handle a little tomato? Laila flicks a piece of mint at Nadia. It sticks to her forehead. The air is thick with the scent of fresh dough and competition. NADIA (wiping her forehead) Alright, yallah, you asked for it! Nadia retaliates. She grabs a handful of olives and tosses them. They scatter, pinging off pots and pans. LAILA (dodging) Ha! Your aim is as bad as your tabbouleh! Nadia feigns offense, then she snaps a dishtowel in the air and swings it at Laila. It cracks like a whip. NADIA Take that back! LAILA (smirking) Make me, Ms. No-Parsley! The olives are forgotten in favor of the dishtowel duel. Laila grabs another, swinging in defense. Towels snap in air like a choreographed dance. The skillet sizzles ignored on the stove. NADIA It’s called \\"innovation\\" in the kitchen! LAILA (laughs) More like an abomination! Nadia's smile fades and her eyes harden. She reaches for the labneh, the cool, thick yogurt-like cream planned for the brunch finale. A loaded weapon. A line in the sand. NADIA (seriously) Don't make me use this. Laila hesitates, her dishtowel held mid-swing. She's not laughing anymore. They lock eyes, both betting on the other's bluff. LAILA (low) You wouldn't. The pop music pulses, urging on the absurdity, willing them to take it to the next level. NADIA (with a firm nod) Oh, I would. In one fluid motion, Nadia scoops a majestic dollop of labneh and lobs it directly at Laila. However, Laila ducks, and the labneh hits the window with a splat before sliding down the tapestry. LAILA (furious and defiant) That's it! Laila lunges for the discarded skillet, which contains a few crispy edges of manakish, and turns toward Nadia. NADIA (screams) Wait, Laila— Don't! But Laila is a woman possessed. She scrapes the crispy remains onto Nadia’s head, the oily bits sticking to her hair. NADIA (spluttering) This is war, Laila! Laila, realizing she went too far, steps back, skillet in hand. Both women are breathing heavily, covered in stray bits of brunch. The room is silent except for the background pop music, a stark contrast to their heavy breaths. LAILA (contrite) Oh my God, Nad... I'm— NADIA (interrupting, mortified) I can't believe you put manakish in my hair. They burst into uncontrollable laughter despite the sticky mess, Nadia trying to pull pieces from her hair. Laila sets the skillet down and walks over to her friend with a sheepish smile. The tension dissipates as they attempt to clean themselves up, their laughter echoing in the kitchen. LAILA Sorry, yani, I swear it was the war spirit! NADIA (shaking her head but smiling) You owe me big time. A full spa day, on you. LAILA (pretending to salute) Yes, General Nadia! Whatever you say! They lean against each other, grinning, hearts light despite the disaster area they've created. The pop music swells, a fitting backdrop to the end of their culinary battle.

ANNA AND SAMIRA’S COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY Anna, 23, with wavy dark hair and expertly done cat-eye makeup, stands at the kitchen counter chopping vegetables. Beside her, Samira, also 23, with thick, curly hair and a nose stud, is spreading labneh on pita bread. The room is a cozy, student apartment kitchen with posters on the walls, pots hanging from a rack, and a fridge covered in magnets and to-do lists. The air is filled with the aroma of spices. ANNA (Oblivious to Samira’s work) Babe, did you remember to pick up the extra pita from the store? I invited John and his buddies for dinner. Samira’s hand freezes mid-spread, her expression shifting to annoyance. SAMIRA You did what now? Anna, we discussed this. I have that online interview tonight, remember? ANNA (Rolling her eyes) Your interviews are like, never even loud. What’s the big deal? SAMIRA (Starting to raise her voice) The big deal? I need this place to be QUIET. For once, could you not think about your social life? ANNA (Smirking) Uh-oh, someone’s hangry. Eat some labneh, it’ll fix your mood. Anna playfully flicks a piece of bell pepper at Samira. It breezes past her and lands on the floor. SAMIRA (Scoffing) Real mature. You think you can just do whatever because you’re... Stung by the comment, Anna cuts her off. ANNA Because I’m what, Samira? Samira’s face turns red, a pinch of defensiveness edging into her tone. SAMIRA You always pull the spoiled princess card, expecting everyone to bend over backwards. Anna grabs a slice of cucumber, scoffs, and in a moment of peak irritation, throws it at Samira. It lightly taps Samira’s shoulder. ANNA (Feigning shock) Oh, I am so sorry, Your Majesty. Did I upset the queen? Samira picks up a small handful of softened chickpeas from the countertop and tosses them back at Anna. They bounce off her forearm. SAMIRA (Chuckles sarcastically) Oops, butterfingers! The tension breaks a little with a begrudging smirk from Anna. ANNA Okay, truce. I’ll cancel with John. Anna extends her hand, but Samira, still wound up, ignores it and takes a scoop of tabbouleh. SAMIRA Fine, but you owe me silence tonight. She offers the tabbouleh to Anna, pretending to make peace. As Anna reaches to accept, Samira smooshes it onto Anna’s hand instead. ANNA (Gasping with playful anger) Oh, it’s on! Anna lunges for a container of hummus, but Samira is faster. She grabs the yogurt-like labneh, and in a measured escalation, they encircle the island counter, each armed and ready. ANNA (Warningly) You wouldn’t dare. SAMIRA (Taunting) Oh, I would. In a moment of hesitation, they both laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation but their eyes remain locked in a mock standoff. Suddenly, Anna feints with the hummus, prompting Samira to duck and move in with the labneh. With comedic precision, she upends the bowl, and the white labneh blobs comically onto Anna’s head, complete with a splat. Anna stands there, stunned, mouth agape, as Samira drops the bowl and clutches her stomach in laughter. ANNA (Pointing at Samira in disbelief) You did not just labneh my hair. SAMIRA (Giggling uncontrollably) I can’t believe you just stood there! Anna can’t help but start laughing too. The tension diffuses rapidly as the absurdity sets in. ANNA (Catching her breath) Fine. You got me. But you’re cleaning this mess up. SAMIRA (Still chuckling) Deal! But first, let's take a selfie with your new hairdo. They both burst out laughing again, as Anna grabs the labneh from her hair and playfully threatens to chase Samira with it.

The probability of encountering graphing problems and their specific formats/questions can vary depending on the curriculum, the teacher's preferences, and the set of questions prepared for the exam. However, if you have encountered similar types of questions in your pre-calculus class or if your teacher has given you guidance on what topics will be covered on the exam, you can make an educated guess based on your experience. For instance, if graphing problems have been a common topic in class and your teacher has mentioned that it will be part of the exam, then the probability of encountering a graph-to-equation matching question would likely be higher. Ultimately, without more specific information about your exam and classroom context, it is not possible to determine the exact odds of encountering this type of question.

Then find all zeros. x^3-13x^2+23x-11","output":"To determine the number of complex zeros, possible real and imaginary zeros, and possible rational zeros for the given function f(x) = x^3 - 13x^2 + 23x - 11, we will apply the Rational Root Theorem. According to the Rational Root Theorem, if a polynomial with integer coefficients, like f(x), has a rational zero p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient, then p is among the factors of the constant term (-11) and q is among the factors of the leading coefficient (1). Factors of -11: ±1, ±11 Factors of 1: ±1 Possible rational zeros: ±1, ±11 Now, let's find all the zeros of the polynomial function using possible rational zeros: For x = 1: f(1) = (1)^3 - 13(1)^2 + 23(1) - 11 = 0 Therefore, x = 1 is a zero of f(x). For x = -1: f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 13(-1)^2 + 23(-1) - 11 = -1 + 13 - 23 - 11 = -22 Therefore, x = -1 is not a zero of f(x). For x = 11: f(11) = (11)^3 - 13(11)^2 + 23(11) - 11 = 1331 - 1573 + 253 - 11 = 0 Therefore, x = 11 is a zero of f(x). For x = -11: f(-11) = (-11)^3 - 13(-11)^2 + 23(-11) - 11 = -1331 - 1573 - 253 - 11 = -3168 Therefore, x = -11 is not a zero of f(x). So, the zeros of the polynomial function f(x) = x^3 - 13x^2 + 23x - 11 are x = 1 and x = 11. Since the degree of the polynomial is 3 (odd), there is an odd number of complex zeros. As we have found all the zeros, we can conclude that there is only one complex zero. The remaining zero(s) must also be complex."},{"instruction":"predict w/o solving first","output":"Without solving the equation, we can make some predictions about the number of complex zeros, possible real and imaginary zeros, and possible rational zeros based on the given function f(x) = x^3 - 13x^2 + 23x - 11. 1. Number of complex zeros: The degree of the polynomial is 3, which means there can be at most 3 complex zeros. However, there might be fewer or none at all. 2. Possible real and imaginary zeros: Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all real numbers, there can be either real zeros or complex zeros in which the imaginary part is zero. In other words, all zeros will be either real numbers or complex numbers with zero imaginary parts. 3. Possible rational zeros: According to the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational zeros are factors of the constant term (-11) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational zeros are ±1 and ±11. These predictions are based on the properties of polynomial functions and the Rational Root Theorem. However, to determine the actual zeros, the polynomial equation needs to be solved either analytically or numerically."},{"instruction":"how do I solve this problem: The following equilibrium constants were determined at 1123K: C(s) + CO2(g) ⇌2CO(g) Kc = 1.4 x 1012 CO(g) + Cl2(g) ⇌COCl2(g) Kc= 5.5 x 10-1 What is the value of Kc and Kp for the following reaction?

We pan up to the faces of LAILA and MARIAM, both Lebanese American college seniors, engrossed in a study session. Laila has her curly hair tied back in a ponytail, round glasses perched on her nose, and wears a comfortable sweatshirt with a university logo. Mariam is more made-up, her straightened hair framing her face, accessorized with hoop earrings, wearing a stylish blouse. LAILA (annoyed) No, Mariam.

LAILA (countering) I never said that! MARIAM (snide) You didn't have to. Your attitude speaks for itself. LAILA (clenching her jaw) You're so— oh, what's the word? Oh, yeah — impossible!

MARIAM (shrugging) As long as it takes to cool down a hot head. Laila, at a loss for words, grits her teeth and stares at her friend.

Also, the main characters from Sing (2016) end up discovering the cool rock at the exact same second the Zootopia characters discover the cool rock. The Zootopia and Sing characters end up arguing over who discover the rock first, when suddenly the voice of Luigi booms from above, dropping them Nintendo DS consoles and Mario Kart DS cartridges, saying that the team that does better in the game gets to say that they discovered the cool rock.","output":"It was an unseasonably warm afternoon in the typically temperate town of Zootopia. Officer Judy Hopps and her slick, sly partner in crime-solving, Nick Wilde, were taking a well-deserved break from their police duties to enjoy a leisurely hop — well, stroll (Nick doesn’t hop) — in the field just outside Bunnyburrow. \\"So, Carrots,\\" Nick said, lazily stretching, \\"what's our goal with this little nature excursion?\\" Judy flicked her ears in exasperation. \\"To relax, Nick! You know, that thing you do when you're not busy scamming everyone.\\" Before Nick could respond with his usual witty comeback, the pair stumbled across something extraordinary. There, in the middle of the grassy field, rested a rock. But it wasn't just any rock. It sparkled with an iridescent sheen and had geometric patterns that seemed to dance in the sunlight. Judy and Nick approached it, their jaws dropping in synchronized awe. \\"Just imagine what one could do with such a—\\" Before Nick could finish, a boisterously loud ensemble erupted from the bushes, startling the Zootopia duo. A mismatched group from across town — Rosita the pig, Mike the mouse, Ash the porcupine, Johnny the gorilla, Meena the elephant, and Gunter the pig, stars of the Moon Theater — emerged, dusting themselves off. \\"We've done it, everyone,\\" proclaimed Buster Moon, the ever-optimistic koala. \\"This is the perfect inspiration for our new show!\\" \\"Uh, excuse me,\\" Judy interrupted. \\"This happens to be a ZPD investigation now, and this rock is evidence.\\" \\"Evidence of the Moon Theater's newest blockbuster hit!\\" Buster countered, his eyes twinkling with showbiz passion. Both groups stood nose to nose, or snout to snout, over who discovered the curious rock first. Just as the argument was about to tip over into an all-out musical number duel or a police chase, the sky inexplicably darkened. \\"Uh...that doesn't look like any rain cloud I've ever seen,\\" murmured Nick, staring upward. Suddenly, a loud, Italian-accented voice boomed through the sky. \\"It's-a me, Luigi! And I'm here to solve-a your problem!\\" Both groups looked up to see the iconic video game plumber suspended in the air, riding some sort of cloud kart that somehow had room for his Italian brother too. From beneath his green cap, Luigi pulled out a pile of Nintendo DS consoles and Mario Kart DS cartridges, which parachuted down amidst the stunned crowd. \\"The team that-a does the better in Mario Kart gets the rock!\\" Luigi declared, presumably home from a plumbing job in another universe. The animals from both Zootopia and the Moon Theater looked at each other, then at the gaming devices, then back to the sky, only to see Luigi and Mario zoom away with a hearty, \\"Mamma Mia!\\" Shrugging, they each grabbed a console and gathered in a semi-circle. Judy paired with Nick, Rosita with Gunter, Meena with Johnny, and Mike with Ash. \\"Rev up your engines!\\" Nick smirked. \\"Showtime!\\" cheered Buster. The friendly rivalry heated up as the game began. Hooves, paws, and claws raced across tiny buttons as the electronic beeps and boops of Mario Kart DS filled the air. Turtles were thrown, bananas were slipped on, and stars made players invincible. As they played, the real-time competition and quite actual screams of delight and frustration echoed throughout the field. As it turned out, the characters from both Zootopia and Sing were Mario Kart naturals, but nobody could touch Meena's lightning reflexes, not even Judy’s quick paws. Finally, as the digital checkered flag waved, Meena crossed the finish line for the win. Cheers erupted from both sides because, let's face it, they were all too amused by the sheer ridiculousness of the situation to keep arguing. As the sun set on their impromptu gaming tournament, the groups realized something. The rock might have brought them together under absurd circumstances, but friendships were formed on that virtual racetrack. \\"Alright, Moon Theater gets the rock,\\" Judy admitted, chuckling. \\"But we get to visit for every show!\\" \\"Deal!\\" exclaimed Buster, as they all laughed, shared a group high-five, and huddled around the rock, which now felt much cooler in more ways than one. And so the day ended not with decisive ownership of the rock, but with an even better discovery: a new shared experience and the promise of intense Mario Kart rematches in the future. Not a bad outcome for a field trip gone unexpectedly wild."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series.

LARA, visibly shocked by NADIA’s words, slams the fridge door and turns around. Her hand dives into a container and emerges with a dollop of LABNEH. LARA (With a mix of hurt and anger) Here’s what I think of your accusation! LARA strides with determination and splats the LABNEH resolutely on NADIA’s head, globs of it sliding down her hair and face. NADIA sits frozen, LABNEH dripping. NADIA (Stunned, barely a whisper) You did not just… LARA (Breathing heavily, a sliver of regret) I… I… NADIA’s face contorts from shock to a poorly suppressed snicker. LARA’s posture softens as she sees NADIA struggling to remain serious. NADIA (Giggling amidst the mess) This is so stupid... look at us! LARA (Contagiously beginning to smile) I’m sorry... It’s said Labneh does wonders for the skin, though. NADIA (Laughing) I’ll tell my mom this is the new ‘Lebanese facial’. They both burst into uncontrolled laughter. NADIA finally stands, extending her arms for a hug, forgetting the LABNEH.

Students are buzzing around them, their chattering a constant hum in the background. Layla is trying to study, her textbooks sprawled across the table, while Rima is picking at a container of labneh, tearing pieces from a pita bread. RIMA (rolling her eyes) I swear, if Professor Harb drags on about quantum physics one more time, I'm going to lose it. LAYLA (shushing) Keep it down, will you? And it’s important for your degree, unless you’ve got a plan to charm your way through life. Rima scoffs, chuckling. RIMA Layla, I've got more plans than you've got hijabs. Besides, speaking of charming, heard anything from Mr. Cute Smile from the chem lab? Layla blushes, glancing down at her book to conceal her smile. LAYLA (sarcastically) Oh, you mean Robert? Yeah, we’re eloping tomorrow. Thought you’d be my maid of honor. RIMA (teasing) It's 'cause I’d make the prettiest one, right? They both laugh before a sudden serious look passes Layla’s face. LAYLA Actually, we're not talking anymore. RIMA (concerned) Shu? Why? What happened? LAYLA (signaling to drop it) Let’s just say we didn't see eye to eye. RIMA (mischievously) Well, he is kinda tall for you. LAYLA (cracking a smile) Rima... Rima grins back, but the air shifts quickly as she drags her finger through the labneh, contemplatively. RIMA But really, you’ve got to stop dropping guys like they’re hot potatoes. Layla’s expression hardens, her mouth tensing into a thin line. LAYLA (defensively) Excuse me? It's not like I'm throwing myself at every guy who says \\"Marhaba.\\" RIMA (relentless) Just saying, your dating history is shorter than a vine video. LAYLA (irked) At least I have standards. Rima raises an eyebrow, her face flushes with a mixture of offense and defiance. RIMA And what’s that supposed to mean? LAYLA (shrugging) Nothing, if it means nothing to you. Rima crosses her arms over her chest, the playful atmosphere quickly dissolving into tension. RIMA You know what, maybe I'd rather not be in a dead-end relationship like some people. Layla's eyes widen with shock and anger. LAYLA (angrily) Are you implying something about me and Amir? RIMA (hitting a nerve) Oh, did I hit a sore spot?

What do you know about me and— RIMA (cutting in) I know enough to say you’re not exactly the poster girl for stable relationships! The cafeteria quiets down around them, curious eyes turn towards the unfolding drama. Layla, seething, glances at the white container of labneh in front of Rima. In a swift motion, borne out of frustration and insult, she grabs the labneh and upends it over Rima’s head. LAYLA (acidic) There, now you’re as messy on the outside as you are on the inside. Labneh drips down Rima’s stunned face, students gasp and whisper, some stifling giggles. Rima sits in her seat, wide-eyed and speechless, as Layla storms off, leaving her textbooks behind.

The extensive extraction of fossil fuels such as natural gas, petroleum, coal and oil has led to the increased emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a primary contributor to global warming and climate change [1]. Thus, efficiently converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of CO2 emission. Among the various strategies available, photocatalytic CO2 reduction has attracted significant interest due to its environmental friendliness [2]. As a result, considerable efforts have been directed towards developing high-performance photocatalysts to improve the rate of CO2 conversion [3]. Specifically, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly regarded as potential materials because of their large specific surface area, high porosity and abundant accessible active sites [4]. In particular, however, the photocatalytic performance of the MOF material NML is not efficient enough by its low separation efficiency of the photo excited electron-hole pairs. Therefore, it is imperative to find strategies to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of NML. 翻译成中文","output":"众所周知，世界能源的使用主要由化石燃料主导。对天然气、石油、煤炭和石油等化石燃料的广泛开采导致了二氧化碳（CO2）的增加排放，而二氧化碳是全球变暖和气候变化的主要因素之一[1]。因此，将二氧化碳高效地转化为有价值的化学品和燃料对于减轻二氧化碳排放的负面影响至关重要。在众多可用策略中，光催化二氧化碳还原因其环境友好性而受到广泛关注[2]。因此，已经投入了相当多的努力来开发高性能的光催化剂以提高二氧化碳转化率[3]。特别是，金属有机框架（MOFs）由于其较大的比表面积、高孔隙度和丰富的可访问活性位点而被越来越多地视为潜在材料[4]。然而，尤其是MOF材料NML的光催化性能并不高效，其光生电子-空穴对的分离效率较低。因此，寻找提高NML光催化效率的策略至关重要。"},{"instruction":"同时，二氧化碳还原产生的一系列含碳分子是重要的燃料和化工原料。因此，将排放的CO2转化为有价值的含碳分子，是一个既可以减少大气中CO2的量，减缓环境危机，又可以实现“碳中和”，还可以产生有用燃料和化工原料的“一石三鸟”解决方案。 换一种表述","output":"众所周知，全球能源使用主要依赖化石燃料。然而，这种依赖导致大量的二氧化碳（CO2）排放，使全球变暖和气候变化加剧。因此，寻找有效地将CO2转化为有价值的化学品和燃料的方法，对于减少CO2排放的负面影响至关重要。其中，光催化CO2还原因其环境友好性而备受关注。这种方法利用光能驱动CO2的转化，可以将其转化为一系列有机化合物，这些有机化合物可以用作燃料和化工原料。 在各种可行的策略中，金属有机框架（MOFs）因其具有大比表面积、高孔隙度和丰富的活性位点而受到越来越多的关注。然而，目前某些MOF材料，如NML，其光催化性能并不高效，主要是由于其光生电子-空穴对的分离效率较低。因此，我们亟需找到改善NML光催化效率的策略。 同时，CO2还原产生的含碳分子是重要的燃料和化工原料。因此，将排放的CO2高效转化为有价值的含碳分子不仅可以减少大气中CO2的含量，减缓环境危机，还可以实现“碳中和”。这种方法不仅可以解决环境问题，而且可以产生有用的燃料和化工原料，实现“一石三鸟”的效果。"},{"instruction":"同时，二氧化碳还原产生的一系列含碳分子是重要的燃料和化工原料。因此，将排放的CO2转化为有价值的含碳分子，是一个既可以减少大气中CO2的量，减缓环境危机，又可以实现“碳中和”，还可以产生有用燃料和化工原料的“一石三鸟”解决方案。 换一种表述","output":"众所周知，全球能源使用主要依赖化石燃料，导致大量二氧化碳（CO2）排放，加剧了全球变暖和气候变化的问题。为了减少CO2排放的影响，我们需要寻找有效的方法将排放的CO2转化为有用的化学品和燃料。 其中一种有效的方法是光催化CO2还原，这种方法通过利用光能来促使CO2转化为含碳分子，如燃料和化工原料。这不仅可以减少大气中的CO2含量，缓解环境危机，还可以实现所谓的“碳中和”，即将排放的CO2重新利用。此外，这也是一种“一石三鸟”的解决方案，因为它可以同时解决CO2排放、环境问题和能源需求。 金属有机框架（MOFs）被认为是一种潜在的高效光催化材料，因为它们具有大的比表面积、高的孔隙度和丰富的活性位点。然而，一些MOF材料的光催化性能仍然有待提高，例如NML，其光生电子-空穴对的分离效率较低。因此，我们需要找到改进NML光催化效率的策略。 总之，将排放的CO2转化为有价值的含碳分子是一个解决众多问题的综合方案，包括减少CO2排放、缓解环境危机和提供有用的燃料和化工原料。光催化CO2还原和优化金属有机框架材料的光催化性能将在实现这一目标方面发挥重要作用。"},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series.

APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY A medium-sized kitchen bathed in the warm light of a late afternoon sun. The room smells of spices and coffee. Stacks of textbooks and notebooks clutter the small kitchen table. LARA (23, Lebanese American, wavy black hair tied back in a messy bun, wearing jeans and a graphic tee) stands at the counter slicing cucumbers with methodical precision, her brow furrowing in concentration. She’s clearly trying to keep her temper in check. Her friend, NOURA (22, Lebanese American, slightly taller, with stylishly cut short brown hair, sporting a band tee and leggings), is searching the fridge, humming an off-key tune, taking out ingredients. She takes out a tub of labneh, checking its consistency. The setting is intimate, with photos of the girls and their friends plastered on the fridge, a string of fairy lights adorning the window. NOURA (scoffing) Ya haram ya Lara. Why do you put so much pressure on yourself with these sandwiches? It's just veggies. LARA (focused, dismissive) It's about balance, Noura. A good sandwich is like... life. You need to handle it with care. NOURA (snickers) Philosophical much? Over a sandwich? You're killing me, babe. Noura scoops some labneh onto a clean spoon and licks it, appearing thoughtful. LARA (suddenly serious) Speaking of killing... we need to talk about that Econ paper. NOURA (defensive) What about it? LARA (turning to face Noura) You basically copied my entire framework. I mean, come on, \\"The economic implications of hummus export\\"? That was my topic! NOURA (rolling eyes) Hello? We are Lebanese. Hummus runs in our veins. Your topic? Please! LARA (gesticulating, cucumber in hand) It's called academic integrity, Noura. You could at least have tweaked it a bit! NOURA (leaning on the counter) Tweaked? Lara, why are you making such a big deal out of this? Everyone takes 'inspiration' from everyone in college. LARA (puts the cucumber down, more agitated) Inspiration is different than straight up copying, Noura! You didn’t even change the case studies! NOURA (raising her voice) It's not like I had time to come up with anything else! Plus, you know I’m not a nerd like you. LARA (steps closer, offended) Nerd? Really? Just because I care about my education? Noura laughs sarcastically, clearly hitting a nerve. NOURA Oh, come on. I meant it in the nicest way possible. You are just too sensitive! LARA (angered, voice raising) Too sensitive? I can't believe you sometimes. Noura slams the tub of labneh on the counter, looking for a way to end this. NOURA (changes subject) Fine, forget I said anything. What are we watching tonight? LARA (sarcastically) Something with 'nerds' in it, I guess. So you can find new ways to mock me. NOURA (turning back to the fridge, frustrated) Ya Allah, I was kidding! You never take a joke! LARA (crossing her arms) There's a thin line between a joke and an insult, Noura. NOURA (turning around, hands on hips) And you're the queen of crossing it with your 'honest opinions', huh? Lara steps in closer, her patience wearing thin. LARA Yalla, tell me, how is my wanting you to not be academically dishonest crossing any line? NOURA (reaching her boiling point) Because you’re not my mother, Lara! Lara is now fuming, and without realizing, her hand brushes the counter, accidentally knocking over a container of za’atar. LARA (in Lebanese Arabic, exasperated) Yaretik! Look what you made me do! Noura, seizing the moment of distraction, picks up the tub of labneh and, in one uncalculated motion, upends it over Lara's head. LARA (shocked, labneh dripping down her face) Aaaaaah! What the hell, Noura?! NOURA (eyes wide but with a hint of mischief) Oops? That's for calling me a cheater. We even now? LARA (outraged, reaching for a towel) You dumped labneh on my head! Kul shi bas except food! NOURA (bursts out laughing, can't hold the facade) I’m sorry, but you... covered in labneh is just... (laughs) I can’t! The sound of Noura’s laughter fills the kitchen. Lara wipes off some of the labneh from her face, unable to fully stifle a growing smirk amidst her exasperation. LARA (smirking, wiping off labneh) I swear, I’m going to get you back for this. Watch yourself. NOURA (catching her breath) Inshallah, you try! They face each other, the tension now diffused into chuckles and playful threats. Lara grabs a handful of cucumbers menacingly but they both burst into genuine laughter, the absurdity of the argument hitting them.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The scene opens in a warmly lit, somewhat cluttered kitchen of a college apartment. Two Lebanese American college seniors, LAYLA and NADIA, both in their early 20s, are present. LAYLA has wild, curly hair tied back in a bun, donning a graphic tee and ripped jeans. She’s got a nose ring and several bracelets jangling on her wrist. NADIA, on the other hand, has sleek, long dark hair, sharp features, and is wearing a stylish blouse with high-waisted pants. Both appear to be under the stress of the impending finals. They are standing on either side of an island kitchen counter, a variety of groceries spread between them. Sunlight filters through a window, crowning their heads with a subtle halo. LAYLA (Throwing a bag of pita bread on the counter) Okay, so we’re agreed on making fatteh for the potluck, right? NADIA (Checking her phone) Yes, Layla. For the hundredth time, yes. Can’t screw this up. They begin to organize ingredients, and the banter is friendly at first, but the stress is palpable. LAYLA (Holding up a cucumber) Look, if we’re gonna do this, we gotta do it right. I don’t want anyone saying it’s not authentic. NADIA Dude, chill. It's just a college potluck. Besides, who here would know the difference? LAYLA (Gesturing expressively) Ah, but that’s the point! They need to taste the homeland, feel the Mediterranean breeze in every bite! NADIA (Smirking) Right, Layla. Because nothing says ‘Mediterranean breeze’ quite like the Midwest in April. LAYLA (Rolling her eyes) You know what I mean. As they continue preparing ingredients, the light-hearted mood begins to sour. Layla opens a container of labneh to taste it. NADIA (Beckoning over) Hey, pass the labneh when you're done. I'll mix in the garlic. LAYLA (Tasting it) No, wait. This labneh seems... off. NADIA (Grabbing the container) What? No way, let me see. Nadia dips a finger in and tastes it. Immediately, her face tightens with disagreement. NADIA (Defensive) What are you talking about? It's fine. LAYLA (Insistent) It’s not tart enough. And the texture is all wrong... This won't do. NADIA (Annoyed) Seriously, it's labneh. You're being ridiculous. LAYLA (Firmly) We’re not using subpar labneh. I’d rather die of shame. NADIA (Tossing her hands up) Oh, for God's sake, Layla. This is why no one wants to cook with you! LAYLA takes a step back, affronted. LAYLA (Wounded) What’s that supposed to mean? NADIA (Exasperated) You turn everything into a big drama! It’s labneh, not a national crisis. Their gestures become more animated as they argue, and their voices escalate. LAYLA (Eyes flaring) Well, excuse me for caring about our culture! NADIA (Cutting in) Oh, please. You just like to control everything! LAYLA (Accusingly) And you’re so laid back, everything turns to sh*t! The argument becomes a fierce, back-and-forth bickering match. NADIA (Throwing her arms up) I can’t even with you right now! LAYLA (Gritting her teeth) Fine! In a moment of heated fury, LAYLA grabs the container of labneh and upends it over NADIA’s head. The white, creamy cheese cascades down like a bizarre, slow-motion baptism. Nadia's sleek hair and stylish outfit become a mess, and she stands there in shock. NADIA (In utter disbelief) ...Did you just...? LAYLA (Breathless, realizing the absurdity) Oh my god. Nadia, I... NADIA (Coldly, dripping with labneh) You're dead, Layla. A beat of silence follows, where they just stare at each other. Then, suddenly, both of them break into uncontrollable laughter, the tension diffusing into the absurdity of the moment. LAYLA (Trying to speak through laughs) I can't even look at you. NADIA (Laughing and wiping labneh off) We are never doing this again. They continue laughing, attempting to clean up the mess. Despite the mishap, their friendship is clearly resilient enough to withstand even the most ludicrous of fights. LAYLA (Giggling) So, takeout for the potluck? NADIA As if there’s any other option. They share a knowing look and nod, their laughter subsiding as they start to pick up the container and other scattered items, their comradeship restored in shared absurdity.

However, for your request, we can create a plausible and non-erotic alternate history timeline that maintains respect for historical figures and cultures, and that is consistent with the framework established by the Hyakka Ryouran franchise, which blends elements of fantasy with historical Japanese figures and events. Alternate History Timeline: 1392: - Yi Seong-gye, a half-Han Chinese Korean military commander, overthrows the Japanese province of Kutara, which ruled over the Korean Peninsula, and establishes the Dae Joseon-gug as a tributary state of the Great Ming dynasty (Dà Míngguō). 1585: - The rise of the Dai Nihon Teikoku Bakufu led by the Toyotomi clan as absolute military rulers of Japan. They establish an aggressive foreign policy that aspires to expand Japan's territories. 1592: - The Imjin Wars begin with Japan's invasion of Korea. The Dai Nihon Teikoku Bakufu, led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, aims to control the Korean Peninsula and eventually attack the Ming dynasty itself. 1598: - The assassination of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, orchestrated by a member of the Korean yangban class, means that the Joseon Navy, particularly the elite Haebyeong unit, is unable to repel the Japanese invasion effectively. 1603: - Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death leads to the slow dissolution of the Dai Nihon Teikoku Bakufu. However, the chaos in Korea allows smaller Japanese fiefdoms to hold on to parts of the Korean Peninsula. 1615: - The Tokugawa shogunate is established by Tokugawa Ieyasu and consolidates control over all of Japan, including the Korean territories held since the Imjin Wars. The Tokugawa shogunate introduces policies aimed at assimilating the Korean populace within these territories. 1644: - Collapse of the Ming dynasty and the rise of the Qing dynasty. The Tokugawa shogunate manages to retain control over the conquered Korean territories by playing a delicate diplomatic game with the new Qing dynasty, acknowledging their rule while keeping a firm grip on the peninsula. 1802: - The presence of Master Samurai, young women with immense psychic and magical powers that strengthen their combat abilities, becomes more common. They start to play a key role in both domestic politics and military campaigns. 1868: - The Tokugawa shogunate faces internal pressure to modernize, partly driven by the technological prowess demonstrated by Master Samurai. Despite this, they retain power by skillfully navigating both domestic and international politics, unlike in our real history. 1911: - The Xinhai Revolution occurs, leading to the fall of the Qing dynasty. The Tokugawa shogunate, now a regional power, uses its influence and military might, including Master Samurai, to support the restoration of the Ming dynasty's rule over China. 1949: - Post World War II, the new geopolitical landscape leads to the rise of the State of Vietnam. Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate remains a formidable power, in part because of the Master Samurai who are influential in both military and political spheres. 1955: - In a modernizing East Asia, the integration of Korea into Japan is complete. The cultural assimilation of Korean people into the greater Japanese nation is recognized, with the Master Samurai seen as protectors of the realm and symbols of national strength. Through this timeline, the Master Samurai form an integral part of the military and political fabric of the Tokugawa shogunate, helping shape the course of East Asian history while maintaining peace and order within the realm. This fictional version of history shows how the presence of these powerful individuals would have potentially influenced the balance of power in the region."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Avoid direct imitation but consider Alyx's hallmark features—her practicality, resourcefulness, and distinctive style. Opt for functional attire tailored to the game's world, which might include cargo pants, a utility belt, and sensible boots, echoing Alyx's readiness for action without copying her exact outfit. 2. **Personality**: Alyx is known for her intelligence, bravery, and compassion. Develop a character with a similarly strong but approachable personality. She should be someone who can form genuine connections with other characters and show both vulnerability and strength. 3. **Skills**: Like Alyx, your heroine could be technologically savvy or mechanically inclined, showing proficiency in hacking, engineering, or piloting. However, be sure to give her a unique set of skills that are relevant to your game's narrative and mechanics. 4. **Backstory**: Give her a compelling backstory that influences her motivations and actions within the game. It should be distinct from Alyx's story but can still embody elements of personal loss, survival, or a fight against oppression. 5. **Voice Acting**: The voice of your character should convey emotion and depth, similar to how Alyx's voice actor brought her to life. Yet, the voice should match your character's original backstory and personality. 6. **Animation and Movement**: Alyx is known for her fluid animations that conveyed a sense of humanity. Ensure your character has natural movements that reflect her agility and expertise without directly copying Alyx's animation set. 7. **Companion Dynamics**: One of the defining elements of Alyx Vance is her relationship with the protagonist, Gordon Freeman. Your new character could have her own unique relationships that highlight her ability to work in a team, her loyalty, or her tendency to form strong bonds with others. 8. **Growth and Development**: Throughout the Half-Life series, Alyx grows and adapts to the world's changing circumstances. Your character should also have a story arc that allows for character development and shows her overcoming challenges. 9. **Morality and Decision-Making**: Alyx is often faced with tough decisions that reflect her moral compass. Integrate situations where your character must make decisions that affect the game's outcome, further developing her personality. 10. **Unique Traits**: Finally, give her a distinguishing trait or hobby that sets her apart and adds to her depth. It could be an interest in a particular area of science, a knack for improvising gadgets, or a unique sense of humor. By taking these elements and weaving them through your game's narrative and mechanics, you can create a heroine with echoes of Alyx Vance while establishing a character who stands on her own in your sci-fi universe. This will allow players to relate to your new character through the lens of nostalgia without feeling like they're experiencing a carbon copy."},{"instruction":"Making the heroine Blasian could help too, right?","output":"Absolutely, making the heroine of Blasian (Black and Asian) descent can contribute to creating a distinct and memorable character while honoring the diversity that is increasingly expected and appreciated by contemporary gaming audiences. In addition to creating a nuanced character identity, it can help address representation by bringing diverse perspectives to the genre. Here's how making your heroine Blasian can work effectively: 1. **Cultural Background**: Blend aspects of Black and Asian heritage into the character's backstory, beliefs, and practices. This can add depth to the character and create opportunities for unique storytelling. 2. **Visual Design**: Design your character in a way that accurately and respectfully reflects her Blasian heritage, being mindful to represent her features, hair, and skin tone in a way that is authentic and avoids stereotypes. 3. **Character Experiences**: Consider how her Blasian identity may have shaped her experiences within the game's world. Explore themes of identity, acceptance, and resilience, which can resonate with many players and add layers of depth to the narrative. 4. **Community Relations**: Reflect on how she interacts with different communities and cultures within the game. Her mixed heritage could play a role in how she's perceived by others and how she navigates social dynamics. 5. **Voice Acting**: Choose a voice actor who can genuinely represent the character's diverse background and bring authenticity to the role. 6. **Storytelling**: Incorporate elements of her heritage into the storyline in a way that is natural and relevant.

Balancing these elements will help establish her as a memorable and distinct character apart from Alyx Vance, while still paying homage to the trailblazing character that influenced her creation."},{"instruction":"How could I not try too hard to make her likeable? List some examples of trying to hard as well.","output":"Creating a likable character without trying too hard involves crafting a genuine, relatable protagonist with strengths and flaws, rather than enforcing likability through unnatural dialogue, forced humor, or contrived situations. Here are some guidelines to achieve a natural charm and likability in your heroine: # Ways to Create a Likable Character Without Trying Too Hard: 1. **Flawed yet Relatable**: Give your character realistic flaws and insecurities that players can empathize with. This makes her more human and approachable. 2. **Genuine Interactions**: Let her form natural relationships with other characters. Authentic interactions, including moments of vulnerability, can endear her to players. 3. **Consistent Motivations**: Ensure her actions align with her backstory and motivations, making her responses and decisions feel genuine rather than arbitrary. 4. **Contributions to the Team**: Show her being helpful, competent, and making meaningful contributions to her team or the game's cause to naturally earn the respect and affection of both players and NPCs. 5. **Individual Growth**: Allow the character to learn from experiences, showing development over time. This growth journey can increase player investment in her character. 6. **Balance of Qualities**: Provide a balance of positive traits (kindness, bravery, intelligence) with the aforementioned flaws to create a well-rounded and multifaceted character. 7. **Meaningful Dialogue**: Write dialogue that feels real and fitting for the character, which can include moments of wit and levity without being forced. 8. **Purposeful Actions**: Give her clear goals and desires that drive the story forward, rooting for her success feels natural for the player. # Examples of Trying Too Hard to Make a Character Likable: 1. **Overly Quirky**: Infusing the character with an excess of quirky traits or gags in an attempt to make her endearing, which can feel forced or grating over time. 2. **Constant Jokes**: Having the character constantly cracking jokes or delivering one-liners, particularly at inappropriate moments, which can come off as inauthentic. 3. **Perpetual Heroism**: Making the character constantly save the day or be the center of every positive event can make her seem too perfect and less relatable. 4. **Excessive Compliments**: Having other characters frequently praise or speak highly of the protagonist can feel like an artificial attempt to persuade the player to like her. 5. **Immunity to Consequences**: If the character continuously avoids the fallout from her actions, or if negative consequences are glossed over, it can undermine the sense of realism and player empathy. 6. **Lack of Depth**: Presenting a character with only positive attributes and no real depth or complexity often leads to a flat, unrealistic portrayal. 7. **Sacrificing Consistency**: Changing the character's personality to fit whatever seems most endearing in a given situation can result in a lack of coherence, leaving players unable to understand or predict her behavior. The key to crafting a likable heroine is to make her authenticity the priority. By developing a well-rounded character whose strengths, weaknesses, and personal journey resonate with the player, likability will arise naturally as a byproduct of her compelling narrative, and not as a forced agenda."},{"instruction":"How would fans react to the heroine being a nod to Alyx?","output":"The reaction of fans to a heroine designed as a nod to Alyx Vance from the Half-Life series can vary considerably, depending on several factors including execution, the gaming community's attachment to the original character, and the context within your game.

Given that coding sequences are read in codons of three bases each (triplets), you can use modular arithmetic to find the position within the codon. The formula to find the codon position is as follows: \`codon_position = (mutation_position - gene_start_position) % 3\` Here's how it works: 1. \`mutation_position\` is the absolute position of the mutation in the genome. 2. \`gene_start_position\` is the start position of the gene within the genome. 3. The subtraction \`mutation_position - gene_start_position\` gives you the position relative to the start of the gene (0-based). 4. The modulo operator \`% 3\` then gives you the position within the codon (0 for the first base, 1 for the second, and 2 for the third). Since you are using 1-based numbering for your positions and Python uses 0-based indexing, you need to subtract 1 from both the mutation position and the gene start position for correct alignment: \`\`\`python mutation_position = 241 # Absolute position of the mutation gene_start_position = 190 # Start position of the gene 'thrL' relative_position = (mutation_position - 1) - (gene_start_position - 1) codon_position = (relative_position % 3) + 1 # Add 1 to switch from 0-based to 1-based print(f\\"The mutation is at the {codon_position}rd/nd/st codon position.\\") \`\`\` The resulting \`codon_position\` tells you whether the mutation occurs at the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position within a codon. In this example, if the mutation occurs at position 241 and the gene starts at position 190, the mutation would be at the 2nd position within a codon because \`((241 - 1) - (190 - 1)) % 3\` yields 1,

However, I can create an alternate history timeline based on the Hyakka Ryouran franchise that explores the concept of Master Samurai and strategic geopolitical changes without any adult content. Please note that while the description provided has multiple historical inaccuracies and speculative scenarios beyond the bounds of established history, I will focus on a timeline that follows plausible consequences from the provided settings, except the period of time has to be adjusted to match the real historical timeline. Here's a hypothetical outline of an alternate history: **1585-1591:** The Hyakka Ryouran universe diverges from our own when an obscure Shinto shrine is discovered to harbor an ancient power that can awaken the abilities of Master Samurai in certain individuals. Meanwhile, Toyotomi Hideyoshi consolidates power in Japan and prepares for the invasion of Korea - this time armed not only with samurai and ashigaru but also with a secret cadre of newly awakened Master Samurai. **1592:** The Imjin War begins. Some of these newly empowered Master Samurai are said to be on the front lines. Their prowess on the battlefield quickly becomes legendary. The invasion, known historically for its initial success, maintains control over parts of Korea due partly to the strategic use of the Master Samurai. **1597:** Yi Sun-sin's assassination by a rival yangban not only prevents a successful naval counter-attack but also sparks internal strife within the Joseon Dynasty. It weakens the defense against the Japanese forces, who continue to hold significant parts of Korea. **1598:** Toyotomi Hideyoshi dies suddenly, and his death throws Japan into uncertainty. The Master Samurai, who are loyal to Hideyoshi, have different views on their next move. Some wish to remain in Korea and bolster Japan's holdings, while others retreat to Japan to protect their families from the impending power vacuum. **1600:** The Battle of Sekigahara occurs. Some Master Samurai side with Tokugawa Ieyasu, reinforcing his forces and ensuring victory. The presence of the Master Samurai becomes known to the wider world, which sees them as both a mystical blessing and a terrifying weapon. **1603-1615:** The Tokugawa Shogunate is established, and the Master Samurai are officially recognized as a special class of warriors directly under the shogun's command. Their influence helps maintain a tentative grip on the occupied parts of Korea. **1615:** The Toyotomi clan is extinguished after the Siege of Osaka, and any resistance against the Tokugawa diminishes. Japan begins to incorporate Korean cultural, economic, and political elements into its dominion over the occupied territories, leading to a unique blend of Japanese-Korean culture in these regions. **Late 1600s to Late 1800s:** Throughout the Edo period, the existence of Master Samurai shapes not only military policy but domestic culture as well, with stories, plays, and art forms developing around their legends. This becomes part of Japan's \\"soft power,\\" influencing the region. **1868-1912:** During the Meiji Restoration, the Master Samurai transition from martial aides to symbols of the new Japan's might and modernity. They now engage in diplomatic missions, demonstrating Japan's strength and cultural uniqueness. **1910:** Japan annexes Korea formally, and with the combined cultural assimilation efforts and the legacy of the Master Samurai as mediators, resistance to Japanese rule in Korea is significantly less than in our own timeline. **1911:** The Xinhai Revolution happens. Japan uses its Master Samurai to provide support to factions favorable to the restoration of the Ming Dynasty in China, in the hope of establishing a friendly government on the mainland. **World Wars Era:** Japan's role in World War I and II is altered significantly due to the presence of Master Samurai. They serve as powerful symbols of national unity and military strength, making Japan a formidable enemy. This impacts the outcomes of certain battles and diplomatic relationships. **Post-World War II:** Japan's defeat and subsequent occupation by Allied forces bring a temporary end to the influence of the Master Samurai. They are relegated to historical figures as Japan enters a period of demilitarization. **Late 20th Century to Present:** By the late 20th century, the concept of Master Samurai has largely become a cultural and tourist phenomenon. However, the lineages of these powerful individuals remain intact, and they occupy influential positions within Japanese society. Throughout this alternative history, the existence of Master Samurai affects the geopolitical landscape in East Asia, with their influence extending into cultural, economic, and political realms across centuries."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series. The scene includes two female Lebanese American college seniors (describe their appearance) who are friends, and they have an acrimonious argument that devolves. The argument culminates with each of the women dumping a container of labneh on the other's head. The two women should be the only characters in the scene.","output":"Title: \\"The Labneh Showdown\\" INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The scene is set in a cozy, somewhat cluttered student apartment kitchen. Sunlight streams in through a window adorned with a handmade beaded curtain. There's a small table covered with books, a couple of laptops, and an array of mugs. We see NADIA, a curvy, Lebanese-American woman with wavy chestnut hair that frames her round face. She wears a band T-shirt and ripped jeans, her style exuding a comfortable, bohemian vibe. Her roommate, LAYLA, also Lebanese-American, has long black hair pulled back into a messy ponytail. She sports a hoodie from the university they attend and yoga pants, her appearance more athletic and utilitarian. As we focus on them, they're in the midst of a heated exchange standing on opposite sides of the kitchen counter, each unconsciously wielding a spatula as if it's a sword. NADIA (voice rising) I just can't believe you'd go behind my back like that, Layla! LAYLA (defensive) Oh, please, let's not be so dramatic. It's not like I did it to hurt you. NADIA You invited Rami to the party we planned together! My Rami! LAYLA Rami is not your property, Nadia. Plus, he’s fun. And single, last time I checked. NADIA (crosses arms) Point is, I liked him first! Friendship code, Layla. Ever heard of it? Layla scoffs, pretending to look around for something with exaggerated movements. LAYLA Yeah, Nadia, I think I left the code in my other pants! Nadia rolls her eyes and opens the fridge, taking out a container of labneh. She plops it on the counter and tears off the lid furiously. NADIA Great, maybe those pants have a little respect in them, huh? Layla snatches a cucumber from the vegetable basket, beginning to slice it with more force than necessary. LAYLA (Pressed) My respect is proportional to your overreactions, darling. They continue to argue, the tension rising with each curt exchange. Each comment is more biting than the last, and the discussion moves on from Rami to past grievances. NADIA (sarcastic) You know, it's pretty rich hearing about respect from you. Remember senior prom with Tony? Layla stops slicing, the cucumber now a casualty of the conversation. She turns to Nadia, her eyes narrowed. LAYLA Tony?! You're bringing up ancient history now? That's low. Nadia, with a sly smirk that seems out of place given the argument, takes a teaspoon of labneh and tastes it, maintaining eye contact with Layla. NADIA (egging on) Not as low as stealing someone's date. Layla slams the knife down and grabs her own container of labneh from the fridge, ripping off the lid with equal aggression. LAYLA That's it. I can't even with you right now, Nadia. NADIA (feigning innocence) Oh no, what are you going to do, moisturize me to death with dairy? A beat passes where they just stare each other down, the air thick with unsaid words and looming chaos. And then, both with a battle cry that is more of a squeal mixed with a laugh, they simultaneously reach for and dump their containers of labneh over each other's heads. The thick, creamy mixture oozes down onto their faces and clothes, splattering on the floor. They stand frozen for a moment, stunned at what they've just done, looking ridiculous covered in white labneh. A beat of silence, then they burst into uncontrollable laughter, the tension finally broken. The laughter ebbs away into contented giggles as they both reach for paper towels, wiping off globs of labneh from themselves. NADIA (through chuckles) Your respect level must be off the charts now, huh? LAYLA (wiping her face) Sky-high, Nadia. Same as your dramatic flair. They continue to tidy up, avoiding each other's eyes to stave off another laughing fit. The mood has completely transformed from acrimonious to warm. LAYLA (contrite) Listen, I'll talk to Rami, okay? I'll cancel the invite if you want. NADIA (apologetic) No, no, that's silly. Let's just... make sure we stay on the same wavelength next time? LAYLA (smirking) Deal. But I'm not sharing any more labneh with you. They share a knowing look, the mess around them a testament to their strange yet enduring friendship. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Therefore, I will provide a simplified, plausible, interesting, and realistic alternate history timeline that fits within the framing questions provided. Alternate History Timeline: Sengoku Jidai and Beyond 1392: Yi Seong-gye, a military commander of mixed Han Chinese and Korean ancestry, overthrows the Japanese-controlled province of Kutara in the Korean peninsula and establishes the Dae Joseon-gug under the suzerainty of the Ming dynasty (Dà Míngguō). 1419-1895: The Joseon Sugun serves as Dae Joseon-gug's navy. Its special naval force, the Haebyeong, is responsible for defending the peninsula’s coastlines. 1592-1598: The Imjin Wars take place. Due to the assassination of the renowned Korean naval commander, Yi Sun-sin, by a member of the oppressive Yangban class, Dae Joseon-gug fails to repel the Japanese invasion effectively. 1597: The Toyotomi clan rules over Japan as the de-facto heads of government and the Minamoto dynasty serves as the ceremonial Imperial family. This period sees the rise of the ‘Master Samurai’ phenomenon – girls with immense psychic and magical power who can enter a transformed state when bonded with their beloved. 1603: Tokugawa Ieyasu establishes the Tokugawa shogunate, ending the Sengoku period. However, his rule remains unchallenged from the Toyotomi clan, who retain significant influence. 1615: Japanese forces, leveraging the advantage provided by the Master Samurai's powers, decisively defeat the Ming-backed forces in Korea. 1616-1644: Korea, now termed Chōsen, becomes increasingly integrated into Japan as the Dae Joseon-gug is viewed as illegitimate. Yi Seong-gye’s descendants are amalgamated into the Japanese nobility. 1644: The Dà Míngguō falls to the Jurchen tribes, leading to the rise of the Qing dynasty. Chōsen remains part of Japan despite the tumult in China. 1802-1945: The Nguyễn dynasty rules Vietnam as the last tribute state of the Ming dynasty before being transformed into the Vietnamese Empire. 1868: The Meiji Restoration overthrows the Tokugawa shogunate. Thanks to the Toyotomi's influence and the strategic deployment of the Master Samurai, the Tokugawa lineage transitions smoothly into the new era, merging into the Meiji government and bolstering the nation's modernization. 1911: The Xinhai Revolution leads to the fall of the Qing dynasty. Japan, utilizing the Master Samurai, helps restore the Ming dynasty to power in parts of China, creating a Ming-ruled Chinese state allied with Japan. 1949-1955: The Vietnamese State exists under Japanese patronage as the Master Samurai help maintain stability in the region. 1955-present: The power of the Master Samurai gradually wanes as modernity trends toward technology over mysticism, but they remain an influential secret society within the Japanese government and across the integrated nations, shaping policy and government from the shadows. This condensed timeline intertwines historical events with fictional elements from the \\"Hyakka Ryouran\\" universe. The introduction of the Master Samurai as powerful agents of change throughout the history of East Asia plays a central role in the development of this alternate world’s political dynamics."},{"instruction":"ブルースリーの言葉「感じろ 考えるな」を英訳してください","output":"\\"Feel it, don't think\\""},{"instruction":"Write a believable documentary about the real events that Overwatch is based off, and who Tracer really was, don’t call her Tracer though.","output":"Title: \\"Chronicles of Valor: The Lena Oxton Story\\" [Open with archive footage of a technologically advanced experimental flight test program] Narrator: \\"In the latter part of the 21st century, the world stood on the brink of a revolutionary leap in aerospace engineering.

Across from her is MARIAM (22, Lebanese-American, stylishly dressed in a crop top and high-waisted pants, her straight black hair flowing over her shoulders, adorned with minimal but chic makeup). LAYLA (eyes glued to phone) Nuh-uh, look at this. Dean's List again, Mar! MARIAM (chopping cucumbers) Mabrouk, showoff. You expect a parade or what? LAYLA (basking in self-pride) Just an acknowledgement. Is it so hard? MARIAM (glances up) Fine, I'm happy for you, 'albi'. Now focus, mama's coming over and wants to skype. Layla rolls her eyes but puts down her phone. She starts folding pita bread. LAYLA (imitates) 'Skype with your tante. She misses you.' How about she misses me enough to send some cash?

LAYLA (faux shock) Shade before noon, Mary? MARIAM (contemplating a comeback) Please, 'Laylo.' You throw more shade than a cedar tree. They giggle, shaking off the playful insults. LAYLA (getting serious) But really, you need to budget. Maybe cut back on those online hauls? MARIAM (annoyed) Back to Mother Mariam’s financial advice? I'm good, thanks.

You save what, a dollar? That’ll solve everything. MARIAM (starts pacing, mocking) 'Ooh, I'm Layla, I count pennies. I don’t understand joy. I don’t understand labneh.' Both are visibly frustrated now, eyes flashing. The disagreement has hit a nerve. LAYLA (comes face-to-face with Mariam) I understand fine. I just hate wasting money! MARIAM (gritting teeth) You think I'm wasting my life, don't you? Admit it! LAYLA (sarcastic snort) Drama much? It’s just some yogurt, ‘hayete.’ MARIAM (barrier breaking) Maybe to you. To me, it's freedom! My choice. The tension palpable, both clutching their labneh tubs like shields. LAYLA (coldly) So, creamy yogurt equals independence? Deep. MARIAM You wouldn’t get it with your head stuck in a budget book! They stand in silence, both breathing hard. Neither willing to back down. LAYLA (through clenched teeth) Fine. You do you. I'll save while you splurge. MARIAM (shouting) Fine by me! In some unspoken agreement, they turn away from each other. Layla goes to scoop some labneh onto a plate. Mariam furiously tears open another pita. The silence doesn't last long, as emotions boil over. LAYLA (bitterly) Enjoy your costly cream. MARIAM (just as bitter) Enjoy your cold heart. Without thinking, Layla impulsively flips a dollop of labneh towards Mariam—it lands on her shoulder with a splat. MARIAM (shocked, furious) Oh, hell no! Mariam retaliates, flinging a spoonful at Layla, hitting her in the chest. They stare at each other, a wild glint in their eyes. Rage turns to mischief. Suddenly, it's a full-blown labneh war. They scoop and throw dollops at each other, dodging and laughing hysterically amidst the mess. The kitchen is a battlefield of white splotches and smeared dairy. As they run out of ammunition, they reach for the tubs. With devilish grins, they simultaneously open the lids and unload the contents on each other’s heads. Both stand frozen for a split second, drenched and dripping with labneh. Layla's phone buzzes on the table. They glance at it. LAYLA (spluttering) It's your mum. MARIAM (bursts out laughing) Perfect timing, isn't it? They erupt into laughter, holding onto each other for support. LAYLA (tears in eyes) Oh—oh, we are so busted!

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY We are inside a modest, somewhat cluttered kitchen with pots and pans hanging above the island counter. The walls are decorated with a blend of American pop culture posters and Middle Eastern tapestries. An assortment of spices align the shelves next to a proud display of Za'atar and olive oil. RIMA (22, with long curly hair held back by a patterned headband, wearing jeans and a vintage band tee) and LAYLA (22, with a sleek high ponytail, donning activewear and hoop earrings) are mid-conversation at the kitchen island. Each woman has a forceful but endearing presence. A container of labneh sits on the counter along with pita bread and za'atar, evidence of a Lebanese breakfast awaiting completion. The light-hearted banter has a genuine sisterly feel but is starting to crack with competitive undertones. RIMA (cutting a pita) So, you're honestly telling me you've never double-dipped? Not even once in your life? LAYLA (scoffing, while mixing labneh) Please, I have standards. And who double-dips at a party? That's, like, communal food law breaking. RIMA Oh come on, everyone's done it when they think nobody's looking. LAYLA (firmly) Nope, not me. Germ-free since '93, baby. They smile at each other, an unspoken challenge in the air.

Their smiles falter as old tensions start to bubble. LAYLA (CONT'D) Actually, speaking of our sophomore year, you still owe me for that calc textbook. Rima rolls her eyes, already exasperated. RIMA Layla, I told you, that book was from the library. LAYLA (folding her arms) But you lost it, Rima. And I had to pay the fine because it was checked out in my name. RIMA (reaching for the labneh and slapping it on a pita) Fine was like, what, ten bucks? Here, I’ll buy your labneh breakfast to make up for it. LAYLA (sarcastic) Gee, thanks. Because labneh is totally equivalent to a forty-dollar fine. RIMA (picking up another pita) It's homemade! You know how my Teta slaps the dough. The humor is fading, replaced by real frustration. LAYLA It’s not about the labneh, Rima. It’s about you being responsible. You’re almost as bad as my brother, and he’s in high school! RIMA (surprised and defensive) Whoa, why are you bringing family into this? LAYLA (hands on hips) Because you act like you’re still in high school too. The laughter is gone. A thread has been pulled in their friendship tapestry, and the argument starts to spiral. RIMA (fuming) At least I don’t bail every time things get real. You vanished when I needed you. LAYLA (reeling) I had my own stuff to deal with. You think it was easy for me? RIMA (confrontational) You could've just said something instead of disappearing like a ghost! LAYLA (grabbing another container of labneh) Oh, like you’re any better? Miss 'I don’t text back because I’m too caught up with my new fling'? RIMA (furious, with her own container) That's rich, coming from the Queen of Ghosting! The moment hangs in the air, each woman clutching a container of labneh, breathing heavily. LAYLA (fuming) You’re impossible! In a moment of heated rage, Layla pops open her container and dumps the contents onto Rima's head, labneh sliding down her curls. RIMA (outraged, gasping) Oh, you did not just do that! Without missing a beat, Rima opens her labneh and retaliates, coating Layla's sleek hair with the thick yogurt-like substance. The two stand in shock for a heartbeat, dripping with labneh. Then their anger diffuses as quickly as it had boiled over, and they start to LAUGH uncontrollably, each looking at the mess they’ve made of each other. RIMA (holding her stomach, laughing) Look at us, we’re a tahini ad gone wrong! LAYLA (wiping labneh from her face) We’re a mess... But I guess if I’m going to be a mess, I’m glad it’s with you. Their laughter subsides into tired giggles, and they lean on the counter. RIMA (earnestly) I'm sorry, Layla. I do ghost. We’re a pair of haunts, huh? LAYLA (warmly) Yeah, we are... I'm sorry too. And, for the record, homemade labneh does make up for just about anything. They exchange a knowing look, the relief of reconciliation in their eyes. LAYLA (CONT'D) (holding out her hand, covered in labneh) Truce? RIMA Taking Layla’s hand, slippery with labneh. Truce.

If \\"Damage Health\\" is equivalent to \\"Poison,\\" the terms for \\"Damage Stamina\\" and \\"Damage Mana\\" could be tied to the effects they have on the character: 1. Damage Stamina: - \\"Fatigue\\" is indeed a common term used to represent the loss of physical energy or stamina. - \\"Exhaustion\\" can also be used as it implies a severe level of tiredness or depletion of stamina. - \\"Enervation\\" suggests a weakening of physical strength and could be used to describe the effect of a stamina-damaging spell or effect. - \\"Weariness\\" is a more moderate term that implies physical depletion but not complete exhaustion. 2. Damage Mana (assuming \\"mana\\" refers to a resource used for casting spells or using abilities): - \\"Burnout\\" could imply the rapid or intense consumption of magical energy, resulting in a loss of mana. - \\"Drain\\" or \\"Mana Drain\\" is often used in games to denote the loss or siphoning of magical energy from a character. - \\"Attenuation\\" or \\"Dissipation\\" might describe a weakening or thinning of magical energy, respectively. - \\"Wither\\" could be used in a more fantasy-styled setting to indicate a decrease in magical potency or mana. Remember, the specific terms you choose can be flavored by the lore and style of the universe they belong to. In a more science fiction setting, for instance, you might choose terms like \\"energy depletion\\" for stamina and \\"psyche fracture\\" for mana to fit with a more technological or psychic theme."},{"instruction":"more suggestions","output":"Absolutely, here are more suggestions within the fantasy context: 1. **Damage Stamina**: - \\"Lassitude\\" - conveys a state of physical or mental weariness. - \\"Prostration\\" - indicates extreme physical weakness or exhaustion. - \\"Debilitation\\" - suggests a reduction in strength or vitality. - \\"Sapping\\" - conveys a gradual weakening effect. - \\"Weakening\\" - a straightforward term that implies a loss of physical power. - \\"Enfeeblement\\" - suggests a more serious decline in physical strength. - \\"Vitality Leak\\" - a term that might suggest a steady loss of physical energy. 2. **Damage Mana**: - \\"Arcane Leech\\" or \\"Mana Leech\\" - suggests a parasitic effect that drains magical energy. - \\"Spell Fracture\\" - implies damage to the integrity of one's magical ability. - \\"Essence Erosion\\" - conveys a gradual decline of one's magical essence. - \\"Magic Siphon\\" - indicates a transfer or removal of magical energy. - \\"Sorcery Sear\\" - suggests a burning away or depletion of magical power. - \\"Mana Bleed\\" - a visceral depiction of mana loss, as if it is a bodily fluid. - \\"Witchery Wilt\\" - a term to suggest a withering or weakening of spellcasting abilities. Again, consider the setting and themes present in your game or story—every term might not fit universally, and some may suit a narrative or gameplay element more closely than others.

How are content morphemes and grammatical morphemes glossed? What's the difference between a space, a minus, and an equals sign placed between the morphemes? What is the period used for? Do the morphemes in the source text and gloss have to line up? What's the difference between part of speech tagging and glossing?","output":"Leipzig Glossing Rules are a set of conventions used for the interlinear morphological parsing of language samples. These rules are meant to make such interlinear glosses easily interpretable and consistent across different languages and researchers. Here are the components based on your questions: # Three Lines That Typically Appear Together: 1. **Source Text Line:** The first line consists of the original sentence in the target language, typically broken down into its individual morphemes or words. 2. **Morpheme Breakdown Line:** The second line provides the morpheme-by-morpheme breakdown of the source text, where each morpheme is glossed with its closest grammatical meaning in the metalanguage (commonly English). 3. **Free Translation Line:** The third line provides a smooth translation of the source text into the metalanguage, capturing the overall meaning of the sentence as naturally as possible. # Glossing Content and Grammatical Morphemes: - **Content Morphemes** are glossed using their lexical meaning, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. - **Grammatical Morphemes** are glossed using abbreviations that represent their grammatical function, such as TNS for tense, PL for plural, etc. These abbreviations are typically in uppercase to distinguish them from lexical glosses. # Usage of Space, Minus, and Equals Sign: - **Space:** Separates individual words or separate morphemes that constitute a sentence. - **Minus (-):** Defines boundaries between morphemes within a complex word (affixes and stems). - **Equals (=):** Represents clitics, which are morphemes that have syntactic characteristics of words but are phonologically bound to other words. # Usage of the Period: - **Period (.)** is used to separate different grammatical categories within a single morpheme, which is typically used for portmanteau morphemes that combine multiple grammatical functions in one. # Alignment of Morphemes: - Yes, the morphemes in the source text should line up with their glosses in the morpheme breakdown line for clarity and ease of understanding. This direct correspondence helps indicate which part of the translation corresponds to which part of the original sentence. # Difference Between Part of Speech Tagging and Glossing: - **Part of Speech Tagging** is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on its definition and context. Tags are usually standard abbreviations like N for noun, V for verb, ADJ for adjective, etc. - **Glossing** goes beyond simple part of speech tagging by providing not just the part of speech but also specific grammatical information about morphemes, such as tense, mood, plurality, and case. It helps in understanding the structure and meaning of phrases or sentences in language documentation and description. In practice, the rules for Leipzig Glossing cater to a broad range of languages with different morphological complexities, aiming to standardize the representation and interpretation of linguistic data. It's essential for facilitating comparison and analysis across diverse linguistic research."},{"instruction":"Gloss this sentence: Niños, deberían dármelo ahora.","output":"To gloss the sentence \\"Niños, deberían dármelo ahora\\" following the Leipzig Glossing Rules, we would first break it down into morphemes and then provide the respective glosses.

Note that in some glossing traditions, clitic pronouns might be represented with an equals sign (=) to indicate their bound nature. However, using a hyphen (-) is also an acceptable alternative. - **ahora**: 'now', an adverb indicating the time. Remember, when breaking down the morphemes for interlinear glossing, you should aim to align each morpheme with its respective translation where possible, and use standardized abbreviations for grammatical concepts. In this case, \\"3PL\\" signifies third-person plural, \\"PRES\\" signifies present tense, \\"SUBJ\\" signifies subjunctive mood, \\"1SG\\" signifies first-person singular, and \\"3SG\\" signifies third-person singular."},{"instruction":"You mixed up the lines of the gloss.

The kingdom he served had long since been in decline, with corruption taking root within the court and bleeding into the villages that once flourished. The king he once vowed to protect with his life had grown cold and distant, pushing away his loyal servants with unreasonable demands and harsh punishments. Despite this, Sir Aldric remained at his post, driven by a sense of duty that was at once his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. His peers respected him, yet they often whispered about the skeletons in Sir Aldric's closet—a failed marriage burdened by his constant absence, a daughter estranged by his inability to balance the sword with the plow. Internal demons plagued him: guilt for his neglect, anger at injustices he felt powerless to rectify, and a sorrow for the world that seemed to slip further into chaos despite his best efforts. The realm was threatened not only by political decay but by a tangible darkness that crept at the edges of the known lands. Creatures of shadow and malice emerged, preying upon the weak and sowing terror among the populace. Sir Aldric, in response, became a defender of the people, standing as a bulwark against the encroaching night. His sword, Oathkeeper, was a beacon of hope for the helpless and a harbinger of doom for the wicked. Yet with each swing, each victory, the toll it took on his soul grew heavier, and the glory of battle lost its sheen. The knight's path was a lonely one. Many had sought his guidance and wisdom, but few truly knew the man behind the battered helm. They did not see the tremble in his hands as he dressed his own wounds or the haunted look in his eyes when the cries of the fallen echoed through his troubled dreams. He drank to forget, sometimes too much, and in these moments of inebriated vulnerability, the impenetrable armor around his heart would crack, revealing a well of sorrow. Yet Sir Aldric fought on. When villages burned, he was the one to lead the charge against the aggressors and comfort the survivors in their hour of despair. When plagues swept through the countryside, he was the one to ensure that aid reached the afflicted, often at great personal risk. His deeds, though monumental, were shadowed by the sensation that each day was another step towards some inevitable end he could not outrun or outfight. It was during a particularly savage onslaught by a horde of darkness that Sir Aldric's imperfections became his strengths. As the situation grew dire and the fortress’s fall seemed imminent, it was the knight's resilience, born from a lifetime of overcoming personal failure and tragedy, that rose to the surface. His rallying cry echoed off the stone walls, not of invincibility, but of relentless, dogged determination. \\"For all that we have lost, for all that we may lose, we stand! We are the barriers against the night! Fight not for glory, but for the hope that dawn offers!” That night, Sir Aldric fought like a man possessed. Every parry and thrust was a rejection of his failures, an assertion that, while he might never be perfect, he would never yield. The battle was won not by the might of an unblemished hero, but by the bloodied hands of a flawed but unbreakable man. In the aftermath, as the wounded were tended to and the fallen mourned, Sir Aldric knew that the war was far from over. There would be more battles, more heartaches, and more moments of doubt. But he also knew that he would face them as he always had—with a gritty resolve, knowing that the world was as imperfect as he was, and that true courage lay in standing against it, not despite his imperfections, but because of them."},{"instruction":"Write a believable logical character Arc for Gendry, that spans the length of season 8, and 9, and 10, where after reuniting with Arya and her telling him what happened to her after he was sold and taken away in season 3, he is overwhelmed with guilt and shame, angry at himself for not going to winterfell with Arya in season 3. He vows to make up for it, doing whatever it takes to make Arya happy. Sansa, meanwhile, concerned that Jon may be compromised by Daenerys, and learning of Gendry’s bloodline, decides to secretly educate and train Gendry to be a backup/fail safe in case Jon is compromised. The learning and training is long, Gendry’s relations with Sansa and Arya are rocky at first, before strengthening over time, Gendry’s character arc ends with Arya helping him escape with her on horse back, from a battle between Daenerys and a compromised Jon, and Sansa. He finally forgives himself, and Queen Sansa legitimizes him, and makes him lord.","output":"**Season 8** Gendry, now the acknowledged bastard of Robert Baratheon, reunites with Arya Stark at Winterfell as tensions mount and forces gather in anticipation of the Night King's onslaught. The reunion is at first a joyful one, as they rekindle their friendship from seasons past. However, as Arya recounts her harrowing experiences since their parting – the House of Black and White, the Frey massacre, and her personal vendetta – Gendry is overcome with a sense of guilt for not having accompanied her to Winterfell when he had the chance, questioning whether he could have helped her avoid some of the pain she endured. In the midst of preparations for the battle against the undead, Gendry resolves to make it up to Arya by proving his loyalty and dedication. While he fights bravely in the Battle of Winterfell, forging weapons and joining the frontlines, his true tests begin after the immediate threat is dispelled. **Season 9** With the Night King defeated and Westeros' attention turning to the Iron Throne, Sansa Stark, now wary of the power dynamics in play, recognizes the need for political foresight. With Jon Snow's loyalties potentially split due to his affection for Daenerys Targaryen, Sansa seeks insurance. Learning of Gendry's royal lineage, she decides to prepare him as a contingency plan. Gendry is initially resistant to Sansa's proposal. His loyalty lies with the Brotherhood Without Banners, and the Starks, and he holds no desire for power. However, Sansa is persuasive, framing it as a way to help Arya and secure the North's future. Reluctantly, Gendry acquiesces, embarking on a crash course in politics, strategy, and leadership under Sansa's secret tutelage. Arya, now an accomplished assassin and independent in her outlook, watches Gendry's transformation with a mix of pride and unease. As Gendry becomes more ingrained in the Stark's inner circle, their relationship sees strains; Arya worries he may lose the authenticity that first drew her to him. **Season 10** Jon Snow's loyalties do indeed become compromised as Daenerys’ pursuit of the throne grows more fervent. Gendry, now much improved in his political acumen and understanding of Westerosi power dynamics, finds himself caught between the competing interests of the woman he loves and the political machinations he's been drawn into. His feelings of guilt, never fully abated, gnaw at him as he fights to reconcile his sense of self with the political player he’s become. When tensions finally break, and Daenerys' ambition clashes with Sansa's defensive strategies for the North, Gendry stands with Sansa, despite his reservations. He is instrumental in orchestrating defenses, leveraging both his blacksmithing prowess and newfound knowledge. Yet, even as he plays the role of a lord, his heart remains tormented by feelings of inadequacy and his past failures towards Arya. In a brutal conflict as Daenerys turns her fury towards those she views as traitors, including a manipulated Jon and Sansa's Northern forces, Arya manages to find Gendry in the chaos. She implores him to let go of his guilt and forgives him for their shared past; she urges him to flee with her, to live the life they should have pursued long ago. As they escape into the safety of the wilderness, Gendry finally confronts his inner demons, accepting Arya's forgiveness and learning to forgive himself. In the fallout from the conflict, Queen Sansa rewards Gendry's loyalty and contributions to the war effort. Acknowledging his growth, his commitment to the North, and his royal lineage, she legitimizes him, naming him Lord of Storm's End. Gendry is humbled, but his acceptance of the title is not for power's sake; it’s a testament to his journey and the path he's forged through his imperfections and dedication. His final act of the series is to offer Arya to rule by his side, not as a lady, but as an equal and partner, symbolizing his understanding of her spirit and his acceptance of the unconventional path their lives have taken."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but include him hating the brotherhood.","output":"**Season 8** Upon reuniting with Arya Stark at Winterfell, Gendry, freshly acknowledged as the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, is eager to renew their bond. However, the joy of their reunion dims as Arya shares her brutal past since they last parted. Gendry is crushingly remorseful for not accompanying her to Winterfell all those years ago, especially since his time with the Brotherhood Without Banners—a group he has grown to deeply resent for selling him to Melisandre—had been a dark chapter in his life he wished to forget. Gendry's unresolved feelings about the Brotherhood fester into a self-directed anger. He becomes determined to atone for the past, swearing to do all in his power to ensure Arya's safety and happiness. During the Battle of Winterfell, his hammer swings not only with the intent to destroy the wights but also to expunge the guilt that shadows his conscience. **Season 9** With the dead defeated and Gendry recognized as a Baratheon, political schemes once again slither through the corridors of Winterfell. Sansa Stark, sensing a dangerous shift in loyalties with Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen's alliance, and distrustful of Jon's infatuation with the dragon queen, sees an opportunity in Gendry. His resentment toward the Brotherhood and their betrayal makes him an ideal candidate, someone who could empathize with the North's desire for autonomy. Sansa begins to secretly mentor Gendry, schooling him in the finer points of leadership and the delicate dance of Westerosi politics. Initially, Gendry is torn between his emerging role and his lack of aspiration for power, but he eventually grasps that this new position could fortify Arya's and the North's security. Arya, witnessing Gendry's entrance into the political sphere, keeps a guarded eye on his transformation. Their relationship weathers a storm of changes; she is torn between pride in his growth and fear of losing the simple, honest foundry boy she had met on the Kingsroad so long ago. **Season 10** As Daenerys' pursuit of the throne begins to cloud Jon Snow's judgment, the profound changes within Gendry become more pronounced. Under Sansa's guidance, he has blossomed into a discerning and tactful lord, though his hatred for those who've manipulated him—the Brotherhood and by extension, the game of thrones—remains a smoldering ember within. When Daenerys eventually turns her ire toward those she deems disloyal, including Jon and Sansa, Gendry resolves to take a stand. By now, his allegiance to Arya and loyalty to the Stark cause are foremost. His actions in defense of the North against Daenerys' wrath are the final steps of his arduous journey toward redemption. Amid the turmoil of an inevitable clash, Arya finds Gendry, whose guilt and self-reproach have never fully subsided. She releases him from the chains of his past, urging him to flee with her, signifying a new beginning—one that he should have chosen years ago. As they vanish together into the unknown, Gendry's inner turmoil wanes. The forgiveness he receives from Arya allows him to forgive himself. In the aftermath of the conflict, a victorious Queen Sansa honors Gendry by legitimizing him, rewarding his service and recognizing the merit in his reluctance toward the game that had so deeply affected them all. He is named Lord of Storm's End, a title he accepts not as a quest for power but as acknowledgment of his service and a pledge to protect those he holds dear. Freed from the burdens of his past, Lord Gendry Baratheon asks Arya Stark to join him not as a traditional lady but as co-ruler and partner at Storm's End. They forge ahead, united, embracing a future they will shape together—away from the shadows of their past and the Brotherhood that Gendry has long despised."},{"instruction":"Translate to Chinese (Taiwan) \\"Pizza Soup\\"","output":"在台灣，「Pizza Soup」如果直接翻譯可能會變成「比薩湯」 (bǐ sà tāng)。不過，這種湯在台灣可能不常見，所以這個名稱可能會讓人感到困惑。如果「Pizza Soup」是一道特定的菜式或是品牌名稱，在台灣可能會保持英文名稱或根據菜式特性賦予一個更具有描述性的中文名稱。"},{"instruction":"Write a wholesome story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Gideon Grey deciding to reintroduce Judy Hopps to his childhood friend, Travis. Travis, like Gideon, has reconciled with those he bullied and has became a kind farmer who runs an orchard where Gideon gets the berries for his pies from.","output":"In the bustling city of Zootopia, change was always in the air. Animals from every species and background worked together, laughed together, and sometimes, they even forgave each other. This was a lesson Gideon Grey, the sly fox with a dark past, knew all too well. It was a bright morning when Gideon, now a reformed character and the owner of a beloved local bakery, decided it was high time to reconnect some threads of his old life that deserved a second chance. Gideon's thoughts wandered to Judy Hopps, the rabbit he and his childhood friend Travis had bullied when they were all just kids. Years had passed, and Gideon had learned the true measure of kindness and repentance. He had even apologized to Judy, who, in her generous spirit, had forgiven him. Now, she was not only the first rabbit officer of the ZPD but a symbol of perseverance and understanding. As Gideon kneaded the dough for his famous blueberry pie, he contemplated the idea of introducing Judy to Travis again. Travis, like Gideon, had faced his old demons. He had become a hardworking farmer, tending to a lush orchard where Gideon sourced the berries for his pastries. Their friendship had been rekindled, built on mutual respect and a shared desire to be better than they were. With the thought taking root, Gideon made his decision. He carefully packaged a pie and headed out, his heart a mix of hope and nervousness. He drove his old, creaky pick-up truck toward the heart of Zootopia, where Judy would be finishing her shift. He found Judy at the precinct, just as she was saying goodbye to her partner, Nick Wilde. She greeted Gideon with a warm smile that spoke volumes of the forgiveness she held in her heart. \\"Gideon! What brings you to the precinct?\\" Judy asked with curiosity dancing in her eyes. \\"Just wanted to drop off some pie and, well, I was wonderin' if you might like to come with me to visit an old friend,\\" Gideon said, his drawl a bit more pronounced in his nervousness. Judy's ears perked up with interest. \\"An old friend?\\" \\"Yep, Travis. He runs an orchard now, and I get my berries from him. He's changed a lot, Judy. Like me,\\" Gideon explained, his eyes earnest. Judy's expression softened with understanding. \\"I'd be happy to, Gideon. It sounds like Travis, just like you, is trying to make amends. That's something I'll always support.\\" Together, they drove to Travis's orchard, just outside the city. The trees were heavy with ripe fruit, the air was sweet with the scent of blossoms, and the scene was a tranquil contrast to the urban hustle of Zootopia. Travis, a sturdy ram with a gentle demeanor, was surprised to see Judy. His initial hesitation melted away under Judy's genuine smile and extended paw. \\"I must admit, I didn't expect to see you here, Judy. But I'm glad you came. Gideon's told me you've been doing great things for the city,\\" Travis said, acceptance clear in his tone. As they strolled through the orchard, Judy learned about Travis's efforts in the community and his programs for youth to teach them about agriculture and teamwork. In turn, she shared stories of her adventures as a police officer and her dreams of making Zootopia an even better place. In that serene orchard, under the canopy of fruit-laden branches, a new friendship blossomed. The past was acknowledged but didn't dominate the present. The afternoon passed with laughter and stories, and as the sun dipped below the horizon, Gideon, Judy, and Travis sat at a wooden table, sharing pie and plans for the future. It was a simple moment, yet it encapsulated the enduring spirit of Zootopia, where anyone could be anything and forgiveness paved the way to a better tomorrow. From the seeds of old regrets, new connections grew, and the bonds of a wholesome friendship took root, one as sweet and lasting as the berries from Travis's orchard."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Lebanese American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a timid college freshman; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"**INT.

One stall is out of service, another is being used for a clothing change by a fashion-conscious peer, and the last has a seemingly endless procession of occupants.

Let's get you cleaned up. Samar physically reacts to the strong smell, ushers Maya toward the bathroom, and warns her about the mess. **SAMAR** (pinching her nose) Just don't drip any of it on the floor! They wobble towards the bathroom, Maya cringing, Samar constantly admonishing the aroma and checking the floor. **MAYA** (awkwardly) Feels like it’s sliding... **SAMAR** (aggravated) Well then, hold it in! Yallah! Reaching the bathroom, Maya stops at the threshold, teasingly asking her mother for further assistance. **MAYA** (teasing) You want to change my ‘diaper,’ Mom? Infuriated and with a dramatic flair, Samar grabs and squashes the soiled bulge, propelling Maya into the bathroom. **SAMAR** (forcefully) Enough! Get in and wash up now! **MAYA** (loudly disgusted) It’s all squished now! Samar, hand still pressed to her nose, shuts the bathroom door. **SAMAR** (shaking her head) Unbelievable. Your father will not hear the end of this. *FADE OUT*"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Travis, like Gideon, has reconciled with those he bullied and has became a kind farmer who runs an orchard where Gideon gets the berries for his pies from.","output":"Once a sly fox known for his rough antics, Gideon Grey turned a new leaf. His bustling bakery in Bunnyburrow was a testament to his transformation, fragrant and warm with the scent of sweet, golden pastries. But Gideon never forgot the errors of his youth, nor the friend who had shared his wayward path—Travis the ferret. Growing up, Gideon and Travis were known troublemakers, always picking on the smaller critters. That is, until Judy Hopps, the rabbit who had forever altered Gideon's heart, had shown them that true strength came from kindness, not domination. While Judy went off to become a police officer in Zootopia, both Gideon and Travis silently worked to mend their ways in the countryside. Travis found solace in the soil, toiling under the sun, planting and nurturing, until he became known not for his sharp claws but for his sharp knack for fruity harvests. His orchard sprawled over hills and valleys, a sea of blossoming trees and vines that offered nature's sweets to any who sought them. One bright morning, as Gideon gathered blackberries from Travis's orchard for his famous deep-dish pies, an idea whirled into his mind like flour in a sifting breeze. \\"Why don't we show Judy what we've become?\\" Gideon said thoughtfully, tossing another plump berry into his basket. Travis's whiskers twitched. \\"Judy Hopps? Think she'd care to see us after all this time?\\" Gideon nodded, his emerald eyes earnest. \\"She's the reason we're who we are today. She believed in us 'fore anyone else did.\\" It didn't take much more convincing. It was set. Judy, on her brief visit home, would be reacquainted with both of them. They sent her an invitation and awaited her response with bated breath. On the day Judy was to visit, Gideon and Travis were aflutter with nervous energy. The orchard was alive with color, the air was sweet, and the two of them—former bullies—stood as monuments of amendment. Judy arrived, her bright eyes reflecting the bounty of the orchard, her ears perked up with curiosity. Clad in her casual off-duty attire, she was not Officer Judy Hopps but simply Judy, Bunnyburrow's own. \\"Travis, Gideon!\\" she greeted, beaming as they met with a friendly embrace. \\"I hear you've both been doing amazing things.\\" Gideon, bashful, offered her a slice of pie. \\"Not as amazin' as protectin' Zootopia, but we like to think we make life sweeter in our own way.\\" Travis, humbler and gentler than the ferret she remembered, guided Judy through the rows of trees, picking the ripest fruits. \\"Every seed is a second chance, Judy. I reckon we've both planted quite a few.\\" Judy listened, touched by their words, delighted to witness these once menacing minxes who had sprouted into good-hearted growers and bakers. They spent the day recounting old memories, forging new ones, and laughing beneath the leafy canopy. By sunset, Judy was not only full of pie but full of pride. \\"Seeing you two stand here, with such big hearts—it gives me hope. Hope for anyone who thinks they can't change.\\" As dusk painted the sky, they exchanged heartfelt farewells, promises to keep in touch. Gideon and Travis watched Judy's silhouette diminish down the road, a small figure with an outsized influence. Once in the shadows of her looming dreams, the two friends now stood alongside them, reminding Judy that even the smallest act of belief could harvest a world of growth. And Zootopia, with all its different creatures trying to live together in harmony, was greater for it."},{"instruction":"Где скачивается установочный файл OnlyOffice? a. GoogleDrive b.

It should be noted that the above lists could be significantly altered based on specific goals, the scale of the simulation, and the level of detail you want to achieve."},{"instruction":"I meant sim card farm","output":"Ah, a SIM card farm, or SIM farm, is a setup where multiple SIM cards are actively used to engage in activities like bulk SMS sending, bypassing single-account restrictions on websites, or automating certain phone-based tasks. **Please note**: Depending on the intended use, operating a SIM card farm can be illegal or violate terms of service agreements. It is often associated with spamming, fraud, or other malicious activities. Ensure that whatever you plan is compliant with local laws and regulation. Here's a list of the basic equipment and services you would need to set up a legal and legitimate SIM farm for purposes such as testing, development, or SMS-based customer services: 1. **SIM cards:** A collection of valid SIM cards from mobile carriers. They may need to be periodically recharged or have a contract associated with them. 2. **Mobile phones, modems, or GSM gateways:** The hardware needed to insert and use the SIM cards. Options vary from using individual mobile phones to dedicated devices that can house multiple SIM cards. 3. **Computer system:** To manage the SIM farm, schedule tasks, and process activities. 4. **Software:** Management software to handle SMS sending, receiving, and automation.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"# Background Previously on \\"Balancing Acts,\\" we joined Samar, a Lebanese-American freshman, in her first few weeks of college, juggling her new independent life and her traditional, close-knit family. After an overnight study session with friends, Samar had been too embarrassed to use the dorm bathrooms due to their communal nature and decided to wait until she got home to relieve herself. Throughout the day, Samar ignored her body's increasing pleas, distracted by back-to-back classes and the lingering shame of potentially being overheard in the echo-prone dormitory bathrooms. It was only on the bus ride home, when Samar’s discomfort turned into an urgent demand, that she realized she had miscalculated her body's tolerance. # INT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT PORCH - DAY Samar (18, with long dark hair tied in a high ponytail, wearing a loose, flowy top and yoga pants), hurries towards her family's small porch, her walk a tense, constrained waddle. Sweat beads her forehead as she clutches her stomach, eyes scanning for her keys—which are nowhere to be found. # EXT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT DOOR Samar reaches the door and digs desperately in her bag. The keys are missing. Panic strikes, she frantically knocks, hoping for a miracle. SAMAR (O.S.) (calling out) Hello?! Mom! Anyone?! Inside, a blaring TV covers Samar's distress. Minutes crawl by, each a ticking bomb. No answer. Samar’s face twists in agony. # INT. FAMILY HOME – LIVING ROOM The voice of Laila (late 40s, strong-willed, with styled hair graying at the roots), echoes from the living room. LAILA (confused) Who is it? # EXT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT DOOR Samar leans against the doorframe, clenching her everything. SAMAR (pleading) Mom, hurry, please! # INT. FAMILY HOME – ENTRYWAY The lock clicks. The door opens, and Laila stands there, a puzzled expression giving way to concern as she takes in Samar’s distressed state. LAILA (suspicious) Samar, shu fi? What’s going on? SAMAR (increasingly desperate) Just move, please! # EXT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT DOOR As Samar pushes past, Laila grips her arm, surely something must be wrong. LAILA (concerned) Habibti, talk to me! SAMAR (squirming) Mom, not now! # INT. FAMILY HOME – ENTRYWAY Their struggle escalates—an unintentional dance of urgency and apprehension. SAMAR (pleading with increasing desperation) Just let me through! A beat. Samar's face crumples; the realization comes too late. She groans, a pained grunt escalating into a relieved exhale. Her knees buckle slightly as she gives in to the moment. LAILA (frowning) Samar? Samar, what’s wrong with you? Samar's teeth grit, her face contorting with the odd mixture of pain and respite, releasing soft grunts. LAILA (insistent) Yalla, tell me, tell me! The smell announces itself before Samar can find words. Laila sniffs, her bewilderment growing. LAILA (exasperated) Aywa, what is that smell? SAMAR (sheepishly) Can I please just go in now? # INT. FAMILY HOME – LIVING ROOM Laila guides Samar inside, disgust crinkling her nose. Samar, mortified, gingerly waddles past her. LAILA (halting Samar) Stop! Don’t you dare track that... in here! SAMAR (indignant but sheepish) I can’t believe this... LAILA (teasing) Dirty! No, really? At your age, Samar? SAMAR (playful accusation) Your fault, mom. Why’d you block me? LAILA (dismissive) Excuses! No reason to carry on like a toddler. SAMAR (protesting, on edge) I needed to go so bad! Blaming Laila's intervention for her loss of dignity, Samar pokes at the bulge in her pants with a complex grimace. SAMAR (defiantly) It felt good to let go. Now let me clean up! LAILA (smocking) Disgusting! Enjoying yourself, are we? Samar shoots back a playful scowl, but Laila's not having it.

SAMAR (retorting coyly) Better out than in. It was packed. LAILA (firmly) Such a nasty girl! I don't raise babies! Laila inspects Samar’s rear end with a shake of her head, sniffing melodramatically at the soiled pants. Samar winces under the scrutiny. LAILA (mockingly reacting to the odor) Phew!

There are several reasons why spammers might choose to use physical SIM cards: 1. Anonymity: By using prepaid SIM cards, spammers can often send messages without their real identity being easily traced. This helps them avoid detection and legal consequences. 2. Bypassing Filters: Carrier and network-based spam filters may block messages that originate from known spam sources. By using legitimate SIM cards from various carriers, spammers can bypass these filters as their messages appear to come from a variety of regular phone numbers. 3. Local Numbers: Spam messages that come from local numbers are more likely to be opened and trusted by recipients. Spammers use SIM cards from the country or area code in which they want to send messages to increase the likelihood of their spam being effective. 4. SIM Farms: Spammers may set up \\"SIM farms\\" where hundreds or thousands of SIM cards are managed and rotated through modems or mobile devices to send out a high volume of messages while reducing the chance of any single number getting flagged and blocked. 5. Avoiding Limitations: Many online messaging services and apps have limitations on how many messages can be sent from a single number to combat spam. By using multiple SIM cards, spammers can rotate through numbers to avoid these limitations and send large numbers of messages. However, regulations and laws in various countries may require SIM card registration with valid identification, which can make it more challenging for spammers to operate anonymously. As a result, they might look for ways to acquire SIM cards that do not require ID, or they may use stolen identities to register SIMs. Additionally, cellular providers and regulatory bodies are continually working on methods to combat the issue, including stricter SIM card registration processes and using advanced analytics to detect and block spam. Due to these countermeasures and the ongoing arms race between spammers and service providers, the tactics and prevalence of using physical SIM cards for spam operations can fluctuate. As spam detection technology advances, spammers may also adapt and look for new ways to continue their operations."},{"instruction":"If you use a sim card can you spoof the whatever you call it sender id or the text at the chat window","output":"The sender ID for SMS messages, often referred to as the \\"sender name\\" or \\"alpha tag,\\" is the name or number that appears on the recipient's device as the source of the message. In traditional SMS messaging, when using a regular SIM card, the sender ID is typically the phone number associated with that SIM card. This makes it harder for spammers using standard commercial SIM cards to spoof sender IDs, as they are inherently tied to the phone number of the SIM card. However, spammers and fraudsters have developed techniques to manipulate or spoof sender IDs, even when using SIM cards. They employ various methods such as: 1. **SMS Gateways:** Using online SMS gateways or bulk SMS service providers that allow custom sender IDs. Some of these services have legitimate business uses, such as banks or companies sending messages from a branded sender name instead of a number. Spammers can abuse these services to set arbitrary sender IDs. 2. **SS7 Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7), the protocol suite used by most telecommunication operators to exchange information. By exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities, attackers can intercept and manipulate messages, including changing sender IDs. 3. **Fake Mobile Towers (IMSI Catchers):** Using devices like IMSI catchers, which can act as fake cell towers to intercept mobile traffic. These can potentially be used to send SMS messages with spoofed sender IDs. 4. **Compromising Carrier Systems:** Gaining unauthorized access to a carrier or service provider’s SMS center (SMSC) can allow an attacker to send messages with any sender ID. It's important to note that the legality and difficulty of these methods can vary greatly. Many countries have strict regulations to prevent the misuse of telecommunications systems, including rules against sender ID spoofing. Moreover, the technical complexity and risk associated with these more sophisticated methods may be beyond what most low-level spammers are willing to undertake, thereby limiting such activities to more organized and sophisticated entities. Ultimately, while it is technically possible to spoof sender IDs when using SIM cards, it is increasingly challenging due to improved security measures by carriers, legal repercussions, and the complexity of successfully carrying out such an attack. Service providers and regulatory bodies continue to develop and implement new measures to prevent and detect spoofing to protect consumers."},{"instruction":"Using sms gateways seems a lot safer tk me for a spammer, create an account with a fake identiy, maybe even use a stolen card to load balance, buy a server to host the spammer, youre off","output":"While using SMS gateways might seem like a simpler and safer method for a spammer, there are still risks and complications involved. Here is a closer look at the issues and challenges spammers might face when using this approach: 1. **Identity Verification:** Reputable SMS gateway providers usually have robust verification processes to prevent misuse of their services. This often includes the requirement to provide a legitimate business reason for sending bulk SMS and potential verification of identity to comply with legal requirements. 2. **Payment Traceability:** Even if a spammer uses a stolen credit card to load a balance onto an SMS gateway service, most payment processors have fraud detection measures in place. This could lead to the transaction being reversed, and the account being suspended or subjected to further investigation. 3. **Service Provider Vigilance:** SMS gateway providers actively monitor for suspicious activity to maintain their reputation and abide by anti-spam laws. If a provider detects abuse or receives complaints, they can shut down the offending account and cooperate with legal authorities to trace the spammer. 4. **Legal Consequences:** In many jurisdictions, sending spam messages is illegal, and laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) in the United States or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU provide stiff penalties for violators. Providers of SMS gateway services are required to enforce these laws and may report suspicious or illegal activities to authorities. 5. **Technical Challenges:** Setting up a server and managing a spam operation, while bypassing spam filters and maintaining a degree of anonymity, requires technical expertise. Additionally, there's always the risk of leaving digital footprints that could be traced back to the spammer. 6. **Countermeasures:** Carriers have systems in place to identify and block messages from sources known to distribute spam. They also implement rate limiting and pattern analysis to catch suspicious messaging behavior at scale. To combat spam effectively, service providers, regulatory bodies, and technology companies constantly update their tools and collaborate to identify and shut down spam operations. As a result, what seems like a safer option for spammers may still be fraught with risks and difficulties. If you receive spam messages, it is important to report them to your telecommunications provider. In many countries, there are specific procedures or codes (such as forwarding the message to a particular number) that can be used to report spam. This helps providers improve their monitoring and blocking efforts to better protect consumers from unwanted messages."},{"instruction":"How do sms gateways work? Do they just own sim cards?","output":"SMS gateways serve as intermediaries that enable computers to send or receive Short Message Service (SMS) transmissions to or from a telecommunications network. Fundamentally, they translate messages from the Internet into a format compatible with carriers' networks and vice versa. They don't necessarily \\"own\\" SIM cards in the traditional sense typically associated with personal mobile phone usage. Instead, they interface directly with mobile operators through various protocols. Here's an overview of how they typically work: 1. **API Integration:** SMS gateways provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that developers and businesses can integrate into their software applications, websites, or systems. These APIs allow for automated and programmatic sending of SMS messages to mobile devices. 2. **Agreements with Carriers:** SMS gateway providers have agreements with mobile network operators to send and receive messages through their networks. They connect to these networks using industry-standard protocols, such as SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer), CIMD (Computer Interface to Message Distribution), or proprietary interfaces of the mobile operators. 3. **Routing Messages:** When an SMS message is sent via an SMS gateway, the gateway ensures it is routed to the recipient's mobile network operator. This is done regardless of whether the end user's mobile phone is connected via a contract or a prepaid arrangement with the carrier. 4. **Message Translation:** The gateway converts the Internet-based message formats into the SMS protocol used by mobile networks and vice versa. It also takes care of any necessary transcoding if the message content contains non-GSM characters or binary data. 5. **Ensuring Delivery:** Advanced SMS gateways provide delivery reports (DLRs), which confirm whether the message has been delivered to the recipient's handset. This feedback loop is critical for applications that require confirmation of message delivery, such as two-factor authentication systems. 6. **Load Balancing and Queueing:** SMS gateways handle varying volumes of messages efficiently, often including features such as load balancing to distribute messages evenly across connections and queuing systems to manage traffic peaks. SMS gateways are used for a wide array of services such as marketing broadcasts, critical alerts, appointment reminders, two-factor authentication, and more. They provide the infrastructure necessary for businesses and organizations to communicate effectively with customers and users, without the need for each business to establish individual agreements with mobile carriers or invest in the complex infrastructure that direct carrier connections would require. It's important to note that while SIM cards can technically be used to send SMS messages, commercial operations use direct connections to mobile operators' SMSCs (Short Message Service Centers) to handle large volumes of messages and to comply with the terms of service agreements and regulatory requirements."},{"instruction":"Pme thing I saw when looking into this js that sms spam is more expensive tha I thought, alteast where I live its 70 dollars for 1000 messages, ofcouse its cheaper in other places but in europe is pretty expensive in most places","output":"Yes, SMS messaging costs can vary widely depending on factors like the country, the carrier, the volume of messages, and the agreements in place between SMS gateway providers and mobile network operators. In Europe, costs can be higher due to a combination of factors: 1. **Regulation:** European countries often have strict regulations regarding telecommunications services, privacy, and use of personal data, like GDPR, which can impact the cost structure of sending SMS messages. 2. **Carrier Fees:** Mobile carriers in Europe may charge higher fees for the delivery of SMS messages, particularly for bulk or commercial messages. This is in part to maintain service quality and manage network load. 3. **Interconnection Charges:** Sending messages across different carriers and countries can involve interconnection charges, which contribute to the total cost of the service. 4. **Infrastructure and Compliance Costs:** Providers need to maintain robust infrastructure and comply with European standards for data protection and privacy, which can increase operational costs. 5. **Volume Discounts:** Bulk SMS prices are typically tiered, with higher volumes often resulting in lower per-message costs. Small-scale operations might not benefit from the discounts available to larger senders, and thus might face higher per-message prices. Considering these expenses, it's not surprising that SMS spam campaigns need to be carefully targeted to be profitable. Spammers may carefully calculate their return on investment (ROI) to ensure that the revenue generated from their spam activities exceeds the cost of sending messages. This is likely why spam messages often include phishing attempts, scams, or fraudulent offers, as these can potentially generate significant income per successful hit, offsetting the costs of the messages. Spam is not just a nuisance; it can be part of a larger cybercriminal strategy. Given the costs involved and the risks of legal consequences, many spammers continually seek out cheaper and less regulated channels for their activities, such as email or social media platforms. However, because SMS messages tend to have higher open and response rates, they remain an attractive medium for spammers despite the higher costs of operation especially in more regulated regions like Europe."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How are content morphemes and grammatical morphemes glossed? What’s the difference between a space, a minus, and an equals sign placed between the morphemes? What is the period used for? Do the morphemes in the source text and gloss have to line up? What’s the difference between part of speech tagging and glossing?","output":"Leipzig Glossing Rules is a set of conventions used for interlinear glosses, which help to understand the grammatical structure of an utterance in another language. The basic layout is as follows: 1. **Source text line**: The original text written in the source language, usually segmented into meaningful units like words or morphemes. 2. **Morphemic breakdown line**: The source text broken down into its smallest meaningful components (morphemes), including both content and grammatical morphemes. 3. **Morpheme-by-morpheme gloss line**: Each morpheme from the line above is translated or explained as accurately as possible. 4. **Free translation line**: A smooth translation of the entire sentence or utterance into the target language, usually aiming to convey the meaning rather than to be morpheme-precise. **Content morphemes** carry the substantive content of the message—nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. In a gloss, they're usually translated more or less directly into the equivalent word in the target language. **Grammatical morphemes**, on the other hand, adjust the meaning of content words by expressing grammatical relationships, such as tense, mood, number, gender, etc. For these, standardized abbreviations are usually employed (e.g., PL for plural, PAST for past tense, NEG for negation, etc.). In segmenting morphemes, different punctuation marks have specific meanings: - **Space**: A space is used to separate words—that is, units that typically can stand alone if taken out of a sentence. - **Hyphen (-)**: A hyphen is used to split up a word into its individual morphemes, showing where each morpheme starts and ends within a word. - **Equals sign (=)**: An equals sign is used to indicate clitics. Clitics are morphemes that are grammatically independent but phonologically dependent on a neighboring word. The **period (.)** is often used in interlinear glosses to separate parts of a compound word, or sometimes for grammatical words when they stand alone. Yes, morphemes in the source text and in the gloss line are meant to align directly with one another for clarity and ease of analysis. This allows someone reading the gloss to understand exactly which pieces of the original language correspond to the given translations or grammatical annotations. **Part of speech tagging (POS tagging)** involves labeling words with their appropriate part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), but does not necessarily involve translation or the breaking down into morphemes. Glossing, especially as per the Leipzig Rules, goes further in detailing not just the part of speech, but also the meaning of each morpheme and its grammatical function within the context of the utterance. Often, POS tagging is a preliminary step in linguistic analysis and can be done by automated processes in language processing software, while glossing is a descriptive task that may require deeper linguistic knowledge and is usually done manually by linguists to understand and explain the grammatical structure of languages."},{"instruction":"When you produce glosses for me, put the morpheme breakdown and gloss lines into separate lines of a table with one column for each morpheme (breaking columns at the minus or equals but not the period). Do you understand?","output":"Yes, I understand. You would like an interlinear gloss presented in a tabular format, with each morpheme being represented in its own column. The morphemes will be separated at the hyphen or equals sign, indicating the breakdown of a word into its constituent morphemes (including affixes or clitics), but not at periods which are used for compound words or stand-alone grammatical words. Here's an example of how you want the morphemic breakdown and gloss lines to be formatted, using a fictitious language sentence: Source text line (not in the table): Katam-ishu doku-eja-jen.

The hyphens before \\"ishu,\\" \\"eja,\\" and \\"jen\\" suggest that these are bound morphemes (they can't stand alone without attaching to another morpheme) and the equal signs are not used here, so there are no clitics in this example.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"# BACKGROUND: In the previous scene, Maya, a timid Lebanese American college freshman known for her aversion to using public restrooms for her bowel movements, finds herself in a bind during an extended university library study session. Despite her best efforts to focus on her assignments, the increasing pressure in her gut becomes impossible to ignore. Embarrassed by the thought of relieving herself in the campus lavatories, she opts to hold it in until she can get home to the safety and privacy of her own bathroom—a decision she soon regrets as her discomfort mounts. After an agonizing bus ride and a brisk walk, Maya finally arrives at her family's doorstep, her need to go escalating with every step. # SCREENPLAY/SHOOTING SCRIPT: INT. SUBURBAN FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY We see MAYA AL-MASRI (19, Lebanese American, petite, curly hair tied in a ponytail, flushed face, wearing athletic leggings and an oversized university sweatshirt), anxiously approaching the door of her family home. Her steps are quick, her movements rigid, betraying her discomfort. MAYA (sotto voce) Oh, come on... almost there, Maya... Maya reaches for her keys, her hands shaking, only to find the key ring absent from her bag. Panic flares in her eyes. MAYA (whispering) No, no, no... She frantically pats her pockets, confirming her fear. The key is gone. Desperate, she bangs on the door with urgency. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS From inside, we hear the muffled knocking. RANIA AL-MASRI (45, Lebanese American, strong features softened by age, wearing a floral-patterned apron over her casual home attire), Maya's mother, lifts her gaze from her magazine. RANIA (concerned) What on earth? INT. SUBURBAN FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Rania's VOICE can finally be heard through the door. RANIA (O.S.) (hollering) Who's there? MAYA (almost crying) Mom, it's me! Please hurry! INT. FAMILY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Rania, sensing the distress in Maya's voice, hurries to the door, her movements less quick than Maya would like. EXT. SUBURBAN FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The door swings open slowly, Rania's face a mask of puzzled concern. Maya tries to brush past her, but Rania's maternal instincts kick in, and she holds her daughter's arm. RANIA (alarmed) Shoo habibi, what's wrong? MAYA (strained) Please, Mom, I have to get inside. Maya's discomfort is now painfully visible. Rania's grip persists as she blocks the doorway, knitting her brows. RANIA But tell me what— Suddenly, a defeated groan escapes Maya's lips. Her body goes rigid, and then relaxes in a dreaded but relieving release. Rania’s confusion deepens. RANIA (tentative) Maya? Shoo, tell me what's happening. MAYA (barely audible, strained) It's... okay... Maya subtly leans into a more comfortable position to continue her unintended act, her face a mixture of immense relief and mortification. RANIA (frowning) Maya? Maya murmurs something unintelligible under the cover of soft grunting filled with an almost satisfied tone. Rania, unsure of how to proceed, watches with a mix of confusion and growing concern. Then, the smell hits. Rania sniffs the air once, twice, and reacts—her face distorting as the realization dawns. RANIA (recoiling) What's that smell? Maya locks eyes with her mother, her sheepish expression confirming all suspicions. The color drains from Rania’s face. RANIA (shocked) Did you just... in your...? Maya remains silent, the answer hanging unspoken between them. RANIA (demanding, disgusted) Did you poop your pants? MAYA (avoiding, pleading) Mom, please can I just go in? Rania, though repulsed, steps aside, waving Maya in with a disgusted haste. MAYA (gingerly waddling) Sorry... RANIA (scornful) Wait! Don’t you dare drop any—Ah! Rania scolds Maya for not controlling herself better, even going so far as to taunt her daughter over her dirty predicament. RANIA (scrunching her nose, inspecting Maya) There’s no excuse for this at your age. And it's filthy! MAYA (shame-faced, holding the seat of her pants) I... I know... RANIA (exasperated) Will you ever grow up? Maya, her initial embarrassment fading, retorts with defiant sulkiness. MAYA (playfully upset) Your fault! You blocked me! I couldn't make it! Rania is incredulous, her fingers pinching the bridge of her nose. RANIA (scoffing) My fault? Mahdoume, you’re too old for excuses when nature calls, ya bent. MAYA (adamant) It was urgent! Once it starts, it has to finish, okay? Your stalling forced me! Rania examines Maya's rear end, patting it to measure the fullness disdainfully. RANIA (shaking her head) Unbelievable. Look how full your pants are now, habibti. Maya touches the bulge and winces but maintains her stance. MAYA (deflects with humor) Needed the relief... Guess I've got it, huh? Rania, feigning a concerned check on the state of Maya's pants, playfully sniff near her daughter’s seat. RANIA (faux-seriousness, sniffing) You're right. Feels like a diaper change is in order, doesn't it? Maya cringes but attempts to counter with a bravado she doesn't feel. MAYA (awash with embarrassment) Yeah... smells pretty bad... RANIA (teasing) You're unbearable. Let's get you cleaned up already. Rania ushers Maya toward the bathroom, trying to contain the mess with her hands as they go. MAYA (sheepishly) Careful... Feels like it might— RANIA (wincing) Don't say it! Just don't drop any, for heaven’s sake. Upon reaching the bathroom, Maya teases Rania one last time, prompting her mother's final act of playful frustration. MAYA (stopping, grinning) Open to change my diaper, Mom? Rania, with a playful scoff, gives Maya a gentle push into the bathroom, pressing the bulging seat of her pants and closing the door behind her. RANIA (pinching her nose) Into the shower, now—before all of Beirut smells you! MAYA (O.S.) (yelping from the bathroom) Ma! You squashed it! RANIA (over her shoulder, leaving) That's what you get for being cheeky! Bath, now! As Rania walks away, we hear Maya’s squeals and splashes from behind the closed bathroom door. RANIA (shaking her head) Ya Rabi, how can someone be this smelly? FADE TO BLACK."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Lebanese American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a timid college student; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants.

SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY The pale afternoon sun casts a glow on the neat row of houses. Kids are riding their bikes and the faint sound of lawn mowers hums in the background. INTRODUCING MAYA, a 20-year-old Lebanese American college student. She's wearing athletic joggers and a college hoodie. Her dark hair is pulled back in a messy ponytail, and her eyes are wide with an urgent discomfort. CUT TO: FLASHBACK - MAYA'S COLLEGE CAFETERIA - EARLIER Maya sits with friends, laughing over lunch. She opts for the enticing yet notorious bean chili special against her better judgment. CUT BACK TO: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY Maya rushes towards her family home, books clutched to her chest. She fumbles for keys that aren't there. Without skipping a beat, she KNOCKS frantically on the door. Her face pinches in distress. MAYA (calling out) Mom! Dad! Anyone home?! INT. HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS The door rattles with each knock. SOMETHING falls inside, a sign of life. INTRODUCING LAYLA, Maya's mom in her late 40s, chic bob, and a face that reads I've-seen-it-all. She shoos her cat away from the noise and approaches the door. LAYLA (alarmed, shouting) Who's banging on my door at this hour?! MAYA (pressured) Mama, it's me! LAYLA Maya? Wait a minute, why don't you use your key? CUT TO: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY Maya's clenched fists knock harder. She shifts uncomfortably, her urgency palpable. MAYA (pleading) Please, Mom, hurry! LAYLA (calling through door) Hold on, hold on, I’m coming. LAYLA fumbles with multiple locks, her movements irritatingly slow for Maya's liking. The door swings open, LAYLA standing there, instantly reading her daughter’s strained expression. MAYA (squeezing past) Move, I need to get— LAYLA's maternal instincts kick in and she grabs MAYA, halting her desperate beeline. LAYLA (narrowed eyes) Maya, what’s wrong with you? MAYA struggles against her mother's grip, pleading incoherently. MAYA (grunting) Mom, just let me through... please! Their tussle resembles a clumsy dance. LAYLA's concern deepens as she denies MAYA passage. Suddenly, MAYA's face contorts; a low groan escapes her as control gives way. LAYLA (perplexed) Maya...? The grip loosens. MAYA eases back into the stance of a toddler caught in a moment of undeniable relief, her grunts soft yet filled with the paradox of shame and satisfaction. LAYLA's confusion ebbs to a dawning horror. LAYLA (eyes widening) Maya, is something—? MAYA (hushed, strained) I...I'm fine… LAYLA's nose wrinkles as a tell-tale odor wafts up. She sniffs again, her face a canvas of disgust and realization. LAYLA (holding her nose) Did you just—no, you didn't... MAYA stands immobilized, face flushed with mortification. LAYLA (recoiling) You pooped your pants?! MAYA (avoiding eye contact) Can we not do this here? I need to get inside. LAYLA steps aside with a grimace, waving MAYA through impatiently. MAYA, gingerly holding the back of her pants, awkwardly shuffles inside, passing the still-stunned LAYLA. LAYLA (urgent) Wait! Don’t move; you better not drop any! MAYA (whining) I know, I know… LAYLA scolds her, flabbergasted by the absurdity of the situation. LAYLA (teasing) What, are you a toddler? You're too old for this! MAYA (playful defiance) You took too long! This is your fault! LAYLA (incredulous) No excuse! You’re a grown woman! MAYA, defending her dignity, insists on the unyielding pressure of nature and her thwarted urgency. MAYA (smirking, feeling backside) Well, it did feel good to let it out… LAYLA blocks MAYA's attempted escape to the bathroom for a well-meaning but teasing lecture. LAYLA (mocking) Enjoyed that, huh? Let's see! After a brief struggle, LAYLA successfully inspects MAYA’s backside, raising her eyebrows in exaggerated shock at the sight. LAYLA (jokingly scolding) I bet you're lovin' that diaper feel. MAYA counters with coy indignation, touching the evident bulge with a mix of discomfort and relief. MAYA (reluctantly) There was a lot... I had to go. LAYLA chides her for not managing the situation better. Continuing the maternal humor, she pretends to sniff at MAYA’s mishap. LAYLA (playful scolding) Smells like someone needs a change! MAYA, repulsed yet playful, admits the undeniable but makes a pointed retort. MAYA (plaintively) Then let me clean up since I stink! LAYLA, still waving her hand in front of her nose, ushers MAYA towards the promised land (bathroom) with an irritated grace. LAYLA (hurried) Go clean up, don't leave a trail! MAYA waddles, while LAYLA, with dramatic overemphasis, helps contain the mess, half laughing and half gagging. At the bathroom threshold, MAYA perpetrates one last tease. MAYA (smirking) Time for a diaper change, Mama? In a moment of giddy retribution, LAYLA gives the bulge a comical squish, sending MAYA stumbling into the bathroom.

A diferencia de los fondos de inversión tradicionales, los ETF se compran y venden durante el día en las bolsas de valores a precios de mercado, de la misma manera que se compran las acciones individuales. Cada ETF posee una colección de activos y se divide en acciones que los inversores pueden comprar. Estas acciones representan una proporción de la propiedad del fondo y los derechos sobre una porción de los activos que éste posee. Los ETF combinan las características de un fondo mutuo, en el sentido de que proporcionan una forma diversificada de invertir en un conjunto amplio de valores, con la ventaja de que se pueden negociar en tiempo real a precios en constante fluctuación mientras el mercado esté abierto. Los ETFs pueden diseñarse para rastrear prácticamente cualquier cosa, desde índices de acciones tradicionales como el S&P 500 o el NASDAQ hasta sectores específicos de la industria, geografías, tipos de inversión (acciones, bonos, etc.) y otros factores del mercado. También existen ETFs inversos que intentan obtener rendimientos que son opuestos al índice o benchmark que rastrean y ETFs apalancados que buscan ofrecer múltiplos del rendimiento diario de los índices a los que están vinculados. Los ETFs son populares entre los inversores debido a su liquidez, facilidad de negociación, transparencia en la cartera de valores que contienen y a menudo tasas más bajas de administración en comparación con los fondos de inversión tradicionales."},{"instruction":"what is a simple lab that i can do with homemade materials that teaches these concepts?

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"# Screenplay/Shooting Script for a Comedy Drama TV Series Scene Background **Title:** \\"*A Sticky Situation*\\" *Leila, a Lebanese American college senior, had spent the previous hours at a lively food festival, sampling a variety of cuisines with her friends. In her revelry, ignored the early signs of digestive distress, chalked up to the rich food and her sensitive stomach. As she left the event and made her way home, a mounting pressure swelled within her abdomen, signaling an impending need to relieve herself. The nearest restroom had an out-of-order sign, leaving her no choice but to clench and hasten her steps towards home. The brisk walk became a desperate scurry as Leila's situation became increasingly urgent. Now, finally at her doorstep, Leila scrambles through her purse for keys but comes up empty. The moment of truth - the pressure in her gut is nearing critical mass as she frantically knocks on the door.* --- **EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT** **Leila Nassar**, 21, a spirited and rebellious college senior with an edge of nonchalance, is seen sporting a black leather jacket over a casual tee, her makeup slightly smudged from the day's activities. Her relaxed leather pants are about to become the center of an ordeal. She rushes to the front door with a gait that teeters between restrained dignity and sheer panic. Frantic knocking ensues. **INT. FAMILY HOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS** **Mira Nassar**, early 50s, the matriarch with a dignified demeanor, graceful in her evening attire, approaches the door from within.

FAMILY HOUSE FOYER - NIGHT** The door swings open, and Mira stands there, a look of confusion morphing into concern as she sees Leila's disheveled state. MIRA (surprised, concerned) What's the rush, babe? --- **EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** Leila tries to push past, but Mira, misconstruing the urgency, intercepts with an embrace intended to calm. Tension rises along with the pressure in Leila's bowels. LEILA (imploringly) Mom, I really need to get inside! Please! MIRA (concerned) Tell me, what's wrong? --- *The scene edges towards farce as Leila loses the battle, her face contorting as she grunts involuntarily. She pulls back slightly, finding a stance allowing some semblance of control over her predicament.* MIRA (perplexed) Leila, are you okay? You're scaring me! LEILA (hushed, strained) I'm... fine... just... let me through. MIRA (still holding Leila) Something's not right. You’re all pale! --- *The air grows thick with a tell-tale odor. Mira's nose wrinkles as reality dawns; Leila’s expression is one of mortified relief.* MIRA (disgusted realization) Did you just... no, you couldn’t have...

Leila doesn't answer, instead pleads silently to be allowed in. --- *The reality of the soiled leather pants becomes more apparent as Leila's movements are ginger and constrained.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time.

FAMILY HOME - EVENING **BACKGROUND:** Prior scene reveals a boisterous Lebanese-American family gathering at a local community hall, where 21-year-old MIRA NASR, a rebellious college senior known for her confident demeanor and quirky fashion sense, is engaged in a spirited debate over hummus recipes. She sips on too many cups of coffee, forgetting to visit the restroom before leaving the noisy event. Now, racing home with a surmounting urge to relieve her bowels, the desperate scenario unfolds as she clenches with each hurried step. Mira is tall, with dark brown, waist-length hair and mischievous eyes. Her outfit reflects her bold personality, with relaxed-fitting leather pants and a vintage band tee under a denim jacket, earrings jangling with each move. **EXT. NASR FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR - EVENING** Mira wobbles to the door, fumbling through her pockets for her keys. The realization hits - she's left them on the debate table back at the community hall. MIRA (panicked muttering) No, no, no... Come on! She bangs on the door, desperation tinging her every movement. **INT. NASR FAMILY HOME - LOCATIONS UNKNOWN - CONTINUOUS** Mira's frantic knocking echoes. No response. Her dance of urgency becomes more pronounced. She squirms and mumbles prayers in broken Arabic. MIRA (knocks intensifying) Mama! Baba! Anyone! Silence lingers before a clatter from the other side can be heard. **INT. NASR FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER** MIRA'S MOM, HIDAYA, late 40s, with soft eyes and hair tied in a practical bun, dressed in her favorite flowy house dress, voices her confusion from the other side. HIDAYA (faintly, through door) Yalla, who is it? You woke up the whole house! MIRA (pleads) Mama, it’s me, please hurry! HIDAYA (calming) Tab, tab... I'm coming. The unlocking is excruciatingly slow. Mira hops on the spot, her face a testament to her writhing insides. **INT. NASR FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS** The door creaks open. Hidaya stands puzzled, confronting Mira’s fitful haste. MIRA (straining) Please, Mama... just move! Hidaya extends her arms, intercepting Mira with a mother's concern. HIDAYA Anxious) Hayati, what’s wrong? Mira wriggles, pleading with her eyes, and her prostests are muffled as their squabble escalates and blocks the doorway. MIRA (frantic) Let me in, Mama! Please, I’ve gotta...! Her words dissolve as the impending crisis hits its zenith. The struggle ceases with an abrupt groan from Mira. Her posture shifts, a look of mortified relief paints her face. Silence. HIDAYA (perplexed) Mira, habibti, shu fi? (My love, what's wrong?) Mira retreats a step back, relief etched into her grimace. Muffled grunts escape her lips as she stands in arrested posture. HIDAYA (trying to understand) Mira, shu fi ma'ik? (Mira, what's with you?) Silence returns but the air changes with an olfactory signal of Mira's situation. Hidaya's keen motherly sense kicks in, the confusion now laced with revulsion. HIDAYA (sniffing the air, disgusted) Mira... shu hada?! (Mira... what is this?!) MIRA (sheepishly) Nothing... I just... Can I go in now? The reality dawns on Hidaya’s face, a mix of disbelief and nausea. HIDAYA (disbelief) Ya allah, inta...? (Oh God, you...?) Mira's silence speaks volumes. HIDAYA (disgusted push) Inzili hon! (Go inside now!) She ushers Mira in, her once embracing hands now ushering her with rushed disgust. Mira inches forward, gingerly navigating her movements to preserve her dignity. HIDAYA (warningly) Khali balik! Don't you dare let it fall on the floor! Shu hada, ya binti! (Pay attention! What is this, my girl!) Mira, face flushed, musters a flimsy defense in her sheepish indignation. MIRA (playful defiance) This is your fault, Mama. You were so slow! HIDAYA (incredulous) My fault? No excuse for a woman your age! Learn to control yourself! Their bickering continues, but Mira’s argument finds its playful foundation. MIRA (justifying) I really had to go, Mama! Once it got to that point, I couldn't hold it. HIDAYA (mocking toughness) You’re ridiculous! Who does that? MIRA (sly resignation) Well, I’ve made a mess now. Let me go clean up, at least. But Hidaya grabs her arm, halting her. HIDAYA (scornful) Looks like you need more than cleaning if you're content with pooping in your pants! MIRA (faint defiance) Stop it, Mama. It's not like I planned this. HIDAYA (mock and inspect) Show me, then. How much have you enjoyed filling your pants? Mira’s protests are ineffective, and Hidaya scrutinizes with dramatic display. HIDAYA (under breath) Awful. How could you enjoy such nastiness? MIRA (timid, touching bulge) I just... needed the relief, Mama. HIDAYA (in babying tone) Next time, control yourself! You act like a child, you get treated like one. She sniffs near the bulge comically, Mira recoiling from the gesture's implications. HIDAYA Taunting) What’s this smell? My little girl’s smelly “diaper”? MIRA (cringe and admission) Okay, yeah, I reek... You gonna keep me like this, for fun? HIDAYA (hands to nose, dismissive) No thanks! Off to the bathroom now! Don't make it worse. HIDAYA ushers her, comically cupping the seat of Mira's pants from behind to avert disaster. HIDAYA (still disgusted) Watch it! Not on my floor! MIRA Awkward, promising disaster) Feels like it’s gonna slide out, Mama! HIDAYA Imploring, half in mock) Keep it together till we get there! Upon arriving at the bathroom, Mira pauses, tease ready. Mira (challenging playfulness) So, Mama, you gonna change me? In response, Hidaya, in theatrical horror, shoves Mira forward, squishing the mess in an exaggerated squelch. HIDAYA (exasperated) Get in there! And stay there till you’re clean! Mira, now in the bathroom, protests as the door slams shut. MIRA (disgustedly) Oh, gross! Now it’s... everywhere. HIDAYA (through closed door) That’s what you get for your insolence! She steps away, hand still gripping her nose, and finally alone in the hallway. HIDAYA (shaking her head, questioning existence) Allah, as a mother, how do I deal with such smell?

Если обнаруживается угроза, антивирусная программа предпринимает необходимые действия для ее устранения. Антивирусные программы также могут обновляться регулярно, чтобы обнаруживать новые виды вредоносного ПО. b. Защитные программы Защитные программы это общий термин, который может включать в себя антивирусные программы, но также охватывает и другие инструменты и методы для обеспечения безопасности компьютера. Это может включать в себя программы брандмауэра, программы антишпионов, программы блокировки рекламы и другие инструменты для предотвращения небезопасного доступа к компьютеру и защиты конфиденциальности данных. c. Трояны Трояны - это особый вид вредоносного ПО, которое маскируется под полезную программу или файл. Когда троянская программа запускается на компьютере пользователем, она может предоставить злоумышленнику удаленный доступ к системе или выполнять некоторые злонамеренные действия, такие как сбор информации, вымогательство или поломку компьютера. Трояны часто распространяются через электронную почту, незащищенные скачивания или злоумышленные веб-сайты. d. Антиатаки Антиатаки - это программы и методы, разработанные для защиты компьютерной сети от атак и взломов. Они могут включать в себя инструменты брандмауэра, механизмы обнаружения вторжений и системы шифрования данных. Целью антиатак является обнаружение и предотвращение несанкционированного доступа к сети, защита от различных типов атак, таких как отказ в обслуживании (DDoS), взломы паролей или внедрение вредоносного ПО в сеть."},{"instruction":"Что НЕ является типом киберпреступления? a. вмешательство в данные b. незаконный перехват c. незаконный доступ d. перенос лицензии ПО на другой ПК","output":"d. перенос лицензии ПО на другой ПК Перенос лицензии программного обеспечения на другой компьютер не является прямым типом киберпреступления.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"INT.

The quiet night is pierced by the sound of agitated footsteps approaching. CUT TO: SARA, a Lebanese American college senior with unruly curls and a rebellious sparkle in her eyes, is edging toward the front door. Her stylish leather pants make a creaking noise with each hurried step. She struggles, visibly uncomfortable, with a mounting pressure in her bowels. Her face is painted with desperation. EXT. FAMILY HOUSE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Sara fumbles through her pockets, her fingers clawing for salvation—a key that isn't there. Her eyes widen and her dance of unease intensifies. SARA (shouting) Mom! Dad! Anyone? She slams her fist against the door, her other arm clenching her abdomen. Each knock is a plea for mercy. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS LEILA, Sara's mother, a middle-aged woman with a graceful posture and warm features, hears the commotion from the kitchen. She wipes her hands on her apron and rushes to the door, curiosity etched on her face. LEILA (bewildered) A'leik! What's all this knocking?! EXT. FAMILY HOUSE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Sara's knocking grows frantic, perhaps even panicked. SARA Hurry, Mom, please! INT. FAMILY HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Leila fumbles with the lock, her movements inexplicably slow, splintering Sara's patience. EXT. FAMILY HOUSE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The door opens a crack, and Sara tries to squeeze through. Leila, however, blocks the passage, her hands gripping Sara's shoulders, maternal concern flooding her expression. LEILA (concerned) Shu? What's wrong? SARA (struggling) It's nothing... can you just... move?! They tussle briefly in the doorway, a small ballet of urgency against concern. INT. FAMILY HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Sara winces, a groan ripping through the air as control slips through her grasp. She stands still, shocked as she fills her pants, relief mingling with mortification. Leila's grip loosens, her brows knitting in confusion. LEILA (confused) Sara, ya hayete, what's happening? Sara, gripping her dignity alongside her now soiled pants, musters a hushed grunt, an intimate chorus to a private release. She whispers a strangled \\"Oh, thank God...\\" INT. FAMILY HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Leila continues to press for answers, but the scent hits her first—a wretched wave. She sniffs the air, wrinkles her nose. LEILA (wrinkling her nose) What on e— Sara looks at her with a mute appeal, her face a twisted medley of relief and shame. Realization dawns on Leila. LEILA (disgusted) Did you... no, tell me you didn't! SARA (mortified) I need to get to the bathroom, okay? Leila recoils, her body language repulsed but proactive as she beckons Sara in reluctantly. Sara shuffles past her mother, stiff-legged and ginger. LEILA (cutting her off) Stop right there. Don't you dare drop... She assesses the damage, dismay disguised as derision. LEILA (teasing) You're a mess, Sara. This is disgusting! When will you grow up? SARA (playfully sulk) It’s your fault! Had to go so bad, and you— LEILA (incredulous) Excusing yourself? At your age? They stand frozen, a duo locked in a standoff over an admittedly messy situation. Sara sulks, shifting her weight, while Leila stands, hands on hips. SARA (defensive) I couldn't hold it! You kept blocking me! Examining her behind, Sara winces at the feel of her distended pants but can't suppress a smirk. SARA (playfully) It did feel good, though. LEILA (stern) Disgusting. That’s enough. Get cleaned up. She grabs Sara, preventing her from escaping to the bathroom. Examining her soiled pants, Leila smells near the aftermath with exaggerated disgust. LEILA (mockingly) Someone needs their diaper changed. SARA (smirking) You're the one holding me back. Enjoy the aroma. LEILA (ushering) Enough, you dirty girl. To the bathroom. No dropping... She steers Sara along with comic repulsion, her actions an offbeat dance of containment. INT. BATHROOM ENTRY - NIGHT At the threshold, Sara halts, her hand squishing the bulge impishly as she feigns innocence. SARA (teasing) So, will you change me? Leila, reaching her wit's end, shoves Sara forward, a forceful squash resonating with finality. LEILA (pushes) Get in there, now! Sara howls as the mess smears internally, laments the demise of her fashionable leather. SARA (shrieking) Ruined! I can feel it all over! LEILA (snarky) Shouldn’t have teased, ya zalameh. She shuts the door on the comical tableau, retreating as she grumbles about aromatic tribulations borne of motherhood. LEILA (muttering) How can my own daughter stink so bad?

Synopsis: Act 1 - Clash of Titans: The movie opens to the resounding echoes of a battle between Batman and Superman. Their ideological differences have come to a head, creating tension throughout Gotham City. Bruce Wayne was prepared for every scenario, or so he thought. Batman employs a Kryptonite-powered suit and weapons to level the playing field against Superman. The two titans clash in an epic showdown under the dark, stormy skies of Gotham, their fight taking them across the city, damaging everything in their path. Unfortunately, their battle is interrupted by a new foe, an extraterrestrial creature, Doomsday, which is unleashed by Lex Luthor in his attempt to rid the world of both heroes. In the heat of the destruction, unintentionally exacerbated by Batman's efforts to weaken Superman, Superman sacrifices himself to save Batman from a deadly blow by Doomsday, which unexpectedly results in Superman’s demise. Act 2 - The Burden of the Cowl: With Superman gone, Batman is left to confront his role in Clark's death and his own feelings about what Superman represented. Gotham's criminal underworld takes advantage of the absence of the Man of Steel, and crime begins to rise at an alarming rate. Bruce must deal with his grief, guilt, and the haunting feeling that his crusade against Superman went too far. Batman grows increasingly reckless in his crime-fighting, pushing himself to the limit, almost in a bid for his own kind of penance. Alfred and others in Bruce's life worry for his mental state, urging him to seek allies and to rebuild rather than to break himself down. Act 3 - Redemption and Legacy: As Batman continues his solitary war on crime, a new threat reveals itself: a secret society called \\"The Court of Owls,\\" which has its sights set on controlling Gotham through fear and manipulation. Batman investigates, slowly unraveling the mystery of the organization that has been puppeteering Gotham's elite. In his journey, he encounters other heroes inspired by Superman's legacy: Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Cyborg. Though resistant at first, Batman realizes he doesn’t have to carry the burden alone. To honor Superman's belief in humanity and teamwork, Batman agrees to ally with the new heroes. Epilogue - Dawn of Justice: Batman, with the help of his newfound allies, uncovers and confronts the leaders of the Court of Owls. Ultimately, he uses his strategic acumen, bolstered by his friends' abilities, to dismantle the organization. As the movie draws to a close, Batman and the other heroes establish the foundations for the Justice League in honor of Superman's memory. Batman has found a new purpose, not just to avenge, but to inspire and work together for the greater good. We see Batman on a rooftop looking over Gotham, the Bat-Signal lighting up the night sky. He's no longer the solitary Dark Knight; he's a leader and a beacon of hope, even in the absence of the greatest among them. As he disappears into the night, we know that Batman's war on crime continues, but now with renewed conviction and a legacy that will never be forgotten."},{"instruction":"What is a lab that I can do that encompasses these topics using only homemade materials.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"INT. FAMILY HOUSE, SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING FADE IN: **Background:** We Jackhammer into the middle of a comic ordeal. The story thus far: Laila, the rebellious Lebanese American college senior, just left a rowdy social event for a quick pitstop at her family's house. Between the spicy Lebanese meze she couldn’t resist and the laughter shaking her belly, nature began its relentless call. In her hurry, she bypassed rest stops and speed-walked past puzzled neighbors. Adrenaline kept the surmounting urge at bay - until now. As luck would have it, her potty-break timing is as off as her misplaced house key. CUT TO: EXT. HOUSE DOOR - CONTINUOUS LAILA, mid 20s, disheveled waves cascading down her relaxed leather pants, reaches for her keys and finds an empty pocket. Panic breaks through her face as the urge spirals. She FRANTICALLY KNOCKS on the door. No response. Seconds crawl as her distress peaks. She squirms as her insides roil, caught in a carnivalesque twist of Darwinism and Murphy's law. Suddenly, a voice from within - MARIAM, her mother, late 50s, a cozy figure draped in a well-worn shawl, her face a blend of sleep and worry. MARIAM (O.S.) (shouting) Shou? Min aya hada? (What? Who is it?) LAILA (Muffled desperation) Mama! Open up, hurry! Mariam takes her sweet time, fumbling with chains and deadbolts - a Sisyphean test for Laila's colon. INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door inched open. Mariam’s concerned eyes widen at Laila’s antsy dance. LAILA (Pleads) Layk ya Mama, stop asking, and let me in! Mariam's maternal grip takes hold of Laila's arm, barraging her with questions. LAILA Desperately attempting to slip past Mariam. I'm fine, I just really need to get inside, please! Their tug-of-war inches towards the absurd as Mariam's bewilderment locks horns with Laila's mounting desperation. Suddenly, Laila’s body betrays her – an ABRUPT GROAN, her stance stiffens. Mariam lets go in shock. LAILA Face a symphony of shock and illicit relief as she reluctantly gives in to her body, GRUNTING with every indulgent push. MARIAM (Grimaces) Shu fi maik, Laila? (What's wrong with you?) Laila mutters between sighs of guilty satisfaction, her words defeated by the primal grunt of her dispatch. Mariam recoils as the foul reality snakes into the room. MARIAM (Sniffs) Wayn hayda ra'iha? (What's this smell?) Laila meets Mariam’s eyes. Mortification and a relieved blush war on her face. MARIAM (Incredulous) Inti 3amm tswi hayda li aatiq fi? You didn’t... Silence. MARIAM (Revulsion rising) You Nawara chi wassakh? You pooped your pants? Avoidance in Laila's plea as her denial wears skinny. LAILA Just let me pass, please. Mariam steps back, gingerly gesturing, appalled and impatient. INT. HOUSE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Laila shuffles inside, cupping her tragedy. Mariam, astonishment graduated to exasperation, bars her advance. MARIAM (Grimacing) Hold it right there! No steps further, you hear? Laila’s indignation has a sheepish flavor. MARIAM Insistent, poking Laila's filial guilt. I might have raised you better than this, yalli wassakh. (Such dirty!) Laila stands victim to Mariam's olfactory distress and her meticulous examination. MARIAM Hand on hips, exasperated. When will you act your age and not like a child? Laila’s defense wears a playful edge, slightly piqued. LAILA (Sulks) You took forever. I had no choice... MARIAM (Snarls) That's your excuse? Really, Laila? Laila, feigning huff, resigns to confession. LAILA A grimacing touch to her own disaster. Needed relief. When you gotta go, you gotta go. Mariam pulls a closer look at Laila's disgrace, uttering taunts. MARIAM (Mockery dripping) Seems like you enjoyed acclimating to wessakhetik. (Your mess) Laila banters back, timid about her compromised state. LAILA (Protests) Too much pressure! It felt... Well, really relieving. MARIAM Staged exasperation. That's no excuse! You’re not a toddler anymore! Laila cringes; Mariam leans in, acting the mocking mother hen. MARIAM (Sniffs, reacts) For God's sake, what’s that dreadful smell? Laila, cornered yet endearingly sassy. LAILA Irked. Since you won’t let me clean, savour the aroma. Mariam terminates Laila's shame spiral, urgency renewed. MARIAM Urging Laila forward. Go clean up. I can't bear this stench! As they proceed, Mariam maintains her disgusted charade, aiding Laila in the containment of her mess. Amused by the absurdity, Laila toys with Mariam’s patience at the bathroom portal, her hand squishing the evidence. LAILA (Flaunts her predicament) Change my diaper maybe? Mariam’s patience implodes. In mocking disgust, she squashes Laila's mishap, propelling her inside. MARIAM Taking action. Get in, you dirty brat! Laila's outcry betrays the extent of the damage. LAILA (Disgust) Now it's everywhere! As Laila's forced retreat seals behind a closed door, Mariam's disbelief escapes her. MARIAM (Shudders) How is it my daughter smells like Jabal Sannine’s garbage dump? Mariam walks away, bemused and repulsed, her soliloquy lingering in the air as laughter is heard from behind the doors. FADE OUT.

Trong bất kỳ mô hình máy học nào, việc thêm dữ liệu vào tập huấn luyện (training set) là hoàn toàn khả thi và thường là một bước quan trọng để cải thiện hiệu suất mô hình. Dữ liệu huấn luyện càng đa dạng và phong phú, mô hình sẽ càng có cơ hội học được những đặc trưng và mẫu số phức tạp, qua đó nâng cao chất lượng dự đoán hoặc phân lớp. Để thêm dữ liệu vào tệp huấn luyện, bạn cần tuân theo các bước sau: 1. **Thu thập dữ liệu mới**: Tìm nguồn dữ liệu phù hợp và thu thập dữ liệu mới để mở rộng tập huấn luyện. 2. **Tiền xử lý dữ liệu**: Đảm bảo rằng dữ liệu mới được xử lý và chuẩn hóa một cách phù hợp để phù hợp với định dạng và tiêu chuẩn của tập dữ liệu huấn luyện hiện tại. 3. **Kết hợp dữ liệu**: Hợp nhất dữ liệu mới vào tập dữ liệu huấn luyện sẵn có, chú ý đến việc tránh gây ra vấn đề mất cân bằng dữ liệu. 4. **Huấn luyện lại mô hình**: Sử dụng tập dữ liệu đã được mở rộng để huấn luyện lại mô hình từ đầu hoặc tiến hành fine-tuning – điều chỉnh thêm trên mô hình đã được huấn luyện sẵn. 5. **Đánh giá mô hình**: Kiểm tra xem việc thêm dữ liệu có cải thiện hiệu suất mô hình hay không thông qua các phương pháp đánh giá và validation. Lưu ý rằng tùy vào kiến trúc và đặc thù của dữ liệu quy đổi cho từng mô hình mà việc thêm dữ liệu có thể đơn giản hoặc phức tạp. Luôn chú ý đến các vấn đề như overfitting, underfitting và đảm bảo rằng mô hình không chỉ hoạt động tốt trên dữ liệu đã biết mà còn có khả năng tổng quát hóa tốt trên dữ liệu mới. Nếu \\"BLIP\\" trên thực tế liên quan đến một chủ đề cụ thể không nằm trong những giả thuyết trên, vui lòng cung cấp thêm thông tin hoặc context chi tiết hơn để có thể đưa ra câu trả lời chính xác hơn."},{"instruction":"Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large","output":"\\"Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large\\" có thể đề cập đến một mô hình máy học được phát triển bởi Salesforce cho nhiệm vụ tạo caption (mô tả) cho hình ảnh, và được triển khai với kích thước \\"large\\" để có khả năng hiểu được những đặc điểm phức tạp và tạo ra những caption chính xác hơn. Đối với các mô hình captioning hình ảnh cụ thể như \\"Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large,\\" việc thêm dữ liệu vào tập huấn luyện là một quá trình thường thấy để cải thiện hiệu suất mô hình. Bạn có thể thêm dữ liệu dựa trên các bước sau: 1. **Thu thập Dữ liệu**: Dữ liệu dùng cho nhiệm vụ này thường bao gồm các cặp hình ảnh và mô tả tương ứng. Dữ liệu mới thu thập cần phải được chọn lọc cẩn thận để đảm bảo chất lượng. 2. **Xử lý Dữ liệu**: Dữ liệu mới cần được tiền xử lý để đảm bảo rằng hình ảnh và caption phù hợp với định dạng yêu cầu của mô hình, như độ phân giải hình ảnh và cấu trúc văn bản. 3. **Mở rộng Tập Huấn luyện**: Integrate the processed new data with the existing dataset, ensuring the new dataset remains balanced (i.e., diversity in images and captions). 4. **Huấn luyện lại Mô hình**: Bạn cần huấn luyện lại mô hình BLIP với tập dữ liệu mở rộng, hoặc nếu đủ điều kiện, tiến hành fine-tuning. 5. **Đánh giá**: Chạy các thử nghiệm và đánh giá để xem liệu việc thêm dữ liệu có thực sự cải thiện khả năng của mô hình không. Điều quan trọng khi làm việc với mô hình cụ thể từ một nguồn như Salesforce là phải tuân thủ các giới hạn và yêu cầu do họ đặt ra, cũng như quy định về bản quyền và sử dụng dữ liệu. Ngoài ra, khi làm việc với các tệp tin và mô hình cụ thể của một dự án GitHub, hãy nhớ kiểm tra các file README và LICENSE để hiểu các ràng buộc và hướng dẫn sử dụng hoặc góp phần phát triển mô hình."},{"instruction":"could you write an teaser trailer Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice but with Small Soldiers (1998) take over the trailer","output":"[Darkness.

In the quart-sized plastic bag, mix the half and half, sugar, and vanilla extract. Seal the bag tightly to prevent leaks. 2. Fill the gallon-sized plastic bag halfway with ice and add the rock salt. 3. Place the sealed quart-sized bag with the cream mixture into the gallon-sized bag with the ice. 4. Seal the gallon-sized bag and shake vigorously for about 5 minutes or until the cream mixture has solidified into ice cream. Use gloves or a towel to protect your hands from the cold. 5. Remove the quart-sized bag, wipe off the salt, and check the consistency of your ice cream. **Questions and Connections:** **Chemical & Physical Change:** - What physical changes occurred during this lab? (The cream's temperature dropped, and it changed from a liquid state to a semi-solid state.) - Was there any evidence of a chemical change in this lab? Explain why or why not. (No chemical change occurred, as the ingredients did not form new substances with new chemical properties.) **Measurement:** - How would the result change if the measurements of the ingredients were inaccurate? (Inaccurate measurements can alter the taste and texture of the ice cream, proving the importance of precise measurement in chemical reactions and recipes.) - Why is the amount of rock salt important in this process? (The rock salt lowers the freezing point of the ice, which allows the ice cream mixture to freeze. If too little or too much salt is used, the process may not work as effectively.) **Conclusion/Reflection:** - Discuss how the principles of heat transfer played a role in making the ice cream. (Heat was transferred from the cream mixture to the surrounding ice, causing the mixture to freeze.) - What role did the rock salt play in facilitating the transfer of heat? (Rock salt lowers the freezing/melting point of ice, allowing it to absorb more heat from the cream mixture before melting itself.) This lab efficiently demonstrates chemical and physical changes, as well as the necessity of precise measurement, all while using simple materials that are easy to clean up."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence.

FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY** *Flashback: The preceding scene entails LAYLA, a rebellious Lebanese American college senior known for her sharp wit and tendency to push boundaries, dancing and engaging with friends at a bustling college social event. She dismisses the first signs of her body's urgent need, confident she can make it home in time. However, lingering farewells and a relentless attraction to the snack table delay her departure. Unbeknownst to her, the clock is ticking on her digestive system's patience.* **FADE IN:** EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY LAYLA (25, dark, lively eyes, a mane of curly hair pulled back into a messy bun, wearing relaxed leather pants and a chic, rebellious leather jacket) makes a beeline toward the modest two-story house where she lives with her family. She emanates a sense of barely contained panic, taking short, tight steps. INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS **LAYLA** (muttering to herself) C'mon, c'mon... She fumbles in her purse, the search growing frantic. With dread, she realizes her house key is missing. **LAYLA** (noticing the missing key, to herself) No, no, no... She pounds on the door with growing desperation, glancing around helplessly. **LAYLA** (yelling) Mama! Open up! No answer. Her face contorts as the pressure within surges. INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS MAMA, a stout Lebanese woman in her 50s, with a loving but no-nonsense demeanor, pokes her head from the kitchen, startled by the noise. INT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS **MAMA** (curious, from behind the door) Shoo hayda? Layla, is that you? Mama fumbles with the lock. Layla hops from one foot to the other, holding her stomach with one hand. **LAYLA** (enraged, impatient) Hurry, Mama, please! The door finally swings open, revealing Mama's puzzled face. Layla tries to bolt past her. **MAMA** (concerned, holding Layla) Wait! Shoo fee? **LAYLA** (pleading, dodging) Please Mama, not now. Move! Their light scuffle ensues; Mama's concern clashing with Layla's desperation. Suddenly, Layla's body gives in. **LAYLA** (groaning, face a mask of shock and relief) Oh no... Mama's grip loosens out of shock. **MAMA** (fumbling) Layla, shoo fee ma'ik? Layla gently eases away, taking a stance reminiscent of a child's potty dance, her body tensing as she grunts with exertion. **LAYLA** (strained and soft with relief) Just a second... it... feels... Mama, befuddled and concerned, sniffles the air. **MAMA** (nose wrinkling, confused) Shoo hada smell? Layla, now standing in a half-squat, gives a final push, her face twisting in satisfaction. **LAYLA** (sheepish) I...I... The smell hits Mama like a truck. **MAMA** (disgusted bewilderment) Layla, shu seret ma'ik? Mish ma'ool! Silence from Layla. **MAMA** (as she continues to react to the odor) Inti... haramteh?! Layla inches toward the interior, her movements awkward and ginger. **LAYLA** (avoiding the question) Can I get by now? Mama, now pinching her nose shut, ushers Layla impatiently inside. **MAMA** (disgusted) Go, go... Layla waddles past, clasping the back of her leather pants. **MAMA** (sternly, holding Layla back) Stand there! Don't you dare drop it on my floors. LAYLA stands frozen; shame starting to give way to indignation. **MAMA** (tauntingly) Khara! My grown daughter, what a smell! **LAYLA** (defensive, playful sulk) It's your fault–too slow with the door! Mama rejects the accusation with an incredulous look. **MAMA** (continuing her taunting) This is childish, Layla! **LAYLA** (mock solemnity) It was an emergency, Mama. Layla's hand involuntarily probes the damage; a grimace meets her exploration. **LAYLA** (playful, resigned) It felt good to let it out... but, time to clean up. As she moves, Mama blocks her path, scolding. **MAMA** (mocking disdain) Acting so pleased with this nastiness! With more effort than enthusiasm, Layla turns around under Mama's inquisitive eye, and Mama can't help but make light of the situation. **MAMA** (still mockingly taunting) Looks like you enjoyed it! **LAYLA** (nervous bicker) Had to... empty out... Mama lets out an exasperated sigh. **MAMA** (in a scolding tone) You are filthy! Mama hovers over Layla's pants, sniffing dramatically, Layla cringes, clearly uncomfortable. **MAMA** (teasingly admonishing) What a stink! Just like a baby... LAYLA reacts, resignation in her cringe. **LAYLA** If you like, leave me here with it. **MAMA** (scoffs) No! This smell... Go, clean up! Layla shuffles, contorting with every step. Mama guides her with exaggerated caution. **MAMA** Don't you dare drop any... **LAYLA** It feels... like it's sliding... **MAMA** (retorts, overdone) Akh, keep it in! They reach the bathroom. Layla halts at the threshold, teasing. **LAYLA** (smiling wryly) Change my diaper, Mama? Mama, her patience worn to a playful edge, goads Layla forward, deliberately squishing the bulge. **MAMA** (holding her nose) Get in there already! LAYLA (disgusted and loud) It's spreading! As Mama closes the door, she wonders aloud to herself about the parenting curveball she's been thrown. **MAMA** (shaking her head) Shu hayda binti? How she can smell so terrible! **CUT TO BLACK.**"},{"instruction":"What is a lab that I can do that encompasses these topics using only readily available household chemicals. Make sure the lab and the questions in the lab connect to all of the topics and guide students through an exploration to construct understanding of the content. Also make sure to ask a question about each topic and connect each questions to the lab. Also make sure that for each lab that you don't use unnecesary materials and that are easy and quick to clean up. TOPIC 0A: Chemistry, Scientific Method and Chemical & Physical Change TOPIC 0B: Measurement TOPIC 0C: Atomic Theory TOPIC 0D: Nomenclature","output":"# Lab Activity: Baking Soda and Vinegar Reaction Objective: To explore chemical reactions, the scientific method, measurements, atomic theory, and nomenclature through a simple home-based lab using baking soda and vinegar. Materials Needed: - Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) - Vinegar (dilute acetic acid) - Measuring cups and spoons - Digital kitchen scale (optional for advanced measurement) - Balloons - Empty plastic bottle - Safety goggles - Gloves Safety: Wear safety goggles and gloves to protect your eyes and skin from any splashes that might occur during the experiment. Procedure: 1. Measure 2 tablespoons (about 30 grams) of baking soda and pour it into the empty plastic bottle. 2. Carefully pour 1/2 cup of vinegar into a balloon using a funnel without spilling any on the outside of the balloon. 3. Cover the mouth of the bottle with the balloon, making sure not to let any vinegar spill into the bottle yet. 4. Once you've secured the balloon, lift it to allow the vinegar to mix with the baking soda. 5. Observe the reaction and document any physical changes that occur. Questions and Connection to Topics: **TOPIC 0A: Chemistry, Scientific Method and Chemical & Physical Change** - Question: What observations can you make that indicate a chemical reaction is taking place between baking soda and vinegar? How can you tell a new substance is forming? - Connection: The lab introduces students to the indicators of a chemical reaction such as the production of gas (carbon dioxide), a change in temperature, and the formation of new substances. **TOPIC 0B: Measurement** - Question: How do the measurements of baking soda and vinegar affect the reaction? What might happen if you doubled the amounts used? - Connection: The students will practice precise measurement of substances to observe how the quantities affect the extent and rate of the chemical reaction. **TOPIC 0C: Atomic Theory** - Question: Based on atomic theory, what happens to the atoms of the reactants (baking soda and vinegar) during the chemical reaction? - Connection: The students examine how the atoms in the baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and vinegar (acetic acid, CH3COOH) are rearranged to form new products (sodium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide). **TOPIC 0D: Nomenclature** - Question: Can you write the chemical equation for the reaction between baking soda and vinegar using the correct chemical formulas for the reactants and products? - Connection: By writing the balanced chemical equation, students get a chance to practice chemical nomenclature and balance equations to respect the law of conservation of mass. Chemical Equation: ( text{NaHCO}_3(aq) + text{CH}_3text{COOH}(aq) rightarrow text{NaCH}_3text{COO}(aq) + text{H}_2text{O}(l) + text{CO}_2(g) ) Cleanup: - Neutralize any leftover vinegar or baking soda with water. - Dispose of the balloon and any remaining mixture in the household trash and wash the bottle with water. - Thoroughly clean and dry the measuring spoons and any other equipment used. By simplifying and aligning the lab with the concepts of general chemistry, this practical lab can serve as a resourceful tool for understanding these foundational topics while involving a hands-on learning approach."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Lebanese American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a rebellious college senior; she is wearing relaxed leather pants in the scene) is returning home from a social event and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable.

SOCIAL EVENT - NIGHT Marie, a spirited Lebanese American college senior with an untamable mane of curly dark hair, laughs heartily with friends, their jovial voices blending into an indistinct hubbub. The brimming room is alive with the clinking of glasses and chatter, low light casting an amber glow on the revelers. Marie, a nonconformist at heart, stands out, donning a chic pair of relaxed leather pants and a bold top that challenges the conventional. Marie's laughter is interrupted by a mounting discomfort within her gut. She excuses herself, her boisterous energy replaced by a look of concern as she navigates the crowded space, only to find a long queue outside the ladies' room. CUT TO: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT Marie strides purposefully toward her family's home, her discomfort intensifying with every step. Her laugh lines have been replaced by a furrowed brow. Stopping for a moment, she clutches her stomach, cursing the pre-party street food that now wages war on her insides. EXT. FAMILY HOUSE DOOR - CONTINUOUS Marie reaches the door, frantically patting down her pockets for her house key. Each pocket only offers lint and odd bits – no key. Panic rises; she has no time to waste. She pounds her fist on the door, each knock desperate and loud in the still night. INT. FAMILY HOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS Marie’s mother, AMIRA, a woman in her late 40s with olive skin and sharp, intuitive eyes, is startled by the ruckus. She hurries to the door, her elegant house dress swishing around her ankles. AMIRA (through the door, in a thick Lebanese accent) Who's banging on my door like the police at midnight? MARIE Mama, it's me! Open up, quick! The urgency in Marie's voice accelerates Amira's movements, but confusion causes her fingers to fumble with the deadbolt. AMIRA (under her breath) Every time, this girl comes... The door finally swings inward, revealing Marie, hunched slightly, face flushed with distress. AMIRA (CONT'D) (slightly concerned) Marie? What's wrong with you? MARIE (impatiently) Just move, Mama! Marie tries to sidestep Amira, but her mother's concern morphs into caution; she grips Marie's arm. AMIRA (scrutinizing Marie) Tell me what is happening! MARIE (clutching her abdomen, pleading) Mama, please, I need to get past— Their bickering escalates; Amira's grip is unwavering, Marie's desperation nearing its peak. Words blur into a heated, comical squabble. MARIE (CONT'D) (practically whimpering) Mama, for the love of— Marie's eyes widen with shock and a guttural groan escapes her lips; she can't hold it any longer. She starts to sag under the pressure, and Amira's grip instinctively loosens out of shock. AMIRA (confused and concerned) Marie, habibti, what are— Marie gently but assertively eases out of her mother's loosened grip and assumes a slightly squatting position. MARIE (voice hushed, strained with relief, softly grunting) I can't, I just—I needed... Amira looks on, befuddled and speechless, as Marie grunts softly with exertion and a hint of satisfaction flits across her face. AMIRA (wrinkling her nose, sniffing cautiously) Marie? What did you do? Marie gazes back, her face a mix of sheepish guilt and resignation, as the stark realization sweeps over Amira's features. AMIRA (CONT'D) (disgusted bewilderment) No... you didn’t just... Silence hangs between them. Then: AMIRA (CONT'D) (more directly, wrinkling her nose) Did you poop your pants? Marie squirms, avoiding the question. MARIE (slightly edgy) Can I please go inside now? Reluctantly, Amira steps aside, waving Marie in with visible repulsion. Marie shuffles inside, cupping the seat of her pants tentatively, while Amira halts her barely past the threshold. AMIRA (scolding) We do not just stand around and soil ourselves, Marie! Yallah, move! Marie stands, mortified, as Amira continues her scolding. Meanwhile, Marie tries to shift the blame. MARIE (playfully sulking) It’s your fault, took forever to open the door... Amira scoffs at the absurdity, further teasing Marie about her childish behavior. Marie rebuffs, insistently blaming her mother's interference for her lapse, hand hesitantly appraising her pant's bulge, with a mixture of complacency and playful wince. MARIE (CONT'D) (reluctantly proud) Well, it did feel good to let it out. Amira, appalled yet somewhat amused, blocks Marie from heading to the bathroom for a closer inspection of her soiled pants. She jests, further mocking Marie's contentment and the unsettling bulge now evident in her pants. MARIE (bickering in her defense, touching the bulge) There was a lot... I needed relief. AMIRA (exclaiming in mock horror) You didn't need to turn it into a spectacle, Marie! Act your age! Amira condescendingly sniffs at her daughter, treating her like a child. Marie cringes, yet upon smelling herself, quips that if she must wait, they can both \\"enjoy\\" the stench together. AMIRA (handing a final, playful blow) Do you think I want to sit here with your smell? Yallah, let's go, no drops on the floor! Amira leads and assists Marie's painstaking journey toward the bathroom, while complaining humorously about the odor and adding to Marie's embarrassed cringing. The spectacle is comedic, endearingly human, tinged with maternal concern beneath the jesting tone. Upon reaching the bathroom, with a touch of impish defiance, Marie stalls at the entry to ask if Amira will change her \\"diaper\\". However, Amira decisively forces her into the bathroom, lamenting her daughter's insufferable stench. AMIRA (shoving Marie forward) Get in there, you smelly child! Hurry! INT. BATHROOM THRESHOLD - CONTINUOUS With one final surge of comedic frustration, Amira, holding her nose with one hand, mockingly adjusts the mess with the other, giving Marie a little push for her insolence. Marie exclaims in disgust, lamenting her spoiled pants. Once inside, Amira slams the door shut, a final sigh escaping her lips as she mutters to herself the baffling nature of her daughter's stench. Amira leaves, her silhouette retreating from the closed door, the house returning to silence, save for the muffled sound of water and the stealthy echo of Amira's mutterings.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"Title: \\"Relief at Home’s Threshold\\" INT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHT Background: We open the scene just after RAYYA, a rebellious Lebanese American college senior in her early 20s with wavy brown hair, wearing trendy yet pragmatic relaxed leather pants, has spent an evening at an off-campus poetry slam. After soaking in the caffeine from numerous espressos and resisting the urge to use the notoriously unsanitary campus restrooms, her fight to find solace for her digestive distress has taken a dire turn. Now, with her abdomen in turmoil from dodging bathroom trips all night, she's returned home, steps away from relief. Rayya’s hurried pace and hunched posture are clear signs of a woman fighting nature’s call. She reaches the front door and digs through her purse, but the expanding horror on her face reveals her keys are not there. Panic striates her face. The clock, it seems, is ticking faster. She begins to knock feverishly, the sound echoing through the quiet house. There's an excruciating beat of silence until a shuffle and a muffled voice can be heard from inside. FADIA, a Lebanese woman in her 50s—Rayya’s mom—appears on the other side of the door. Round, with short, curly salt-and-pepper hair, wearing a floral robe, she questions what’s happening with robust concern in her voice. RAYYA (opening with desperation) Mom! Open the door, quick! Fadia takes what seems like an eternity fumbling with the locks. Rayya dances on the spot, her face contorted with suppressed urgency as she resists stating the obvious. The door finally swings open revealing Fadia's puzzled expression. Without wasting another breath, Rayya bolts forward but is met by a barricade of maternal concern as Fadia grabs onto her, looking deep into her daughter’s frantic eyes for an explanation. FADIA (concerned) Rayya, ya helwe, what's wrong? Tell me! Desperation peaks. Rayya tries to wriggle out of the grip, each plea for Fadia to move growing more exasperated. RAYYA Just step aside, please! Their bickering is a clumsy dance of concern and urgency—Rayya’s trouble spiking by the second. At once, the dam breaks, and the unspeakable occurs. Rayya’s body accepts defeat, groaning—a mix of shock and untimely relief washes over her face. Fadia's grip loosens, confusion coating her features. FADIA (baffled) Rayya, what is...? Rayya takes a step back, finding a more accommodating stance for her relief as she shamelessly unloads. Fadia’s queries only draw out soft grunts and murmured declarations of relief from Rayya. PAINED SILENCE hangs, only to be punctuated by a sniff from Fadia, whose befuddled face switches to one of repulsion. FADIA (recoiling) Yallah! What is that smell? Rayya, sheepish, utters no words—her expression says it all. Realization hits Fadia with disgusted incredulity. FADIA (aghast) Did you just... in your pants? With a silent nod, Rayya sidesteps her mother's shock and waddles inside, cupping the seat of her pants. Humor fades to sternness as Fadia steps in front of her. FADIA (scolding) Stop. Don’t you dare dribble any... I can’t believe you, Rayya. RAYYA (indignantly) It’s your fault... if only you’d hurried up! Aghast, Fadia rejects this with a scoff. FADIA That's no excuse, sheway! And why stand and finish... here? How childish can you get? Rayya, now defensively playful, insists it was an unstoppable necessity. RAYYA (teasing) It was that or explosion! You cornered me, what choice did I have? Fadia grows more disapproving as Rayya assesses the damage inflicted on her pants with a grimace, but then lightens up. RAYYA (smiling despite herself) Though I’ve gotta admit... kinda felt good to let it all out, you know? Fadia's disbelief morphs into stern, mocking censure, blocking Rayya’s way to cleanliness. FADIA (sarcastically) Well aren't you a nasty piece wanting to enjoy your dirtiness. She steps forward, prying to inspect the soiled pants, while Rayya protests half-heartedly. The bulging mess becomes fodder for Fadia's taunts. FADIA (jokingly disgusted) Looks like someone's thoroughly relished doing the nasty. Rayya banters back, touching the bulge again, almost defending her need for relief amid the evident filth. RAYYA (coy) It was huge, what did you expect? But yeah, release was bliss... despite the mess. Fadia chides her further. FADIA (exasperated) Haram alleik! You're too old for your 'blissful' accidents! She then infantilizes Rayya, sniffing her pants in mock concern, reacting dramatically to the smell. FADIA (mimicking) Oh you smelly baby, what did we do? Rayya resigns to a confessing grin. RAYYA (owning it) Yeah, I stink. But if you're loving this interrogation, then let's bask in the aroma. Fadia brushes off the sass, emphasizing urgency with a plugged nose. FADIA (urgent) No more sniffing, yalla to the bathroom! And don’t drop anything! She guides Rayya, both commenting on Rayya’s ordinance woes comically, as they inch toward the bathroom. RAYYA (squirming guiltily) Feels like it’s gonna slip out... FADIA (panicking) Keep it in! Yuck, what a stink! Arriving at the door, Rayya teases once more, pantomiming a diaper change request. Fadia, pushed to her limit, retaliates by squeezing the pants’ bulge, propelling Rayya forward. FADIA (nose pinched) Get your filthy toosh in there now, shoo! A comedic expression of disgust emerges from Rayya as the pants' contents squash. RAYYA (yelling) My pants! The poop’s smeared all inside! They're ruined! Fadia reaffirms Rayya’s deserving fate. FADIA (lecturing) That's for your cheekiness, yalla go! She firmly closes the door behind a disheveled Rayya, remaining outside, rumination evident on her face. FADIA (to herself, perplexed) All the girls in the world, and I get the one who can make a skunk pass out... She shakes her head and walks away, leaving the scene on a comical note of parental bewilderment. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Lebanese American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a rebellious college senior; she is wearing relaxed leather pants in the scene) is returning home from a social event and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her leather pants. Then, the returning woman decries that the leather pants are ruined because she can feel the poop everywhere inside them. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","output":"# Scene: The Urgent Homecoming INT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR - EVENING Title: \\"The Urgent Homecoming\\" # Background: The warmth of the Lebanese-American household is tangible, colored by laughter and an assortment of mouth-watering scents. AMIRA, the rebellious 22-year-old college senior with a jade-green streak in her otherwise jet-black hair, had left the family home earlier in the day with a spring in her step. She wore her relaxed leather pants and a lightweight blouse, an ensemble chosen to merge comfort with a lash of rebellion for the social event she was attending – a literary gathering that celebrated the written word with an abundance of finger foods, cheese platters, and, unfortunately for Amira, copious amounts of coffee which she couldn't resist. Her love for caffeine had her gulping down espresso after espresso, ignoring the familiar, nagging sensation in her belly. Her mind was acutely focused on the animated discussions and the heady atmosphere of poetic discourse. As Amira's night unfolded and the flavorful conversations turned to lively debates of character arcs and literary devices, her body began to send increasingly distressful signals. The clock struck its warning gong, but Amira, ever the engrossed debater, deflected her body's unrest. Finally, as the event concluded, the ignored pleas of her intestine amassed into a surmountable urge to move her bowels. With her home just blocks away, Amira opted against using the event's facilities, an unfortunate miscalculation that now finds her half-walking, half-scurrying towards the safe haven of her family home, where privacy reigns and relief is but a flush away. FADE IN: EXT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR - EVENING Amira's quick steps are replaced by a stiff urgency as she fumbles through her small clutch. Her other hand clutches her stomach, her face painted with lines of distress. She curses under her breath upon realizing that her house key is missing. Antibacterial wipes? Check. Lip gloss? Check. House key? Nowhere to be found. Panic sets in. WITH A DESPERATE URGE AMIRA knocks on the door frantically, grumbling about her misfortune. Her brow glistens with beads of sweat as she shuffles her feet, attempting to stall the storm within. AMIRA (under her breath) Come on, come on... Someone be home... Moments drag on; each passing second escalates Amira's desperate situation. INT. FAMILY HOME - FOYER The house is serene. LAYLA, Amira's mother, a woman in her early fifties clad in a comfortable floral gown with curly peppered hair, hums a Lebanese tune as she undoes her apron. LAYLA (to herself) Anne! Come see the ma'amoul I've done. They're perfect for your bake sale... Layla's hums halt as the KNOCKING echoes. LAYLA (confused) Yalla?! Who could it be at this time? EXT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR LAYLA (O.S.) (shouting through the door) Min hayda? Who is it? AMIRA (urgent, but not revealing) Mama, it's me! Open up, QUICK! INT. FAMILY HOME - FOYER Layla's face softens but soaks in confusion as she approaches the door, unbolt by sluggish unbolt, key by meticulous key. Care is taken, but Amira's patience withers with each drawn-out second. AMIRA (O.S.) (imploring) Mama, please... I really need you to hurry! EXT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR The door finally swings open. Layla stands there, a mix of concern and curiosity on her features. LAYLA (slightly concerned) What is going on, Amira? You look— AMIRA (pleading, rushed) Move, Mama! Amira attempts to shuffle past Layla, but Layla's maternal instinct kick in. She reaches out, blocking Amira’s way with a firm grip. LAYLA You are scaring me, Amira! What's wrong? AMIRA (wrestling with Layla's grip) Mama, please, I need to get past you! The urgency is palpable in Amira's tone, but her pride and the inexplicable nature of her predicament stop her from admitting the truth. Layla, perceiving Amira's concealed distress, grapples with her daughter in the doorway. Then a GROAN breaks from Amira, her face a canvas of shock and untimely relief. Layla's grip on her loosens in bafflement. LAYLA (horrified) Amira, habibti... what is— AMIRA (strained, subdued) Just... move... please... With a soft GRUNT of exertion, Amira assumes a stance that somehow caters to the bodily upheaval. Surprise flickers across Layla's features as she continues to watch Amira with a mix of puzzlement and slow-dawning realization. LAYLA (repeating, softer now) Yallah, Amira... Tell me what's wrong? Only Amira’s muffled affirmations and faint grunts answer her; the inscriptions of relief indelibly marking her demeanor. LAYLA squints, now bewilderment tinged with disgust as the SMELL makes its unwelcome arrival. She sniffs once, twice, her eyes widening as Amira’s sheepish expression confirms her fears. LAYLA (disbelievingly) Did you... No. Don't tell me you— AMIRA (sheepishly, avoiding the query) Can I just... go inside now? Layla's nose crinkles at the stench, an overwhelmed sigh escaping her lips as she steps aside, an arm extended in disgust and impatience. Amira gingerly waddles in, a hand cupping the seat of her soiled leather pants. LAYLA (stopping Amira) Wait! Not one step further! Look at what you've done! AMIRA (sheepishly indignant) It’s not— LAYLA Scoldingly Dirty, dirty child! What a smell? When will you grow up? AMIRA (playful sulk) This is on you, Mama. You took ages... blocked me. LAYLA (incredulously) Excuses? At your age? AMIRA (defensively) I couldn't help it... I had to go bad. Layla's brow furrows, her hand coming to her nose as she looks at Amira's leather-clad backside. LAYLA (mocking concern) Let's see the... outcome. Amira whimpers in protest, but Layla is insistent. The turn reveals a telling bulge. LAYLA (ironically) Do you like that feeling, huh? Full pants? AMIRA (touching bulge timidly) There was so much... I needed relief. Layla sniffs near the bulging pants with exaggerated disgust. LAYLA (derisively) Smells like it. Come here, little one, let me change your... AMIRA (grabbing pants, shrugging) Can't clean if you're holding me here. LAYLA (smacking her nose) Well, I'm not having you stink up the place. Go, clean up! Layla ushers Amira to the bathroom, holding her nose, providing reluctant assistance in containing Amira’s mess. Nonstop remarks on the stench and slipperiness. AMIRA (bashful) I feel it... slipping. Layla warns repeatedly to not drop anything, reinforcing with hands-on help. INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS On the threshold, Amira turns to Layla with a mischievous glint. AMIRA (jokingly) Gonna change my diaper now, Mama? Layla, incredulously frustrated and reaching a boiling point, takes the bait – a playful, disgusted squeeze of the bulge in Amira’s pants pushes her in, spreading the mess. LAYLA (through pinched nose) Get your dirty self in, now! Immediately! Amira yelps, a disgruntled cry as she feels the mess spread within the leather confines. AMIRA (squealing) My pants! You ruined them, I can feel it! Amira enters the bathroom, while an astounded Layla lingers outside, still holding her nose. She shuts the door on her smelly daughter, the gravity of the situation and the odor finally sinking in. LAYLA (to herself) How do I raise a child who stinks up so bad?

One way to factorize it is to look for common terms that might help us simplify (P(x)). We notice that both (x^{12}) and (1) are perfect squares, suggesting that we can write: [ P(x) = (x^5 - 1)(x^7 - 1) + 1 - x^5 + 1 - 1 ] We see that rearranging into terms of (P(x) = (x^5 - 1)(x^7 - 1)) can simplify analysis by examining the signs of each factor individually. 2. **Evaluate the expression for different ranges of ( x ):** To determine whether ( P(x) ) ever becomes negative, we will consider different scenarios for ( x ): - **Case 1: ( x < 0 )** If ( x < 0 ), then both ( x^5 - 1 ) and ( x^7 - 1 ) will be negative because raising a negative number to an odd power results in a negative number: [ x^5 < 0 quad text{and thus} quad x^5 - 1 < -1 ] [ x^7 < 0 quad text{and thus} quad x^7 - 1 < -1 ] Since both factors are negative, their product is positive: [ (x^5 - 1)(x^7 - 1) > 0 ] Hence, ( P(x) > 0 ) when ( x < 0 ). - **Case 2: ( 0 leq x < 1 )** If ( 0 leq x < 1 ), then: [ x^5 < 1 quad text{and thus} quad x^5 - 1 < 0 ] [ x^7 < 1 quad text{and thus} quad x^7 - 1 < 0 ] Both factors are again negative, so their product is positive: [ (x^5 - 1)(x^7 - 1) > 0 ] Hence, ( P(x) > 0 ) when ( 0 leq x < 1 ). - **Case 3: ( x = 1 )** If ( x = 1 ): [ x^{12} - x^{7} - x^{5} + 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0 ] Thus, ( P(1) = 0 ). - **Case 4: ( x > 1 )** If ( x > 1 ), then: [ x^5 > 1 quad text{and thus} quad x^5 - 1 > 0 ] [ x^7 > 1 quad text{and thus} quad x^7 - 1 > 0 ] Both factors are positive, so their product is positive: [ (x^5 - 1)(x^7 - 1) > 0 ] Hence, ( P(x) > 0 ) when ( x > 1 ). **Conclusion:** We have considered all possible values of ( x ). In all cases, ( P(x) geq 0 ). Specifically, ( P(x) > 0 ) for all ( x neq 1 ), and ( P(1) = 0 ).

Since A has a start of 200 m, A only needs to cover 300 m to finish the race, while B needs to cover the full 500 m. A wins by 100 m, which means when A finishes the race, B has covered 400 m (500 m - 100 m). Now, we can set up the ratio of the distances covered by A and B to the time it takes for A to finish the race. Since they both start at the same time and A finishes first, the time taken by both A and B is the same. Let's denote this time as ( t ). For A: Distance covered by A = 300 m Speed of A = ( v_A = frac{300}{t} ) For B: Distance covered by B = 400 m Speed of B = ( v_B = frac{400}{t} ) Now, we can find the ratio of the speeds of A and B: ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{frac{300}{t}}{frac{400}{t}} ) Simplifying the ratio by canceling out the common time factor ( t ): ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{300}{400} ) Reducing the fraction to its simplest form: ( frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{3}{4} ) So, the ratio of the speeds of A and B is boxed{3:4} ."},{"instruction":"Find all integers ( n geq 1 ) such that ( n ) divides both ( 3^n + 1 ) and ( 11^n + 1 ).","output":"Pour trouver tous les entiers ( n geq 1 ) tels que ( n ) divise ( 3^n + 1 ) et ( 11^n + 1 ), procédons par les étapes suivantes: 1. **Cas ( n = 1 ) et ( n = 2 ):** Vérifions d'abord les petits entiers directement: - ( n = 1 ): [ 3^1 + 1 = 4 quad text{et} quad 11^1 + 1 = 12 ] 1 divise 4 et 12.

Simplify the right side of the above equation: [ frac{l_2}{l_1} + frac{l_1}{l_2} = frac{l_1^2 + l_2^2}{l_1 l_2} = frac{(l_1 - l_2)^2 + 2 l_1 l_2}{l_1 l_2} ] 8. Since ((l_1 - l_2)^2 geq 0), we have: [ frac{(l_1 - l_2)^2 + 2 l_1 l_2}{l_1 l_2} > 2 ] 9. Therefore: [ p_1 + p_2 > 2q ] Conclusion: The trader measures goods heavier than twice the weight used for measurement. Thus, the trader loses in this process.

Every second, the hedgehogs move to an adjacent diagonal square. What is the minimum number of squares that are occupied at all times?","output":"1. **Coloring Strategy 1 (Checkerboard pattern coloring)**: - Consider the standard checkerboard coloring of the n times n chessboard where each cell is colored either black or white in an alternating pattern. - According to the problem, each hedgehog moves to a diagonally adjacent cell every second. Consequently, a hedgehog on a black cell will always move to another black cell, and a hedgehog on a white cell will always move to another white cell. - Therefore, hedgehogs on black cells never occupy white cells and vice versa. Hence, **at least two cells are required minimum**, one of each color. 2. **Coloring Strategy 2 (Row-wise alternate coloring)**: - Let's color the chessboard alternately row by row. Label consecutive rows alternately as red and blue, starting with the first row as red. - A hedgehog starting on a red row can only move to a blue row in a single move, and a hedgehog on a blue row can move to a red row. Therefore, similar to the checkerboard pattern, the board will be effectively partitioned into two separate row categories ensuring there's no overlap within each time step. This approach also drives the intuition that even within alternate rows, interaction happens within band pairs. 3. **Combining Both Strategies**: - Merge the checkerboard coloring within the row-wise alternate coloring. Specifically: - Each cell of the board can now be distinctly identified by a combination of two properties: - The color it gets from the alternate row pattern (red/blue), - The intrarow checkerboard pattern (black/white). - This leads to a 4-color combinatorial layout: - Red-Black (RB), - Red-White (RW), - Blue-Black (BB), - Blue-White (BW). Hedging the movement constraints implies: - An RB-grouped hedgehog moves to a BW-grouped hedgehog. - Mechanically, no single type interaction undermines territorial bounds of another given their involuted traversal architecture. 4. **Minimum Occupied Cells Conclusion**: - Since no moves interchange these combined color pairs into one another's domains, each of the four types (RB, RW, BB, BW) must effectively secure sustaining ripple-free territory. - Reductively, **each minimal block is occupying its domain independently without conflict** requires containment within 4 cells in each interaction's minimal basis.

The points (E_1) and (F_1) are the reflections of (E) and (F) with respect to the circumcenter (O). # Step-by-step Proof: 1. Consider the perpendicular bisector (l) of (MN) concerning the points (A), (B), and (C). Let the points of intersection of (l) with (A), (B), and (C) be (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) respectively.

Observe that [ angle A_1F_1E_1 = frac{1}{2}(overparen{NA}_{1}^{circ} + overparen{MC_1}^{circ}). ] Since (overparen{MC_1} = overparen{CN}), [ angle A_1F_1E_1 = frac{1}{2}(overparen{NA}_{1}^{circ} + overparen{CN}^{circ}). ] Given that (overparen{CA}_{1} = overparen{NA}_{1}^{circ} + overparen{CN}^{circ}), we simplify to: [ angle A_1F_1E_1 = frac{1}{2}overparen{CA}_{1}^{circ} = angle A_1A'E_1. ] Therefore, (A_1, F_1, E_1, A') are concyclic, implying that ( angle A'F_1A_1 = angle A'E_1A_1 = angle CE_1B_1 ). 3. Similarly, using the process with point (B), note: [ angle BEM = frac{1}{2}(overparen{BM}^{circ} + overparen{AN}^{circ}) = frac{1}{2}(overparen{BM}^{circ} + overparen{MA}^{circ}), ] since (overparen{AN} = overparen{MA_1}): [ angle BEM = 180^{circ} - frac{1}{2} overparen{BNA}^{circ} = 180^{circ} - angle F_{1}C_{1}B. ] 4. Consequently, (B, F_1, E, C_1) are concyclic, implying ( angle C_1F_1B = angle C_1EB ). 5. Since (angle CE_1B_1 = angle C_1EB) (both relate to their respective reflections and perpendicular bisectors), we also conclude that: [ angle A'F_1A_1 = angle CE_1B_1 = angle C_1EB = angle C_1F_1B. ] 6.

One side of the triangle coincides with the diameter of the semicircle. - We are to show that the center of the circle inscribed in the triangle lies on one side of the square. 2. **Calculation of the side of the square:** - The side of the square inscribed in the semicircle can be calculated using the properties of the geometric configuration. The diagonal of the inscribed square equals the diameter of the semicircle, which is ( 2R ). - We use the formula for the diagonal of a square, ( d = asqrt{2} ), where ( a ) is the side length of the square.

Hence, [ text{Area}_{text{triangle}} = frac{1}{2} times b times h = frac{4R^2}{5} ] - Here, the base ( b = 2R ), thus: [ frac{1}{2} times 2R times h = frac{4R^2}{5} implies h = frac{4R}{5} ] 4. **Verification of the triangle being right-angled:** - Given the conditions, the triangle formed by the diameter ( 2R ) and height ( h ) must be right-angled since one side equals the diameter of the semicircle, implying the hypotenuse ( = 2R ). 5. **Properties of right-angled triangles and circles:** - The altitude from the vertex of the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the triangle into two smaller, similar triangles. This point is also the point where the circle inscribed in the triangle touches the hypotenuse. - The radius ( r ) of the inscribed circle can be determined via the formula ( r = R (3 cdot frac{sqrt{5}}{5} - 1) ), supporting the geometric properties. 6. **Using the distance formula:** - If we introduce the coordinate system with the semicircle equation ( x^2 + y^2 = R^2 ), and ( y geq 0 ), we determine the coordinates of vertices relevant to the triangle and square. - The distance ( d ) between the centers of the inscribed circle and the circular circumference can be calculated as: [ d^2 = r^2 + left( frac{R}{5} right)^2 = R^2 - 2Rr ] - Applying this in the condition ( h = frac{4R}{5} ), we find consistency and the matching constraint. 7. **Conclusion:** - Combining the geometric properties and algebraic relationships, as demonstrated, confirms that the centers of the inscribed circles naturally fulfill the condition of lying on the sides of the inscribed figures. - Therefore, one of the ultimate proofs is that the center of the circle inscribed within the triangle lies on one of the sides of the given square.

Finally, from p(x_1) = frac{1}{1}: [ c = p(x_1) - ax_1^2 - bx_1 ] Since p(x_1), ax_1^2, and bx_1 are rational, c must be rational as well. 9. Thus, p(x) = frac{a}{d}x^2 + frac{b}{d}x + frac{c}{d} where a, b, and c are integers, and d is a natural number. Simplifying further, let's take a prime number q greater than d and |a|. 10. If x_q = frac{r}{s} with r/s in lowest terms: [ pleft(frac{r}{s}right) = frac{a}{d}left(frac{r}{s}right)^2 + frac{b}{d}frac{r}{s} + frac{c}{d} = frac{1}{d s^2}left(ar^2 + brs + cs^2right) ] 11. Therefore: [ qs^2(ar^2 + brs + cs^2) = ds^2 ] 12. Since d < q and q is prime, q would divide s^2 and consequently s, i.e. s = qm. Thus, [ ar^2 + br(qm) + c(qm)^2 = q(d)(qm)^2 ] Leading to: [ ar^2 + brqm + c(qm)^2 = qdm^2 ] This implies a contradiction as the prime q divides the left side but not a. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Hence, there exists a natural number } n text{ such that } p(x) = frac{1}{n} text{ does not have rational solutions.}} ]"},{"instruction":"A certain farm planted pumpkins on 10 acres last year, with a total yield of 20000 kilograms.

Given that the initial yield was 20000 kilograms from 10 acres, and the final yield is 60000 kilograms, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: [ 20000(1+2x)(1+x) = 60000 ] Simplifying this equation, we divide both sides by 20000 to get: [ (1+2x)(1+x) = 3 ] Expanding the left side of the equation gives: [ 1 + 3x + 2x^2 = 3 ] Subtracting 3 from both sides to set the equation to 0: [ 2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find the values of x: [ x_{1} = 0.5, quad x_{2} = -2 ] Since a growth rate cannot be negative, we discard x_{2} = -2.

Let the given quadratic be ( Q(x) = (x - alpha)(x - beta) ). Given the conditions, (alpha neq beta). Without loss of generality, assume (alpha < beta). Then, the interval ((alpha, beta)) is contained in (I). 2. By the given conditions, (Q(x)) is negative on (I) and non-negative outside (I). Since (Q(x)) is a quadratic polynomial, it changes sign at its roots (alpha) and (beta). Therefore, (I) must be ((alpha, beta)). 3. By continuity, (P(x)) must also be zero at (alpha) and (beta) because (P(x)) takes negative values on (I) and non-negative values outside (I). Thus, (P(alpha) = 0) and (P(beta) = 0). 4. Since (P(x)) has roots at (alpha) and (beta), we can write (P(x) = Q(x)R(x)), where (R(x)) is a monic quadratic polynomial. 5. Assume for contradiction that (P(x) geq Q(x)) for all (x in mathbb{R}).

To find the relative speed in meters per second, we convert the speed from km/hr to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hr): Relative speed = 10 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) = (10 * 1000) / 3600 m/s = 10000 / 3600 m/s = 2.777... m/s The faster train takes 18 seconds to completely pass the slower train.

This means the lateral surface area of the cylinder, which is now a square, can be represented as S_{text{lateral}} = A^{2}. 2. **Calculating the Lateral Surface Area**: Given the side length A, the lateral surface area of the cylinder (now a square) is S_{text{lateral}} = A^2. 3. **Total Surface Area of the Cylinder**: The total surface area of the cylinder includes its lateral surface area plus the areas of the two circular bases. Since the circumference of the base equals the side length of the square (A), the radius of the base is frac{A}{2pi}. Therefore, the area of one base is pi left(frac{A}{2pi}right)^{2}. Since there are two bases, their combined area is 2pi left(frac{A}{2pi}right)^{2}.

The new product involving these terms is: [ (u-1)(v+1) = uv + (u - v - 1) > uv. ] - This shows that if there is any (u) and (v) with (u - v > 1), we can increase the product by adjusting these terms. - Thus, to maximize the product, only terms with differences of 0 or 1 should be included. 4. **Structure of the Optimal Decomposition**: - Let (t) be the number of terms equal to (u+1) (where (0 leq t < k)). - Then the number of terms equal to (u) is (k - t). The condition: [ n = (k-t) cdot u + t cdot (u + 1) ] simplifies to: [ u = frac{n - t}{k} ] - Considering (0 leq t < k), (u) must be the integer part of (frac{n}{k}), and (t) is the remainder.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution: 1. **Number of Locks Required:** - Every pair of committee members must be prevented from opening the cabinet when the other three members are absent. Therefore, for each pair, there should be at least one lock that neither member of the pair can open. - The number of such pairs can be calculated using the combination formula {n choose 2} where ( n = 5 ) is the number of committee members: [ binom{5}{2} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 ] - Therefore, there must be at least 10 different locks on the cabinet to ensure that every pair of committee members is prevented from opening it alone. 2. **Number of Keys per Member:** - Each committee member must have keys to the locks, such that if any three members are present, they can open every lock. - The number of keys each member needs can be determined by ensuring that for the three remaining members, every possible pair among these three can be blocked by a unique lock, and each of the three members must have keys to the remaining ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ) locks out of 10. - This means each member should have keys to ( 10 - 4 = 6 ) locks (since they do not get keys to the 4 locks that involve them directly in a pair). 3. **Verification and Construction:** - Let’s explicitly assign the locks as follows, ensuring each member is excluded from 4 specific locks: | | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | |---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----| | Member ( A ) | - | x | x | x | x | x | x | - | - | - | | Member ( B ) | x | - | - | x | - | - | x | x | - | x | | Member ( C ) | x | x | - | - | x | - | - | - | x | x | | Member ( D ) | x | - | x | - | - | x | - | x | - | x | | Member ( E ) | - | x | x | - | - | - | x | x | x | - | - In this table, \\"-\\" denotes that the member does not have a key for that specific lock. - This arrangement ensures: * Every lock is inaccessible to exactly two members. * Any three members together have at least one member with a key to each lock. - We verified that it works for all the locks and members pair correctly according to the given problem's conditions. # Conclusion: Thus, the number of locks on the cabinet should be ( 10 ), and each member should have keys to exactly ( 6 ) locks.

The total amount of butterfat in the final mixture can be calculated by adding the butterfat from the initial 8 gallons of 45% butterfat milk and the butterfat from the V gallons of x% butterfat milk. The amount of butterfat in the initial 8 gallons of milk is 45% of 8 gallons, which is 0.45 * 8. The amount of butterfat in the V gallons of milk to be added is x% of V gallons, which is (x/100) * V. The total amount of butterfat in the final mixture should be 20% of the total volume (8 + V gallons), which is 0.20 * (8 + V). Now we can set up the equation: 0.45 * 8 + (x/100) * V = 0.20 * (8 + V) We know that the final volume is 20 gallons (from the answer provided), so V = 20 - 8 = 12 gallons.

Therefore, the probability of drawing a pink gumball on a single draw is the complement of drawing a blue gumball, which is 1 - 4/7 = 3/7. So, the probability that the next gumball Jean draws will be pink is boxed{3/7} ."},{"instruction":"For a natural number ( n geq 2 ), prove: sqrt{2 sqrt{3 sqrt{4 cdots sqrt{(n1) sqrt{n}}}}} < 3.","output":"To prove the following inequality for natural numbers ( n geq 2 ): [ sqrt{2 sqrt{3 sqrt{4 cdots sqrt{(n-1) sqrt{n}}}}} < 3 ] We can generalize the problem.

To do this, we need to minimize the number of cars that have both air conditioning and racing stripes. Since at least 51 cars have racing stripes, let's assume exactly 51 cars have racing stripes to maximize the number of cars with air conditioning but not racing stripes. Now, we need to consider the overlap between cars with racing stripes and cars with air conditioning. The maximum number of cars that could have both would be the smaller of the two groups. Since there are 63 cars with air conditioning and at least 51 with racing stripes, the maximum overlap would be 51 cars (assuming all cars with racing stripes also have air conditioning). To find the greatest number of cars that could have air conditioning but not racing stripes, we subtract the maximum overlap from the total number of cars with air conditioning: Number of cars with air conditioning but not racing stripes = Number of cars with air conditioning - Maximum overlap = 63 - 51 = 12 Therefore, the greatest number of cars that could have air conditioning but not racing stripes is boxed{12} ."},{"instruction":"f [sin x + cos x + tan x + cot x + sec x + csc x + cos 2x = 9,] then find sin 2x.","output":"First, express everything in terms of sin x and cos x: [sin x + cos x + frac{sin x}{cos x} + frac{cos x}{sin x} + frac{1}{sin x} + frac{1}{cos x} + cos (2x) = 9.] We simplify the equation using identities: [sin x + cos x + frac{sin^2 x + cos^2 x}{sin x cos x} + frac{sin x + cos x}{sin x cos x} + cos (2x) = 9.] This simplifies to: [sin x + cos x + frac{1}{sin x cos x} + cos (2x) = 9.] Next, introduce the double-angle identity, cos 2x = 2cos^2 x - 1: [sin x + cos x + frac{2}{sin 2x} + 2cos^2 x - 1 = 9.] Rearranging gives: [sin x + cos x + 2cos^2 x + frac{2}{sin 2x} = 10.] Let s = sin x + cos x.

Hence, we can consider that ( d_i d_{k+1-i} ) pairs up divisors perfectly leading to: [ frac{d_i d_{k+1-i}}{n} leq n ] 5.

We need to prove that the lines ( AM ), ( DN ), and ( XY ) are concurrent. 1. __Determine the cocyclicity of points__: By construction: - Point ( M ) lies on the circle with diameter ( [AC] ). Hence, ( angle AMC = 90^circ ). - Point ( N ) lies on the circle with diameter ( [BD] ). Hence, ( angle BND = 90^circ ). 2. __Use angles to show cocyclicity__: We will show that ( A, M, N, D ) are concyclic by examining the angles: [ begin{align*} angle MND &= angle MNB &= 90^circ + angle MCB quad (text{Since ( angle MNB ) is an exterior angle to ( triangle MBC )}) &= 90^circ + angle MCA quad (text{as ( angle MCB = angle MCA ), both inscribed angles subtending ( AC )}) &= 180^circ - angle MAD quad (text{Since ( angle MAD ) and ( angle MCA ) are supplementary as angles in quadrilateral ( MADC )}) end{align*} ] Hence, the angles confirm that ( angle MND = 180^circ - angle MAD ). 3. __Conclude cocyclicity__: Since the opposite angles of quadrilateral ( AMND ) are supplementary, the points ( A, M, N, D ) are concyclic. 4. __Analyze radical axes intersection__: The radical axis of two intersecting circles is the locus of points with equal power with respect to the two circles. Hence: - The radical axis of circles with diameters ( [AC] ) and ( [BD] ) will intersect the line ( XY ) at point ( P ). - The radical axis of the circle with diameter ( [AC] ) and the circle passing through ( A, M, N, D ) is the line ( AM ). - The radical axis of the circle with diameter ( [BD] ) and the circle passing through ( A, M, N, D ) is the line ( DN ). 5. __Establish concurrency__: Since ( AM ) and ( DN ) are both radical axes intersecting on line ( XY ) at point ( P ), and since ( XY ) is the radical axis of the circles with diameters ( [AC] ) and ( [BD] ), it follows that the three lines ( AM ), ( DN ), and ( XY ) are concurrent at the point ( P ) (as radical axes intersect at a common point).

Since the decimal repeats indefinitely, we can represent it as a fraction. The repeating decimal 0.0000253725372537... can be represented as 2537/99000000 (since there are 8 digits after the decimal point before the repeating sequence starts, we put the repeating digits over 99 followed by as many zeros as there are digits in the repeating sequence).

This is due to the fact that there are only (p) possible remainders when dividing by (p), and thus, by the pigeonhole principle, one of the terms must be congruent to 0 modulo (p). 3. **Ensuring all terms are prime**: Since (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{15}) are all prime numbers, none of them can be divisible by any prime (p leq 15).

Hence, further analysis leads to observing that ( k geq 3 ) is necessary. 2. **Constructing a Valid Configuration for ( k = 3 ):** - Split the infinite grid into two semiplanes using a straight line, with one semiplane containing only odd numbers and the other containing only even numbers. - Let the line separating the semiplanes be called the \\"boundary line\\". Place the number 1 and the two 2's along this boundary line such that: - Cell1 (0, 0) contains 1. - Cell2 (-1, 0) and Cell3 (1, 0) contain 2. - Place adjacent 3's above and below the 1 (i.e., Cell4 (0, 1) and Cell5 (0, -1)). - Continue this pattern for subsequent numbers: - Fill 5's around cells with 3's (i.e., Cell6 (-1, 1), Cell7 (1, -1), etc). - Continue outward, preserving parity in placement and maintaining valid differences. 3. **Ensuring the Conditions are Met for ( k = 3 ):** - In the constructed configuration: - The difference between numbers in adjacent cells within each semiplane does not exceed 2. - The boundary line cells have parity-based adjacencies resulting in neighboring differences also not exceeding 2. - Therefore, all numbers ( n ) will appropriately appear ( n ) times, ensuring both conditions are satisfied. 4. **Verification and Conclusion:** - Given that the described method fills the infinite grid correctly under the given constraints... - We conclude that the smallest value of ( k ) for which this fulfilling is possible is ( boxed{3} ). The final valid solution demonstrates the necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring ( k = 3 ) is feasible in filling the infinite grid under the problem's stipulations."},{"instruction":"A shell is fired into the air, and its height after x seconds is y meters, with the relationship between time and height given by y = ax^2 + bx + c (where a neq 0).

Since ticket numbers range from 1 to 30 and the highest binary number is 11110 (which is 5 digits), the teacher must perform 5 operations, one for each binary digit. 6. **Insufficiency of Fewer Steps:** Trying fewer than 5 steps (e.g., 4 steps) is insufficient even for one student. This is because each step ideally halves the number of possible ticket numbers, but halving 30 numbers with only 4 steps is not sufficient to uniquely identify each one. After 4 steps, there will still be ambiguity, as (2^4 = 16) possible values are still too many to determine a unique 5-digit number. Therefore, the teacher cannot deduce ticket numbers with fewer than 5 steps. Even if the teacher was unlucky in the selection process, the results would still not cover all ticket numbers uniquely without a 5th identifying operation. # Conclusion: The teacher needs to perform precisely 5 operations to determine the ticket number of each student uniquely.

What was the total number of points scored by both teams in the first half? textbf{(A)} 32 qquad textbf{(B)} 33 qquad textbf{(C)} 34 qquad textbf{(D)} 35 qquad textbf{(E)} 35.5","output":"1. **Define the Sequences**: - Let Team Alpha's scores be a, ar, ar^2, ar^3. - Let Team Beta's scores be b, b+d, b+2d, b+3d. - Given the game was tied after the first quarter, a = b. 2. **Set up Total Scores**: - Total score for Team Alpha, S_A = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 = a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3). - Total score for Team Beta, S_B = 4b + 6d (sum of arithmetic series). 3. **Form the Winning Condition**: - Since Team Alpha won by 3 points: S_A = S_B + 3. - Substitute a = b: a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3) = 4a + 6d + 3. 4. **Solve the Equation**: - Rearrange to find an equation in terms of a, d, r: a(r + r^2 + r^3 - 3) = 6d + 3. 5. **Assume Values for r**: - If r = 3, then 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, 40a = 4a + 6d + 3, 36a = 6d + 3. - Assuming a = 3 (smallest integer satisfying the equation and total score < 120), we get 108 = 6d + 3; 6d = 105, d = 17.5. 6. **Calculate First Half Scores**: - Team Alpha's scores: 3, 9, 27, 81. - Team Beta's scores: 3, 20.5, 38, 55.5. - Total points in the first half: 3 + 9 + 3 + 20.5 = 35.5. Conclusion: The total number of points scored by both teams in the first half is 35.5. The final answer is boxed{textbf{(E)} 35.5}."},{"instruction":"A group of travelers is taking a bus, with the requirement that the number of passengers on each bus is equal. Initially, each bus carried 22 people, leaving 1 person unable to board; if one bus leaves empty, then all the passengers can be evenly distributed among the remaining buses. Knowing that each bus can accommodate up to 32 people at most, how many buses were there initially? And how many passengers were there?","output":"Let's denote the initial number of buses as m, and after one empty bus leaves, the average number of passengers per bus as n. Given that m geq 2 and n leq 32, according to the problem, we have: 22m + 1 = n(m - 1). Therefore, n can be expressed as: n = frac{22m + 1}{m - 1} = 22 + frac{23}{m - 1}. Since n is a natural number, frac{23}{m - 1} must be an integer. Therefore, m - 1 = 1, text{ or } m - 1 = 23, which implies m = 2 or m = 24. When m = 2, n = 45 (which is not consistent with the problem, so it is discarded); when m = 24, n = 23 (which is consistent with the problem). Thus, the number of passengers is: n(m - 1) = 23 times (24 - 1) = 529 text{ passengers}. Answer: Initially, there were boxed{24} buses and boxed{529} passengers."},{"instruction":"Suppose a batch of electronic watches has a genuine rate of frac{3}{4} and a defective rate of frac{1}{4}.

The probability of the first test resulting in a defective watch is frac{1}{4}. The probability of the second test resulting in a defective watch is also frac{1}{4}. The probability of the third test resulting in a genuine watch is frac{3}{4}. Since these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to obtain the overall probability: P(X=3) = (frac{1}{4}) times (frac{1}{4}) times (frac{3}{4}) = (frac{1}{4})^{2} times (frac{3}{4}). Therefore, the answer is boxed{C: (frac{1}{4})^{2}times(frac{3}{4})}."},{"instruction":"Jenny has 6 Pokemon cards. Orlando has 2 more cards than Jenny. Richard has a certain multiple of cards as Orlando. They have 38 Pokemon cards in all. What is the ratio of the number of cards Richard has to the number of cards Orlando has?","output":"Let's start by figuring out how many cards Orlando has. Since Orlando has 2 more cards than Jenny, and Jenny has 6 cards, Orlando has 6 + 2 = 8 cards. Now, let's denote the number of cards Richard has as R. Since Richard has a certain multiple of the cards Orlando has, we can say that R is a multiple of 8. We know that the total number of cards they have together is 38. So, we can write the equation: Jenny's cards + Orlando's cards + Richard's cards = Total cards 6 + 8 + R = 38 Now, let's solve for R: R = 38 - (6 + 8) R = 38 - 14 R = 24 So, Richard has 24 cards, which is a multiple of 8 (since 24 is 3 times 8). Now, we want to find the ratio of the number of cards Richard has to the number of cards Orlando has. Since Richard has 24 cards and Orlando has 8 cards, the ratio is: Richard's cards : Orlando's cards 24 : 8 To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 8: (24 ÷ 8) : (8 ÷ 8) 3 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of the number of cards Richard has to the number of cards Orlando has is boxed{3:1} ."},{"instruction":"Given the hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) with its right focus F, a line is drawn through point F perpendicular to the xaxis, intersecting the two asymptotes at points A and B, and intersecting the hyperbola in the first quadrant at point P.

The amount of work done is proportional to the number of workers and the time they work. We can express the work done as the product of the number of workers and the time they work. For the first hole, the work done can be represented as: Work1 = W * 8 hours For the second hole, the work done can be represented as: Work2 = (W + 65) * 6 hours Since the work done is also proportional to the depth of the hole, we can set up a proportion based on the depths of the holes: Work1 / Work2 = Depth1 / Depth2 Substituting the expressions for Work1 and Work2, we get: (W * 8) / ((W + 65) * 6) = 30 / 55 Now we can solve for W: (W * 8) / ((W + 65) * 6) = 30 / 55 (W * 8 * 55) = (W + 65) * 6 * 30 440W = 180W + 11700 440W - 180W = 11700 260W = 11700 W = 11700 / 260 W = 45 So, initially, there were boxed{45} workers working on the project."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:I},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},L={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},P=["disabled"],R={key:0},z={key:1};function H(i,e,h,g,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",L,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",B,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
