Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The U.S.-Mexico border has witnessed a significant increase in the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border in recent months. These children are primarily from Central America and are escaping violence and instability in their home countries. The U.S. government has responded by opening new detention centers to house these young immigrants; however, the living conditions in these centers have come under fire from critics who claim that they are inhumane. The surge in unaccompanied minors crossing the border has put a significant strain on the U.S. immigration system. In March 2021, more than 18,800 unaccompanied minors were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border, the highest monthly total ever recorded. The Biden administration has promised to address the situation and has begun to move some of the children out of detention centers and into more suitable living arrangements. The children who are crossing the border are often fleeing violence and instability in their home countries. Many are seeking refuge from gang violence and domestic abuse. They are leaving behind their families and homes in search of safety and a better life. The journey is perilous, and many of these children fall victim to human trafficking or other forms of exploitation along the way. The U.S. government has responded to this crisis by opening new detention centers to house the young immigrants. However, these centers have come under fire from critics who claim that the living conditions are inhumane. Reports have emerged of overcrowded facilities, lack of access to basic hygiene, and inadequate medical care. These conditions are not only unacceptable but pose a significant risk to the health and wellbeing of these vulnerable children. There is no easy solution to the surge in unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Addressing the root causes of violence and instability in Central America is critical to resolving the crisis. In the meantime, the U.S. government must ensure that the children who are seeking refuge are treated with dignity and respect. The detention centers must provide access to basic necessities and adequate medical care. The safety and wellbeing of these children must always be the top priority."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet expressing disappointment.","output":"Feeling so disappointed right now."},{"instruction":"it true that Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth according to the following passage?

Amazon, which recently became the second company in the world to achieve a market capitalisation of 1tn, has faced criticism from several labour organisations over low wages and poor working conditions in its warehouses. The pay rise has been widely welcomed by campaigners who have called on Amazon for years to make its workplaces fairer. The move will also affect Whole Foods employees, which was acquired by Amazon for 13.7bn last year. The company has stated that it will be lobbying the US government to increase the federal minimum wage, which has been set at 7.25 per hour since 2009. Amazon’s decision to raise the minimum wage comes amid increasing scrutiny of wages and working conditions in the retail sector. Other US firms, such as Target and Walmart, have also moved to increase their minimum hourly wages in response to activism and mounting pressure from lawmakers.

The decision has been widely criticized due to concerns over human rights abuses taking place in the country. Qatar's treatment of migrant workers, who make up a significant portion of the workforce responsible for constructing the infrastructure necessary for the tournament, has come under fire from human rights organizations.

Concerns have also been expressed about the freedom of expression and the right to protest in Qatar. Additionally, there are concerns about the extreme heat in Qatar during the summer months.

It's an excellent way to relax and create beautiful, functional items. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced knitter, choosing the right project and materials can make all the difference. The first step in knitting is to choose a project. This can be anything from a simple scarf to a complex sweater. It's important to select a project that is appropriate for your skill level so that you don't get discouraged. Once you've chosen your project, it's time to select your materials. Yarn comes in different weights and fibers, and each type of yarn will have different characteristics. You may also need knitting needles or other tools, depending on the project you've chosen. Next, it's time to cast on stitches. This is the process of making a row of loops on your knitting needle. The number of stitches you need to cast on will depend on the pattern and the size of the item you are making. Casting on can take some practice, but there are many tutorials available to help you learn. Once you have cast on your stitches, it's time to begin knitting. Follow the pattern carefully, paying attention to any special instructions or abbreviations. It's important to keep track of your progress by counting rows or using stitch markers so that you don't lose your place. It's also important to take breaks if needed. Knitting for long periods without a break can cause strain on your hands and arms. Give yourself time to stretch and rest your hands so that you can avoid injury. When you've finished your project, it's time to weave in the ends. This is the process of securing any loose yarn tails so that they don't unravel with wear. There are many techniques for weaving in ends, so find one that works best for you. Finally, it's time to block the final product. This is a process of wetting the knitted item and drying it in a specific shape to help it retain its shape and even out any inconsistencies. Not all projects will require blocking, but it can be a helpful step for larger or more intricate items. In conclusion, knitting can be a rewarding and relaxing hobby. By choosing the right project, materials, and following the steps of casting on, knitting, and blocking, you can create beautiful and functional items to treasure for years to come."},{"instruction":"w to clean a bathtub:<br>Mix vinegar and baking soda in a spray bottle.

This means that retailers in the country will no longer be able to sell or distribute plastic bags to customers.

Plastic pollution has become a major issue in recent years, with many countries confronting the challenge of dealing with a huge amount of plastic waste. New Zealand is not alone in its decision to ban single-use plastic bags. Several other countries have already implemented similar measures, including Kenya, Rwanda, and Bangladesh. The ban is an important step towards reducing plastic waste and protecting the environment. Single-use plastic bags are one of the most significant contributors to plastic pollution. They are often used only once and then disposed of, ending up in landfills or polluting the natural environment. By implementing the ban, New Zealand is sending a strong message to retailers and consumers that the country is serious about protecting the environment. It also encourages people to consider alternative, more sustainable options for carrying their shopping. The ban has been welcomed by environmental groups and others who are committed to reducing plastic waste. However, some retailers have expressed concerns over the impact on their businesses. Overall, the ban is a positive step towards reducing plastic waste and protecting the environment.

A recently released study suggests that cutting greenhouse gas emissions could save millions of lives per year and the global economy trillions of dollars.

The study suggests that reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 1% per year will save between 6,000 and 15,000 lives per year in countries that are especially vulnerable to air pollution.

Company burned £28.6m worth of products to protect brand's exclusivity. Critics call for more sustainable practices and donations to charity.","output":"Burberry, the British luxury fashion brand, has recently come under fire for burning millions of pounds worth of unsold goods. The company reportedly destroyed £28.6m worth of products last year to protect the exclusivity of the brand. The revelation has sparked anger among environmentalists, ethical consumers, and poverty campaigners. Critics claim that Burberry's actions reflect a lack of consideration for sustainability and responsibility towards the planet. Burning unsold goods leads to air pollution and contributes to climate change. Moreover, affluent brands like Burberry should be aware of the problems of resource depletion and environmental degradation caused by the fashion industry. The backlash against Burberry has also put pressure on the company to adopt more sustainable practices. Rather than destroying their unsold goods, Burberry could consider donating them to charity or recycling them. This approach would not only be better for the environment, but also help the brand combat poverty and support social causes. Burberry's recent sustainability report does acknowledge that the company has a \\"responsibility to protect the environment for future generations.\\" However, the brand still has a long way to go to meet that objective. Consumers nowadays are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of fashion and want to support brands that prioritize sustainability. Burberry's extensive burning of unsold products not only clashes with that perspective, but also raises questions about the overall ethics of the fashion industry. Many experts also point out that the luxury fashion industry tends to produce excessive waste and contribute heavily to carbon emissions. In short, Burberry's actions have raised serious concerns about the environmental impact of the fashion industry and highlighted the need for sustainable fashion practices. The brand's future decisions will be closely monitored by consumers and environmentalists, who will demand greater transparency and accountability from the fashion industry as a whole."},{"instruction":"f the price of gas rises, will that decrease the number of cars on the road?

The study found that plants exposed to the sound of bees produced sweeter nectar than plants exposed to artificial sound or silence. The researchers conducted the study by exposing plants to the sound of bees or artificial sounds for three days. They then measured the sugar content of the nectar produced by the plants. The plants that were exposed to the sound of bees produced nectar that contained higher levels of sugar. The researchers suggest that the plants may be responding to the sound of bees as a way to attract more pollinators and increase their chances of reproduction. Plants rely on pollinators, such as bees, to spread their pollen and fertilize their flowers, which leads to the production of seeds. The findings of this study have important implications for plant-pollinator interactions. If plants can hear and respond to the sound of bees, this could have a significant impact on the behavior of pollinators. For example, if plants can produce sweeter nectar in response to the sound of bees, this could attract more bees to the plant and increase its chances of reproduction. This study also has broader implications for our understanding of plant behavior. Until recently, it was believed that plants were passive organisms that simply responded to their environment. However, this study suggests that plants are much more sophisticated than we previously thought. Overall, this study provides new insights into the relationship between plants and pollinators. It suggests that plants are capable of complex behaviors and responses, and that their interactions with pollinators are more dynamic than we previously believed."},{"instruction":"f The cat scratched me because I was teasing it., can we say The cat was angry with me.?

At least 1 in 7 children in the United States is considered food insecure, meaning they lack consistent access to adequate food. Proposed Policy: 1. Establishment of a National Nutrition Assistance Program: The federal government will create a new initiative that aims to provide healthy food choices to low-income families. The program will allocate funds to State child nutrition programs to provide families and schools with nutritious foods. 2. Improving Access to Nutritious Foods: Government officials establish community schools and micro-retailers to distribute daily lunches and other food items at a low cost to low-income families. The schools will allocate resources to provide meals and snacks to children, with a strong emphasis on locally-sourced, fresh produce. 3. Promoting Healthy Habits: The government will develop public health campaigns that emphasize the importance of healthy food consumption in early childhood development, emphasizing the importance of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. The campaigns will also promote physical activity among children. Financial implications: Approximately 10 billion will be allocated to the execution of this policy for five years. The expenditure will cover research and development, public health campaigns, and food distribution programs. Impact: The policy aims to reduce childhood malnutrition in the United States by 50% within five years.

Write a news article summarizing the controversy and including quotes from people on both sides. Include any analysis of whether or not this is a positive step forward for fashion advertising.","output":"A new advertisement campaign featuring plus-size models has caused a stir in the fashion industry. The series of advertisements, which feature models of various sizes, was created to promote body positivity and inclusivity. However, the campaign has received mixed reactions from people on both sides of the debate. Some supporters of the campaign believe that it is a positive step forward for the fashion industry, which has traditionally promoted unrealistic beauty standards. They argue that the advertisements help to promote diversity and inclusivity, and that seeing models of different sizes can help to boost self-esteem and confidence. However, critics of the campaign argue that featuring plus-size models is promoting an unhealthy lifestyle, and that it is sending the wrong message to young people. They argue that obesity is a serious health issue, and that promoting plus-size models can contribute to a rise in obesity rates. One critic, fashion blogger Sarah Smith, said \\"I understand the message behind the campaign, but I don't think it's helpful. We need to promote a healthy lifestyle, not obesity. Seeing plus-size models can encourage people to think it's okay to be overweight, which can have serious health consequences.\\" In contrast, another supporter of the campaign, psychologist Dr. Rachel Kim, argues that featuring plus-size models can help to promote body positivity and self-acceptance. \\"We need to start accepting people of all sizes, shapes, and colors,\\" she says. \\"By promoting body positivity, we can help people feel more confident and comfortable in their own skin.\\" Overall, it is clear that the new advertisement campaign has sparked an important debate about body positivity and inclusivity in the fashion industry. While some see it as a positive step forward, others worry about the messages it sends to young people. Nonetheless, it seems likely that the use of plus-size models in advertising will continue to be a contentious issue in the years to come, as the industry continues to grapple with questions of diversity, representation, and body image."},{"instruction":"What is the population of Tokyo, Japan?

The practice helps to calm the mind, slow down racing thoughts and reduce stress and anxiety levels. This is achieved by focusing attention on the present moment and letting go of distracting thoughts that can cause stress and worry. Another benefit of meditation is increased self-awareness. With regular practice, one is able to become more in tune with their thoughts, emotions and physical sensations. This heightened awareness allows for better self-regulation, better decision-making, and ultimately a more satisfying life. Meditation can also improve physical health. Research has shown that regular practice can lower blood pressure, improve immune function, and reduce inflammation in the body. These physical health benefits are likely due to the reduction in stress levels that meditation can provide. Finally, meditation can be a tool for personal growth, helping individuals to cultivate a sense of compassion, kindness, and empathy towards themselves and others. Regular practice can lead to an enhanced sense of connectedness with the world, greater empathy towards others and reduced irritability towards others. In conclusion, meditation is a powerful tool to improve both mental and physical health, enhance self-awareness, and promote personal growth. With just a few minutes of practice a day, one can reap the many benefits of meditation and enhance the overall quality of their life."},{"instruction":"The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications constructed along the northern borders of China to protect against invasions.

The Great Depression was caused by a mixture of both domestic and international economic factors, and had profound and long-lasting effects on American society. One of the primary causes of the Great Depression was the stock market crash of 1929. Many Americans had invested heavily in the stock market during the 1920s, buoyed by the booming economy; however, in late October 1929, the market suddenly collapsed, wiping out many investors. The loss of confidence and wealth triggered a wave of bankruptcies, and many businesses were forced to close their doors. Another major cause of the Great Depression was the worldwide economic downturn of the 1930s. The United States was heavily dependent on international trade, and as global markets contracted, American businesses suffered. The collapse of the farming sector was especially devastating to the rural economy. The Dust Bowl, a period of severe drought and soil erosion in the Great Plains, only exacerbated the problem, as it made farming almost impossible in many areas. The effects of the Great Depression were profound and far-reaching. Unemployment soared, and by 1932, one in four Americans was out of work. Many people lost their homes and savings, and were forced to rely on charity for food and shelter. The psychological impact of the Depression was also significant, with suicide rates skyrocketing. The Great Depression had lasting effects on American society long after the 1930s had ended. It led to the development of government programs such as Social Security and unemployment insurance, which were designed to protect citizens in times of economic hardship. It also paved the way for increased government intervention in the economy, as policymakers sought new ways to prevent future economic downturns. In conclusion, the Great Depression was a complex and multifaceted event. It had both domestic and international causes, and had profound and long-lasting effects on American society. Although the scars of the Depression remain, the experience ultimately helped to shape the modern American economy and government."},{"instruction":"Revise the punctuation in the following text: Join the Star Wars fan club May the force be with you Always.","output":"Join the Star Wars fan club.

It is a series of fortifications that snake across the northern borders of China, built to protect the Chinese empire from invading nomadic tribes from the north. The earliest sections of the Great Wall were constructed during the Warring States Period (475-221 BCE) when various states of China built defensive walls to protect their territories from each other. However, it wasn't until the reign of the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (221-206 BCE), that the separate walls were connected and extended to form a continuous line known as the Great Wall. The emperor ordered the construction of the wall to protect China's northern borders from the marauding Xiongnu people, who were Genghis Khan's ancestors. The Great Wall that we see today is mainly a product of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE). The Ming era walls were built in response to the invasion of a powerful Mongol army led by Kublai Khan. The Ming fortifications incorporated many advances in construction techniques, including brick and stone-faced walls, watchtowers, and firepower, including the famous \\"Great Cannon.\\" The wall was manned by soldiers, and they were responsible for defending against invasions. However, many sections of the wall were abandoned over time as the need for protection was reduced. During the 19th and 20th centuries, parts of the wall were dismantled and used as building material by villages, and many sections are now in a state of disrepair. The Great Wall of China is not just an iconic structure but also a marvel of engineering, and it is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Chinese people throughout history. Today, the wall is a symbol of Chinese cultural heritage and is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors from around the world."},{"instruction":"To make a homemade pizza, preheat your oven to 425°F and spread sauce and toppings on your dough.

The man, Michael Litersky, woke up to find the animal clinging to his arm, sinking its teeth into him. Kinkajous are nocturnal mammals native to Central and South America, and they're known for their long, prehensile tails and their love of sweet fruit. It's unclear how the animal ended up in Litersky's home, but it likely entered through an open door or window. After the attack, Litersky called 911 and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. While kinkajou bites aren't typically fatal, they can cause serious infections. It's unclear what will happen to the animal, as kinkajous are protected under Florida law and cannot be kept as pets without a permit. This isn't the first time a kinkajou has made headlines for its unusual behavior. In 2019, a woman in Florida was attacked by a kinkajou that had entered her home through a pet door. And just this year, a kinkajou caused a stir in Costa Rica when it was spotted stealing food from a busy street vendor.

But there's growing evidence that it's also contributing to poor mental health, particularly among young people. As more and more studies are conducted, it's becoming clear that social media is not just a harmless distraction – it can have serious consequences. One of the ways that social media affects mental health is through comparison. Social media platforms present us with carefully curated versions of other people's lives, highlighting the best parts and leaving out the mundane or negative. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to these idealized versions and feeling inadequate or depressed as a result. Teenagers, in particular, are vulnerable to these feelings, which can lead to poor self-esteem and even suicidal thoughts. Another way that social media can hurt mental health is through addiction. With endless feeds of new content and notifications that constantly pull us back in, it's easy to spend hours scrolling through social media. But studies have found that excessive social media use can lead to anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation. And for some people, it can become so addictive that they struggle to stay off social media, even when it's clearly harming their mental health. Finally, social media can contribute to feelings of isolation, despite the fact that it's meant to connect us. Studies have found that heavy social media use can make people feel more lonely, anxious, and socially isolated. This may be because social media interactions often lack the depth and nuance of in-person interactions, leaving people feeling unfulfilled and disconnected. These are serious concerns, but there are ways to mitigate the impact of social media on mental health. For instance, users can be more mindful of how much time they spend on social media and deliberately limit their use. They can also seek out and follow accounts that make them feel good about themselves, rather than ones that lead to comparison and negativity. It's also important for parents and educators to talk to young people about the potential pitfalls of social media and help them develop healthy social media habits. In conclusion, while social media has many benefits, it's important to be aware of its potential impact on mental health. By being mindful of our social media use and taking steps to mitigate its negative effects, we can better protect our mental health and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative?

Since then, other individuals have attempted to break Gardner's record, but none have been successful. In fact, many experts strongly advise against staying awake for extended periods of time, as it can have serious effects on one's physical and mental health. Lack of sleep has been linked to a variety of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and depression. It can also increase the risk of accidents, as sleep-deprived individuals are more likely to make mistakes and have slower reaction times. In conclusion, while the world record for longest time spent without sleep may seem like an impressive feat, it is not something that should be attempted without careful consideration and medical supervision. Adequate sleep is crucial for overall health and well-being, and should not be sacrificed for the sake of breaking a record."},{"instruction":"Article: The Pyramids of Giza are a complex of ancient monuments located on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt.

Plan Your Route: If you have to go out, plan your route in advance, and try to stay on the main roads. These roads are more likely to be plowed and salted than side streets or rural roads. 3. Slow Down: Drive at a slower speed than usual, and leave plenty of room between your vehicle and other cars around you. Braking on icy roads can be difficult, and it takes longer to come to a complete stop. 4. Turn on Your Lights: Turn on your headlights so that you can see the road in front of you, and other drivers can see you. Use low-beam headlights to reduce glare and increase visibility. 5. Clear Your Windows: Clear all snow and ice from your vehicle before driving. Ensure that all windows, headlights, tail-lights, and mirrors are clear of snow and ice. This will provide better visibility while driving. 6. Be Prepared: Before heading out, make sure that your vehicle is equipped with emergency supplies including a flashlight, blankets, snacks, and a first aid kit. Also, ensure that you have enough gas in the tank to avoid running out of gas in the middle of a snowstorm. 7. Watch for Black Ice: Black ice is a thin and transparent layer of ice that forms on the road surface. This can make the road slippery and hard to navigate. Be aware of black ice, especially in areas where the road is shaded or where there is less traffic. By following these simple tips, you can make driving in a snowstorm safer and less stressful.

The protein in question, known as tau, has long been linked to the development of Alzheimer's.

While laboratory studies have shown promising results, more testing is needed to determine its safety and efficacy in human patients.

While they are often viewed as opposing ideas, there are some similarities and differences between the two. The theory of evolution proposes that all life on earth descended from a common ancestor through the process of natural selection. This means that organisms with traits that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits on to their offspring. Over time, these small changes accumulate and result in the diversity of life we see today. On the other hand, creationism proposes that a divine being, usually God, created all life on earth. This theory contends that life forms were created in their current state and have not changed since their creation. One of the primary differences between these two theories is their approach to evidence. The theory of evolution is based on scientific observations, experiments, and evidence. This includes the fossil record, genetic data, and observations of natural phenomena. Creationism, on the other hand, relies on belief in a divine being and takes faith as its primary evidence. Another difference between these two theories is their approach to the idea of time. The theory of evolution suggests that life on earth has existed for billions of years and has gradually changed over time. Creationism proposes that life was created in a relatively short period of time, usually within the span of a few thousand years. Despite these differences, there are some similarities between the theories of evolution and creationism. Both theories attempt to explain the origins of life on earth, and both have significant followings. Additionally, both theories have been the subject of intense debate and controversy. In conclusion, while the theory of evolution and creationism differ in their approach to evidence and their treatment of time, both ask and attempt to answer some of the most fundamental and profound questions human beings ask themselves about their own origins."},{"instruction":"Read the paragraph and determine if the sentence is true: John ate a sandwich for lunch and drank a soda.

We start with the Initial Plan having a total project duration of 14 days. # Initial Plan: - Critical Path: A -> C -> E -> G (14 days) - Total Direct Costs: 1,200 - Total Indirect Costs: 700 (for 14 days at 50 per day) - Total Cost: 1,900 (1,200 + 700) # Iteration #1: For the first iteration, we aim to reduce the total project duration by 1 day, bringing it from 14 to 13 days. We assess activities along the critical path (A -> C -> E -> G) for crash opportunities. The activities on the critical path with crash potential are C and E. Between C and E, crashing E is more cost-effective. It has a lower crash cost per day (20) compared to C which has a crash cost of 40 per day. - **Crash E** by 1 day (5 to 4 days) for 20 (1 day * 20) - New Critical Path: A -> C -> E -> G (13 days) - Total Direct Costs: 1,200 + 20 (crash cost for E) = 1,220 - Total Indirect Costs: 650 (50 * 13 days) - Total Cost: 1,220 + 650 = 1,870 # Iteration #2: Now, the project duration is 13 days. We focus again on the critical path (which remains unchanged since that's where the longest duration lies), aiming to reduce the duration to 12 days. Between C and E which still have crash potential (C can now be considered since E was already crashed by 1 day), crashing C is cheaper. - **Crash C** by 1 day (5 to 4 days) for 40 (1 day * 40) - New Critical Path: A -> C -> E -> G (12 days) - Total Direct Costs: 1,220 + 40 (crash cost for C) = 1,260 - Total Indirect Costs: 600 (50 * 12 days) - Total Cost: 1,260 + 600 = 1,860 # Iteration #3: Following the trend, to bring the project duration down to 11 days, we need to find more crash opportunities. At this stage, D and F are not on the critical path, so their crash potential is not immediately beneficial for reducing the total project duration. Further crashing of C and E would not be possible without violating their minimum durations. However, we notice that if we look at alternative adjustments, further reduction requires crashing activities already at or approaching their minimum or reassessing activities off the initial critical path for compression opportunities, which are not present or viable without exceeding minimum durations or previous crash choices making further reductions impractical under given constraints. # Optimal Project Duration: Based on the iterations, Iteration #2 provides the best balance between cost and duration, with a total duration of 12 days and a total cost of 1,860. This is the optimal project duration that results in the lowest cost given the constraints and available data. Further reductions in project duration either aren't possible without violating minimum duration constraints or would lead to increased costs without feasible crash options detailed in the scenario provided."},{"instruction":"Vytvoř shrnutí z následujících informací: Výcvik v tělesné přípravě je jedním z hlavních druhů výcviku vojáků. Jeho cílem je zabez pečovat tělesnou připravenost vojáků ke zvládnutí úkolů a zátěže při výkonu služby za všech situací. Cílem kontroly a hodnocení tělesné přípravy je udržování trvalého přehledu: a) o průběhu a účinnosti tělovýchovného procesu; b) o úrovni tělesné připravenosti jednotlivců; c) o připravenosti organizačních celků a jejich složek v tělesné přípravě během výcvikové ho roku. 2. K výsledkům kontrol tělesné přípravy se přihlíží při: a) služebním hodnocení vojáka; b) rozhodování o umístění vojáka k druhu vojska; c) služebním zařazení vojáka a určení vojenské odbornosti; d) rozhodování o způsobilosti uchazeče pro výkon služby vojáka. Kontrolní testy 1. Kontrola tělesné přípravy se uskutečňuje přezkoušením pomocí základních kontrolních testů a rozšiřujících kontrolních testů. Základní kontrolní testy se využívají ke zjištění stavu výcviku v tělesné přípravě v základní úrovni. Rozšiřující kontrolní testy se využívají ke zjištění stavu zvláštních dovedností a návyků jednotlivců, skupin a složek organizačního celku z tematiky speciální tělesné přípravy. Rozšiřující kontrolní testy se mohou kombinovat se základními kontrolními testy. Základní úroveň tělesné výkonnosti vojáků se zjišťuje jejím prověřením při výročním přezkoušení, které probíhá jednou do roka. Schopnost jednotlivců a složek organizačního celku plnit normami stanovená výkonnostní a dovednostní kritéria se ověřuje profesním přezkoušením v průběhu výcviku, při kontrolních cvičeních podle programu přípravy (výuky) a při tematických a komplexních kontrolách. V rámci výročního přezkoušení z tělesné přípravy se voják přezkušuje: ze souboru cvičení silových a vytrvalostních testů Profesní přezkoušení z tělesné přípravy je přezkoušení pohybových schopností a zvláštních dovedností jednotlivců a složek organizačního celku na základě testů a výkonnostních limitů, které se liší podle typu organizačního celku, odbornosti a systemizovaného místa. Při profesním přezkoušení z tělesné přípravy se zjišťuje: a) úroveň pohybových schopností jednotlivců ve vytrvalosti, rychlosti, obratnosti a síle pomocí základních kontrolních testů b) rozsah a úroveň zvláštních dovedností a návyků z výcviku jednotlivců, skupin a složek organizačního celku daného druhu vojska z tematiky speciální tělesné přípravy pomocí rozšiřujících kontrolních testů Jednotlivé organizační celky nebo jejich složky se zařazují do výkonnostních skupin A, B a C podle požadavků na stupeň jejich vycvičenosti. 2. Do výkonnostní skupiny A se zařazují organizační celky nebo jejich složky s vysokou náročností na tělesnou připravenost jejich příslušníků. 3. Do výkonnostní skupiny B se zařazují organizační celky nebo jejich složky se střední náročností na tělesnou připravenost jejich příslušníků. 4. Do výkonnostní skupiny C se zařazují organizační celky nebo jejich složky s požadavkem na zvládnutí základních pohybových schopností a dovedností jejich příslušníků. Kontrolní testy pro profesní přezkoušení z tělesné přípravy se vybírají tak, aby prověřily všechny pohybové schopnosti vojáka. Využívají se všechny skupiny základních kontrolních testů (silové a vytrvalostní testy, testy rychlosti a obratnosti a koordinace pohybu) a rozšiřující kontrolní testy. 2. U organizačních celků nebo jejich součástí ve výkonnostní skupině C se přezkušuje podle základních a rozšiřujících kontrolních testů. 3. U organizačních celků nebo jejich součástí ve výkonnostní skupině A a B se přezkušuje podle rozšiřujících kontrolních testů. V závislosti na úkolech organizačního celku je možno přezkušovat rovněž podle základních kontrolních testů nebo se mohou kombinovat základní kontrolní testy s rozšiřujícími kontrolními testy.","output":"Výcvik tělesné přípravy je klíčovou součástí tréninku vojáků, jehož hlavním cílem je zajistit, aby byli fyzicky připraveni na plnění svých úkolů a zvládání zátěže ve všech situacích. Kontrola a hodnocení tělesné přípravy má za úkol sledovat průběh a efektivitu výcvikového procesu, úroveň fyzické kondice jednotlivých vojáků a připravenost vojenských jednotek během výcvikového období. Tyto výsledky mají vliv na služební hodnocení, umístění, funkční zařazení a určení kvalifikace vojáků. Kontrolní testy se dělí na základní a rozšířené, kde základní testy slouží k posouzení generální fyzické kondice a rozšířené testy hodnotí speciální pohybové dovednosti a schopnosti vyžadované různými vojenskými specializacemi. Výkonnost a schopnosti jednotlivců i celých jednotek se testují při výročních přezkoušeních i během celého roku prostřednictvím profesionálních kontrolových testů. Organizační celky jsou na základě výsledků těchto testů řazeny do výkonnostních skupin A (vysoká tělesná náročnost), B (střední tělesná náročnost) nebo C (základní pohybové schopnosti a dovednosti), které odpovídají požadavkům na jejich fyzickou kondici.

Однако, на первый взгляд, важное место, которое могло бы вызывать проблему, это начальная установка состояния в функции \`cmd_start\`. При каждом вызове команды \`/start\`, несмотря на то, что пользователь мог уже ранее вводить информацию, вы сбрасываете состояние и предлагаете начать процесс с начала. Однако, проблема может быть глубже и заключаться в логике функции \`generate_bio\`. Вы извлекаете значение \`last_question_idx\` из базы данных и если пользователь уже отвечал на вопросы, он должен вернуться к последнему неотвеченному вопросу. Если бот каждый раз начинает с первого вопроса, возможно, проблемы с извлечением или сохранением этого индекса. Возможные направления для диагностики и исправления: 1. **Проверка корректности сохранения \`last_question_idx\`**: Убедитесь, что после каждого ответа пользователя, индекс последнего заданного вопроса (\`last_question_idx\`) корректно обновляется в базе данных. Это ключевой момент, так как именно на основе этого индекса определяется, какой вопрос спросить дальше. 2. **Проверка запроса к базе данных в \`generate_bio\`**: Убедитесь, что запрос к базе данных верно выдает значение \`last_question_idx\`. Возможно, значение не извлекается корректно или извлекается значение, которое не соответствует действительности. 3. **Инициализация профиля пользователя при первом обращении**: При первом обращении пользователя, вы правильно добавляете его в базу с начальным индексом вопроса 0. Убедитесь, что при повторных обращениях текущий индекс вопроса правильно интегрирован в логику бота и корректно влияет на выбор следующего вопроса. 4. **Логика перехода между состояниями**: Проверьте логику перехода между состояниями в функциях обработки сообщений. Убедитесь, что после ответа на вопрос, идет переход к корректному следующему состоянию или завершение опроса. Эти шаги помогут идентифицировать и устранить проблему повторного начала с первого вопроса. Также рекомендуется добавить логирование ключевых шагов логики (например, сохранение ответа и обновление индекса последнего вопроса), чтобы точнее определить, в какой момент логика не срабатывает как ожидалось."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Nice to see you back from school, Nate.” Nate: “Hey Natsuki, thanks!

Due to Shikai restoring the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] through the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] making himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China like in OTL, the post-Xinhai, post-Qing modern warlord era of modern Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] continuing and [the restored Chinese monarchy] expanding on the federalist, parliamentary and democratic systems introduced to Han China proper by the Beiyang Government through the first ROC.

The Empire of China is thus [the Empire of China] able to win the National Protection War against the Nationalists and [the Empire of China] restabilize Han China, although Nationalist China survives in its [Nationalist China's] stronghold of Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi]. The loss in the National Protection War leads to the ousting of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" from power in the rump Nationalist China and the emergence of a mostly buisness-oriented, anti-Chinese, anti-unification, pro-independence Cantonese nationalist and Cantonese independence clique in the government of the rump Nationalist China. These Cantonese nationalists and independence activists make a series of negotiations that ensure the independence of the rump Nationalist China in Cantonia from the restored Ming Empire in Han China proper in all but name.","output":"Chapter 7: The Restoration of the Great Ming and the Divergence of China In the early decades of the 20th century, the landscape of East Asia underwent a transformation that would redefine the course of China’s history for the coming centuries. The Xinhai Revolution of 1911–1912, a period marked by upheaval and the pursuit of national liberation, laid the groundwork for the creation of a new political entity: a Beiyang Government-ruled Federal Parliamentary Presidential Republic, which emerged from the ashes of the centuries-old Qing Dynasty. This new entity was different from the traditional dynastic rule that had characterized China for millennia, embodying a blend of modern governance structures with the military dominance of the Beiyang faction. The transition was precipitated by the visionary efforts of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen and his Tongmenghui, a movement driven by a potent mix of Han nationalism, Chinese imperialism, and an aspiration for a socio-political metamorphosis influenced by Marxist-Stalinist ideals. In their quest for national rebirth, the Xinhai Revolution intended not merely to overthrow the Manchu-dominated Qing but to restore the glory of the Ming Dynasty under the auspices of the Imperial House of Zhu, an objective deeply influenced by the millenarian aspirations of the Yellow Sand Society and other Han monarchist factions. Yuan Shikai, once a staunch pillar of the Qing, emerged as a pivotal figure in shaping post-revolutionary China. In a radical departure from the historical trajectory that saw him proclaim himself as Emperor, Yuan chose instead to facilitate the reenthronement of the Imperial House of Zhu, thereby altering the fabric of China’s imperial legacy through the establishment of the Empire of China. This singular act not only averted the fragmentation of China into warlord fiefdoms but also sustained and expanded the federalist, parliamentary, and democratic reforms initiated by the Beiyang Government. However, the ambitions of the nascent Kuomingtang (KMT), led by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, posed a significant challenge to the Ming restoration. The KMT, adhering to Sun’s Three Principles of the People, carved a niche for itself in the southern realms of China, particularly in Guangdong and Guangxi, thereby necessitating the National Protection War of 1915–1916. The conflict, emblematic of the ideological chasm between the KMT’s vision for a unitary directorial republic and the restored Ming’s federal parliamentary structure, eventually culminated in an unexpected compromise - the secession and restoration of the Dali Kingdom in Yunnan in reciprocity for its support against the KMT rebellion. The reenthroned Ming Dynasty's strategic concession to the Dali Kingdom exemplified the Empire’s adaptability and its commitment to a federalist ethos, ensuring the pacification and stabilization of Han China proper. Meanwhile, the KMT's stronghold in Canton (Guangdong and Guangxi) evolved into a quasi-independent entity, distinguishing itself from the mainland's rejuvenated Ming rule. This divergence marked the birth of a new Cantonese nationalism, propelled by a business-orientated clique that aspired for autonomy from the broader Chinese framework. Thus, in the wake of the National Protection War and the subsequent political rearrangements, China witnessed an unprecedented bifurcation. The north and central regions, under the aegis of the restored Ming Dynasty, embarked on a path towards consolidation and modernization, nurturing a federal parliamentary democracy that integrated traditional monarchical elements. Concurrently, the southern enclave of the rump Nationalist China, driven by Cantonia’s assertive autonomy, cultivated an identity distinct from the restored Ming's imperial governance. The reconstitution of the Great Ming and the evolution of Cantonia represent not just a historical anomaly but a testament to the complexities of nation-building in the face of divergent ideologies and regional loyalties. As the 20th century progressed, these concurrently existing entities — one an emblem of China’s imperial legacy, the other a beacon of modern nationalism — navigated their unique trajectories, laying the groundwork for a new era in Chinese, and indeed world, history."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Nice to see you back from school, Nate.” Nate: “Hey Natsuki, thanks!

Cependant, il semble que vous ayez un problème lié à l'interaction précise avec Supabase pour l'insertion d'une nouvelle annonce depuis votre widget Flutter. Voici un guide étape par étape pour ajuster votre code et permettre la création d'une annonce à distance (sur Supabase) : # 1. Préparez Vos Données Avant d'essayer de créer une annonce à distance, assurez-vous que toutes les données nécessaires sont collectées et valides. Il s'agit notamment du titre, de la description, des dates de début et de fin, et du type d'annonce. Vous semblez avoir déjà des contrôleurs pour ces informations. # 2. Conversion de l'Annonce en Objet La portion de code suivie semble tenter de publier une annonce sans la construire d'abord en objet \`Annonce\` correct. Vous référencez \`annonce\` dans \`daq.AnnonceQueries.publishAnnonce(annonce);\`, mais \`annonce\` n'était pas définie avant dans le code que vous avez partagé. Vous devez d'abord créer un objet \`Annonce\` à partir des informations recueillies : \`\`\`dart final annonce = Annonce( titre: _titleController.text, description: _descriptionController.text, dateDeb: DateTime.parse(_dateDebController.text), dateFin: DateTime.parse(_dateFinController.text), idType: typesAnnonce![_selectedTypeAnnonceIndex!].id, // Ajoutez d'autres champs nécessaires ici. ); \`\`\` # 3. Créez l'Annonce à Distance Votre méthode \`publishAnnonce\` semble correcte pour l'ajout d'une annonce dans Supabase, mais assurez-vous de l'appeler avec l'objet \`annonce\` correctement construit. \`\`\`dart final idAnnonceCree = await daq.AnnonceQueries.publishAnnonce(annonce); \`\`\` Assurez-vous que la méthode \`publishAnnonce\` renvoie l'ID de l'annonce créée pour confirmation ou pour d'autres opérations. # 4. Gestion des Exceptions et Confirmation Il est crucial de gérer les exceptions qui peuvent se produire lors de l'interaction avec Supabase. Utilisez des blocs \`try-catch\` pour gérer les scénarios d'échec. \`\`\`dart try { final idAnnonceCree = await daq.AnnonceQueries.publishAnnonce(annonce); // Afficher un message de succès ou naviguer. } catch (e) { // Gérer l'exception, montrer un message d'erreur, etc. } \`\`\` # 5. Mise à Jour de l'Interface Utilisateur Une fois l'annonce créée, vous pouvez vouloir nettoyer le formulaire, afficher un message de succès, ou même naviguer l'utilisateur vers une autre page de votre application. # Conclusion Votre structure de base est bonne, mais vous devez vous assurer de la construction correcte de l'objet \`Annonce\` à partir des données du formulaire et de la manipulation correcte des retours et exceptions de la méthode \`publishAnnonce\`. Il est aussi important de mettre à jour l'interface utilisateur en conséquence pour refléter l'état actuel de l'opération (succès, en attente, ou échec)."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Nice to see you back from school, Nate.” Nate: “Hey Natsuki, thanks!

Described with the atomic symbol Ky and atomic number 5, Kyoron occupies a special place within its fictional elemental group labeled as \\"Group A\\". Its attributes suggest profound implications for the technology, culture, and visual experience within its universe. Let's delve deeper into its characteristics and potential applications: # Physical and Sensory Properties - **Appearance:** To human observers, Kyoron appears as opaque, pitch black, absorbing 100% of light, which presents a profound visual enigma. However, for beings with kyoron-based photoreceptors, it manifests as a turbulent, color-changing liquid, comprising a palette of undiscovered colors. This dichotomy underscores the element's unique interaction with light and perception. - **Non-toxicity:** Kyoron is described as inert, tasteless, non-flammable, and non-toxic, making it safe for consumption. This broadens its potential uses, especially in cultures or technologies that prioritize safety and environmental compatibility. - **Kyorophoton production:** One of the most revolutionary properties of Kyoron is its ability to produce kyorophotons, a new, non-electromagnetic type of photon. This aspect alone suggests a paradigm shift in the understanding of light and energy in its universe. # Technological and Cultural Applications - **Kyorotechnology:** Leveraging kyorophotons, kyoronic technology introduces kyorophotonic lights. Such technologies can replicate a vast spectrum of colors, including those perceived by the mantis shrimp (known for its extensive color vision in the real world) and even impossible or forbidden colors. This implies advancements in display technology, art, design, and optical communication, pushing the boundaries of creativity and information exchange. - **Programmability and Omega Physics:** Kyoron is programmable, suggesting compatibility with computing and digital technologies. The reference to \\"omega physics\\" indicates that Kyoron's properties lead to a new understanding of natural forces, potentially unlocking new forms of computation, material science, and theoretical physics. - **Enhanced Visual Perception:** For beings equipped with kyoron-based photoreceptors, the world is a kaleidoscope of colors far beyond human comprehension. This not only suggests ecological and evolutionary adaptations but also presents a profound metaphor for understanding and perception's relativity. In essence, Kyoron embodies the intersection of the unknown and the imaginable, serving as a foundation for a wide array of technological marvels and experiences within its fictional universe. Its properties challenge our understanding of physics, chemistry, and perception, making it a cornerstone element for constructing a richly detailed, speculative world where the boundaries of technology and magic blur."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Nice to see you back from school, Nate.” Nate: “Hey Natsuki, thanks!

He might offer goods and services that are of particular need during the colder months, demonstrating his adaptability and sharp wit to survive and thrive in any season. 3. **Chief Bogo** (Cape Buffalo): Since cape buffaloes do not hibernate but might migrate to find food during dry seasons in their native habitats, Chief Bogo would likely organize and oversee migrations or movements within Zootopia to ensure that all animals have access to resources during the colder months. His leadership and strength would ensure safety and order during these times of scarcity. 4. **Flash** (Sloth): Given that sloths are from tropical environments and do not hibernate, Flash would continue his slow-paced lifestyle, unaffected by the change of seasons. However, during the \\"hibernation season,\\" he might slow down even more due to the colder temperatures, becoming even more of a figure of patience and calmness in Zootopia's DMV. 5. **Yax** (Yak): Yaks are well adapted to cold weather and do not hibernate; they have thick fur and a robust physiological makeup that allows them to withstand low temperatures. Yax would likely be unaffected by the colder season, possibly even thriving. He might use this time to offer warmth and shelter to other animals, turning his naturist club into a cozy retreat for those less adapted to the cold. 6. **Gazelle** (Gazelle): Gazelles, being creatures of arid and semi-arid environments, do not hibernate. During a \\"hibernation season,\\" Gazelle, the pop star, would likely use her high energy and mobility to continue performing and uplifting the spirits of Zootopia's residents, possibly even organizing concerts and events specifically to brighten the darker, colder months. 7. **Finnick** (Fennec Fox): As a fennec fox, Finnick would not need to hibernate thanks to his species' adaptation to desert life. However, during the colder season, he might find the hustle a bit harder, potentially teaming up with Nick for some winter-specific schemes or finding innovative ways to use his small size and agility to navigate the challenges of the season. 8. **Mrs. Otterton** (North American Otter): Otters do not hibernate. They have thick fur to insulate them and can find food even in cold waters. Mrs. Otterton would likely use her resourcefulness and adaptability to keep her family safe and warm, perhaps by gathering extra food resources or creating a cozy den for her loved ones. 9. **Officer Clawhauser** (Cheetah): Cheetahs do not hibernate and are not significantly impacted by seasons due to their habitats in plains and savannahs. Clawhauser would likely continue his duties at the ZPD, his vibrant personality undimmed, perhaps indulging in seasonal treats and spreading cheer to his colleagues and the citizens he interacts with. 10. **Mayor Lionheart** (Lion): Lions do not hibernate; they are active all year round. Mayor Lionheart would likely use the \\"hibernation season\\" as a time to demonstrate his leadership and strength by ensuring that Zootopia's administrative functions run smoothly during this period. He might focus on implementing policies or initiatives to support the inhabitants of Zootopia who are more affected by the cold season, showcasing a protective, noble side of his leadership."},{"instruction":"“I know headquarters wants us to add that new product line,” said Dell Havasi, manager of Billings Company’s Office Products Division. “But I want to see the numbers before I make any move. Our division’s return on investment (ROI) has led the company for three years, and I don’t want any letdown.” Billings Company is a decentralized wholesaler with five autonomous divisions. The divisions are evaluated on the basis of ROI, with year-end bonuses given to the divisional managers who have the highest ROIs. Operating results for the company’s Office Products Division for this year are given below: Sales 22,235,000 Variable expenses 13,981,800 Contribution margin 8,253,200 Fixed expenses 6,100,000 Net operating income 2,153,200 Divisional average operating assets 4,625,000 The company had an overall return on investment (ROI) of 17.00% this year (considering all divisions). Next year the Office Products Division has an opportunity to add a new product line that would require an additional investment that would increase average operating assets by 2,400,000. The cost and revenue characteristics of the new product line per year would be: Sales 9,600,000 Variable expenses 65% of sales Fixed expenses 2,582,400 3. Compute the Office Products Division’s ROI for next year assuming that it performs the same as this year and adds the new product line. (Do not round intermediate calculations. Round your answers to 2 decimal places.)","output":"1. Calculate the division's current ROI: ROI = Net Operating Income / Average Operating Assets ROI = 2,153,200 / 4,625,000 ROI = 46.60% 2. Calculate the additional net operating income from the new product line: Additional Net Operating Income = Sales - Variable Expenses - Fixed Expenses Additional Net Operating Income = 9,600,000 - (65% * 9,600,000) - 2,582,400 Additional Net Operating Income = 3,360,000 3. Calculate the new total net operating income with the new product line: New Total Net Operating Income = Current Net Operating Income + Additional Net Operating Income New Total Net Operating Income = 2,153,200 + 3,360,000 New Total Net Operating Income = 5,513,200 4. Calculate the new total average operating assets with the new product line: New Total Average Operating Assets = Current Average Operating Assets + Additional Investment New Total Average Operating Assets = 4,625,000 + 2,400,000 New Total Average Operating Assets = 7,025,000 5. Calculate the division's ROI for next year with the new product line: ROI = New Total Net Operating Income / New Total Average Operating Assets ROI = 5,513,200 / 7,025,000 ROI = 78.45% Therefore, the Office Products Division's ROI for next year, assuming it performs the same as this year and adds the new product line, would be 78.45%."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Nice to see you back from school, Nate.” Nate: “Hey Natsuki, thanks!

This type of diagram is crucial for understanding how a particular hydrocarbon mixture behaves in the subsurface environment, guiding decisions in the development and production of oil and gas reservoirs. The PVT relationships are fundamental for reservoir engineering, production forecasting, surface facilities design, and pipeline transportation. Here are the key concepts and parameters involved in drawing a PVT phase diagram for all set of reservoirs: 1. **Phases:** Hydrocarbon fluids exist in either gaseous, liquid, or solid (rarely relevant for typical reservoir conditions) phases, and their state is influenced by the temperature, pressure, and composition. The PVT diagram helps identify the phase behavior of the reservoir fluid at specific conditions. 2. **Critical Point:** The critical point is the highest temperature and pressure at which gas and liquid phases of the substance can coexist. At this point, the properties of gas and liquid phases become identical, and the fluid is in a supercritical phase. In the PVT diagram, the critical point marks the end of the two-phase envelope curve. 3. **Two-Phase Region:** This area on the PVT diagram is bounded by the bubble point curve and the dew point curve. Within this region, the hydrocarbon fluid exists as a mixture of liquid and gas phases. 4. **Bubble Point Curve:** The bubble point line delineates the conditions under which the first bubble of gas comes out of solution from the liquid phase as the pressure decreases or temperature increases. It defines the boundary of the liquid phase envelope in a PVT diagram. 5. **Dew Point Curve:** The dew point line marks the conditions at which the first drop of liquid condenses from the gas phase as the pressure increases or temperature decreases. It defines the boundary of the gas phase envelope in the PVT diagram. 6. **Critical Temperature and Pressure:** These are specific points that mark the critical condition for the fluid. The critical temperature is the highest temperature at which a fluid can exist as a liquid, while the critical pressure is the pressure at which gas and liquid phases have the same density and are indistinguishable at the critical temperature. 7. **Tricritical Point (Triple Point is Commonly Used in Other Contexts):** While the term \\"tricondenther\\" doesn't apply, relatedly, the triple point in phase diagrams for single components is where solid, liquid, and gas phases can coexist in equilibrium. However, for multicomponent systems like reservoir fluids, tricritical points can arise under specific conditions where three phases may coexist, but this is more complex and rarely discussed in simplified PVT explanations. The PVT diagram is drawn based on experimental data obtained from PVT analysis conducted on reservoir fluid samples. The analysis provides essential data on the composition, volatility, density, viscosity, and phase behavior of the fluid, which are critical for the accurate modeling of the reservoir and the planning of its development. In summary, PVT phase diagrams are complex and provide essential insight into the phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures in reservoir conditions. Understanding the interactions of pressure, volume, and temperature, along with the critical parameters discussed, is fundamental for effective reservoir management and production strategy development."},{"instruction":"also include tricondentherm and tricondenbaf","output":"The terms \\"tricondentherm\\" and \\"tricondenbaf\\" as specified in your request do not seem to be standard terms used within the context of reservoir engineering, phase behavior studies, or petroleum engineering. It's possible there might be a misunderstanding, miscommunication, or typographical error regarding these specific terms. In the realm of phase diagrams and fluid behavior, especially related to petroleum engineering and reservoir studies, the most relevant and commonly discussed terms include: - **Critical Point:** Where the phase boundary between liquid and vapor disappears. - **Triple Point:** The condition under which three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) coexist in equilibrium. However, this is more relevant to pure substances rather than the complex mixtures typically found in reservoir fluids. - **Two-phase envelope:** The region bounded by the bubble point and dew point curves where liquid and gas phases coexist. For reservoir fluids and their PVT (Pressure-Volume-Temperature) analysis, we discuss phenomena such as: - **Bubble Point:** The condition under which the first bubble of gas forms as pressure drops or temperature increases in a liquid system. - **Dew Point:** The condition under which the first drop of liquid condenses from a vapor as pressure increases or temperature decreases. Regarding multicomponent systems like hydrocarbon reservoir fluids, there are indeed complex behaviors including **retrograde condensation**, which occurs in the gas condensate systems. However, specific terms like \\"tricondentherm\\" and \\"tricondenbaf\\" do not fit within the commonly accepted terminology or concepts as teaching in petroleum engineering or chemistry related to PVT analysis. If your topic is related to an advanced or very specific concept within a niche area of research in reservoir fluids or thermodynamics that has introduced new terminology, it would be helpful to refer to the most recent and cutting-edge scientific literature or clarify the context of these terms. As of my last update, these terms are not standard in the scientific literature related to fluid phase behavior, PVT analysis, or reservoir engineering. Therefore, without additional context or clarification, providing accurate information based on these terms is challenging. Expanding on confirmed, well-established concepts in fluid dynamics and reservoir engineering might be more beneficial for understanding the phase behavior of reservoir fluids."},{"instruction":"Cricondenbar and Cricondentherm","output":"Apologies for the oversight. Let's clarify the terms \\"cricondenbar\\" and \\"cricondentherm,\\" which are indeed relevant and important in the context of PVT analysis and phase behavior studies for reservoir fluids. 1. **Cricondentherm**: This is the highest temperature at which liquid and vapor phases of a substance can coexist in equilibrium. Beyond the cricondentherm, the substance cannot exist as a liquid, regardless of the pressure applied. In a PVT diagram, the cricondentherm is found at the topmost point of the two-phase envelope, signifying the limit of temperature for the coexistence of liquid and gas phases for a given composition. It is particularly important when dealing with gas condensate reservoirs, as it helps define the temperature conditions under which maximum liquid dropout from the gas phase can occur. 2. **Cricondenbar**: This is the highest pressure at which liquid and vapor phases of a substance can coexist in equilibrium. Beyond the cricondenbar, the substance cannot exist as vapor, irrespective of the temperature. In a PVT diagram, the cricondenbar is found at the rightmost point of the two-phase envelope, representing the pressure limit for the coexistence of liquid and gas phases for a given composition. For reservoir engineers, understanding the cricondenbar is crucial for managing the pressure of reservoirs, especially for those containing volatile oil and gas condensates, to optimize recovery and prevent issues like retrograde condensation within the reservoir. Both cricondentherm and cricondenbar are critical points on the phase diagram of a multicomponent system, marking the boundaries of phase behavior under equilibrium conditions. These points are essential for designing and operating production facilities that handle hydrocarbon fluids, especially for reservoirs containing complex mixtures where phase behavior significantly impacts recovery strategies. In practical applications, knowing the location of these points on the PVT phase diagram of the reservoir fluid helps in fine-tuning the reservoir management strategies, such as maintaining reservoir pressure above the cricondenbar to minimize liquid dropout in gas condensates or adjusting temperature conditions in processing facilities based on the cricondentherm to optimize hydrocarbon liquid recovery."},{"instruction":"“I know headquarters wants us to add that new product line,” said Dell Havasi, manager of Billings Company’s Office Products Division. “But I want to see the numbers before I make any move.

The juxtaposition of the joyous, communal spirit of Christmas against your protagonist's isolation and internal conflict can create a powerful contrast that engages readers deeply. Exploring themes such as redemption, loneliness, and the possibility of reconciliation or self-acceptance during a time traditionally associated with togetherness and celebration can add layers of depth to your story. Here are a few considerations and suggestions to help you develop your idea further: 1. **Character Development**: Delving into your protagonist's emotional state and backstory will be crucial. Consider what led to their incarceration, their feelings about their past actions, and their hopes or fears for the future. Their journey towards self-forgiveness or the decision to seek reconciliation with their family could be central to the narrative. 2. **Setting and Atmosphere**: The stark contrast between the festive cheer surrounding the protagonist and their personal turmoil can be highlighted through descriptions of the setting. Empty streets, closed shops, or even the distant sound of celebrations could serve to underscore their isolation. 3. **Supporting Characters**: Introducing characters who either heighten the protagonist's sense of isolation or offer a bridge to healing and connection can enrich the story. These could be old friends, strangers, or even members of their family with whom they have a complicated relationship. 4. **Symbolism**: Christmas symbols (such as lights, gifts, or a Christmas tree) can be used metaphorically to reflect the protagonist's emotional journey. For instance, a discarded Christmas tree by the roadside could mirror their feelings of abandonment or loss, while a single light in a window might symbolize hope. 5. **Resolution**: The end of your story doesn't have to be conventionally \\"happy\\" to be meaningful. Whether your protagonist makes a small step towards healing, decides to face their family, or simply comes to a new understanding about themselves, what matters is the sense of growth or change. Using Christmas as a backdrop for such a poignant story could highlight not only the pain of loneliness but also the potential for renewal and hope, even in our darkest moments. This contrast can make for a memorable and touching narrative. Remember, the beauty of storytelling lies in its ability to explore the complexities of the human condition—your story sounds like it's poised to do just that."},{"instruction":"the backstory is the protagonist, Jackson was thrown in jail a year ago for his violent robbing tendencies, since he grew up in poverty","output":"With Jackson's backstory rooted in a life of poverty leading to violent crimes and ultimately his incarceration, you're setting the stage for a deeply nuanced character study that explores the intersection of socioeconomic factors, individual choices, and the potential for redemption. This context adds layers of complexity to his emotional state and actions during the Christmas season, a time when societal pressures and personal reflections are often amplified. As you further develop Jackson's narrative, consider the following aspects to deepen the story and character arc: 1. **Motivations and Regrets**: Dive into Jackson's motivations for turning to a life of crime, emphasizing the struggles and perhaps moments of desperation that led to his choices. Reflecting on his actions from the vantage point of his current isolation could offer insights into his regrets, aspirations, or a desire to break free from the cycle of poverty and violence. 2. **Encounters and Reflections**: Introduce characters or situations that prompt Jackson to reflect on his life choices. This could be an unexpected encounter with someone from his past, an act of kindness from a stranger, or even observing a scene that mirrors his own family experiences. These moments can serve as catalysts for introspection and possibly transformation. 3. **Family Dynamics**: Exploring the complexity of Jackson’s relationship with his family can add emotional depth. Consider the dynamics before his incarceration, how his actions affected his family, and their potential reactions to his release. This might include feelings of betrayal, worry, or unresolved anger, but also love and a desire for reconciliation. 4. **Theme of Hope and Redemption**: Despite the bleakness of Jackson's situation, weaving in a theme of hope and the possibility of redemption can resonate strongly, especially against the Christmas backdrop. This could come in the form of him taking small, positive actions, such as helping someone in need, which could reignite a sense of self-worth and a desire for change. 5. **Climactic Moment**: Consider creating a pivotal moment that challenges Jackson—perhaps a choice that tests his resolve or an opportunity to make amends in some way. This moment can act as a catalyst for personal growth or change, and doesn't need to fully resolve his situation but can point to a new direction or mindset. 6. **Setting and Atmosphere**: Use the festive atmosphere to contrast with Jackson's internal and external world. The brightness of Christmas lights, the joy of families gathering, and the coldness of winter can all serve as metaphors for his journey from darkness towards a potential light. As you develop this story, maintaining a balance between the harsh realities of Jackson's circumstances and the universal search for meaning, redemption, and connection can make for a compelling narrative. His journey during the Christmas season, a time typically associated with rebirth and joy, could offer a poignant commentary on the challenges of overcoming one's past and the resilience of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: \\"Morning, Nate!

Рекомендация заключается в том, чтобы проверять не только индекс последнего вопроса, но и количество данных (ответов) пользователя в базе данных, чтобы точно знать, какие вопросы уже были заданы и какие вопросы нужно задать.

Updated Critical Path after Iteration 1: A > C > E (crashed by 1 day) > G - **New Project Duration:** 13 days - **New Direct Costs:** - Increment due to 'E' crashing: 20 - Updated Total Direct Costs: 1,200 + 20 = 1,220 - **New Indirect Costs:** 50/day x 13 days = 650 - **Total Cost after Iteration 1:** 1,220 (Direct) + 650 (Indirect) = 1,870 # Iteration 2: Compress by One More Day Now, we seek to reduce the duration further, focusing again on the critical path. - Since 'E' can be crashed further by 1 day for an additional 20, we'll do that, bringing it down to 3 days. Updated Critical Path after Iteration 2: A > C > E (crashed to 3 days) > G - **New Project Duration:** 12 days - **New Direct Costs:** - Increment due to another 'E' crashing: 20 - Updated Total Direct Costs: 1,220 + 20 = 1,240 - **New Indirect Costs:** 50/day x 12 days = 600 - **Total Cost after Iteration 2:** 1,240 (Direct) + 600 (Indirect) = 1,840 # Iteration 3: Compress by Another Day For further compression, we can look at either 'C' or starting on another task since 'E' reached its minimum. - Crashing 'C' by 1 day (cost of 40 per day) is feasible. It's on the critical path and can be reduced from 5 days to 4. Updated Critical Path after Iteration 3: A > C (crashed by 1 day) > E (previously crashed to 3 days) > G - **New Project Duration:** 11 days - **New Direct Costs:** - Increment due to 'C' crashing: 40 - Updated Total Direct Costs: 1,240 + 40 = 1,280 - **New Indirect Costs:** 50/day x 11 days = 550 - **Total Cost after Iteration 3:** 1,280 (Direct) + 550 (Indirect) = 1,830 # Optimal Project Duration for Lowest Cost After Iteration 3, the total project duration is 11 days with a cost of 1,830.

Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni potenziali miglioramenti e considerazioni che potresti voler prendere in considerazione: 1. **Gestione delle Risorse:** Attualmente, stai chiudendo il \`ServerSocket\` usando una try-with-resources, che è una buona pratica. Tuttavia, potresti voler assicurarti che ogni socket client gestito da \`ClientHandler\` sia anche correttamente chiuso alla fine della comunicazione. Questo di solito è qualcosa che dovrebbe essere considerato all'interno della logica di \`ClientHandler\`. 2. **Configurazione del Server:** Ottimo lavoro nell'utilizzare un file di configurazione! È una buona pratica perché rende il tuo server più flessibile senza dover riconfigurare il codice. Puoi migliorare questo ulteriormente gestendo casi dove alcune proprietà potrebbero non essere presenti nel file di configurazione e fornire dei valori di default. 3. **Gestione delle Eccezioni:** La tua gestione delle eccezioni è adeguata, ma potresti espandere le tue risposte agli errori per offrire una migliore diagnostica dei problemi. Ad esempio, quando viene intercettata una \`IOException\` durante l’esecuzione del server, potrebbe essere utile stampare lo stack trace completo per una diagnosi più approfondita. 4. **Numero di Thread nel Pool:** Hai scelto un pool fisso di 20 thread. Questo potrebbe essere adeguato per carichi di lavoro modesti, ma potrebbe essere una limitazione per un'applicazione più grande con molti utenti simultanei. Considera strategie per rendere questo valore configurabile oppure esplora l'uso di \`Executors.newCachedThreadPool()\`, che può adattarsi dinamicamente al numero richiesto di thread, anche se richiede più attenzione per evitare l'esaurimento delle risorse in un sistema con un alto numero di richieste. 5. Mancano alcuni dettagli implementativi nella tua classe, come la definizione di \`ClientHandler\`. Assicurati che questa classe gestisca correttamente le connessioni dei client in modo efficiente e sicuro. Ad esempio, considera un timeout per le connessioni client per evitare di occupare risorse con connessioni inattive. 6. **Security:** Non hai menzionato alcuno strato di sicurezza nel tuo server. Per applicazioni reali, dovresti considerare l'aggiunta di TLS/SSL per crittografare il traffico tra i client e il server per proteggere i dati sensibili. 7. **Logging:** Potresti voler implementare un sistema di logging più sofisticato (ad esempio, utilizzando Log4j o SLF4J) anziché stampare semplicemente messaggi sulla console. Questo può aiutarti nell'analisi dei problemi, nel monitoraggio delle performance e nell'auditing. 8. **Documentazione e Convenzioni di Codice:** È sempre una buona pratica commentare il tuo codice e seguire le convenzioni standard di codice Java (ad esempio, nome dei metodi, variabili) per migliorare la leggibilità e la manutenibilità. Ricorda, la chiave per un software di successo non è solo farlo funzionare, ma anche renderlo mantenibile, scalabile e sicuro."},{"instruction":"public static void readConfig() throws IOException { try (InputStream input = ServerMain.class.getResourceAsStream(configFile)) { if (input == null) { throw new IOException(\\"File di configurazione non trovato\\"); } Properties prop = new Properties(); prop.load(input); port = Integer.parseInt(prop.getProperty(\\"port\\")); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\\"Formato numero non valido nel file di configurazione: \\" + e.getMessage()); throw e; } } spiegami riga per riga questo metodo","output":"Il metodo \`readConfig()\` è progettato per leggere delle configurazioni da un file di proprietà e assegnare i valori letti a delle variabili statiche all'interno della classe \`ServerMain\`. Ecco una spiegazione dettagliata riga per riga: 1. **Definizione del Metodo:** \`public static void readConfig() throws IOException {\` Questa linea definisce un metodo pubblico statico chiamato \`readConfig\` che non restituisce alcun valore (\`void\`). Il metodo può lanciare un'eccezione \`IOException\`, indicando che chi chiama questo metodo deve gestire o propagare ulteriormente questa eccezione. 2. **Tentativo di Apertura del File di Proprietà:** \`try (InputStream input = ServerMain.class.getResourceAsStream(configFile)) {\` Qui viene usato un try-with-resources che tenta di aprire un \`InputStream\` per leggere il file delle configurazioni. Il file è cercato nel classpath perché \`getResourceAsStream\` è usato, e il nome del file è specificato dalla variabile statica \`configFile\`. Il try-with-resources assicura che l'\`InputStream\` sia chiuso automaticamente alla fine del blocco try, prevenendo quindi possibili memory leak. 3. **Controllo se il File è Trovato:** \`if (input == null) {\` Questa condizione controlla se l'\`input\` è \`null\`, il che significherebbe che il file di configurazione non è stato trovato nel classpath. 4. **Lancio di Eccezione Se il File Non è Trovato:** \`throw new IOException(\\"File di configurazione non trovato\\");\` Se il file di configurazione non è stato trovato (cioè \`input\` è \`null\`), lancia manualmente un'\`IOException\` per segnalare l'errore. 5. **Creazione di un Oggetto \`Properties\`:** \`Properties prop = new Properties();\` Questa linea crea un nuovo oggetto \`Properties\`, che è una struttura chiave-valore utilizzata per leggere (e scrivere) file di proprietà. 6. **Caricamento delle Proprietà dal File:** \`prop.load(input);\` Questa istruzione legge il file di configurazione (surrogato dall'\`InputStream\`) e carica le proprietà nell'oggetto \`Properties\` appena creato. 7. **Lettura del Port Dal File di Proprietà e Conversione:** \`port = Integer.parseInt(prop.getProperty(\\"port\\"));\` Qui tentiamo di estrarre la proprietà \`port\` dal file di configurazione, convertirla da \`String\` a \`int\` e assegnarla alla variabile statica \`port\`. Se la proprietà non è presente oppure non è un valore intero valido, il codice solleverà un'eccezione. 8. **Gestione dell'Eccezione \`NumberFormatException\`:** \`catch (NumberFormatException e) {\` Questo blocco catch è eseguito se la conversione da \`String\` a \`int\` fallisce perché il valore di \`port\` nel file di configurazione non è un numero valido. 9. **Stampa del Messaggio di Errore:** \`System.err.println(\\"Formato numero non valido nel file di configurazione: \\" + e.getMessage());\` Se l'eccezione \`NumberFormatException\` è catturata, il codice stampa un messaggio di errore su \`System.err\`. 10 **Rilancio dell'Eccezione:** \`throw e;\` L'eccezione catturata viene rilanciata. Questo è importante perché mantiene visibile l'errore al livello superiore e impedisce al programma di continuare con configurazioni potenzialmente errate. 11. **Fine del Metodo:** \`}\` Questo chiude il blocco try e anche il metodo \`readConfig\`. In sintesi, il metodo \`readConfig()\` cerca di aprire e leggere un file di configurazione per ottenere il valore del \`port\` su cui il server deve ascoltare le connessioni in entrata. Gestisce anche errori legati all'assenza del file o alla presenza di valori invalidi, assicurando che queste condizioni siano segnalate chiaramente."},{"instruction":"spiegami meglio l'operazione di load","output":"L'operazione di \`load\` utilizzata nel contesto di leggere un file di configurazione è una funzionalità fornita dalla classe \`Properties\` di Java, che estende \`Hashtable<Object,Object>\`. Questo metodo è utilizzato per caricare (o leggere) le proprietà/chiavi da un \`InputStream\` o da un \`Reader\` in un oggetto \`Properties\`, consentendo quindi l'accesso facile e diretto ai valori delle proprietà specificate nel file. La firma del metodo che utilizza \`InputStream\` è: \`\`\`java public void load(InputStream inStream) throws IOException \`\`\` Quando invochi \`prop.load(input);\` nel tuo codice, ecco cosa avviene: 1. **Leggere il Flusso di Dati:** Il metodo \`load\` legge il flusso di dati dall'\`InputStream\` fornito (\`input\` nel tuo caso), che rappresenta il contenuto del tuo file di configurazione. Questo flusso di dati è tipicamente il contenuto testuale del file delle proprietà. 2. **Analisi del Formato delle Proprietà:** Il metodo analizza il contenuto secondo il formato standard dei file di proprietà di Java. Questi file sono in formato chiave=valore, dove ogni riga rappresenta una proprietà con la sua chiave e il suo valore associato. Per esempio: \`\`\` port=8080 \`\`\` Commenti e linee vuote sono ignorati. I commenti iniziano con il carattere \`#\` o \`!\`. 3. **Caricamento delle Coppie Chiave-Valore:** Per ogni coppia chiave-valore analizzata correttamente, il metodo \`load\` inserisce la coppia nell'oggetto \`Properties\`. La chiave e il valore sono considerati come stringhe. Se il file contiene chiavi duplicate, l'ultimo valore letto per quella chiave soprascrive qualsiasi valore precedentemente letto. 4. **Gestione delle Eccezioni:** Durante il processo di caricamento, possono verificarsi diverse situazioni che potrebbero generare un'\`IOException\`, come problemi di lettura del file (ad esempio, se il file non esiste, è corrotto o avviene un errore di I/O). Se si verifica un'eccezione, il processo di caricamento viene interrotto e l'eccezione viene propagata al chiamante. 5. **Conclusione del Caricamento:** Una volta che il file è stato completamente letto e tutte le coppie chiave-valore valide sono state caricate nell'oggetto \`Properties\`, il metodo \`load\` termina. Da questo momento, è possibile recuperare i valori delle proprietà utilizzando i metodi \`getProperty(String key)\` o \`getProperty(String key, String defaultValue)\` sull'oggetto \`Properties\`. L'operazione di \`load\` offre quindi un modo semplice ed efficiente per trasferire le impostazioni dal filesystem alla memoria del programma, rendendo queste impostazioni facilmente accessibili durante l'esecuzione del programma."},{"instruction":"import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter; import java.net.Socket; import java.net.UnknownHostException; import java.util.Scanner; import java.io.InputStream; import java.util.Properties; // javac -cp \\".:lib/gson-2.10.1.jar\\" HOTELIERServer.java Hotel.java ServerMain.java ClientMain.java HOTELIERCustomerClient.java User.java ResponseCodes.java MulticastListener.java // java -cp \\".:lib/gson-2.10.1.jar\\" ClientMain // rm -f *.class public class ClientMain { public static final String configFile = \\"server.properties\\"; public static int port; public static String serverIP; public static void main(String[] args) { // configuro il server try { readConfig(); } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\\"Errore durante la lettura del file di configurazione: \\" + e.getMessage()); return; } // variabile per leggere l'input da CL Scanner scanner = null; // variabile per leggere l'input dal server Scanner in = null; // apro il socket verso l'ind IP del server sulla porta 10000 try (Socket socket = new Socket(serverIP, port)) { // inizializzo lo scanner per leggere l'input da CL scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // inizializzo lo scanner per leggere l'input dal server attraverso il socket in = new Scanner(socket.getInputStream()); // per inviare output al server attraverso il socket PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true); HOTELIERCustomerClient client = new HOTELIERCustomerClient(scanner, in, out); // fase di autenticazione client.start(); // se viene inserito il comando \\"exit\\" return; } catch (UnknownHostException e) { System.out.println(\\"L'indirizzo IP del server non è stato trovato: \\" + e.getMessage()); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(\\"Si è verificato un errore di I/O: \\" + e.getMessage()); } finally { // chiudo le risorse Scanner se non sono null. if (scanner != null) { scanner.close(); } if (in != null) { in.close(); } } } public static void readConfig() throws IOException { // apro il file di configurazione try (InputStream input = ClientMain.class.getResourceAsStream(configFile)) { // se non è stato trovato il file lancio un' eccezione if (input == null) { throw new IOException(\\"File di configurazione non trovato\\"); } // carico le proprietà in prop Properties prop = new Properties(); prop.load(input); // leggo la porta dal file port = Integer.parseInt(prop.getProperty(\\"port\\")); // leggo l'indirizzo del server dal file serverIP = prop.getProperty(\\"serverIP\\"); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\\"Formato numero non valido nel file di configurazione: \\" + e.getMessage()); throw e; } } } ci sono errori? posso fare miglioramenti?","output":"Il tuo codice per un client che si connette a un server tramite socket è ben strutturato e funzionale. Ci sono però alcuni aspetti che potresti considerare per migliorare l'efficienza, la robustezza, e la leggibilità del codice: 1. **Gestione delle Risorse:** Utilizzi correttamente la try-with-resources per garantire che tutte le risorse vengano chiuse automaticamente alla fine del blocco try. Questo include il socket e gli oggetti \`Scanner\`, ma non chiudi esplicitamente il \`PrintWriter\`. Anche se in questo caso specifico il \`PrintWriter\` si basa sullo stream di output del socket (che viene chiuso automaticamente), è buona norma chiudere esplicitamente tutti gli stream/risorse che apri. 2. **Handling delle Eccezioni:** I tuoi catch per \`UnknownHostException\` e \`IOException\` stampano messaggi di errore, che è positivo. Potresti considerare di estendere la gestione degli errori per rivedere o riprovare la connessione in caso di fallimento, specialmente per \`IOException\` che può indicare un problema temporaneo di rete. 3. **Uso di \`System.err\` e \`System.out\`:** Mantieni la coerenza nell'uso di \`System.err\` per gli errori e \`System.out\` per i messaggi normali. Questo è buono, ma assicurati di essere coerente in tutto il tuo codice. 4. **Configurabilità e Validazione:** Ottimo lavoro nel rendere configurabili porta e indirizzo IP del server attraverso un file di proprietà. Tuttavia, considera di aggiungere una validazione per assicurarti che \`serverIP\` non sia \`null\` o vuoto dopo aver letto il file di configurazione. Inoltre, potresti voler fornire valori di default se qualche proprietà non è definita nel file di configurazione. 5. **Codice Morto / Logica Non Utilizzata:** Un piccolo dettaglio, ma “// se viene inserito il comando \\"exit\\"” sembra essere un commento che anticipa una logica non presente o rimasta incompleta. Se esiste un meccanismo per gestire comandi come \\"exit\\", assicurati che sia implementato correttamente. 6. **Specificità degli Oggetti Client:** Crei un \`HOTELIERCustomerClient\`, che presumibilmente gestisce la logica del client specifico del tuo programma. Assicurati che all'interno di questa classe vengano gestite correttamente la chiusura delle connessioni e dei streams, e che eventuali eccezioni siano catturate e gestite in modo da evitare di lasciare risorse aperte accidentalmente. In generale, il tuo codice sembra ben organizzato ed è un buon punto di partenza.

Queste strutture dati assicurano l'accesso thread-safe alle collezioni; per esempio, le operazioni di aggiornamento sulla \`ConcurrentHashMap\` sono atomiche e non richiedono ulteriori forme di sincronizzazione per mantenere la coerenza dei dati. Tuttavia, la questione della concorrenza non si esaurisce con l'uso di queste strutture dati. Guardando il tuo codice, ci sono altre considerazioni: 1. **Accesso ai File JSON:** Le operazioni di lettura e scrittura sui file JSON (\`load*\` e \`save*\` metodi) utilizzano blocchi sincronizzati basati su oggetti lock dedicati (\`lockReviews\`, \`lockUsers\`, \`lockHotels\`). Questo è importante e appropriato dato che l'accesso al file system deve essere serializzato per evitare corruzione dei dati o problemi di concorrenza. Assicurati che ogni accesso (lettura o scrittura) a questi file passi attraverso questi blocchi sincronizzati. 2. **Controllo dell'esistenza di oggetti prima dell'aggiunta:** Mentre l'uso di \`ConcurrentHashMap\` si occupa della sincronizzazione interna per operazioni base come inserimento e recupero, nel tuo caso specifico (ad esempio, durante la registrazione di un nuovo utente o inserimento di una nuova recensione), potresti voler verificare l'esistenza di un elemento prima di procedere con la sua aggiunta. Questo genere di \\"controllo-poi-azione\\" può esporre a condizioni di gara se non gestito dentro un blocco sincronizzato o utilizzando metodi atomici offerti dalla struttura dati concorrente quando appropriato (ad es., \`putIfAbsent\` su \`ConcurrentHashMap\`). 3. **Aggiornamento di \`Hotel\` in \`updateHotel\` method:** Sebbene tu utilizzi \`CopyOnWriteArrayList\` per la lista di hotel, e questo assicura che le iterazioni sulla lista siano sicure rispetto ai cambiamenti concorrenti, la modifica di un \`Hotel\` esistente (per esempio, aggiornando i suoi voti) non è intrinsecamente thread-safe. Potresti dover considerare l'applicazione di una sincronizzazione più fine o l'utilizzo di \`Atomic\` variabili all'interno degli oggetti \`Hotel\`, a seconda dell'esatta semantica di accesso/concorrenza prevista. 4. **Notifica Multicast:** L'invio di notifiche multicast (\`notifyClient\`) non coinvolge direttamente le strutture dati condivise da più thread, quindi il suo attuale implementazione non presenta particolari problemi di concorrenza. In breve, sei sulla strada giusta nell'utilizzo di strutture dati concorrenti e blocchi sincronizzati per la gestione di alcuni aspetti della concorrenza. Tuttavia, potrebbe essere necessario esaminare più da vicino e testare scenari specifici di accesso e modifica concorrente alle tue risorse condivise, in particolare per gli aggiornamenti agli oggetti \`Hotel\`, per assicurare che il tuo server sia completamente thread-safe."},{"instruction":"1.

Assicurati che ogni accesso (lettura o scrittura) a questi file passi attraverso questi blocchi sincronizzati. Aggiustami il mio codice in modo che faccia questo","output":"Il tuo codice è già sulla buona strada per utilizzare un meccanismo di sincronizzazione per l'accesso ai file JSON attraverso l'uso dei blocchi sincronizzati basati su oggetti di lock dedicati. Tuttavia, per assicurarti che ogni accesso (lettura o scrittura) ai file JSON passi attraverso questi blocchi sincronizzati come raccomandato, riassumerò e ribadirò come sono attualmente gestite queste parti nel tuo codice e come potresti confermare o rafforzare questa pratica. # 1. **Caricamento dei Dati (Lettura dei File JSON)** Per quanto riguarda il caricamento dei dati dalle funzioni \`loadHotels\`, \`loadUsers\` e \`loadReview\`, in questo momento non utilizzano esplicitamente blocchi sincronizzati perché vengono chiamate una volta all'inizio quando il server viene avviato. Presumo che il server non carichi dinamicamente queste risorse più volte durante l'esecuzione o in risposta a richieste dei client. Se il tuo design attuale richiede che queste funzioni siano chiamate solo una volta all'avvio, allora il modello attuale dovrebbe essere sicuro. Se prevedi di doverle chiamare più volte durante l'esecuzione del server, dovrai racchiuderne il contenuto in un blocco \\"synchronized\\" appropriato, simile a come fai per il salvataggio: \`\`\`java private void loadHotels(String jsonFilePath) { synchronized (lockHotels) { // La logica esistente } } \`\`\` E lo stesso per \`loadUsers\` e \`loadReview\` usando rispettivamente \`lockUsers\` e \`lockReviews\`. # 2. **Salvataggio dei Dati (Scrittura sui File JSON)** Per quanto riguarda il salvataggio dei dati, le funzioni \`saveHotel\`, \`saveUsers\`, e \`saveReview\` già utilizzano correttamente i blocchi sincronizzati: \`\`\`java private void saveHotel() { synchronized(lockHotels) { // La logica esistente } } \`\`\` Questo approccio è corretto e assicura che l'accesso in scrittura ai file sia protetto da problemi di concorrenza. # Conclusione Il tuo codice attualmente soddisfa la raccomandazione di assicurare che ogni accesso (lettura o scrittura) ai file JSON sia adeguatamente sincronizzato per quanto riguarda le operazioni di salvataggio. Se aggiorni il sistema per ricaricare i dati durante l'esecuzione, dovrai incorporare una logica di sincronizzazione simile anche nelle funzioni di caricamento. Ricorda, l'uso di blocchi sincronizzati può introdurre overhead e potenziali colli di bottiglia, soprattutto se le operazioni di lettura/scrittura sono frequenti o richiedono molto tempo. Assicurati di valutare le prestazioni e di considerare, se necessario, strategie alternative come il caching dei dati in memoria con aggiornamenti batch periodici al filesystem per ridurre l'overhead di sincronizzazione."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Эти аспекты включают следующее: 1. **Застой в развитии страны**: Внешнеполитический курс, который вел СССР в период застоя под руководством Леонида Брежнева, характеризовался консерватизмом, острой Конфронтацией с западным миром в рамках Холодной войны, и значительными военными расходами. Это привело к перераспределению ресурсов из социальной сферы и экономики в пользу военно-промышленного комплекса, замедлению технологического и экономического развития страны. 2. **Афганская война (1979-1989)**: Вторжение в Афганистан было критическим моментом, обрушившим на СССР международное осуждение, усилив конфронтацию с Западом, и приведя к значительным человеческим и экономическим потерям. Война в Афганистане также подорвала моральные и идеологические устои советского общества. 3. **Гонка вооружений с США**: СССР пытался соперничать с Соединенными Штатами в разработке и производстве вооружений, включая ядерное оружие. Это привело к исчерпанию экономических ресурсов, которые могли бы быть использованы для развития страны. Гонка вооружений достигла апогея в эпоху президентства Рональда Рейгана в США, который инициировал программу стратегической обороны («Звездные войны»), еще более усилив напряженность между двумя сверхдержавами. 4. **Отношения с Китаем и другими социалистическими странами**: СССР также испытывал трудности в отношениях с Китаем и некоторыми другими странами социалистического лагеря. Разногласия с Китаем привели к значительному осложнению геополитической обстановки и усилению напряженности на границах. 5. **Экономическое отставание от Запада**: К 1980-м годам стало очевидным, что СССР не только уступает Западу в технологическом плане, но и сталкивается с углубляющимся экономическим кризисом, который проявлялся в дефиците товаров, низкой производительности и стагнации промышленного производства. Эти и другие факторы создали серьезные предпосылки для пересмотра внешней и внутренней политики СССР. Приход к власти Горбачева открыл путь к политике гласности и перестройки, которая включала в себя поиск путей снижения международной напряженности через дипломатию, ограничение ядерных арсеналов (Договор о ликвидации ракет средней и меньшей дальности, ДРСМД, 1987 г.) и попытку модернизации экономики."},{"instruction":"расскажи о внутренней политике до прихода к власти Горбачева которые можно отнести к предпосылкам и причинам перестройки в частности об устройстве партийного аппарата и госслужб","output":"Внутренняя политика Советского Союза до прихода к власти Михаила Горбачева характеризовалась рядом ключевых факторов, которые способствовали возникновению предпосылок и причин для начала процессов, известных как перестройка. Эти аспекты включают систему партийного аппарата и государственного управления, экономические и социальные проблемы, а также общественное недовольство. Давайте кратко рассмотрим некоторые из них: # Устройство партийного аппарата и государственного управления 1. **Централизованное планирование и бюрократия**: Советская система была основана на принципах централизованного планирования, где ключевые экономические и социальные решения принимались на верхних эшелонах власти. Это породило огромную бюрократическую машину, которая была малоэффективна и подвержена коррупции. 2. **Недостатки в системе управления**: Партийный аппарат и государственные органы управления были перегружены бюрократическими структурами. Многоуровневая иерархия приводила к замедлению процесса принятия решений, увеличивала отчуждение руководства от нужд обычных граждан и снижала эффективность инициатив. 3. **Идеологическая жесткость и репрессии**: В период застоя, особенно во времена Леонида Брежнева, партийное руководство уделяло значительное внимание поддержанию идеологической однородности и лояльности. Это подразумевало ограничение свободы слова, репрессии против диссидентов и подавление любых форм независимой политической или социальной активности. 4. **Проблемы в экономике**: - Неэффективность и отставание: Советская экономика страдала от системных недостатков, включая неэффективное распределение ресурсов, отсутствие стимулов к инновациям и повышению производительности труда. - Дефицит товаров: Экономика СССР была ориентирована на производство военной продукции и тяжелой промышленности за счет потребительских товаров и услуг, что приводило к дефицитам и снижению жизненного уровня населения. # Общественное недовольство К началу 1980-х годов накопилось значительное социальное и экономическое недовольство. Низкий уровень жизни, дефицит товаров первой необходимости, отсутствие политической свободы и перспектив на будущее заставили многих советских граждан стремиться к изменениям. Все эти факторы создали почву для инициации процессов перестройки, призванных модернизировать советскую экономику, реформировать партийный и государственный аппарат, а также внести элементы демократии и гласности в общественную жизнь страны. Михаил Горбачев, пришедший к власти в 1985 году, стал символом этих перемен, хотя впоследствии масштаб и последствия этих реформ оказались совершенно иными, чем планировалось изначально."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Alex was known among his friends for his adventurous spirit and insatiable curiosity. He loved exploring the woods and imagining tales of knights, dragons, and hidden treasures. But little did Alex know, his next adventure would surpass even his wildest dreams. One sunny afternoon, while wandering deeper into the forest than he had ever gone before, Alex stumbled upon an ancient, moss-covered stone archway that seemed to appear out of nowhere. With his heart pounding with excitement and a hint of fear, Alex stepped through the archway—and everything around him changed. He found himself standing in an astonishingly beautiful land, where the sky shimmered with hues of purple and pink, and giant, fluffy clouds floated close to the ground, as if inviting him to jump on them. This was the Secret Kingdom of Nimbus, a place of magic and wonder that few humans had ever seen. No sooner had Alex taken a few steps into this breathtaking kingdom than he was greeted by a talking squirrel named Pip. With a tip of his tiny acorn cap, Pip explained that Alex had been chosen by the magical forces of Nimbus to help save the kingdom from a terrible drought that threatened its very existence. Eager to help and thrilled by the idea of an adventure in a magical kingdom, Alex followed Pip to the majestic Crystal Lake, the source of all water in Nimbus. There, they met Aria, a water nymph whose radiant blue eyes reflected the depths of the lake itself. Aria revealed that the Golden Chalice, an ancient artifact with the power to summon rain, had been stolen by the mischievous Shadow Fox. Determined to save Nimbus, Alex, Pip, and Aria set out on a quest to retrieve the Golden Chalice. Their journey took them through whispering forests where trees told secrets, across fields of glowing flowers, and over sparkling streams that sang melodies of old. Along the way, they encountered creatures of wonder—graceful unicorns that galloped on rainbows, friendly dragons that painted the skies with their fiery breath, and talking birds that shared news from distant lands. Finally, after braving many challenges and solving ancient riddles, the trio reached the Shadow Fox's lair, hidden beneath the roots of the oldest tree in Nimbus. With cleverness and courage, they outwitted the Shadow Fox and reclaimed the Golden Chalice. Aria held the chalice high, and as it filled with water from the Crystal Lake, dark clouds gathered overhead. Soon, gentle rains fell upon the kingdom, filling the streams, watering the plants, and bringing new life to Nimbus. The inhabitants of the kingdom rejoiced, and a grand celebration was held in Alex's honor. The king of Nimbus, a wise and kind lion with a mane of silver clouds, bestowed upon Alex a medal of bravery. As the festivities came to an end, Pip and Aria led Alex back to the stone archway. With heartfelt goodbyes and promises to return, Alex stepped back into his world, the setting sun casting long shadows through the trees. As he made his way home, Alex wondered if his adventure in Nimbus had been just a dream. But when he reached into his pocket, he found the medal of bravery, shining softly in the palm of his hand. With a smile and a heart full of memories, he knew that the Secret Kingdom of Nimbus would always be waiting for his return. And from that day on, Alex's adventures were far from over, for he had learned that magic can be found in the most unexpected places, and that courage and friendship can overcome even the greatest of challenges."},{"instruction":"Top ai script to video free ai generator","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, there are several AI-based tools and platforms designed to help users generate videos from scripts, albeit not all might be completely free.

Сегодня я хочу рассказать вам о перспективах использования спутниковых технологий для мониторинга засух. Наше исследование опирается на данные, представленные в статье, опубликованной в журнале \\"Remote Sensing\\" под названием \\"A Review of Satellite-Derived Drought Indices\\". В этой статье рассматривается обзор спутниковых индексов засухи. Засуха является одним из наиболее вредоносных природных явлений, влияя не только на сельскохозяйственное производство и водоснабжение, но и на экосистемы и экономику в целом. В условиях изменения климата и увеличения частоты экстремальных погодных явлений мониторинг засухи становится критически важной задачей. В данной статье представлены последние достижения в использовании спутниковых данных для оценки и прогнозирования засух. Авторы статьи рассматривают различные индексы засухи, получаемые с помощью спутниковых наблюдений, такие как индекс нормализованной разности вегетации (NDVI), индекс водного стресса растений (PWSI) и индекс уровня зеленой массы растений (GLI). Каждый из этих индексов предоставляет уникальную информацию, позволяющую оценить степень и продолжительность засух, а также их воздействие на сельскохозяйственные угодья и натуральные экосистемы. Преимущества использования спутниковых данных для мониторинга засух очевидны. Во-первых, это возможность получения информации в режиме реального времени со всей территории исследования, включая труднодоступные районы. Во-вторых, это высокая частота обновления данных, что критически важно для оперативного реагирования на развивающиеся засухи. В-третьих, многолетние архивы спутниковых данных позволяют оценить исторические тренды и изменения в распределении и интенсивности засух. В заключение хочется отметить, что интеграция спутниковых технологий в системы мониторинга и управления рисками засух может существенно улучшить способность государств и международных организаций предупреждать и минимизировать последствия этих катастрофических природных явлений. Современные спутниковые инструменты и алгоритмы, описанные в статье, предоставляют мощный инструмент в борьбе с засухой, который будет только совершенствоваться по мере развития технологий.

Отже, давайте характеризувати зазначених персонажів з \\"Ревізора\\": 1. **Городничий** (Антон Антонович Сквозніков) – центральний антагоніст п'єси \\"Ревізор\\". Він зображений як корупційний і самовпевнений чиновник маленького провінційного містечка. Городничий є втіленням бюрократії і корупції, характерними для Російської імперії 19 століття. Він завжди намагається заручитися підтримкою вищестоящих осіб і прикривати власні злодіяння. 2. **Бобчинський і Добчинський** – це два помічники городничого, які в п'єсі виступають як комічна пара. Вони перебільшено лояльні до городничого і дуже бояться будь-яких перевірок із столиці. Обидва вони випадково вважають Хлестакова ревізором і запускають ланцюг комічних подій, які розгортаються в п'єсі. Бобчинський і Добчинський є символами сліпої відданості владі та страху перед нею. 3. **Хлестаков** (Іван Олександрович Хлестаков) – головний герой п'єси, молодик з Петербурга, непорозумінням взятий за ревізора. Це безтурботний і поверховий юнак, який раптом отримує владу над містечком і його жителями через низку комічних обставин. Хлестаков використовує цю ситуацію на свою користь, приймаючи хабарі та залицяння від місцевих чиновників, не розуміючи наслідків своїх дій. 4. **Анна Андріївна** - дружина городничого, яка також зображена як корумпований і марнославний персонаж. Вона прагне до більш високого соціального статусу та заздрищів до того, що вона вважає кращим життям столиці. Анна Андріївна намагається скористатися візитом Хлестакова для підняття свого суспільного статусу. Ці персонажі є яскравими прикладами гоголівської сатири на російське суспільство і бюрократію 19 століття, де корупція, помилкові цінності та непорозуміння стають основою для комічних, але глибоко критичних ситуацій."},{"instruction":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Похоже, что происходит некорректное взаимодействие между состоянием пользователя и логикой обработки команды /start. Давайте попытаемся внести исправления в код, чтобы решить эту проблему. Сначала нужно убедиться, что при сохранении ответа пользователя вы актуализируете информацию о последнем отвеченном вопросе правильно. В вашем случае, вы стараетесь отслеживать последний вопрос с помощью \`last_question_idx\` в таблице \`users\`, что правильно. Чтобы это работало, нужно убедиться, что запросы в функции \`save_answer\` и \`generate_bio\` выполняются корректно.

Дополнительно к уже предложенным изменениям, давайте более детально рассмотрим, как можно улучшить логику работы с последним индексом вопроса и состояниями бота. Похоже, что при реализации команды \`/start\` и выборе \\"Сгенерировать био\\", проверка на последний индекс вопроса или предыдущие ответы не выполняется должным образом. Изначально предложенное исправление предполагало, что функция \`generate_bio\` правильно определяет, какой вопрос нужно задать, но, возможно, здесь всё же есть пропуск. Рассмотрим способ гарантировать, что бот будет продолжать с последнего неответившего вопроса или начнет с начала, если ответы были полностью сброшены. Первое, что нужно сделать, - это убедиться, что значение \`last_question_idx\` корректно обновляется и используется: 1. Проверьте, сохраняется ли \`last_question_idx\` в базу данных после каждого ответа на вопрос. Это должно происходить в функции \`save_answer\`: \`\`\`python async def save_answer(user_id: int, question: str, answer: str, question_idx: int): async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: # Сохраняем ответ await db.execute('INSERT INTO answers (user_id, question, answer) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (user_id, question, answer)) # Обновляем индекс последнего вопроса пользователя await db.execute('UPDATE users SET last_question_idx = ? WHERE id = ?', (question_idx, user_id)) await db.commit() \`\`\` 2. Убедитесь, что SQL запрос в функции \`generate_bio\` корректно извлекает из базы индекс последнего вопроса. Вы пытались это сделать, но есть вероятность, что условие \`if last_question_idx:\` не работает, как ожидалось, поскольку это условие всегда будет истинным, если запрос возвращает строку (даже если \`last_question_idx\` равен \`NULL\` или \`0\`). Вы можете изменить проверку следующим образом: \`\`\`python @dp.message_handler(lambda message: message.text == \\"Сгенерировать био\\", state=Form.choosing_action) async def generate_bio(message: types.Message): user_id = message.from_user.id async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: cursor = await db.execute('SELECT last_question_idx FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,)) row = await cursor.fetchone() last_question_idx = row[0] if row else None if last_question_idx is not None: await set_next_question(user_id, last_question_idx + 1) else: await set_next_question(user_id, 0) \`\`\` 3. Гарантируйте, что состояние бота явно сбрасывается или устанавливается корректно в начале каждой новой сессии взаимодействия. Это может потребовать явного вызова \`await state.reset_state()\` перед установкой нового состояния в \`cmd_start\` или в начале \`generate_bio\`. 4. Проверьте, что ваши состояния (\`Form.answer_name\`, \`Form.answer_birthday\` и т.д.) меняются корректно после каждого ответа и что логика перехода между состояниями правильно реализована. Одной из возможных причин, по которой ваш бот начинает с первого вопроса, является некорректное управление состояниями или логика извлечения/интерпретации \`last_question_idx\` из базы данных. Попробуйте указанные выше шаги, чтобы убедиться, что данные обрабатываются и используются правильно."},{"instruction":"Может ли быть проблема в last_question_idx INTEGER DEFAULT 0?","output":"Да, проблема может быть связана с использованием поля \`last_question_idx INTEGER DEFAULT 0\` в вашей базе данных, особенно если логика вашего кода не должным образом учитывает начальное значение этого индекса. Если \`last_question_idx\` изначально задан как \`0\` и не обновляется должным образом после сохранения ответов, это может привести к тому, что бот будет начинать с первого вопроса при каждом новом сеансе, даже если пользователь уже ответил на некоторые вопросы. # Как это может быть проблемой: 1. **Неправильное обновление \`last_question_idx\`:** Если ваш код не корректно обновляет \`last_question_idx\` после того как пользователь отвечает на вопрос, последующие сеансы будут начинаться с \`last_question_idx = 0\`, что соответствует первому вопросу. 2. **Неадекватная проверка \`last_question_idx\`:** При проверке значения \`last_question_idx\` для определения, с какого вопроса начинать, важно правильно интерпретировать значение 0. Если пользователь еще не ответил ни на один вопрос, \`last_question_idx = 0\` может быть корректным, но после ответа на первый вопрос значение должно измениться. 3. **Логика перехода между вопросами:** При переходе от одного вопроса к другому вам нужно убедиться, что \`last_question_idx\` корректно отражает число отвеченных вопросов, чтобы при новом сеансе бот мог начать с правильного места. # Как исправить: - **Убедитесь, что \`last_question_idx\` обновляется:** После того, как пользователь отвечает на вопрос, инкрементируйте \`last_question_idx\` и сохраните новое значение в базу данных. \`\`\`python async def save_answer(user_id: int, question: str, answer: str, question_idx: int): async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: # Сохраняем ответ await db.execute('INSERT INTO answers (user_id, question, answer) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (user_id, question, answer)) # Важно: теперь обновляем last_question_idx на question_idx, а не на +1 к предыдущему значению! await db.execute('UPDATE users SET last_question_idx = ?

Если бот начинает не с первого вопроса (\\"Имя\\"), а со второго (\\"Дата рождения\\"), это указывает на то, что \`last_question_idx\` ошибочно устанавливается или интерпретируется как \`0\`, когда пользователь начинает процесс, что приводит к непредвиденному пропуску первого вопроса. Поскольку указанные ранее рекомендации не решили вопрос полностью, давайте скорректируем подход к индексации и обработке вопросов. Мы изменим способ, которым \`last_question_idx\` обновляется и используется для определения следующего вопроса в сессии. # Пересмотренное решение: 1. **Определение начального состояния \`last_question_idx\`:** Пусть индексация вопросов начинается с \`1\`. Таким образом, когда \`last_question_idx = 0\`, это означает, что пользователь еще не начал отвечать на вопросы. Это сделает логику восстановления сессии и определения текущего вопроса более интуитивно понятной. 2. **Корректировка функции \`generate_bio\` для корректного восстановления сессии:** При каждом вызове \`/start\` проверяйте значение \`last_question_idx\` и корректно восстанавливайте состояние. Если \`last_question_idx = 0\`, начинайте с первого вопроса. При значениях \`last_question_idx > 0\`, переходите к вопросу, соответствующему индексу. 3. **Изменение логики обработки вопросов:** Убедитесь, что после успешного ответа на каждый вопрос \`last_question_idx\` корректно обновляется. Действуя в соответствии с этими принципами, ваш метод \`generate_bio\` может выглядеть примерно так: \`\`\`python @dp.message_handler(lambda message: message.text == \\"Сгенерировать био\\", state=Form.choosing_action) async def generate_bio(message: types.Message): user_id = message.from_user.id async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: cursor = await db.execute('SELECT last_question_idx FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,)) row = await cursor.fetchone() last_question_idx = row[0] if row else 0 # Поправка в условие для корректного смещения, если пользователь уже отвечал на вопросы if last_question_idx >= 1: await set_next_question(user_id, last_question_idx) else: await set_next_question(user_id, 1) \`\`\` Убедитесь, что в \`set_next_question\` и при сохранении ответов вы правильно обрабатываете \`last_question_idx\` с учетом новой логики. Особое внимание стоит уделить тому, как вы обновляете \`last_question_idx\` после каждого ответа пользователя, чтобы избежать проблем с неверным определением \\"следующего\\" вопроса.

During the last decade, several global DEMs have been released based on satellite data. ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, but the more recently released, AW3D30, TanDEM-X and MERIT, are being increasingly used. Many researchers have studied the quality of these DEM products in recent years. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their quality over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. To provide this comparison, we examined the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four geographic regions with different topographic and land use conditions. We used local high-precision elevation models (Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Pleiades-1A) as reference models and all global models were resampled to reference model resolution (1m). In total, 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed. To estimate the accuracy, we generated error rasters by subtracting each reference model from the corresponding global DEM and calculated descriptive statistics for this difference (e.g., median, mean, root-mean-square error (RMSE)). We also assessed the vertical accuracy as a function of the slope, slope aspect, and land cover. We found that slope had the strongest effect on DEM accuracy, with no relationship for slope aspect. The AW3D30 was the most robust and had the most stable performance in most of the tests and is therefore the best choice for an analysis of multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also performed well where available, whereas NASADEM, as a successor of SRTM, showed only slight improvement in comparison to SRTM. MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well despite their lower spatial resolution. Keywords: DEM; validation; accuracy assessment; slope; aspect; topography; land cover Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction Digital elevation models (DEMs) and the topographic and terrain variables derived from these models (e.g., slope aspect, slope, channels, hillslopes) are fundamental inputs for environmental and landscape modeling and spatial analysis [1,2,3,4,5], especially for research in geomorphology [6], hydrology [7], and geology [8]. For several decades, DEM products have been created at different spatial scales (e.g., global or national) mainly using remote sensing data [9]. As different remote sensing data and methods are employed during the development of DEMs, it has become increasingly important to assess the accuracy and performance of such products to provide insights into their limitations [10] and develop correction procedures [11,12]. The potential artifacts (errors) and inconsistencies identified in DEM products usually arise from distortions caused by atmospheric, terrain, and sensor conditions at the moment of the data acquisition [10,13,14]. Due to the potential analytical bias that results from artifacts and inconsistencies in DEMs, several studies have investigated the quality of such products, especially for those developed at a global scale. These investigations usually focused on the height (vertical) accuracy of the DEM [15,16] or the model’s performance in different applications, such as river network generation, the acquisition of geomorphological metrics, and flood simulation [12,17]. Most of the assessments compare freely available DEM products with GPS survey points [18] or with DEMs developed based on photogrammetric aerial images or on laser scanning (e.g., LiDAR) [19]. For instance, the vertical accuracy of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM; released in 2003) ranges from 2.18 to 21.70 m [10,20] and for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection satellite (ASTER, released in 2006), the accuracy ranges from 4.56 to 7.10 m [10,20]. These high-resolution global DEM products, developed based on radar data (SRTM) and data from optical sensors (ASTER), were one of the first freely available DEMs at a global scale. Recently, new freely available global-scale DEM products have been released, such as the TanDEM-X DEM [15], the Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM [21], the ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (AW3D30) [22], and the NASADEM [23]. Because these products are so new (TanDEM-X has been freely available since late 2018, MERIT 2017, AW3D30 and NASADEM since the beginning of 2020), fewer studies have evaluated their accuracy [24,25,26,27,28]. If their accuracy can be confirmed, these new DEM products, which are based on more current remote sensing data and better processing methods, will be highly valuable because of their ability to capture natural or man-made changes in the topography of terrestrial surfaces [29]. DEM products are continuously being improved, and new versions are being released constantly. Usually, the newest versions are developed by applying analytical improvements that reduce errors or inconsistencies identified in the previous DEM versions, especially based on assessment studies [9,30]. Many researchers have assessed the quality of the global-scale DEM products in recent years [26,28,30]. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the quality of these freely available global DEMs over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. The accuracy of the DEMs can largely vary depending on the latitude, vegetation, and topography. In addition, previous studies have only used a few hundred GPS points for ground control [30,31] or LiDAR-based DEM averaged to global DEM resolution [26] which results in a loss of information. In our study, we evaluated the performance of the freely available DEM products (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four different regions of the world with different topography and land cover characteristics. We used locally derived LiDAR-based DEMs and the Pleiades 1A data as reference models to estimate the accuracy and resampled all the global models to the reference model resolution (1 m) which resulted in a total of 608 million 1x1 m pixels. This enabled us to perform the accuracy assessment at the highest possible resolution (1 m) and capture the continuous nature of topography. We estimated the vertical accuracy of the global DEM products as a function of slope, slope aspect, and land cover type. To the best of our knowledge, the accuracy of NASADEM has not been systematically estimated before against ground truth and in comparison with SRTM. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Areas Four study areas were chosen based on two main criteria: (1) the availability of a LiDAR or other high-precision reference model, and (2) the diversity of the land cover and relief, as these are the main factors known to influence DEM accuracy. We chose study areas where a reference model was freely available and where different topographic conditions (flat, hilly, and mountainous areas) coexisted with various land cover types (Figure 1). Remotesensing 12 03482 g001 550Figure 1. Locations of the four study areas, and images of their topography. The reference digital elevation models (DEMs) were obtained using local-scale Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys (Estonia, Norway, New Zealand) and Pleiades 1A images (China). 2.1.1. Estonia The Estonian study area is located in Southern Estonia, and covers 225 km2 (Figure 1). About 52% of the study area is covered by closed forest and about 17% is covered by open forest. About 28% of the study area is arable or otherwise cultivated land. The study area includes the small village of Puka, with 565 inhabitants, and several smaller villages. The elevation ranges from 40 to 218 m according to the LiDAR-based reference model (see Section 2.3.1.), and the topography is relatively flat, with some hilly landscapes in the eastern part of the study area (Figure 1). 2.1.2. China The Chinese study area is located in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region (south of Mongolia). The area is bounded by the Helan Mountains and has tectonic faults that resulted in a diverse relief (Figure 1). In the 103 km2 total area, 52% is covered by open land or sparse vegetation, 24% is covered by artificial landscapes (e.g., residential and industrial areas), and 20% by grasslands. The area’s elevation ranges from 1063 to 1766 m (Figure 1). 2.1.3. New Zealand The study area covers 111 km2 and is located in the southern part of North Island of New Zealand in the administrative districts of Lower Hutt City, Upper Hutt City, and South Wairarapa. The dominant land cover types are dense evergreen forests. The other land cover types are grasslands, open forest, shrubs, and arable land. The region’s relief is characterized by mountains and gorges, with elevation ranging from 32 to 828 m. 2.1.4. Norway The Norwegian study area lies between Jotunheimen and Rondane mountainous areas, and covers 193 km2. It is located in the Froni municipality within Innlandet County. The elevation ranges from 335 to 1662 m, but it is relatively flat and does not have many steep slopes. The Vinstra river crosses the study area. Approximately 44% of the study area is covered by forests, 37% by grasslands and 12% by open forest. Water bodies, arable land, and wetlands cover the rest of the area. The SRTM and NASADEM were not available for this study area because it is located above 60°N latitude. Therefore, we only analyzed the ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, and TanDEM-X DEMs to test the accuracy of these alternative global DEMs for a region where SRTM and NASADEM data are not available. 2.2. The Studied DEMs Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the DEMs used in the present study. Table 1. Summary of the global digital elevation models (DEMs) evaluated in the present study. Table 2.2.1. ASTER The ASTER Global DEM (GDEM) version 2 (v2) was created photogrammetrically from a compilation of cloud-free ASTER stereopair images [32,33]. The sensor is carried aboard the Terra satellite and the images stereopairs were acquired by nadir- and after-looking angles in the near-infrared band [30,34]. A major advantage of the along-track mode of data acquisition (as compared to cross-track acquisition) is that the images that form the stereopairs are acquired a few seconds apart (rather than days) under uniform environmental and lighting conditions [34]. The ASTER GDEM2 was released in 2011 and showed improvements compared with the first version, such as better georeferencing, inclusion of more scenes acquired between 2008 and 2011, and a smaller correlation kernel, and has higher spatial resolution [33]. However, ASTER GDEM2 is known to have anomalies and artifacts that limit its usefulness [9,35]. Previous studies have found that ASTER GDEM2 performs well over bare areas but is less accurate over areas with a high forest cover [30,36]. 2.2.2. AW3D30 The ALOSWorld3D 30 m DEM (AW3D30; version 3.1) was developed based on millions of images acquired by panchromatic optical sensor (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) [22]. The stereoscopic images were acquired along-track at nadir, backward and forward views and with 2.5 m of spatial resolution [37]. The first version of AW3D30 was published in 2016 and since then the dataset has been updated to improve the absolute/relative height accuracies with additional calibrations and void filling [22]. The latest version was released in April 2020, which was also used in the current study. Although, the accuracy estimation of the AW3D DEM is available only for the 5 m-resolution commercial version (root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5 m), studies that have compared different DEM products have shown good accuracy for AW3D30 [38,39]. 2.2.3. MERIT The MERIT DEM was created to provide an error-reduced DEM product. The DEM was developed by combining data acquired from SRTM with data from the ALOS World 3D data with 30 m resolution (AW3D-30m v1), and used error-removal techniques that reduced the bias and other sources of noise [21]. The reported accuracy is ±12 m (90th percentile of the error range) [21]. Studies suggested that the reduced-error DEM performed well [12,28], but that artifacts remain in the DEM product [40]. 2.2.4. TanDEM-X DEM The TanDEM-X DEM was developed based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images acquired by X-band radar and full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sensors on two satellites (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X) [15,41]. The sensors imaged the Earth’s surface at least twice between 2010 and 2015, and additional images were acquired for areas with complex topography, such as mountain regions. The sensors aboard the satellites orbited the Earth in a twin formation with long track distances ranging from 300 to 500 m, thereby supporting both across-track and along-track interferometry [42]. This approach supported the development of a DEM with high accuracy. The TanDEM-X DEM product with a spatial resolution of 12 m that was released in September 2016 is reported to have a horizontal and vertical absolute accuracy of <10 m, and a relative vertical accuracy of 2 m for slopes ≤11° and 4 m for slopes >11° [43]. As the DEM with 12 m resolution is only available upon approval of a scientific proposal and requires payment of a processing fee, we instead used the completely free TandDEM-X DEM global product (Version 1.0) with 90 m spatial resolution that was released in late 2018 [26]. The quality of the interferometric SAR (InSAR) DEMs are known to be affected by the particular land cover and terrain characteristics of the area under illumination and the specific acquisition geometry used for the data take [15]. SAR acquisitions over complex terrain are often affected by geometric distortions (including foreshortening, layover, and shadow) [15,44], and the X-band signal can partially penetrate vegetation [26] and volume scattering, creating some uncertainty in the height estimation. 2.2.5. SRTM The SRTM DEM was developed based on the images acquired by two synthetic aperture radars aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour [45,46]. The shuttle flew and mapped continental areas between 60°N and 60°S for 11 days in February 2000. One of the sensors, which used a C-band radar system, was responsible for contiguous mapping coverage, while the other sensor, which used an X-band system, was responsible for generating data along discrete 50-km-wide swaths [45]. The SRTM DEM that we used, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, was developed based on the C-band radar interferometry data and has a reported accuracy of ±16 m [47]. However, the vertical accuracy has also been reported to be <9 m [48] and to be 4.31 m (±14.09 m) in mountain regions [49]. SRTM is known to suffer from voids due to shadow-casting [50]. The accuracy of SRTM is known to suffer from the similar InSAR methodology-related issues as TanDEM-X (see Section 2.2.4). In our study, we used the void-filled SRTM DEM version 3 (SRTMV3) dataset that was released in 2014 [50]. 2.2.6. NASADEM The NASADEM (released in February 2020) was created by reprocessing of the SRTM radar data, and merging it with other DEM datasets, such as ASTER, ICESat and GLAS. The main objective was to eliminate voids and other limitations that were present in the SRTM dataset [23]. The NASADEM is supposed to be the successor of the SRTM DEM dataset [51]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on the accuracy of the NASADEM dataset. 2.3. Reference Models 2.3.1. LiDAR DEMs We used DEM products derived based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data as reference models for the study areas in Estonia, Norway, and New Zealand (China is described in the next section). LiDAR-based DEMs have good accuracy [57], but LiDAR technology cannot penetrate a dense vegetation canopy and the datasets do not cover large areas [32]. For the Estonian study area, we downloaded the DEM from the Estonian Land Board’s Geoportal [58]. The reported vertical accuracy by the Estonian Land Board is 9 to 14 cm. The reference DEM for the Norwegian study area was acquired from Høydedata portal [59] and the reported vertical accuracy is 3 to 12 cm. The New Zealand reference DEM was downloaded from Linz Data Service [60]. The reported vertical accuracy of the New Zealand reference DEM is 10 to 15 cm. All reference DEMs had a 1 m horizontal resolution. 2.3.2. Pleiades-1A DEM For the Chinese study area, we used the Pleiades-1A DEM because LiDAR data were not available. The Pleiades-1A DEM for the Chinese study area was developed using five image stereopairs acquired by the satellites of the Pleiades mission on 23 April, 17 July, 24 July, and 25 July of 2014 [61]. These images were processed using the photogrammetry module of the ERDAS IMAGINE software. The final DEM was acquired by averaging the point cloud from the image stereopairs within 1 m pixels using continuous-curvature splines in tension and a tension factor of 0.75 [61]. The data were downloaded from OpenTopography portal [62]. No estimated vertical accuracy was provided for the current DEM product, but studies that used similar approaches have reported accuracies from 30 cm [63] to 0.5 m [64]. 2.4. Pre-processing All the datasets had different spatial resolution and different horizontal and vertical reference systems. All global DEMs (except TanDEM-X) originally represented orthometric heights from the EGM96 geoid. However, all of the reference DEMs used different geoids. To make all the study areas comparable, we (1) projected all the datasets to the WGS84 coordinate system; and (2) transferred all DEMs to the EGM96 geoid by subtracting the difference between the local geoid and the EGM96 geoid from the reference DEM values. The elevation values for the TanDEM-X DEM represent ellipsoidal heights, so to convert them to orthometric heights, we subtracted the EMG96 height from the TanDEM-X DEM. All geoid models (except EST-GEOID2017) were downloaded in GeoTIFF format from Agisoft Geoids [65]. EST-GEOID2017 [66] was obtained in ASCII format from the Estonian Land Board. Previous studies have resampled reference models to the global DEM resolution, but this loses information. Therefore, we resampled all global DEMs using the nearest neighbor method and aligned the results spatially to the reference model’s spatial resolution (1 m). Pre-processing was performed in ArcGIS 10.6 [67]. 2.5. Accuracy Assessment All global elevation models are, strictly speaking, digital surface models (DSMs) [30,32,68]. However, in most applications, they are treated as being equivalent to DEMs [69,70], so for simplicity, we will use the term “DEM” in the rest of this paper. To assess the vertical accuracy of the global DEMs, we created the error rasters on a cell-by-cell basis by subtracting the reference model’s value from the corresponding value in each global DEM: Δℎ=𝑍model−𝑍ref (1)where ∆h is the height difference (error) between the global and reference DEM, which was defined as the error term, Zmodel is the height in the global DEM, and Zref is the height in the reference DEM. We used the map algebra module in ArcGIS 10.6 to generate the error rasters. To analyze the effect of vegetation on the accuracy of the elevation models, we used the global 100 m-resolution vegetation cover data for the year 2015 from the Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers—Collection 2, which can be freely downloaded from the Copernicus site [71]. The data collection for the global DEMs took place from 2000 to 2017. We initially chose the study areas in relatively remote areas with small land cover change. In addition, to consider the land cover changes, we firstly performed visual check of historical changes based on Google Earth images and CCI long-term global land cover time series (300 m resolution). We identified that the land cover has not changed significantly over the last 10 years. To better align the land cover dataset for the year 2000 (SRTM and NASADEM), we used the Global Forest Change forest cover dataset [72] and added all the forests to the 2015 year land cover to ensure that bare areas are not overestimated in the land cover. Only the Estonian study area had noticeable changes in the forest cover from 2000 to 2015. The NZ and Norwegian study areas remained practically unchanged, and the Chinese study are had no forest. The original 21 land cover classes (Supplementary S1) were generalized and reclassified into 10 classes (Table 2). To separate the effect of slope from the effect of land cover, we only used slopes of less than 15° in the land cover analysis. Table 2. Slope, slope aspect, and land cover classes used in the study. Table To analyze the effect of slope and aspect on the accuracy of the DEM, we derived slope and aspect from the reference model DEM (LiDAR or Pleiades-1A). Slope was reclassified into 8 classes (Table 2). Gdulová et al. [24] reported that the relationship between the DEM accuracy and terrain aspect is stronger for greater slopes. Therefore, we extracted slopes steeper than 15° (slope classes 4 to 8 in Table 2) to estimate the effect of aspect on the DEM accuracy. In addition, to eliminate the effect of dense vegetation on the aspect analysis, we only used land cover classes 4, 5, and 7 (classes 9 and 10 were not present on slopes steeper than 15°) in the aspect analysis. We also reclassified aspect from 0° to 360° into 8 cardinal directions (Table 2). In addition, we calculated roughness for all the study areas because we assumed that higher roughness (variability or irregularity in elevation) results in lower DEM accuracy. We performed correlation analysis which revealed that roughness was highly correlated with slope (0.92 < r2 < 0.98). Therefore, roughness would not have explained the significant amount of additional variation in the errors, and for this reason we did not include it in the further study. We further analyzed the error rasters together with the land cover, slope, and aspect rasters using Python function libraries. We used the Python rasterio and pandas libraries [73] to transform all the raster data into dataframes in which all spatially aligned error cells were joined with the respective land cover, slope, and aspect class. For every error raster, we generated a histogram of the errors (Supplementary S2). The histograms let us estimate the error distribution and detect any deviations from a normal distribution. We calculated error metrics across all study areas and also as a function of the land cover, slope, and aspect classes. We used the following error statistics suggested by Höhle and Höhle [74]: the mean error (ME), median error (MedE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and standard deviation (STD). Several DEMs did not have a normal error distribution (Supplementary S1) and we therefore also calculated more robust accuracy measures suited for non-normal error distributions [74]: the normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) and the 25% and 75% quantiles. We used the Python NumPy library [75] to calculate the error metrics. In addition, we generated boxplots to visualize the errors. The Python scripts used for these calculations are available in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/LandscapeGeoinformatics/globalDEM_accuracy. 3. Results 3.1. Overall Vertical Accuracy For all study areas and elevation models, except for a few cases in ASTER and TanDEM-X, ME and MedE were positive (Table 3, Figure 2). That is, all the global models generally overestimated the elevation compared to the reference models, which was expected. From the spatial distribution of the errors, it is clear that forested areas had strong positive errors compared to the reference models (Figure 1 and Figure 3). However, in the cases of the Estonian, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas, ASTER had a negative ME and MedE. The negative errors were spatially occurring in areas with low vegetation cover (Figure 3). The accuracy of AW3D30 was the most stable based on RMSE and STD across the study areas and in most cases also performed the best; however, it slightly overestimated the elevation in all four study areas (Figure 3). Of the six global models, ASTER and in most cases also MERIT performed the worst based on RMSE. Moreover, MERIT showed the largest variation in error values (NMAD between 2.11 and 10.41 m) (Table 3, Figure 2). Of the four study areas, the biggest variation in errors (STD) was observed in New Zealand, where the relief was the most rugged and was combined with tall and dense vegetation (Table 3, Figure 2).

Error terms: ME, mean error; STD, standard deviation; 25% and 75%, quantiles; MedE, median error; NMAD, normalized median absolute deviation; RMSE, root-mean-square error. Table 3.2. Effect of Slope and Aspect on Accuracy There was a clear effect of slope on the vertical accuracy of the DEMs (Figure 4, Supplementary S3a–d) in the Chinese, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas. The Estonian study area showed no slope effect because most of the study area is flat and 95% of the pixels had a slope less than 10° (Supplementary S4). The effect of slope on accuracy was smallest for the AW3D30, SRTM, and NASADEM. The ASTER, MERIT, and TanDEM-X DEMs exhibited similarly strong effects of slope on their accuracy; with increasing slope, the RMSE and variation of the error (STD) increased (Figure 4, Supplementary S3a–d). MedE showed slightly different behavior among the DEMs. MedE did not have clear increasing nor decreasing pattern for ASTER. For all the other DEMs, MedE in general increased, except for the Chinese study area. Remotesensing 12 03482 g004 550Figure 4. Box plots of errors by slope class for all global digital elevation models for the four study areas. SRTM and NASADEM data were not available for the Norwegian study area because of its high latitude. The central horizontal line in the box marks the median; the boxes show the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile), and the whiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range.

The effect of aspect on accuracy was strongest for the ASTER model; however, there was no clear pattern across study areas (Figure 5). In the Norwegian study area, the E and SE slopes had MedE values of 6.04 and 3.24 m, respectively, whereas the opposing W and NW slopes had MedE values of −7.47 and −6.48 m, respectively. We observed a similar pattern for the New Zealand study area, where E, SE, and S slopes had contrasting MedE values to the opposite W, NW, and N slopes, respectively. However, the Estonian and Chinese study areas did not show similar patterns. Remotesensing 12 03482 g005 550Figure 5. Box plots of errors by slope aspect class for all global digital elevation models for the four study areas. SRTM and NASADEM data were not available for the Norwegian study area because of its high latitude. The central horizontal line in the box marks the median; the boxes show the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile), and the whiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range. The MERIT model also showed high variation in errors (STD) for all aspects and all study areas except Estonia. However, there was no clear dependency on aspect. The errors in the AW3D30 model had the smallest variation but showed no strong dependency on aspect. In the case of New Zealand and Chinese study areas, AW3D30 even exhibited contrasting patterns. SRTM and NASADEM also showed relatively low variation. For the SRTM and NASADEM, the E and SE slopes had the poorest accuracy (high MedE) among the study areas and NW slopes had the highest accuracy (low MedE) (Figure 5, Supplementary S5a–c). TanDEM-X did not show any dependency on aspect. 3.3. Effect of Land Cover on Accuracy We found that all DEMs had systematically higher elevations than the actual land surface in forested areas in land cover classes 1 and 2 (Figure 6, Supplementary S6a–c). MedE was consistently positive for all the DEMs, except for the ASTER model in the Estonian study area, and RMSE ranged from 3.54 to 13.66 m for the closed forest and 2.82 to 10.5 m for the open forest across study areas. We observed the highest errors and variation (STD) for forested areas in the New Zealand study area. From all six global models, the AW3D30 was the most accurate over the forested areas across all study areas. Remotesensing 12 03482 g006 550Figure 6. Box plots of errors by land cover class for all global digital elevation models for the four study areas. SRTM and NASADEM data were not available for the Norwegian study area because of its high latitude. Land cover classes: 1, Closed forest; 2, Open forest; 3, Shrubs; 4, Herbaceous vegetation; 5, Cultivated area; 6, Urban / built up area; 7, Bare land / sparse vegetation; 8, Wetland; 9, Snow and ice; 10, Water. Only existing land cover classes are plotted for each study area. The DEMs were generally more accurate for the herbaceous and cultivated areas (land cover classes 4 and 5) than for the forested areas (Figure 6, Supplementary S6a–d). In most cases, the global models slightly overestimated (positive MedE) the elevation over the herbaceous and cultivated areas. The RMSE was less than 5 m in most cases, except for the ASTER DEM, for which the RMSE was mostly greater than 5 m and often greater than 10 m. The ASTER DEM also often underestimated the elevation for herbaceous and cultivated areas. There was no single best performing DEM over the herbaceous and cultivated areas. Some DEMs that showed high accuracy in some study areas did not have good accuracy in some others (e.g., MERIT). However, AW3D30 showed most consistent and in most cases also the best accuracy across all study areas. The magnitude of the error for the urban and built-up areas (land cover class 6) was similar to the values for herbaceous and cultivated areas. For urban and built-up areas, the MedE values were −5.56 to 4.39 m, which was similar to the values for herbaceous and cultivated areas. All DEMs, except for TanDEM-X, strongly overestimated the elevation over water (land cover class 10) in the Chinese study area (Supplementary S6b). 4. Discussion 4.1. Overall Accuracy AW3D30 provided the most robust and accurate DEM for all regions, which aligns with previous studies that found that the vertical RMSE was below 5m in flat areas [16,76] and rises up to 12 or to 14 m in areas with more complex relief [76]. The next-best DEMs were SRTM and NASADEM. For the SRTM, previous studies reported a vertical accuracy (RMSE) of 5 m [30] using GPS ground-control points, and 14.9 m (RMSE) by using LiDAR as the reference model [32]. Our results agree with these previous studies, as we found the overall RMSE to be 6.59, 10.00, and 13.07 m in the Estonian, Chinese, and New Zealand study areas, respectively. The recently released NASADEM, which is supposed to be the successor for the SRTM, showed only slightly better accuracy with the overall RMSE found to be 6.39, 8.53, and 12.08 m in the Estonian, Chinese, and New Zealand study areas, respectively. For the MERIT model, we found an overall accuracy (RMSE) of 3.01, 12.43, 13.58, and 10.49 m for the Estonian, Chinese, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas, respectively. For the TanDEM-X DEM, overall RMSE was 7.16, 11.10, 15.05, and 6.84 m for the Estonian, Chinese, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas, respectively. These fall within the expected accuracy range in previous research: 12 m for MERIT [21] and 10 m for TanDEM-X [15]. However, some studies have identified better accuracies. For example, Hawker et al. [26] estimated the RMSE to be 2.32 and 3.10 m for MERIT and TanDEM-X, respectively. Our error estimates are probably higher because of the more complex terrain in our study areas; however, in the flat Estonian study area, our results are similar to these previous results. MERIT and TanDEM-X are more sensitive than SRTM to relief, mainly due to the lower spatial resolution; this leads to intra-pixel variation, which is exacerbated on steep slopes. ASTER performed the worst of the models in all study areas (RMSE 9.22 to 13.52 m). It also had the highest uncertainty (high STD) across study areas for a range of topographic conditions and land cover types. Several studies have found similar accuracy for ASTER [32,33]. The ASTER DEM also includes artifacts that are likely due to cloud cover, mismatches between different scenes, and processing techniques which is its major shortcoming [9,30]. 4.2. Effect of Slope and Aspect on Accuracy The slope had the strongest effect on the accuracy of the global DEMs. For all six global DEMs, the uncertainty increased with the increasing slope. The ASTER, MERIT and TanDEM-X were the most affected by slope. The RMSE rose from between 8.25 and 10.62 m on slopes <5° to between 10.25 and 23.35 m on slopes >35° for ASTER; from between 2.83 and 7.25 m on slopes <5° to between 4.67 and 26.85 m on slopes >35° for MERIT; from between 3.27 and 8.06 m on slopes <5° to between 8.12 and 19.23 m on slopes >35° for TanDEM-X (Supplementary S3a–d). This agrees well with previous studies [24,26,77,78]. We resampled all the global DEMs to agree with the reference model resolution (1 m), which results in higher intra-pixel variation on steeper slopes. This effect can be clearly seen in the error map for the New Zealand study area (Figure 3), which had the most complex topography and where intra-pixel variation is clearly visible for the lower-resolution MERIT and TanDEM-X DEMs. The accuracy of the AW3D30, SRTM and NASADEM models was the least affected by slope and their variation in error did not increase so much as compared to ASTER, MERIT and TanDEM-X. ASTER showed the biggest variation in errors (STD) and AW3D30 showed the smallest variation due to aspect, but no clear dependency on aspect. The high variation of the errors and the overall random response to aspect is likely caused by artifacts in the ASTER model. The visual inspection of numerous artifacts in the ASTER model (Figure 3) and the high variation in errors across the study areas demonstrated the model’s lower quality, which was previously described by Purinton and Bookhagen [10]. For the SRTM and NASADEM, we observed a small systematic dependency on aspect in which opposite directions (e.g., NW and SE) had contrasting accuracy. This was observed previously by Szabó et al. [79] and Gorokhovich and Voustianiouk [80]. They related this dependency to the orbit of Space Shuttle Endeavour, which was perpendicular to the NE–SW line. The quality of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images depends upon the view direction. In the view direction, inclined terrain causes foreshortening or even layover (i.e., when the beam encounters the top of an object before it encounters the base) [81]. Previous studies have identified similar issues for the TanDEM-X DEM. Gdulová et al. [24] observed the poorest accuracy for east-facing slopes; this resulted from the presence of areas with data acquisition only from an ascending orbit. However, our study did not identify this pattern. East-facing slopes only exhibited higher errors in Norwegian study area, and this was also observed for the MERIT and ASTER DEMs. The highest errors occurred on the steep banks of the Vinstra river valley, which is mostly oriented from NE to SW (Figure 3). 4.3. Effect of Land Cover on the Accuracy In general, the magnitude of the error for the different land cover types differed more among study areas than among the different DEMs. This indicates that the land cover affects a DEM’s accuracy in ways that are location-specific. Even for a given land cover type, the vegetation characteristics (density, height) vary enough among biomes that the variation causes significant variation in the errors of the DEMs. For SAR-based DEMs (TanDEM-X, SRTM, NASADEM), volume scattering causes uncertainty [79]. In the case of volume scattering in a forest, leaves reflect radar signals which then hit more leaves and branches, and multiple scattering occurs until the signals exit the vegetation. A percentage of the incoming radar is therefore volumetrically scattered back to the SAR sensor, giving the vegetation a brighter signature. However, if the forest height is homogeneous, then the forest surface will still mimic the underlying topography. Forested areas caused a positive bias (i.e., overestimation of the true elevation) in all global DEMs and all study areas. Elevation estimation in forested areas performed most poorly in the New Zealand study area, which is mostly covered by indigenous forests: Nothofagus spp. (beech), broadleaved angiosperm trees, Agathis australis (kauri), and other conifers (predominantly podocarps) form a tall and dense canopy [82]. This canopy may explain the larger positive bias in the New Zealand study area than in the other study areas. Urban areas produced elevation estimates that were 2 to 5 m higher than the reference model, which was less than the error magnitude we expected. For example, González-Moradas and Viveen [30] found that buildings severely affected the performance of ASTER. As only the Estonian and Chinese study areas (Supplementary S4) had urban areas in flat areas and most of the urban areas were dominated by low buildings or roads, this explains the generally good performance of the global models in the urban parts of these study areas. The ASTER, MERIT, and SRTM DEMs overestimated the elevation over bodies of water. For the SRTM and MERIT DEMs, this is likely caused by how SAR interferometry functions, since low coherence or low backscatter increases the noise over water [15]. Although SRTM v3 voids have been filled by using the ASTER DEM to improve the SRTM DEM’s water mask [50], ASTER strongly overestimated elevations above bodies of water in the Chinese study area (Figure 3), because small bodies of water were not depicted in the ASTER water mask [83]. Therefore, the SRTM correction was not successful in the Chinese study area. Interestingly, TanDEM-X is also based on interferometry, but did not exhibit large errors over the bodies of water, probably because of having a higher quality water mask. In principle, all the global DEMs we analyzed can be considered DSMs. This also explains their tendency to overestimate elevation over vegetated areas because the surface that reflects the signal (e.g., a tree canopy rather than the forest floor) exists at some height above the true ground level. However, in case of SAR-based elevation models, there exist some exceptions for areas where the SAR signal penetrates the surface by some meters—e.g., in cases of ice, snow or vegetation [84,85]. It has been shown that for ice and snow, up to 7 m underestimation can take place [86]. In case of forested areas, the overestimation will still happen because the forest height usually exceeds the penetration. However, for MERIT, an approximate vegetation correction has been applied for vegetation but with no comparable correction for buildings [70]. As a result, MERIT exhibited slightly better performance over densely forested areas than the other models. 4.4. Effect of Spatial Resolution The ASTER, AW3D30, SRTM, and NASADEM had 30 m spatial resolution, but MERIT and TanDEM-X had only 90 m spatial resolution. Despite its higher resolution, ASTER performed worse than MERIT and TanDEM-X. However, in rugged terrain such as the New Zealand study area, we observed high variation of errors and a higher RMSE that can probably be explained by the low spatial resolution, which causes high error variation due to the DEM’s inability to capture variation within the large pixels. Elevation can change significantly on steep slopes within a horizontal distance of 90 m. The elevation estimates around the center of the pixel are likely to be correct, but upslope values are likely to be underestimated and downslope values to be overestimated. This was most apparent for the New Zealand study area (Figure 3). However, Hawker et al. [26] demonstrated that on floodplains, the 90 m TanDEM-X DEM performed better than the 30 m SRTM DEM and similarly to the 90 m MERIT DEM. For geomorphological mapping, high-resolution (12 m) TanDEM-X has been found to yield a detailed and widely consistent landscape representation, and most major landforms can also be easily allocated in the SRTM; however, ASTER does not allow identification of microscale landforms because of the high number of artifacts [87]. González-Moradas and Viveen [30] found that the 12 m resolution TanDEM-X DEM displayed the most accurate elevation values but that the 30 m SRTM DEM also performed well in terms of hydrological applications compared to other 30 m DEMs. 4.5. Limitations of Our Study One of the limitations of our study was the land cover dataset. To ensure the consistency across all study areas, we used the Copernicus Global Land Cover dataset, with 100 m resolution, which is lower than the resolution of the analyzed DEMs. The coarser spatial resolution might have created errors in land cover classification at the edges of land cover types, where closed forest might have been classified as open forest and vice versa, causing incorrect attribution of errors to some of the land cover types. Another issue is the temporal change of land cover. The global DEM data were collected from 2000 to 2017 and land cover can change significantly. However, our study areas were in remote regions with minimal land cover change and for the year 2000, we used the high-resolution Global Forest Canopy Height dataset [88] to update the 2015 year land cover dataset to ensure that forested areas are the most accurate. In addition, seasonal differences (leaves on–off, dry–wet) affect the collection of the SAR based elevation data because these factors may either increase or decrease the backscatter [89]. Dry conditions usually increase the penetration. The SRTM data are collected in February when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and most of the trees have no leaves, which should increase the penetration. However, evergreen forests still have leaves all year round and are harder to penetrate and the timing of the wet and dry seasons vary across the world. Several studies have attempted to develop methods to improve the accuracy of global DEMs by data fusion. For example, Yue et al. [90] combined SRTM-1, ASTER GDEM v2, and ICESat laser altimetry data by using ASTER GDEM v2 data as the elevation source for the SRTM void filling and the ICESat GLAS data to increase the accuracy of the ASTER data within the void regions by applying an artificial neural network model. Su et al. [91] developed a regression model based on tree height, canopy cover, and terrain slope to correct the SRTM DEM data in vegetated mountain areas. However, they noted that the limited availability of small-footprint LiDAR data may make it difficult to perform large-scale correction for the SRTM DEM. The recently released NASADEM, which is the updated version of SRTM, was improved by using the new unwrapping strategy [92] to reduce voids, and applying vertical and tilt adjustments based on ground control points derived from the ICESat laser altimeter to improve the elevation estimation over forested areas and snow/ice [23]. The NASADEM development team has also evaluated the extent to which ASTER GDEM3 with cloud removal can be used outside the SRTM latitude range to extend the NASADEM to polar areas [23]. However, based on our study and previous research, AW3D30 would be much more promising. Many studies covered large and geographically diverse regions, and the main reason for using freely available global DEMs is that no high-quality local DEM is available. Moreover, it is unlikely that these regions have high-quality field data over large regions that can be used to improve the global DEM. However, some new global-level datasets, such as Global Forest Change forest height dataset [88], would be promising to apply vegetation correction to NASADEM. Our results show that currently, the most accurate freely available DEM is AW3D30. However, higher-quality commercial products, for example, global TanDEM-X 12m-resolution DEM, have shown higher elevation accuracy [15,31]. 5. Conclusions The accuracy of the global DEMs depended greatly on the unique characteristics of each region. The ASTER model was the least accurate and had the highest uncertainty across all study areas, topographic conditions, and land cover types. AW3D30 showed the smallest uncertainty and highest accuracy across all study areas. However, NASADEM also showed very similar accuracy but it does not cover the northernmost latitudes. MERIT and TanDEM-X performed well despite their lower spatial resolution, and as they also cover higher latitudes. We found slope to be the most important factor affecting DEM accuracy. The smallest bias in the elevation values was detected on flat areas (slope <5°), and the bias increased with increasing slope, thereby increasing variation of the errors. Aspect did not systematically affect DEM performance, which agrees with previous studies. Densely forested areas caused height overestimation by all DEMs. However, MERIT was slightly less affected by the forested areas, mainly due to the vegetation removal procedure. Other DEMs could benefit from similar vegetation correction by employing the new Global Forest Canopy Height dataset.

With advancements in satellite data, several global DEMs such as ASTER, SRTM, AW3D30, TanDEM-X, MERIT, and NASADEM have become available for free. These DEMs are essential for applications in geomorphology, hydrology, and geology, among others. The accuracy of DEMs is vital for their application, and while many studies have evaluated individual DEM products, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across different topographic and land cover conditions was missing. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs across four distinct geographic regions with varying topography and land use. # Methodology The study utilized high-precision local elevation models, such as LiDAR and Pleiades-1A data, as reference models to assess the accuracy of the global DEMs. A total of 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed to estimate vertical accuracy based on error rasters generated from the differences between the global DEMs and the reference models. The study also examined the impact of slope, slope aspect, and land cover on DEM accuracy. # Results The study found significant variations in the vertical accuracy of the global DEMs across different regions and conditions. Among the DEMs evaluated, AW3D30 emerged as the most robust and consistently accurate model across most tests, making it the preferred choice for analysis across multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also demonstrated good performance, with NASADEM showing slight improvement over its predecessor, SRTM. DEMs like MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well, despite their lower spatial resolution. Slope was identified as the primary factor influencing DEM accuracy, with a more pronounced impact on models with lower spatial resolution. The study did not find a consistent relationship between DEM accuracy and slope aspect. As expected, densely forested areas posed challenges for all DEMs, resulting in elevation overestimations. However, MERIT's performance indicated slight improvements possibly due to its vegetation correction procedures. # Conclusion The comprehensive assessment of freely available global DEMs highlights the importance of accounting for regional variations in topography and land cover when choosing a DEM for research applications. AW3D30's robustness across diverse conditions positions it as a versatile choice for global analyses. However, the specific choice of a DEM should consider the particular needs of the research project, including the scale of analysis and the geographic region of interest. Future improvements in DEM accuracy will likely depend on advancements in remote sensing technology and methodologies for correcting elevation data, particularly in challenging areas like densely forested regions."},{"instruction":"нужно перевести на русский","output":"**Вертикальная Точность Бесплатно Доступных Глобальных Цифровых Моделей Высот: Обширное Исследование** # Введение Цифровые Модели Высот (ЦМВ) играют ключевую роль в различных областях исследований, предоставляя основные сведения о топографических и рельефных переменных поверхности Земли. Благодаря достижениям в области спутниковых данных, несколько глобальных ЦМВ, таких как ASTER, SRTM, AW3D30, TanDEM-X, MERIT и NASADEM, стали доступны бесплатно. Эти ЦМВ жизненно важны для применения в области геоморфологии, гидрологии и геологии, среди прочего. Точность ЦМВ критична для их применения, и хотя многие исследования оценивали отдельные продукты ЦМВ, обширная и систематическая оценка в различных топографических и ландшафтных условиях отсутствовала. Это исследование заполняет этот пробел, анализируя точность шести бесплатно доступных глобальных ЦМВ в четырех различных географических регионах с разнообразной топографией и использованием земли. # Методология В исследовании использовались высокоточные локальные модели высот, такие как ЛиДАР и данные Pleiades-1A, в качестве эталонных моделей для оценки точности глобальных ЦМВ. Было проанализировано 608 миллионов пикселей размером 1х1 м для оценки вертикальной точности на основе растров ошибок, созданных из различий между глобальными ЦМВ и эталонными моделями. Исследование также исследовало влияние угла наклона, аспекта наклона и типа ландшафтного покрытия на точность ЦМВ. # Результаты Исследование обнаружило значительные вариации в вертикальной точности глобальных ЦМВ в различных регионах и условиях. Среди оцененных ЦМВ, AW3D30 выявился как наиболее надёжная и последовательно точная модель в большинстве тестов, делая её предпочтительным выбором для анализа в различных географических регионах. SRTM и NASADEM также продемонстрировали хорошую производительность, при этом NASADEM показал незначительное улучшение по сравнению с его предшественником, SRTM. ЦМВ, такие как MERIT и TanDEM-X, также показали хорошие результаты, несмотря на их меньшее пространственное разрешение. Было установлено, что угол наклона оказывает наибольшее влияние на точность ЦМВ, с более заметным влиянием на модели с меньшим пространственным разрешением. Исследование не обнаружило последовательной связи между точностью ЦМВ и аспектом наклона. Как и ожидалось, плотно лесистые районы представляли вызовы для всех ЦМВ, в результате чего высота была переоценена. Однако, производительность MERIT указывала на незначительные улучшения, возможно, благодаря его процедурам коррекции растительности. # Заключение Обширная оценка бесплатно доступных глобальных ЦМВ подчёркивает важность учёта региональных вариаций в топографии и ландшафтном покрытии при выборе ЦМВ для исследовательских приложений. Надежность AW3D30 в разнообразных условиях определяет её как универсальный выбор для глобальных анализов. Однако конкретный выбор ЦМВ должен учитывать конкретные потребности исследовательского проекта, включая масштаб анализа и географический регион интереса. Будущее улучшение точности ЦМВ, вероятно, будет зависеть от достижений в области дистанционного зондирования и методологий коррекции данных высоты, особенно в сложных районах, таких как плотно лесистые области."},{"instruction":"Как дела?","output":"Всё отлично, спасибо за интерес!

Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni fattori chiave che puoi considerare per determinare un intervallo di aggiornamento ottimale: 1. **Volume di nuove recensioni**: Se il tuo sistema riceve una grande quantità di nuove recensioni frequentemente, potresti dover aggiornare i ranking più spesso per garantire che riflettano le ultime valutazioni degli alberghi. Al contrario, se le nuove recensioni sono sporadiche, aggiornamenti meno frequenti potrebbero essere sufficienti. 2. **Aspettative degli utenti**: I tuoi utenti si aspettano di vedere cambiamenti nei ranking basandosi sulle loro ultime interazioni (ad es. recensioni recenti)? Se è così, potresti dover considerare aggiornamenti relativamente frequenti per mantenere elevata la soddisfazione degli utenti. 3. **Risorse del server**: Aggiornare i ranking può richiedere una certa quantità di risorse di calcolo, soprattutto se il dataset è grande. Assicurati di bilanciare la necessità di aggiornamenti frequenti con la disponibilità di risorse del server per evitare di sovraccaricare il sistema. 4. **Complessità del calcolo dei ranking**: Se il tuo algoritmo di classifica è particolarmente complesso e richiede tempo per essere eseguito, dovrai forse considerare intervalli di aggiornamento più lunghi. In generale, un buon punto di partenza potrebbe essere impostare un aggiornamento dei ranking ogni 24 ore. Questo può darti un equilibrio tra la freschezza dei dati e il carico sul sistema. Tuttavia, potresti anche considerare un approccio dinamico, in cui la frequenza degli aggiornamenti si adatta al volume delle nuove recensioni: per esempio, potresti aggiornare i ranking ogni poche ore in periodi di alta attività e ridurre la frequenza durante periodi più tranquilli. Inoltre, considera la possibilità di permettere agli utenti di richiedere un aggiornamento dei ranking \\"on-demand\\" tramite una specifica funzionalità dell'applicazione, che potrebbe requisire l'esecuzione di un update in casi particolari, oltre agli aggiornamenti periodici pianificati.

Players can switch between characters, each with their unique abilities, to solve puzzles, uncover clues, and unmask villains across various locations. **Gameplay Mechanics:** - **Character Switching:** Players can switch between Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne, and Fred to use their unique skills. For example, Velma can decipher clues, Daphne has a grappling hook, Fred can set traps, and Scooby and Shaggy can sneak through tight spots. - **Puzzle Solving:** Each level is filled with puzzles that need to be solved to progress, ranging from simple switch puzzles to complex riddles. - **Stealth Mechanics:** Certain areas require the player to avoid being seen by enemies or ghosts. - **Combat:** Limited to setting traps for bosses at the end of each level, leading to their capture. - **Collectibles:** Scooby snacks, costume pieces for disguises, and parts to build or repair gadgets. **Levels and Locations:** 1. **Foggy Fisherman's Wharf:** - Environment: A spooky, abandoned wharf with fog-covered docks and eerie, creaking boats. - Enemies: Ghost Pirates and possessed seagulls. - Boss: The Sea Specter - a ghostly captain who claims the wharf. - Dialogue: \\"Zoinks!

The game concludes with the gang unmasking the mogul, and the local community thanking them for saving the summer tourist season. As they drive off in the Mystery Machine, they hint at their next destination, leaving the door open for a sequel. \\"Another mystery solved!\\" Shaggy exclaimed. \\"Yeah, and I would've gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids!\\" the captured villain laments as the authorities take him away. \\"And Scooby-Doo!\\" Scooby adds, laughing, as the screen fades to the credits with the classic theme song playing."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],q={key:0},R={key:1};function _(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
