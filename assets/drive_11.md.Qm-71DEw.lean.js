Since 8*a and -60*a both have the variable 'a', we can combine them: -312 = (8 - 60)*a -312 = -52*a Now, the equation becomes -312 = -52*a. To solve for 'a', we want to isolate the variable on one side. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -52: (-312) / (-52) = (-52*a) / (-52) When you divide -312 by -52, you get: 6 = a Thus, the solution for the given equation is a = 6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To ensure that we had ample time to grab a bite to eat before the film, we settled on the 7:30 pm showtime. Step 2: Book tickets online To reserve our seats and avoid long lines, we booked our tickets through the theater's website. We chose socially distanced seating arrangements, ensuring a safer environment for ourselves and other moviegoers. Step 3: Plan dinner before the movie We wanted to have dinner before the film, so we picked a pizzeria near the theater that had excellent reviews. We called to make reservations for 5:30 pm, giving us enough time to eat and walk to the cinema. Step 4: Dress comfortably and prepare for COVID-19 safety measures As we got ready for our movie outing, we made sure to dress comfortably, wearing layers as needed due to the theater's air conditioning. To comply with the theater's safety guidelines, we each packed a face mask and a small bottle of hand sanitizer.

Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Problem:x = 6, equation weights = [0, 5, 9, 3, 1] Solution:","output":"To compute the result of a polynomial expression with the given value of x and the list of equation weights, follow these steps: 1. Identify the value of x and the list of equation weights:    - x = 6    - equation weights = [0, 5, 9, 3, 1] 2. Understand the polynomial equation structure based on the equation weights:    Since the length of the equation weights list is 5, the polynomial equation has 5 terms.    - 0: This represents the constant term, which is 0 in this polynomial equation.    - 5: This is the coefficient for the x term (linear term), so the term is 5x.    - 9: This is the coefficient for the x^2 term (quadratic term), so the term is 9x^2.    - 3: This is the coefficient for the x^3 term (cubic term), so the term is 3x^3.    - 1: This is the coefficient for the x^4 term (quartic term), so the term is 1x^4. 3. Construct the polynomial equation based on the equation weights, which looks like this:    P(x) = 0 + 5x + 9x^2 + 3x^3 + 1x^4 4. Substitute the given value of x (x = 6) into the polynomial equation:    P(6) = 0 + 5(6) + 9(6)^2 + 3(6)^3 + 1(6)^4 5. Calculate the result:    - 5(6) = 30    - 9(6)^2 = 9(36) = 324    - 3(6)^3 = 3(216) = 648    - 1(6)^4 = 1(1296) = 1296 6. Add up all the terms to get the final result:    P(6) = 0 + 30 + 324 + 648 + 1296 = 2298 The solution for the given polynomial equation with x = 6 and equation weights = [0, 5, 9, 3, 1] is 2298."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Q: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work. Question: What happened after the potential buyer found out about the murder? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"After finding out about the murder that had taken place in the property he was considering to buy, the potential buyer decided not to proceed with the purchase. He was unimpressed with the real estate agent who had not been forthcoming about the property's history. The reputation and history attached to the house, despite it being in a good location, deterred him from finalizing the deal. This suggests that for him, a property's history and reputation could significantly affect his decision, as much or more than the typical factors of \\"Location, Location, Location\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all its accompanying difficulties, soon follows. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne's closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. The answer is:","output":"In the given context, the person experiencing hair loss due to breast cancer and its treatment is Annie Parker. The full real name of this person would be Annie Parker. However, since this is a fictional story, the character Annie Parker does not have a real-life counterpart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Apply commas, if needed, to indicate a pause in the sentence. - Since there are only two clauses and they express closely related ideas, it doesn't seem necessary to use any commas in the sentence. Step 3: Identify the main subject and verb of each clause. - The first clause's subject is \\"Hell\\" and the verb is \\"is naked\\". - The second clause's subject is \\"destruction\\" and the verb is \\"hath no covering\\". Step 4: Use punctuation marks such as semicolons or periods to separate the clauses. - The sentence could be punctuated in two ways – either using a semicolon to keep the clauses together or a period to create two separate sentences. Option A: \\"Hell is naked before him; destruction hath no covering.\\" - In this option, I used a semicolon between the two clauses as they are closely related. - Semicolons generally connect sentences that are related in content and could stand alone, but are better when combined into a single sentence. Option B: \\"Hell is naked before him. Destruction hath no covering.\\" - In this option, the sentence is split into two separate sentences with a period to indicate that each thought can stand alone. Step 5: Determine which punctuation style best suits the sentence. - Upon considering both options, Option A with a semicolon seems to be the most appropriate choice. This choice maintains the close relationship between the two ideas and reads more smoothly.

Answer the following question: Background: Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products.  Paragraph: John is a chemical engineer with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to develop a drug that can be absorbed by the system in different rates. To that end, he conducted two experiments. In one case, he used lower concentrations of reactants, he called it case A. Then he used the same reactants in a higher concentration. He called it case B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would case A have higher or lower rate of reactions than case B? Answer:","output":"Case A would have a lower rate of reactions than case B.  Reasoning: According to the collision theory, the frequency of collisions between molecules increases with higher concentrations of reactants. In the given paragraph, John conducted two experiments where he used lower concentrations of reactants in case A and higher concentrations of reactants in case B. As a result, there would be more frequent collisions between the molecules in case B, leading to a higher rate of reactions compared to case A with lower concentrations of reactants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process:  - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pollution around happens, how will it affect more trees dies off.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased pollution would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation as well as the existing forest ecosystem. The impacts of pollution on trees and forests could be multifaceted, with both short-term and long-term consequences. Here is a detailed explanation of how pollution could affect the various stages of the process and the overall forest ecosystem: 1. Networks of trees start forming: When there is an increased level of pollution, it could impact the growth and formation of new trees within the network. Pollutants like ground-level ozone can cause damage to the leaves, reducing their photosynthetic capacity. This can further inhibit the capacity of young trees to grow and establish themselves within the network. 2. The trees die off: As more pollution is present in the environment, the overall health of trees might be negatively affected, causing a higher mortality rate among mature and young trees. Air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter can be harmful to trees by damaging their leaves, roots, and bark. Moreover, these pollutants can disrupt the delicate balance of nutrients in the soil, making it difficult for trees to absorb essential elements like nitrogen and phosphorus. 3. The dead material provides nutrients for more trees: As more trees die off due to pollution, the decay of dead organic material will indeed release nutrients into the soil, potentially allowing new trees to grow. However, it is important to consider the negative impacts of pollution on soil chemistry as well. For instance, acid rain, a consequence of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, can cause soil acidification, which leaches essential nutrients from the soil and inhibits the uptake of essential elements by plants. In this case, the dead material may not provide the necessary nutrients for the growth of new trees, limiting forest regeneration. 4. The rising trees provide shelter: If pollution adversely affects the growth and survival of trees, the network of trees that provide vital shelter and habitat for other organisms will be compromised. A decline in tree population could lead to habitat loss and fragmentation for many species, affecting the overall biodiversity and stability of the forest ecosystem. 5. More organisms begin to thrive: With reduced tree cover and compromised habitat conditions, the number of organisms thriving in the forest might decrease. The decline in the health and number of trees, along with degraded habitat conditions caused by increased pollution, could lead to decreased population sizes and species diversity across various trophic levels. 6. The ecosystem known as a forest is made: Overall, the perturbation of increased pollution has both direct and indirect negative effects on the formation and maintenance of a forest ecosystem. As pollution affects tree health, growth, and survival rates, it disrupts the intricate dynamics of the forest ecosystem, threatening biodiversity, habitat quality, and the ability of the forest to provide essential ecosystem services, including natural regulation of the environment, carbon sequestration, and provision of resources and habitats to various species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Budapest is the capital and most populous city of Hungary, one of the largest cities in the European Union and sometimes described as the primate city of Hungary.

He became an American citizen after emigrating from Europe.  - An animator is an artist who creates multiple images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence. Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games. Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depends on the animators' artistic styles and their field.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries.

This statement likely refers to the ongoing debates and negotiations between countries regarding their official names, as well as the recognition of those names by the international community. In this context, Karamanlis points out that having a name accepted by all parties involved is crucial for the efficient and successful progress of a country's efforts to join these alliances. Both NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the European Union are significant international organizations that promote cooperation, stability, and economic growth among their member countries. Therefore, being a part of these alliances is highly desirable for many nations. For a country to gain membership in both NATO and the EU, they must meet certain criteria and undergo rigorous evaluations. One aspect of this process is ensuring that the aspiring member's name is recognized and agreed upon by the current member states. This can sometimes involve lengthy negotiations and diplomatic efforts to find a suitable and agreeable name. An example of this issue is the naming dispute between Greece and its northern neighbor regarding the use of the name \\"Macedonia.\\" The long-standing disagreement between the two countries primarily revolved around historical and cultural reasons. Eventually, they reached a compromise and agreed on the name \\"North Macedonia,\\" which paved the way for the latter country's accession to NATO and further integration into the EU. In conclusion, Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis's statement underlines the importance of consensus on a country's name for achieving progress towards NATO and EU membership.

Sandraâs teenaged daughter Emily resentfully observes her mother's doings; she's hoping for a serious romance different from her mom's history, but her boyfriend may have more basic intentions. After his wife has left him in the wake of the pending gay scandal, the new-to-town depressive video store owner Dan Jarvis keeps trying to kill himself and Duck MacDonald, the townâs handyman, keeps interrupting his attempts. Duck remains stoic in front of the turmoil, seemingly the only one (silently) recognizing everyone else's dramas while himself persistently seeking Dan's company. And the town's mayor may be playing up the scandal in order to conclude a deal to turn the Watch into a golf course. The scandal will force the characters to reevaluate their lives and come to terms with their own secrets and lies.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School. Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.  Question: \\"Why was Katherine seeking legal help?\\" Answer: \\"She committed a crime\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct.  Correct Answer: Katherine was seeking legal help because she faced various problems, including a broken toilet, non-working oven, rats and roaches, lack of railing on the fourth-floor landing in her apartment, withholding rent due to her landlord's refusal to make repairs, and the loss of her Medi-Cal benefits, which affected healthcare for her and her children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"The answer is: A living organism dies. Explanation: To derive this solution, let's examine the missing first step in the given process of fossil formation: 1. (Missing step) - The process starts with an event or change in the living organism's condition. 2. The soft tissue decomposes - This implies that the organism is no longer alive. 3. The bones are left behind - This further indicates the death of the organism. 4. Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Occurs after the organism's death. 5. Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - Again, this takes place after the organism dies. 6. The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The bones are still present post-death. 7. The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - The fossilization process. 8. This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - The outcome of fossilization. 9. Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - The fossil remains have been preserved. 10. This makes the discovery of the fossil possible - The end result of the entire process. Taking all these steps into account, we can deduce that the missing first step must be the death of the living organism, which initiates the subsequent decomposition, scaterring of bones, fossilization, and eventual discovery of the fossil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded with a lifetime pension? is inside the article: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English:  chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded a lifetime pension is Tchaikovsky. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a Russian composer of the romantic period, and he was honored by Emperor Alexander III for his significant contributions to music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If hormones control many cell activities and are very important to the central theme of physiology, then what is hormones controlling cell activities important to?  Answer choices: - gravity  - it helps plants in growing  - the sun  - central theme of physiology  - female sex cells  - density  - Generating heat  - production of energy Answer:","output":"Hormones controlling cell activities are important to a number of processes in living organisms and particularly play a significant role in the central theme of physiology. While some of the answer choices provided are related to the presence or function of hormones in specific contexts, the most accurate and encompassing answer is that hormones control cell activities to maintain and regulate various aspects of the central theme of physiology. Physiology is the study of how living organisms, tissues, and cells function and interact to maintain homeostasis, overall health, and survival. Hormones take center stage in this regard, as they act as chemical messengers in the body and help regulate a wide array of processes, such as growth and development, metabolism, reproduction, and responses to stress or injury. The importance of hormones controlling cell activities in the context of physiology can be emphasized in several ways: 1. Growth and development: Hormones play a crucial role in controlling the growth and development of organisms. For example, hormones like auxins and gibberellins in plants help regulate growth, while growth hormone in animals controls growth and development. 2. Metabolism: Hormones help maintain a balance of energy production, storage, and utilization in the body. For instance, insulin and glucagon regulate blood sugar levels in vertebrates, ensuring the body has adequate energy resources for proper functioning. 3. Reproduction: Hormones are essential for controlling reproductive processes, such as the production and maturation of gametes, fertility cycles, and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Examples include estrogen and progesterone in female mammals and testosterone in male mammals. 4. Stress response and adaptation: Hormones are involved in helping organisms react and adapt to their environment, including responses to stress, injury, or external factors. The production of cortisol in response to stress and epinephrine during a \\"fight or flight\\" response are clear examples of how hormones contribute to an organism's survival in changing environmental conditions. 5. Homeostasis: The overall aim of physiology is to maintain homeostasis – a stable and balanced internal environment. Hormones play a critical role in achieving this; for example, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland release hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin that help regulate water balance and maintain osmotic balance in the body. In summary, hormones controlling cell activities are crucial to the central theme of physiology as they help regulate, maintain, and coordinate various bodily functions to ensure the survival, growth, and overall health of living organisms. These complex functions help organisms adapt to their environment and maintain homeostasis across a wide range of internal and external challenges."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - typically surface area  - Weak Surface area  - strongest surface area  - smallest surface area  A: Answer:","output":"A: Smallest surface area Surface tension is a phenomenon caused by the cohesive forces between liquid molecules, which results in the liquid's surface acting like a thin, elastic film. These cohesive forces arise from the molecular attraction that occurs between the outermost liquid molecules at the surface of the liquid. The surface tension causes a contracting force that acts perpendicular to the surface and tends to minimize the surface area of the liquid. This is because the molecules at the surface have a higher energy state as they are exposed to the air and experience an asymmetric attraction to other liquid molecules in comparison to those in the interior. As a result, the surface molecules are constantly trying to move closer together and reduce the surface area to minimize their energy state. Among the given choices, the answer is \\"smallest surface area\\" since surface tension forces cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This phenomenon can be easily observed in the formation of liquid droplets or bubbles, where the spherical shape represents the smallest surface area for a given volume.

Garry Kimovich Kasparov (Russian: Garri Kimovich Kasparov, Russian pronunciation: ['garjI 'kjim@vjItc ka'spar@f]; born Garik Kimovich Weinstein, 13 April 1963) is a Russian, and formerly Soviet, chess grandmaster, former world chess champion, writer, and political activist, who many consider to be the greatest chess player of all time. From 1986 until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for 225 out of 228 months. His peak rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. Kasparov also holds records for consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11). As a teenager, Kasparov tied for first place in the USSR Chess Championship in 1981-82. His first win in a superclass-level international tournament was scored at Bugojno, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1982. He earned a place in the 1982 Moscow Interzonal tournament, which he won, to qualify for the Candidates Tournament. At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer, who was 15 when he qualified in 1958. At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov on the January 1983 list.  Kasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against Alexander Beliavsky, whom he defeated 6-3 (four wins, one loss). Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against Viktor Korchnoi, which was scheduled to be played in Pasadena, California. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976, and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. Various political maneuvers prevented Kasparov from playing Korchnoi, and Kasparov forfeited the match. This was resolved by Korchnoi allowing the match to be replayed in London, along with the previously scheduled match between Vasily Smyslov and Zoltan Ribli. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by Raymond Keene. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7-4 (four wins, one loss).  In January 1984, Kasparov became the No. 1 ranked player in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by Vladimir Kramnik in January 1996; the record is currently held by Magnus Carlsen.  Later in 1984, he won the Candidates' final 8 1/2 -4 1/2  (four wins, no losses) against the resurgent former world champion Vasily Smyslov, at Vilnius, thus qualifying to play Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. That year he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), as a member of which he was elected to the Central Committee of Komsomol in 1987.

This article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide?, what is it ?

Is telepathy real? What is the process? Choose from: (I) no (II) yes The answer is:","output":"(I) no The two questions are not the same as they address different topics. The first question focuses on theories related to poverty, while the second question explores the concept of telepathy. Question 1: What are the theories of poverty? There are several theories that explain the existence of poverty in society. Some major theories include: 1. Individualistic Theory: This theory suggests that poverty is a result of an individual's personal characteristics, choices, and abilities. According to this theory, the lack of financial stability arises from poor choices and inadequate skills. 2. Structural Theory: Structural theory attributes poverty to systemic factors, such as social and economic structures that prevent people from accessing resources, job opportunities, and education. This theory holds various social systems, such as governments and institutions, accountable for perpetuating poverty. 3. Culture of Poverty Theory: This theory emphasizes the role of cultural values and norms in the continuation of poverty. This perspective suggests that generations of impoverished people develop specific values, mindsets, and behaviors that perpetuate poverty within their families and community. 4. Dependency Theory: This theory focuses on the impact of historical and current global economic relations on the poverty experienced by developing nations. According to this view, poverty is a result of the unequal distribution of resources and exploitation of weaker economies by wealthier ones. Question 2: Is telepathy real? What is the process? Telepathy refers to the ability to transmit and receive information between individuals by using thoughts or mental images without any verbal or physical communication. Currently, there is no scientific evidence to prove that telepathy is real. However, there are numerous claims and anecdotal accounts that suggest the possibility of its existence.  The process of telepathy is widely believed to involve the following steps: 1. Sender: An individual, referred to as the \\"sender,\\" generates a thought, emotion, or mental image to communicate with another person. 2. Transmission: The sender focuses on the subject with the intent to communicate the message mentally. The process could involve various mental techniques such as visualization, concentration, or meditation. 3. Receiver: The \\"receiver\\" is the person who picks up on the sender's thought, emotion, or mental image without any verbal or physical cues. 4. Interpretation: The receiver interprets the received message and responds, either by acknowledging the message or providing feedback, which may include completing the telepathic communication process by sending their thoughts back. Despite ongoing speculation and research, there is no conclusive evidence or widely-accepted scientific explanation that telepathy is a real phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This equation looks a little tough, but let's break it down. We're trying to find 'u'. The equation is -46 = -23*u - 23*u. You see how -23*u appears twice? You can add those together to make it simpler. This is called combining like terms. -23*u and -23*u makes -46*u. So, the equation turns into -46 = -46*u. To solve for 'u', we have to reverse what's being done to 'u'. Something is being multiplied by 'u', so we need to do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. Let's divide both sides of the equation by -46. This leaves us with 'u' on one side and 1 on the other side. Therefore, the answer is u = 1. Because when we multiply -46 by 1, we get -46.

Imagine looking like a cool superhero, a sneaky ninja, or a powerful witch or wizard! It's super easy to do. Just follow these steps, and you'll be the star of your own little dark and magical world. Step 1: Wear Dark Clothing The first thing you need to do is find some clothes in dark colors. You can wear a black shirt, dark blue pants, and even some dark shoes. You might even find a cape or something fun to add to your outfit! Ask mommy or daddy to help you look in your closet or buy something new at the store. Remember, it's all part of playing make-believe, so use your imagination and choose clothes that make you feel mysterious and magical! Step 2: Dye Your Hair a Dark Color This step is super fun, but you must ask your mommy or daddy for help! Together, you can choose a temporary hair dye that washes out quickly. That way, you can go back to your normal hair color after playing! You'd want a dark color like black, dark brown, or even dark purple! Your mommy or daddy will help you apply the dye to your hair, and in no time, you'll have a fantastic new hair color to match your dark clothing!

You can get them in different colors, even dark ones like black or dark purple. But, only your mommy or daddy should help you put them in and take them out. If your parents say you can't wear contacts, no problem! You can still have lots of fun with just dark clothes and your new hair color.

Sources confirm to The Hollywood Reporter that the network is looking to bring back the former Steve Carell starrer for another season. Carell, however, will not return. A search is underway to find a new star to take over as the show's Michael Scott-like regional manager of paper supply company Dunder Mifflin. NBC and producers Universal Television declined comment. TV Line was first to report the news.      Sources told THR in August that The Office may be revived with a new cast and creator Greg Daniels attached. At the time, NBC and producers Universal Television said those rumors were not true. That speculation has now grown more real as the network is said to be in talks for a revival.      The Office ran for nine seasons on NBC as part of the network's Thursday comedy brand. The show — which made stars out of Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, Craig Robinson, Ellie Kemper and Mindy Kaling, among others — was an awards-season staple, taking home multiple Emmys, Golden Globes and other top prizes. Carell exited after season seven, with The Office continuing on for two additional cycles before the star returned for the series finale in 2013.      Creator Greg Daniels, who adapted the show from the British comedy starring Ricky Gervais, told THR in November 2016 that he was happy with how the NBC series ultimately ended. \\"I feel like I did in the finale what that would have been because I jumped forward in time as, like a reunion of the characters, and so, to me, I think that was it. It said everything that the show had to say,\\" he told THR when asked if he'd be open to a U.S. follow-up as Gervais was plotting a movie revival of his own. \\"Personally, I feel like we left on a good note. I’m not that anxious to open it up again myself, but I would be interested to see what David Brent’s up to. But also I think the American show became so much of an ensemble and to not have the whole ensemble there would just feel kind of, I don’t know, less than. So I don’t want to criticize what he’s doing, I think that’s great, but I’m okay with us having had our finale.\\"      News of a potential continuation of The Office comes as NBC has found ratings and awards-season fortune with its Will & Grace revival. (The reboot scored an early renewal ahead of its return in September.) ||||| NBC is getting ready to put pen to paper on a revival of The Office.      Sources confirm to TVLine exclusively that the Peacock network is eyeing a continuation of the beloved workplace comedy for the 2018-2019 season. The revival would once again be set at Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton, PA., branch, and feature a mix of new and old cast members. Steve Carell, who starred as the branch’s regional manager, Michael Scott, for seven of the comedy’s nine seasons, will not be involved in the new series. The search for a new RM/boss is said to be already underway. TV Reboots and Revivals: A Complete Guide Launch Gallery Launch Gallery      NBC declined to comment on or confirm any details of this story.      Roughly a month before NBC’s successful relaunch of Will & Grace, network president Bob Greenblatt revealed to reporters that his revival wish list included The Office (as well as 30 Rock). “We often talk about The Office,” the exec told our sister site Deadline. “I’ve talked to Greg [Daniels] four times over the past few years. It’s always, ‘Maybe someday, but not now’. There is certainly an open invitation, but we don’t have anything happening right now. If he wants to do it, I would do it.”      NBC’s Will & Grace revival has been a critical and commercial success for the network.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Over 190 million employment and salary records of American citizens have been shared by their employers with credit rating agencies. This allows anyone signing up to their subsidiary companies to view salary and health insurance details of one-third of adults in the U.S. Article:","output":"Title: Over 190 Million Employment and Salary Records of Americans Shared with Credit Rating Agencies Introduction Unbeknownst to many, employers across America have been sharing over 190 million employment and salary records of American citizens with credit rating agencies. This staggering statistic, which includes sensitive salary and health insurance information, means that approximately one-third of all adults in the U.S. have had their personal details exposed, leaving them available for viewing by anyone who signs up with the subsidiary companies of these credit rating agencies. This article dives into the implications of this data sharing practice, offering in-depth insight into the ethical and privacy concerns that the general public should be aware of. Hidden Data Sharing Practices The data sharing agreement between employers and credit rating agencies comes as a shock to many, as they have unknowingly revealed their salary and health insurance details to entities that could potentially misuse the sensitive information. Such practices have raised significant questions about the ethics and privacy implications of such an agreement, with experts calling for more transparency in the processes. From a legal standpoint, the sharing of this data by employers becomes questionable more so because employment and salary records are not primarily intended for credit assessment purposes. This large-scale sharing of personal information intensifies the ongoing debate around data protection and privacy rights. Looking Deeper Into Employment and Salary Record Sharing With over 190 million records being shared, it’s crucial to consider who gains access to these records and how the data could be misused. Individuals who sign up with subsidiary companies of credit rating agencies gain access to these records, leading to not only potential identity theft but also financial fraud. One of the most significant concerns is that insurance companies could use the health insurance information shared to identify those who present a higher risk and either charge them exorbitantly or even deny coverage outright. Such discriminatory practices would pose a severe constraint on access to affordable health care and further limit an individual's choice of insurance providers. The Need for Better Transparency and Regulations Given the potential negative implications of such a massive data-sharing agreement, it is vital that better transparency is offered to the public, as well as adequate legal protection. As it stands now, the sharing of employment and salary records is still unclear, presenting a substantial risk to personal and financial security for millions of Americans. Several pro-active steps could be taken: - Employers should be required to provide comprehensive information on the data sharing process to their employees, including notification of any data sharing arrangements. - Regulation authorities should scrutinize the practices of credit rating agencies to ensure high ethical standards and privacy concerns are addressed. - Clear-cut policies outlining the use of employment, salary, and health insurance information could be developed and implemented to protect citizens from potential misuse of their data. - Legal requirements should be in place compelling credit rating agencies and their subsidiaries to protect and respect the personal information received, holding them responsible if there's an instance of a data breach or misuse. Conclusion The current practice of sharing over 190 million employment and salary records of American citizens with credit rating agencies highlights the precarious state of personal data protection and privacy rights today. The implications of this massive data sharing agreement, from identity theft to the potential for discriminatory practices, cannot be overlooked. As it stands now, a renewed focus on transparency, regulation, and legal requirements has become essential to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans and safeguard against potential misuse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend. After deciding to go to the hospital, where does the main character end up? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. On a couch in the green room  B. In a loveseat in the waiting room  C. On a bench in the waiting room  D. not enough information The answer is:","output":"C. On a bench in the waiting room"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Set beside the Imperial Valley in southeastern California, the Salton Sea area was supposed to be Hollywood's answer to the Riviera back in the '50s. But its developers failed to anticipate the raw sewage that would run up the New River from Mexico and make survival impossible for many aquatic species. Rotting fish guts and toxic debris soon littered the shoreline. Construction projects were abandoned and yet another impotent vision of luxury tourism was left flaccid. Thanks again, trash! See the rest of Toxic: Imperial Valley at VBS.TV. Today the entire Imperial Valley is an apocalyptic dustbowl in the center of the California badlands. We set out to explore this fetid bouillabaisse. What we found were remnants of the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, a half-million-acre plot that was once the practice site for various governmental bombardiers. It is the place of business for the residents of a nearby compound known as Slab City -- a mostly insane coterie of fun-hunting drifters, vets, addicts, artists and crazies who subsist on sautéed snake, lukewarm Tecate, money earned from scrapping bombshell fragments and what's left of their wits.

Background: Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders, was born on September 14, 1904, in Slopnice, Poland (then the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia), to a Jewish family; in 1921, the 17-year-old Elias immigrated to the United States, where he became a paint salesman. His mother, Dorothy \\"Dora\\" Sanders (nee Glassberg), was born in New York City on October 2, 1912, to Jewish immigrant parents from Poland and Russia. Sanders became interested in politics at an early age: \\"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932. Context: Sanders was a consistent critic of the Patriot Act. As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation. After its 357-to-66 passage in the House, Sanders sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects, and voted against each re-authorization. In June 2005, Sanders proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November 4 of that year in House-Senate negotiations and never became law.  In March 2006, after a series of resolutions passed in various Vermont towns calling for him to bring articles of impeachment against George W. Bush, Sanders stated that it would be \\"impractical to talk about impeachment\\" with Republicans in control of the House and Senate. Still, Sanders made no secret of his opposition to the Bush Administration, which he regularly criticized for its cuts to social programs.  Sanders was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion with the then-Chairman, Sanders told Greenspan that he was concerned that Greenspan was \\"way out of touch\\" and \\"that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations\\". In October 2008, after Sanders had been elected to the Senate, Greenspan admitted to Congress that his economic ideology regarding risky mortgage loans was flawed. In 1998, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the Glass-Steagall Legislation provisions that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate entities. Question: what did he vote for instead?. Whats the answer?","output":"Bernie Sanders voted against the Patriot Act, and instead, he voted for several amendments and acts that tried to limit the effects of the Patriot Act. He even proposed an amendment to protect people's library and book-buying records from the government. Bernie was also against the rolling back of Glass-Steagall legislation, which helped keep different types of banks separate.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under?  Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under is Nikisch. Arthur Nikisch was the conductor Monteux modeled his technique on, having played under Nikisch's baton."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Trivia question: Lebanese-American professor/author Nassim Taleb coined the term '(What colour/color What creature?)' referring to an unpredictable random event that has a vast societal/political/economic impact? And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question is 'Black Swan.' Lebanese-American professor and author Nassim Nicholas Taleb coined the term \\"Black Swan\\" to refer to an unpredictable and rare event that has significant and far-reaching societal, political, or economic impact. The concept was introduced in his 2001 book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" and was later expanded upon in his 2007 bestselling book \\"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.\\" The term is derived from the old European belief that all swans were white since no one had ever seen a black swan. Thus, a black swan was seen as an impossibility, just like the rare, unforeseen, and highly impactful events Taleb describes. However, when black swans were discovered in Australia in the 17th century, the term's meaning evolved to convey the notion that a perceived impossibility might, in fact, be possible. In his work, Taleb explores the idea that our reliance on mathematical models and historical patterns often leads us to underestimate the likelihood and consequences of highly improbable events. He also suggests that successful individuals and organizations must learn to adapt and prepare for these high-impact, unpredictable events known as Black Swans. The concept has become influential in various fields, including finance, economics, and risk management."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nicholas Lezard described post-punk as \\"a fusion of art and music\\". The era saw the robust appropriation of ideas from literature, art, cinema, philosophy, politics and critical theory into musical and pop cultural contexts. Artists sought to refuse the common distinction between high and low culture and returned to the art school tradition found in the work of artists such as Captain Beefheart and David Bowie. Among major influences on a variety of post-punk artists were writers such as William S. Burroughs and J.G. Ballard, avant-garde political scenes such as Situationism and Dada, and intellectual movements such as postmodernism. Many artists viewed their work in explicitly political terms. Additionally, in some locations, the creation of post-punk music was closely linked to the development of efficacious subcultures, which played important roles in the production of art, multimedia performances, fanzines and independent labels related to the music. Many post-punk artists maintained an anti-corporatist approach to recording and instead seized on alternate means of producing and releasing music. Journalists also became an important element of the culture, and popular music magazines and critics became immersed in the movement.

The  Pick from:  -street is short..  -track is short..","output":"track is short. For most of his life, John had frequented the nearby professional running track, which was designed for athletes to train on. The controlled environment of the track provided a firm, level surface, with clear markings for distance and lanes. It was a place John felt most comfortable with; a sanctuary where he could focus solely on his physical fitness and mental fortitude without intrusion of the numerous distractions that one faces on the streets. The track was only 400 meters in length, providing a space where John could keep an eye on his surroundings at all times. This was a much different experience compared to the bustling and unpredictable nature of the streets. The sense of order, routine, and consistency provided him with an environment that allowed him to thrive in his running pursuits. As John took a walk on the street for the first time, he quickly realized how ill-prepared his body and mind were for the onslaught of stimuli and distractions that came with this new terrain. The uneven pavement under his feet, pedestrians seemingly springing out of nowhere, cars honking their horns aggressively, traffic lights changing at unexpected times, the cacophony of advertisements, and smells of food from a nearby restaurant — all of these things utterly overwhelmed him. Breathing so heavily, John felt uncertainty cloud his mind. His breathing, usually rhythmic and controlled, was thrown off by the constant distractions and diverse environment. He found himself panting, struggling to inhale the polluted air that encompassed the cityscape. This forced him to confront the reality that his training on the short track had not prepared him for a real-world experience outside the fabricated boundaries of the sports facility compound. With every pounding step echoing on the concrete pavement, John physically and mentally navigated this foreign and intimidating world. He realized how valuable it was to gain experience beyond the comfort of his familiar track. Over time, he knew that he would gain adaptability and versatility in both his training and his mindset. As John continued to venture on his walks in the streets, he began to understand that there was a need for the adaptation and integration of experiences from the short track and the grander scope of life. It was a lesson in resilience, adaptability, and personal progression. With each breath, John learned to embrace the challenges and unpredictability of the streets, slowly building his confidence and welcoming the change that his running journey had taken. In the end, the distinct qualities of both the short track and the bustling streets offered John invaluable lessons. The confinement of the track allowed him to build a strong foundation and discipline, and the streets brought him face to face with the complexity of life. The amalgamation of these experiences shaped him into a resilient and well-rounded individual, both on and off the track."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .","output":"The phrase \\"maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral\\" can be considered negative for several reasons. We can break down the phrase into two parts – \\"maladjusted teens\\" and \\"downward narcotized spiral\\" – to better understand the implications behind these words and why the overall sentiment is negative. 1. Maladjusted teens:  \\"Maladjusted\\" refers to someone who is unable or unwilling to adjust to or cope with a particular situation in a healthy or appropriate manner. In this case, it is applied to \\"teens.\\" Adolescence is a crucial time for identity formation, socialization, and emotional growth. Being maladjusted implies that the teenagers in question are struggling to deal with the challenges of adolescence, which is not a positive situation. Such struggles can lead to various emotional, social, and psychological challenges, negatively affecting their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being. 2. Downward narcotized spiral: This part of the phrase concerns drug addiction or substance abuse. \\"Narcotized\\" refers to being under the influence of a narcotic substance, while \\"downward spiral\\" describes a steadily worsening situation that may be difficult to escape or reverse. Combining these terms, the \\"downward narcotized spiral\\" indicates a vicious cycle of escalating drug use and its deteriorating consequences on the teens' lives. This has numerous negative implications, such as: - Health issues: The use of narcotic substances can cause severe short and long-term health problems, including dependence, addiction, and even fatal overdose. - Emotional and psychological consequences: Drug abuse can lead to emotional disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Moreover, it can exacerbate pre-existing mental health problems. - Social and interpersonal struggles: Substance abuse often causes conflicts in relationships, leading to isolation, damaged friendships, and strained family interactions. - Educational and career disruption: Maladjusted teenagers who are caught in a downward narcotized spiral may struggle academically, lowering their chances of achieving educational and career goals. - Legal problems: Engaging in illegal drug use is against the law, and may lead to legal consequences, further exacerbating the negative situation. In conclusion, the phrase \\"maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral\\" is decidedly negative, touching upon issues related to emotional and social struggles, substance abuse, and their detrimental effects on adolescents' lives. This description paints a concerning picture of teenagers who may require support and intervention to overcome these challenges and break free from a potentially damaging and dangerous cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The formation of natural gas is a complex process that involves multiple factors and reactions, and the primary components that get transformed into natural gas are dead organic materials, primarily from plants and microscopic organisms, rather than oxygen. The formation of natural gas occurs over millions of years through a process called diagenesis and catagenesis. During this process, heat and pressure transform decaying organic materials into hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Oxygen is not the primary element that gets transformed into natural gas – instead, the organic materials are mainly composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and smaller amounts of sulfur and other trace elements. The misconception that heat and pressure transform the remains of dinosaurs into natural gas may stem from the fact that natural gas is sometimes inaccurately referred to as a \\"fossil fuel\\" in general terms. In actuality, oil and coal are primarily derived from remains of plants and ancient microscopic marine organisms rather than dinosaurs. As the dead organic material accumulates and gets buried beneath layers of sediment, heat and pressure cause it to undergo chemical and physical changes. In the early stages of diagenesis, the organic material turns into a waxy substance called kerogen through the loss of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. As heat and pressure continue to increase during catagenesis, the kerogen transforms into liquid hydrocarbons (crude oil) and subsequently into gaseous hydrocarbons (natural gas). Therefore, the right answer to the question \\"what gets changed into natural gas due to heat and pressure?\\" is the organic material from dead plants and microscopic organisms, rather than oxygen. The heat and pressure acting on these organic materials create a series of chemical and physical transformations leading to the formation of natural gas, which mainly consists of hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. The process also involves some reduction of oxygen content, but oxygen in itself does not get transformed into natural gas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages.  Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing? Answer:","output":"Tim learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing. This is because he focused on the Greenhouse Effect, which is primarily about the way certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat and warm the planet. While greenhouse gases do contribute to the trapping of terrestrial radiation, and thus to global warming, Tim's focus was more on the overall mechanism and consequences of the Greenhouse Effect. On the other hand, Norm read about mini-Ice Ages, which occur when the Earth experiences periods of significantly cooler temperatures mainly due to decreased solar activity and natural climate variability. During mini-Ice Ages, less terrestrial radiation is trapped, and the planet cools down, leading to a reduction in global temperatures and a temporary decline in the overall rate of global warming. Since Norm's focus was on these colder periods, he would have learned more about the reduction of trapped terrestrial radiation in relation to the Earth's cooling. In summary, Tim learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing, as he focused on the Greenhouse Effect, whereas Norm's focus on mini-Ice Ages would have provided him with more information about the reduction of trapped terrestrial radiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ranveer Singh Bhavnani (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. Singh was born on 6 July 1985 into a Sindhi family in Mumbai, to Anju and Jagjit Singh Bhavnani. His grandparents, Sunder Singh Bhavnani and Chand Burke, moved to Mumbai from Karachi, Sindh, (present-day Pakistan) during the Partition of India. He has an elder sister named Ritika Bhavnani. Singh is the maternal cousin of actress Sonam Kapoor and producer Rhea Kapoor, daughters of actor Anil Kapoor and wife Sunita Kapoor (nee Bhavnani). Singh explains that he dropped his surname Bhavnani, since he felt that the name would have been \\"too long, too many syllables\\", thus downplaying his brand as a \\"saleable commodity\\".  Singh always aspired to be an actor, participating in several school plays and debates. Once when he had gone for a birthday party, his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her. Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song \\"Chumma Chumma\\" from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting a break in the film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was \\"too far-fetched\\", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University.  At the university, he decided to take acting classes and took up theatre as his minor. After completing his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O&M and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He then decided to send his portfolio to directors. He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: \\"Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating. There were times I would think whether I was doing the right thing or not.\\" Entity:","output":"The text is about Ranveer Singh Bhavnani, an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer:  an air hose  for the following movie plot:  German U-boat U-571 is immobilized by a British destroyer.

This presented a significant challenge to Rachel, as she relied heavily on public transportation and ride-sharing services for her daily travels and errands. However, in this particular situation, Rachel's usual options were not viable due to a variety of unforeseen circumstances. Firstly, the public transportation system was experiencing delays and service disruptions because of ongoing maintenance work. This made it difficult for Rachel to plan her trip around bus or train schedules and to guarantee that she would be able to reach the store in a timely manner. Not only were there delays, but her closest bus stop was temporarily closed, forcing her to walk several blocks to an alternative stop, further complicating her journey. Secondly, the use of ride-sharing services, like Uber and Lyft, was not a practical option for Rachel at that time. She had recently lost her smartphone and was unable to access the apps needed to request a ride. Moreover, due to a sudden surge in demand, the prices for these services had skyrocketed, putting them well beyond her budget. Faced with these challenges, Rachel called upon her friend Elena for assistance. Elena had access to a personal vehicle, providing her with the flexibility and mobility that Rachel lacked. Furthermore, Elena was familiar with the area and knew the location of the store where Rachel's medication was available, making her a perfect candidate for the task. Recognizing the urgency and importance of her friend's situation, Elena graciously agreed to help Rachel obtain her medication. She stopped by the store on her way home from work, ensuring that she could complete the errand efficiently and without delay. Elena's help proved to be an invaluable resource for Rachel during this time of need, as it allowed her to overcome the various obstacles that were preventing her from getting the medication herself. In summary, Rachel needed Elena to pick up a medication at the store because she didn't have a car. With multiple inconveniences in public transportation and ride-sharing services, combined with her own limitations, Rachel was in a difficult situation.

A government spokesman said that there were no substantial grounds for believing that the claimants would face danger in their home countries. The group, who are also seeking asylum in Canada, have 14 days to appeal. The asylum-seekers - a Sri Lankan couple with two children, a Sri Lankan man and a Filipino mother with a daughter - were introduced to Edward Snowden by their lawyer, Robert Tibbo. He brought him to their homes in 2013 just after the former National Security Agency contractor revealed he had leaked classified information to the press revealing widespread US government surveillance. The identity of the group, who sheltered him for about two weeks, only became public shortly before the release of an Oliver Stone film about the whistleblower. \\"We now have less than two weeks to submit appeals before the families are deported,\\" Mr Tibbo said, calling the decision \\"completely unreasonable\\". There are currently 8,956 asylum seekers in Hong Kong awaiting a decision on their case, according to the Immigration Department. But the territory only recognised 72 people as refugees between 2009 and December 2016, the South China Morning Post reported in February. Most spend years in limbo waiting for the government - which is not a signatory to the UN refugee convention, but considers claims for protection on the grounds that those sent home could be tortured - to process their case. The lawyers for the asylum seekers believe they are being treated unfairly by the Hong Kong government. The proof? They say the four adults all arrived in Hong Kong at different times, submitted their applications separately and made different claims. Their asylum cases had little in common. Instead what unites them is that they all fed and sheltered Edward Snowden. Their main lawyer, Robert Tibbo, told me the fact that all the cases were activated and decided at the same time suggested his clients were singled out because of their relationship with Mr Snowden. Another one of their lawyers, Marc-Andre Sequin, said their cases had been expedited because their plight had drawn attention to the \\"embarrassing\\" way in which Hong Kong treated asylum seekers. A spokesman for the Hong Kong government denied these accusations. Marc-Andre Seguin, a Canadian lawyer representing the group in their Canadian application, told RTHK that \\"clearly there is targeting here and our clients have reason for concern\\". Two of the Sri Lankan refugees say they are being illegally pursued by police from their own country who travelled to Hong Kong in late 2016. Sri Lankan police have denied the allegations. In a statement, the government spokesman said claims the Immigration Department targeted \\"any particular claimants or categories of claimants is unfounded and not true\\". \\"All claims are screened under the same procedures and requirements, and ImmD [the Immigration Department] has all along been handling each non-refoulement claim professionally in a fair, impartial and efficient manner.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Asylum-seekers from Sri Lanka and the Philippines, who sheltered whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong, have had their asylum claims rejected by the local government.

Foreign service agents and their close family members may choose to receive language training to help with their social integration in foreign countries before departing from Canada. This form of training can be highly beneficial for both the agents and their relatives, as it equips them with the necessary skills to communicate effectively and adapt to the new environment more easily.  When assigned to a post abroad, foreign service agents often encounter different languages, cultures, and customs. In order to ensure a smooth transition and integration into their host country, it is crucial to have a good understanding and grasp of the local language. This knowledge enables them to communicate with locals, form social connections, and develop a better understanding of the cultural nuances in the country they are assigned to. In addition to language training, foreign service agents may also receive cultural awareness training, which can provide valuable insights into the host country's customs, values, and social norms. By being aware of these customs and practices, the agent and their family members can navigate the social landscape more effectively, avoiding potential misunderstandings or cultural faux pas. For family members accompanying foreign service agents, these language courses can be particularly beneficial.

Life is hard,whether we want it to be or not. What we need to do is try our best to make our roots reach deep into the brave heart,so when the rain falls and the wind blows,we could face them strongly and won't be beaten down. Question: Why did Dr Gibbs treat his trees in that way? Options: A: Because he wanted to make them grow better. B: Because he wanted to work off his anger. C: Because he didn't care about them at all. D: Because he wanted to make experiments on them.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences.

Aunque a veces es posible utilizar cristales de metales o minerales inorgánicos formados por medios naturales, a menudo es necesario prepararlos mediante recristalización o precipitación del material en una solución líquida sobresaturada en condiciones controladas de concentración y temperatura. En el método de cristalización por difusión de vapor, la solución que contiene el material a cristalizar junto con un precipitante alcanza un estado de equilibrio termodinámico con otra solución más concentrada del precipitante, por difusión del disolvente hacia esta a través del aire; esta técnica se usa tanto para moléculas de pocos átomos como para proteínas y otras macromoléculas. Un segundo método es la cristalización en geles, muy útil para cristalizar materiales insolubles; esta técnica, lenta comparada con la difusión de vapor, consiste en la introducción de un reactante en un gel antes de que este se endurezca. Posteriormente se introduce otra solución de un segundo reactante en la capa superior del gel, desde donde se difunde al resto de la matriz y reacciona con la primera sustancia para dar lugar a cristales.

There may be no motion in stagnant areas; for example, in parts of Alaska, trees can establish themselves on surface sediment deposits. In other cases, glaciers can move as fast as 20–30 m (70–100 ft) per day, such as in Greenland's Jakobshavn Isbræ (Greenlandic: Sermeq Kujalleq). Velocity increases with increasing slope, increasing thickness, increasing snowfall, increasing longitudinal confinement, increasing basal temperature, increasing meltwater production and reduced bed hardness. What makes some glaciers stagnant? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Some glaciers become stagnant due to a combination of factors that reduce their movement. These factors can include: 1. Lack of slope: Glaciers move more quickly when on a steeper incline, as the force of gravity pulls the ice downhill. In flatter areas, the force of gravity is less effective at causing movement, leading to stagnation. 2. Decreasing thickness: Thinner glaciers exert less pressure on their base, which can result in less basal sliding motion. As a glacier thins over time, its movement may slow down and eventually become stagnant. 3. Low snowfall: Glaciers accumulate mass from snowfall, which then compacts into ice and drives glacier movement. In areas where snowfall is limited, there may be insufficient mass accumulation to cause significant motion. 4. Limited longitudinal confinement: Glaciers are more likely to move faster when they are confined within narrow valleys, as this confinement can help to channel the ice flow. In wider, more open areas, this channeling effect is reduced, which can lead to slower-moving or stagnant glaciers. 5. Low basal temperature: If the temperature at the base of a glacier is too low, the ice may become frozen to the underlying bedrock, preventing any sliding movement. This can result in a stagnant glacier, even if other conditions are favorable for movement. 6. Decreased meltwater production: Meltwater is an essential lubricant for glacier movement. When there is less meltwater available, the sliding motion of a glacier may be impeded, leading to stagnation. 7. Bed hardness: If the underlying bedrock or till is particularly hard, it can provide greater resistance to the glacier's movement, slowing it down or even causing it to become stagnant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Dealing with crickets in your yard can be important to minimize damage to plants and mitigate the noise they create. Accomplishing this goal involves a multi-faceted approach focused on habitat modification, natural predators, barriers to entry, and, if necessary, chemical control. Below are several effective steps to take in dealing with crickets in your yard. 1. Habitat modification: Crickets thrive in damp, dark, and cluttered areas. By eliminating their preferred habitat, you can make your yard less attractive to them.    a. Remove debris such as leaf piles, wood piles, and heaps of yard trimmings.    b. Keep the grass cut short and well-maintained. This will expose the crickets to their natural predators.    c. Limit the amount of standing water in your yard by fixing leaky faucets and ensuring proper drainage.    d. Trim shrubs, branches, and other vegetation near your home to allow sunlight to penetrate and reduce hiding places for crickets. 2. Natural predators: Encouraging the presence of natural predators in your yard can help reduce the cricket population by providing a natural form of pest control.    a. Attract birds to your yard by installing bird feeders, birdhouses, and birdbaths. Many bird species feed on crickets.    b. Provide habitat for reptiles, particularly lizards and frogs, which are known to eat crickets. Construct small rock piles, logs, or other sheltering places for them.    c. Encourage beneficial insects, such as spiders and ground beetles, which also feed on crickets. Planting a variety of native plants can help attract these helpful insects. 3. Barriers to entry: Preventing crickets from entering your home is an effective way to mitigate damage and annoyance.     a. Seal gaps, cracks, and openings around your foundation, windows, and doors with caulk or another appropriate sealant.    b. Install window screens, door sweeps, and weatherstripping to further block entry points.    c. Outdoor lighting can attract crickets at night. Switch to yellow or sodium vapor bulbs to reduce cricket attraction. 4. Traps: Using traps can help decrease the cricket population in your yard.    a. Create homemade traps by filling shallow dishes or jars with a mix of water and molasses or sugar to attract the crickets. Place these traps around the area with high cricket activity.    b. Use store-bought cricket traps or sticky traps, placed in prime cricket locations. 5. Chemical control: In severe cases, you may need to resort to chemical control to deal with crickets in your yard.    a. Apply insecticides labeled for cricket control, such as carbaryl, permethrin, or cyfluthrin, following the instructions on the product label. It's best to target areas where crickets are breeding or hiding, rather than indiscriminate spraying.    b. Use bait containing insecticides, placing it in areas with high cricket activity. Follow the provided instructions to use these products safely and effectively. By employing a combination of these strategies, you can effectively deal with crickets in your yard and create a more pleasant and peaceful outdoor environment. Don't forget to monitor your yard regularly to ensure that cricket populations remain under control."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Critical analysis of Beiderbecke's work during his lifetime was sparse. Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine \\"Melody Maker\\" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: \\"Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time\\". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: \\"Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays\\" (September 1927 issue); \\"The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet….\\" In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution. Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: \\"His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.\\" In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician.  In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet\\", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with...

The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival.  \\"I had to stop listening to them for a while,\\" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view \\"had a negative effect on me,\\" and made him irritable and angry.  \\"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\\" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles.  Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him.  Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said.

Aboard a US Navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance plane, CNN got a view from 16,500 feet of low-lying coral reefs turned into garrisons with five-story buildings, large radar installations, power plants and runways sturdy enough to carry large military aircraft.      During the flight the crew received six separate warnings from the Chinese military, telling them they were inside Chinese territory and urging them to leave.      \\"Leave immediately and keep out to avoid any misunderstanding,\\" a voice said.      The US Navy jet flew past four key artificial islands in the Spratly chain where China has built up fortifications: Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Johnson Reef and Mischief Reef.      On Subi Reef, the Poseidon's sensors picked up 86 vessels, including Chinese coast guard ships, moored in a giant lagoon, while on Fiery Cross Reef rows of hangers stood alongside a lengthy runway.      \\"It was surprising to see airports in the middle of the ocean,\\" said Lt. Lauren Callen, who was leading the air combat crew aboard the Navy flight.      Each time the aircraft was challenged by Chinese military, the US Navy crew's response was the same.      \\"I am a sovereign immune United States naval aircraft conducting lawful military activities beyond the national airspace of any coastal state,\\" the response said.      \\"In exercising these rights guaranteed by international law, I am operating with due regard for the rights and duties of all states.\\"      CNN has reached out to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.      CNN gets rare access on board a US military surveillance flight over the hotly-disputed islands in the South China Sea.      Competing claims      The Chinese government staunchly maintains large areas of the South China Sea have been part of the country's territory \\"since ancient times.\\"      Beijing's \\"nine-dash line\\" extends more than one thousand kilometers from its southernmost province, taking in more or less the entirety of the waters, through which the United Nations estimates one-third of global shipping passes.      The South China Sea is also believed to contain rich oil and natural gas reserves that have yet to be fully explored.      Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei all claim overlapping portions of the sea which spans 3.6 million square kilometer (1.4 million square miles), but the most far-reaching claims have been made by China.      Beijing's sovereignty claims are considered by most other countries as unsubstantiated, a view backed by an international tribunal in 2016.      Despite this however, little has changed in China's approach to the region in recent years.      To reinforce its claims of sovereignty, Beijing has been reclaiming land on and around reefs and shoals to construct artificial islands which are then militarized with airfields and radar equipment.      China has spent much of the past two years fortifying these islands, including placing missiles on the Spratly island chain during naval exercises in April.      This is despite a promise made by President Xi Jinping to then-US President Barack Obama in 2015 that the Chinese government would not be militarizing the artificial islands.      The US Navy's P8-A Poseidon plane which carried a CNN crew from Okinawa, Japan, over the South China Sea on August 10.      Rapid expansion      The last time CNN was given access to a US Navy mission over the South China Sea was in September 2015, when the aircraft was also warned off by Chinese military.      Since then, Beijing's island building in the contested waters has moved forward at a rapid pace.      Flying over Fiery Cross Reef on Friday, a five-story building was visible, as well as a large radar installation, which looked like neatly arranged golf balls on the Navy plane's infrared camera.      Though no Chinese missiles were seen on Friday's flight over the South China Sea, Navy officers said some of the structures seen could potentially be used to house them.      Cmdr. Chris Purcell, who leads Patrol Squadron Four which undertook Friday's mission, said the US has been doing these flights for five decades and they show US commitment to maintaining free passage in international waters.      \\"The reason we're here hasn't changed,\\" Purcell said. \\"The reason (the Chinese) are here has changed.\\"      Within hours of the trip, Chinese state tabloid Global Times posted a reaction to CNN's report on its Chinese-language website. The article called for all readers to \\"give a thumbs-up to Chinese servicemen\\" for their defense of China's territory.      China claims US sparking militarization      Beijing says its growing military presence in the South China Sea is necessary to protect its sovereignty, blaming Washington and its allies for tensions in the region.      Chinese military exercises in April included the largest naval parade in the country's history, with President Xi Jinping overseeing drills that included 10,000 troops, 48 naval vessels and 76 fighter jets.      Beijing points to the regular US Navy patrols and flyovers of the South China Sea as an example of US militarization and provocations, and a justification for the increased Chinese military presence.      \\"By playing up the so-called China's militarization in the South China Sea, certain people in the US are staging a farce of a thief crying \\"stop thief\\",\\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in May . \\"It is self-evident to a keener eye that who is militarizing the South China Sea.\\"      In the past year, the US has stepped up freedom of navigation operations in the region, sailing US naval vessels within miles of China's artificial islands across the South China Sea.      The exercises , which the US also conducts in other parts of the world, assert the navy's right to travel wherever it pleases in international waters, a vital component of Washington's naval power across the world.      Time may be running out to effectively challenge China's claims in the South China Sea however.      Adm. Philip Davidson, the recently installed head of the US Pacific Command, told Senators during a confirmation hearing in April that China is already very firmly entrenched.      \\"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,\\" Davidson said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The article discusses increased tensions over the militarization of the South China Sea, in particular China's rapid expansion on the islands such as the Spratly chain. Despite international concern and an international tribunal ruling against China's territorial claims to the sea, China has continued to assert its sovereignty with artificial land construction and militarization, including placing missiles on the Spratly island chain during naval exercises. The US, on a navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance flight recently, has challenged this by maintaining their right of free passage in international waters, even as the Chinese military warned them off their territory. The article also highlights that the South China Sea is significant for its believed reserves of oil and natural gas and significant shipping traffic. Other countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei also lay claim to overlapping parts of the sea, but China's assertions have been the most extensive."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.  I am facing a new situation today: Two friends were in college. Hank studied plate tectonics, while his buddy Alex studied Earth's atmosphere. They were both very fascinated by the subjects.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student learned more about mantle convection? Answer:","output":"Hank learned more about mantle convection, as he studied plate tectonics which directly involves the process of mantle convection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Given the below context:  The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.  Guess a valid title for it!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: It is important to keep a balance between staying in touch with home and working to establish a new community where you are. Strike up conversations with people who seem interesting. This might be someone in your dorm or someone in one of your classes.  The first few days or weeks of college, summer camp, or studying abroad can be a great opportunity to make friends. Take advantage of situations where you're not the only new person around. If you're studying or working in a different country, try a local consulate, expatriate society, or university international society to find other people who are sharing your experience of being away from home. Talking about feelings of unhappiness with people who are sharing your experiences can be helpful.  Think about taking up a hobby or joining a club. Or, you can volunteer with a local nonprofit organization. These are great ways to find people with common interests. Keeping yourself in your past home or place may keep you from accomplishing goals in your new place or establishing new connections and friendships. Sometimes when we are away from home, our daily routine and even habits might change.  This type of change makes the new environment seem even more foreign. To help prevent large changes like this, try to continue some of your familiar habits, even in your new place. For instance, if you have moved away for college and are missing Taco Tuesday nights with your family, try to implement a new Taco Tuesday with your dorm roommates or new group of friends. Or if you are away on summer camp and you do certain things to prepare for bed every night, try to continue this routine. These type of routines often offer structure and familiarity, so try to add some of these into your new environment. Step outside with your camera or smart phone. A camera can be a great way to see your new location in a new light. By keeping your mind active and focused on your new surroundings, you can turn your attention away from homesickness. It's also a great way to document your experiences while away from home. To get the most out of your experience, particularly if you're living abroad, break out of your comfortable cocoon and try new things.  For example, try new foods. Food can often be the most defining element of a culture. Trying the local foods and finding something that the natives eat that you also enjoy can go a long way towards making you feel comfortable in a new place. Go to cultural events. Even if you are away at college in a different state, you can still sample the different cultural events that you might not get in your hometown. Culture shock involves feelings of confusion, doubt, or nervousness caused by being in a new place. This can be especially hard for people living in a new country, but it can also happen if someone moves away to college in a city from a rural area. The trick is not to let it get the better of you. In particular, if you're living abroad, try these strategies to help overcome culture shock:  Learn the rules of living in your host country. Try to understand how and why the local people act the way they do. Their behavior and customs may be different from your own, but they are probably typical for the area. Take time to learn the language. It always helps to understand as much as possible of what people are saying. They will appreciate your effort to communicate with them in their language, even if it is just a few simple phrases, and it will make your daily life much easier. Approach the experience with a positive attitude and an open mind.  Approaching your experience as an adventure is likely to help you have a good experience.","output":"It's important to find a balance between staying connected to home and making new friends when you're away.

TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Dancing in public is not allowed in Iran, but thousands could hardly contain themselves at a recent presidential campaign rally in the capital city, Tehran. Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady. On this day, the deafening cheers were not for presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi, but rather for his wife -- a woman some are calling Iran's Michelle Obama. The comparisons to the first lady of the United States stem from the role Zahra Rahnavard is playing in her husband's quest for the presidency. Never in the history of Iranian presidential elections has a candidate put his wife in the forefront of his campaign. The overwhelming majority were young voters, many of whom said they attended because of","output":"Rahnavard. As an accomplished academic, artist, and former chancellor of Alzahra University, she inspired the youth with her message of hope, change, and empowerment. The bold move by Mousavi to include his wife in campaigning highlighted a shift in Iranian politics, recognizing the significant role of women in the society and their potential contributions to the country's future. In the weeks leading up to the election, the momentum surrounding Mousavi and Rahnavard's campaign grew exponentially. Women, in particular, felt more included in the political process than ever before and were determined to make their voices heard. They organized rallies, went door-to-door to distribute campaign materials, and engaged in conversations about the future of Iran with their families and friends. Mousavi's approval rating climbed he was considered the front-runner by election day. As the election results started coming in, it became clear that Mousavi had secured a massive victory. Celebrations erupted across the country, with people taking to the streets to rejoice in the triumph of democracy. For the first time, Iran had elected a President who prioritized inclusivity, equal rights for women, and building stronger international relations. During their time in office, President Mousavi and First Lady Zahra Rahnavard successfully implemented progressive reforms in the fields of education, healthcare, and the economy. They addressed the high rate of inflation, which had plagued Iran for years, by introducing effective fiscal policies. Thanks to their efforts, the Iranian economy eventually stabilized and experienced a period of remarkable growth. The Mousavi administration also focused on restoring Iran's global reputation, engaging in diplomatic talks with Western countries and fostering new alliances. As their foreign policy shifted, economic sanctions were lifted, paving the way for positive international relations and cooperation. Rahnavard continued to play a crucial role during her husband's presidency, actively promoting gender equality and women's rights. She established pioneering initiatives to eliminate gender-based discrimination in the workplace and educational institutions and worked tirelessly to ensure women had equitable access to opportunities in all spheres of life. The impact of President Mousavi's and Zahra Rahnavard's leadership improved the lives of millions and significantly changed the political landscape in Iran. Their eight-year tenure marked a new chapter in the country's history – one in which tolerance, unity, and progress became the guiding principles of governance. As their term came to an end, the Iranian people cast their ballots to elect a successor. Taking cues from Mousavi's and Rahnavard's successful approach, many of the candidates featured their spouses in the campaigns, addressing pressing issues like climate change, technology advancements, and income inequality. The legacy left behind by Mousavi and Rahnavard paved the way for the subsequent generation of inspired Iranian leaders. The country progressed in areas of civil rights, education, and international relations. Many credit their visionary leadership coupled with the strength and perseverance of the Iranian people for this success. In the years that followed, Iran’s political landscape evolved, and it became increasingly common for female candidates to run for office, breaking the previous barriers set in the male-dominated political sphere. Zahra Rahnavard, often referred to as \\"Iran's Michelle Obama,\\" remains an enduring symbol of women's empowerment and change for millions in Iran and across the globe.

Article: I have been a special education teacher for 17 years and I wish more people would get into special education.The position is very demanding and there is always a shortage of special education teachers.It is not an easy profession to get into. One needs a BA in education and then a special education certificate  such as a certificate in learning disabilities, emotional disabilities or cross categories which means covering all the subjects.A certified new special educate teacher needs to _ a current special education teacher for at least, a year because there is that much to know and practice. Working with the students is the biggest reward.However, the paperwork is huge with  requesting more year after year.If you are good at doing about ten things at the same time, then you may be the right person for the job. No day is the same. Parent and government expectations are high. A sense of empathy(the ability of feeling and sharing another person's feelings) and one hundred percent prepared to help your students is important. Also, if you are a special education teacher working in the high school, it is your job to make sure your special education students are able to be employed after they graduate, and then the special education teacher needs to stay in touch with the special students a year after they graduate to make sure they are employed and can support themselves. Education is a very political field next to working in politics. One needs to know what to say, when to say it and make sure it is a benefit for everyone involved. It is a mixture of knowing medical diagnosis and teaching with that in mind. Your record needs to be perfect, and it would also help to be a very strong Christian because you will need to pray often to yourself. This position is not about the money but more of a service.

The two groups have long worked together and foreigners are known to fight alongside Somali militants. The announcement comes as al-Shabab is under pressure on several fronts. Is al-Shabab on the back foot?Profile: Ayman al-ZawahiriQ&A: Who are al-Shabab?'Lifeline' US-Somalia remittances on hold Africa Union troops supporting the forces of the UN-backed government have taken control of the capital, Mogadishu, while both Kenya and Ethiopia have sent forces into Somalia to push back the Islamists. Al-Shabab, however, still controls many southern and central areas of the country. However, correspondents say al-Shabab's policy of banning many foreign aid agencies from areas it controls during the region's worst drought in 60 years has lost the group some of its popular support. The United Nations says that although the famine in Somalia is officially over, a third of the population still needs urgent feeding. BBC Somali editor Yusuf Garaad Omar says the merger of al-Shabab and al-Qaeda has the potential to change the dynamics of the conflict in Somalia. During the 15-minute Arabic-language video posted on jihadist websites, Zawahiri said the move was \\"good news\\" for al-Qaeda. Analysts say the announcement helps boost al-Qaeda after its leader Osama Bin Laden was killed last year. \\"Al-Qaeda needs to project power and influence, particularly given its own operational impotence,\\" Australian analyst Leah Farrall told Reuters news agency. \\"Al-Shabab's acceptance under the al-Qaeda umbrella probably came with permission from Zawahiri for the group to launch external operations against the West.\\" This week, the London-based Royal United Services Institute think-tank warned that about 50 Britons were training with al-Shabab and could return to attack the UK. Last week, William Hague was also in Mogadishu, the first visit by a British foreign secretary in 20 years. The UK government is holding a conference in London on 23 February to try to find a political solution to Somalia's problems, and tackle piracy and extremism. Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991 and since then, has been convulsed by conflict. What was that article about?","output":"The article primarily discusses the alliance of Al-Shabab, a Somali extremist group, with Al-Qaeda, an international terrorist organization.  Al-Shabab, being under pressure as it tries to maintain control in Somalia, has been weakened due to various causes. Provision of aid has been cut off by them to those regions they control, gaining the group some antipathy among the locals. This strategic policy error is especially notable given that these regions are currently grappling with the impacts of the worst drought the area has faced in six decades. The UN has declared the famine in Somalia to be officially over, but still sees an urgent need for local population aid. Africa Union troops along with the forces of the UN-backed government have taken control over the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and both Kenya and Ethiopia have sent their forces into Somalia in an attempt to push back the Islamist group. However, Al-Shabab still has authority over many central and southern parts of the country.  The acceptance of Al-Shabab by Al-Qaeda has provided the latter with a significant strategic boost, particularly after the death of its former leader, Osama Bin Laden. This announcement of obedience by Ahmed Abdi Godane (Mukhtar Abu Zubair), the Al-Shabab leader, has thrust Al-Qaeda back into relevance and allowed it to project its influence by permitting Al-Shabab to instigate external operations against the West.  The article also includes the warning from the Royal United Services Institute that around 50 Britons who are currently training with Al-Shabab could potentially inflict harm upon returning to the UK. In this scenario, Britain appears to be taking proactive steps, as evident from the recent visit of British foreign secretary William Hague to Mogadishu, the first in 20 years. The UK government is expected to hold a conference in London in an effort to find a political solution to the issues plaguing Somalia, particularly piracy and extremism.  Overall, the socio-political landscape of Somalia, devoid of a central governing authority since 1991, continues to be chaotic and characterized by conflict, with this recent alliance of Al-Shabab and Al-Qaeda adding a new dynamic to the ongoing unrest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They tend to be drawn to intimacy, so they may dislike a rowdy bar as a date setting. Opt for a smaller, intimate location where it is easy to converse.  For example, book a corner table in a tiny, romantic restaurant. You can also try a first date at a quiet coffee shop. If you go out to a bar, make sure it's quiet. Bars with loud music and huge crowds are unlikely to win a cancer woman's favor. Some think Cancer women love traveling. A good way to plan a date is planning short trips. Take her away for the weekend on occasion to somewhere she has never been before. A Cancer woman will appreciate this gesture.  You do not need to spend a fortune on a trip. A day trip to a nearby city can be a great way to spend a Saturday with a Cancer woman. Remember that Cancer women prefer intimate settings. When planning activities for a day trip, look for locations that are quiet and low-key over loud bars and crowded restaurants. Some think Cancer women prefer it if their partner makes the first move. They are unlikely to initiate physical contact or the first kiss. If a cancer woman seems engaged with you, try brushing her hand, touching her arm, or leaning in for a kiss. If you're planning something like a birthday party for a Cancer woman, smaller is generally better. Cancer women have a few close relationships and prefer to spend time with small groups of people. Gather a Cancer woman's close friends for events rather than inviting, say, everyone from her office or casual acquaintances from school.  You can, for example, have a birthday party for your Cancer woman in your home. Invite a few of her closest friends and plan low-key activities like board games. If you take a Cancer woman out for her birthday, invite only a handful of friends and choose a quiet location. Those who believe in astrology find Cancer women appreciate sincerity in a partner more than their career, material possessions, or education. Romantic gestures should come from a place of sincerity. Rather than trying to impress her with an expensive date night, go for something personal for her. For example, you don't have to spend a lot of money on a fancy restaurant. Instead, plan an intimate picnic lunch in area that's personally meaningful for you, like the park where you first met. Summary:","output":"Cancer women are believed to prefer intimate and quiet settings over rowdy and crowded places. When planning a date, avoid loud bars and choose a cozy restaurant or coffee shop. Short trips and weekend getaways are also appreciated by Cancer women, as they love traveling and exploring new places. When it comes to making the first move, it is suggested that a partner should initiate physical contact as Cancer women may be hesitant to do so themselves. For events like birthday parties, opt for smaller gatherings with close friends and low-key activities. Sincerity matters more to Cancer women than material possessions or status.

A:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"fossil fuels are burned in many what?\\" is not \\"fuel cells\\" if we consider that many engines burn fossil fuels. The more appropriate answer would be \\"internal combustion engines\\" or simply \\"engines.\\" Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is asking about where fossil fuels are burned.  Step 2: Identify the difference between fuel cells and engines Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing water as a byproduct. They do not involve the direct burning of any fuels.  Internal combustion engines, on the other hand, burn fossil fuels like gasoline, diesel, or natural gas to generate motion through a series of controlled explosions. Step 3: Justify the answer Since the question focuses on the burning of fossil fuels, which primarily occurs in internal combustion engines, the appropriate answer should be \\"internal combustion engines\\" or simply \\"engines\\" instead of \\"fuel cells.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling.

Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather than his father was Merneptah. If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah.   - A sarcophagus (plural, sarcophagi) is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word \\"sarcophagus\\" comes from the Greek \\"sarx\\" meaning \\"flesh\\", and \\"phagein\\" meaning \\"to eat\\", hence \\"sarcophagus\\" means \\"flesh-eating\\"; from the phrase \\"lithos sarkophagos\\". Since \\"lithos\\" is Greek for \\"stone\\", \\"lithos sarcophagos\\" means, \\"flesh-eating stone\\". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to decompose the flesh of corpses trapped within it.  - Not to be confused with Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses II , and Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses III. The Egyptian prince Amenherkhepshef was the son of Ramesses VI and Queen Nubkhesbed . He lived in the Twentieth dynasty and was buried in the reused sarcophagus of Twosret , in the reused tomb of Chancellor Bay , KV13 , in the Valley of the Kings , on the west bank of the Nile , in Thebes , Egypt .  - Nubkhesbed (Gold and Lapis lazuli) was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 20th dynasty. She was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses VI and mother of Pharaoh Ramesses VII, Princess Iset (God's Wife of Amun) and Princes Amenherkhepshef and Panebenkemyt.  - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO).  - Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt who reigned from 1145 to 1137 BC and a son of Ramesses III by Iset Ta-Hemdjert. His royal tomb, KV9, is located near Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings.  - Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis Ta-Hemdjert, simply called Isis in her tomb, was an Ancient Egyptian queen of the twentieth dynasty; the Great Royal Wife of Ramesses III and the Royal Mother of Ramesses VI.  - Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun Ramesses VII (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the sixth pharaoh of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. He reigned from about 1136 to 1129 BC and was the son of Ramesses VI. Other dates for his reign are 1138-1131 BC. The Turin Accounting Papyrus 1907+1908 is dated to Year 7 III Shemu day 26 of his reign and has been reconstructed to show that 11 full years passed from Year 5 of Ramesses VI to Year 7 of his reign.  - Tomb KV13, located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, was cut and decorated for the burial of the noble Bay of the Nineteenth Dynasty. An ostraca published in the French Egyptological journal BIFAO in 2000 records that Chancellor Bay was executed by pharaoh Siptah. Consequently, Bay was never buried in his tomb. Moreover, no funerary goods were found in the tomb belonging to Bay. It was later reused by Amenherkhepshef and Mentuherkhepsef of the Twentieth Dynasty.

Does \\"Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"Besides new cotton fibers, what type of fibers can be used to make cotton products?\\"","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process.\\" contains the correct answer to the question \\"Besides new cotton fibers, what type of fibers can be used to make cotton products?\\" According to this statement, besides new cotton fibers, recycled or recovered cotton fibers can be used to make cotton products. These recycled or recovered fibers are essentially the waste materials that could have been discarded during various stages of the manufacturing process, such as spinning, weaving, or cutting. Recycling or recovering cotton fibers is an environmentally friendly practice that helps reduce waste and contribute to a more sustainable textile industry. Utilizing these waste materials not only conserves resources but also minimizes the environmental impact of the production process. The use of recycled cotton fibers can help decrease water and energy consumption and reduce the need for harmful chemicals. Moreover, using recycled or recovered cotton in textile production can also provide additional benefits, such as: 1. Cost savings: By reducing the amount of raw materials needed, companies can save money on purchasing new cotton fibers. 2. Unique properties: Recycled cotton fibers can sometimes have unique properties, such as a softer feel or a more textured look, which may be appealing to consumers. 3. Waste reduction: Incorporating recycled cotton fibers into the production process helps divert waste from landfills and contributes to a circular economy, where resources are continuously reused and recycled. 4. Market differentiation: Brands that use recycled or recovered cotton can position themselves as environmentally responsible and cater to eco-conscious consumers, which can provide a competitive advantage in the market. It is important to note that while using recycled or recovered cotton fibers in textile production has numerous advantages, there can be some challenges associated with the process. For example, the quality of the recycled fiber might not be as high as that of new fibers, and there could be some technical hurdles when blending recycled fibers with other materials. However, technological advancements and increased efforts toward sustainable production practices are consistently working towards addressing these challenges and improving the overall quality and usability of recycled cotton fibers in textile products."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why do vectors have components and scalars don't? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available choices: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","output":"Scalars and vectors are two types of physical quantities used in physics and mathematics. Scalars are quantities that have only magnitude, such as mass, temperature, and distance. Vectors, on the other hand, have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity, force, and acceleration. Vectors have components because they have both magnitude and direction. To represent a vector, we need separate components to specify each aspect of its direction and magnitude. These components are usually represented in terms of coordinates, like the x, y, and z coordinates, each corresponding to a specific direction. The need for components stems from the fact that one can break down any vector into its components, which are scalar multiples of unit vectors in the respective directions. On the other hand, scalars have no direction and are only characterized by their magnitude. Because scalars are unidirectional quantities, there is no need for components to describe their behavior, as there's no direction to quantify. Now, coming to the third question: \\"Do those questions have the same meaning? Available choices: [1] no; [2] yes,\\" let's analyze it. The first two questions are about the nature of scalars and vectors, asking for a basic definition, and exploring the reasons why vectors have components while scalars do not.

Firstly, the app's utility is undeniable. This package is pivotal to the Android ecosystem, offering a medley of functions that keeps your device functioning smoothly and connects various Google services. It ensures Google applications like Google Play, Maps, and others are updated and synchronised properly. Its functionality regarding the maintenance of other apps is a standout.  Performance wise, it runs quite nicely in the background without consuming a large portion of system resources. The consistency it brings to my Android device is fairly commendable. However, it has its fair share of shortcomings. Occasionally, the app might cause excessive battery drain, which can be somewhat annoying. Furthermore, the lack of transparency around its operations can be puzzling for some users. It is not always clear what exactly the app is doing or why certain functions are necessary.  Although it can be apparent when it falters (given it affects other applications), it's often unnoticed when it does its job right - a sign of good design but offers little user engagement.

Movie title: A Bittersweet Life Movie plot: Kim Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is a high ranking mobster and enforcer for Kang (Kim Yeong-cheol), a cold and calculating crime boss to whom he is unquestionably loyal. The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Dae-sik (Hwang Jung-min), a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-woo what is perceived to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip â to shadow his young mistress, Hee-soo (Shin Min-ah), whom he fears is having an \\"affair\\" with another man, giving Sun-woo the mandate to kill her (and her paramour) if he manages to discover it. As he performs his duty â following Hee-soo, and escorting her to a music recital one day â he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent. When he does come to discover Hee-soo's lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him and prepares to inform Kang, but his attraction to her causes him to hesitate. He thus spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, earning him Hee-soo's enmity. Meanwhile, Sun-woo continues to be embroiled in personal business with Baek Dae-sik over having beaten up several of his henchmen earlier for overstaying their welcome at the hotel. He is then threatened by one of his enforcers to apologize, but he adamantly refuses, fueled by his frustrations over Hee-soo. As he relaxes in his apartment later one night, he is suddenly kidnapped by Baek's men to be tortured, but before they can do so they receive new orders via phone call and he is abruptly carried off to Kang, who has returned from overseas and has found out about his attempted cover-up of Hee-soo's affair. Kang's men torture him into confessing why he lied until he is left alone to think about his answer. A daring but messy escape follows, after which Sun-woo plans his revenge.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"A Bittersweet Life,\\" Sun-woo (played by Lee Byung-hun) escorts Hee-soo (played by Shin Min-ah) to a music recital one day. He follows her and performs various tasks as assigned by his boss, Kang (played by Kim Yeong-cheol), who suspects Hee-soo of having an affair with another man. Sun-woo's duty is to monitor Hee-soo and determine if she is cheating, with a mandate to kill her and her alleged lover if he confirms the affair. Over the course of his surveillance, Sun-woo begins to be captivated by Hee-soo's beauty and innocence, which prompts him to reflect on his own isolated and empty personal life. When he ultimately discovers the evidence of Hee-soo's affair, Sun-woo struggles with the conflicting emotions his duty and his growing feelings for her evoke. Instead of following through with Kang's orders, Sun-woo spares Hee-soo and her lover's lives under the condition that they cease their relationship. This decision, driven by his attraction to Hee-soo, garners her resentment and sets off a series of events that further intertwine Sun-woo's personal and professional challenges. As Sun-woo navigates the escalating tensions between his mobster affiliation and his relationship with Hee-soo, viewers are presented with a thoughtful exploration of loyalty, human nature, and the consequences of our choices.

In this context, the best answer to the question \\"Why did Remy do this?\\" is option C: feed his guests.  Option C is the most suitable answer because it takes into consideration the shared hunger between Remy and his guests. It implies that Remy's primary goal in cooking the pasta was to provide a meal that would satisfy everyone’s hunger and ensure his guests had a pleasant experience at his home. Additionally, the act of cooking pasta for his guests demonstrates Remy's hospitality and the notion that he prioritizes the well-being of his visitors. Option A - stay hungry - does not adequately answer the question as it contradicts the context provided. Staying hungry would not address the issue at hand, which is the shared hunger between Remy and his guests. To \\"stay hungry\\" would mean that no action was taken to resolve the situation. Option B - cook pasta - while it does represent the action that Remy took and indicates an effort to address the problem, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to why Remy did this. Cooking pasta was a means to an end, but it does not address the intent behind the action, which was to satisfy the hunger of both Remy and his guests and ensure their well-being during their visit.

Specifically, substantial efforts were made against the large ports of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland on the English east coast.  In Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on 9 April 1941, the German Luftflotte 2 deployed 120 bombers in a five-hour attack, dropping 150 tons of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries. This intense bombardment resulted in extensive damage to sewer, rail, docklands, and electric installations, severely disrupting city’s infrastructural framework.  The focus then shifted to Sunderland on 25 April, where once again, Luftflotte 2 orchestrated a bombing raid, with 60 bombers dropping 80 tons of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries. The extensive bombing took a heavy toll on the city, causing significant damage and disruption. Following Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland, a further attack took place on the Clyde, at Greenock, on 6 and 7 May. The geographical spread and intensity of the attacks indicate that these regions were significant strategic targets based on their port status and potential to disrupt English maritime movements and cripple regional industry. Despite the massive scale of damage, these attacks by the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple the industry in these regions. These attacks, therefore, were focused on industrial areas that the Germans considered to be strategic targets in the north of England but failed to achieve their broader military objectives."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member who was upset when a past band member visited the studio and no one initially recognized him?  After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth.

Information:  - Leeches are segmented worms that belong to the phylum Annelida and comprise the subclass Hirudinea. Like the oligochaetes, such as earthworms, leeches share a clitellum and are hermaphrodites. Nevertheless, they differ from the oligochaetes in significant ways. For example, leeches do not have bristles and the external segmentation of their bodies does not correspond with the internal segmentation of their organs. Their bodies are much more solid as the spaces in their coelom are dense with connective tissues. They also have two suckers, one at each end.  - Euhirudinea, the true leeches, are an infraclass of the Hirudinea. These clitellate annelids are of somewhat unclear relationships; namely the relationships of Hirudinea with oligochaetes are in need of revision. It may be that the presumed sister taxon of the Euhirudinea, the Acanthobdellidea, turns out to be more distantly related, as was already the case with the Branchiobdellida. Thus, eventually Euhirudinea might become a junior synonym of Hirudinea.  - The proboscisless leeches, Arhynchobdellida, are classified as an order of the Hirudinea. But leech taxonomy and systematics will eventually be revised in due time, not because there are many uncertainties about their phylogeny, but because the major clades of clitellate annelids - and whether the clitellates are themselves a clade - have not been fully elucidated. For example, the \\"true leeches\\" (Euhirudinea) might actually be synonymous with the Hirudinea, as all other leech-like annelids might not be very closely related to the true leeches.   - Anatomy. Form and function. Depending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from long and wide to long and over wide, but the typical \\"Lumbricus terrestris\\" grows to about long.  - In biology, a hermaphrodite is an organism that has reproductive organs normally associated with both male and female sexes. Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes. In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which either partner can act as the \\"female\\" or \\"male\\". For example, the great majority of tunicates, pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.  - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".  - The Hirudiniformes are one of the currently - accepted suborders of the proboscisless leeches ( Arhynchobdellida ) . Their most well - known member is the European Medical Leech , Hirudo medicinalis , and indeed most of the blood - sucking \`\` worms '' as which leeches are generally perceived belong to this group . In general , though some leeches suck blood , many are predators which hunt small invertebrates . The Arhynchobdellida were formerly divided into two groups , denoted by presence or absence of toothed jaws . But this does not represent a natural division , as has now been determined - the most primitive proboscisless leeches are not found among the jawed blood - sucking forms as was generally believed , but among the jawless predators . \`\` Jawed leeches '' - termed \`\` Gnathobdellae '' or \`\` Gnathobdellida '' - are exclusively found among the Hirudiniformes , but the order contains a number of jawless families as well . The jawed , toothed forms make up the aquatic Hirudidae and the terrestrial Haemadipsidae and Xerobdellidae ( sometimes included in the preceding but worthy of recognition as an independent family ) . These might actually form a clade , which would then be placed at superfamily rank , but it seems that the Hirudidae might rather be close relatives of the carnivorous Haemopidae instead . Many of the most well - known leeches belong to this family , most notably the medical leeches , such as the European species , already mentioned , which is prominent among these . Other medical Hirudiniformes of lesser importance are for example other species of the genus Hirudo , the North American Medical Leech ( Macrobdella decora ) , and the Asian Medical Leech ( Hirudinaria manillensis ) . Among the better - known bloodsucking land leeches are the Indian Leech ( Haemadipsa sylvestris ) and the yamabiru or Japanese Mountain Leech ( Haemadipsa zeylanica ) .  - The clitellum is a thickened glandular and non-segmented section of the body wall near the head in earthworms and leeches, that secretes a viscid sac in which the eggs are deposited. It is present about behind the anterior end of the body (around the 14th, 15th and 16th segments). Its main function is to store the eggs of the worm.  - The coelom (, plural coeloms or coelomata ) (from \\"koîlos\\", hollow, cavity) is the main body cavity in most animals and is positioned inside the body to surround and contain the digestive tract and other organs. In developed animals, it is lined with a mesodermal epithelium. In other animals, such as molluscs, it remains undifferentiated.  - Biological systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time. Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies). Phylogenies have two components, branching order (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms (biogeography).

I have a new situation: Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide  him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids.  But I can use this background: Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases.  What is an answer for this question: Which liquid will have lower viscosity? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, we can deduce the answer step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the relationship between intermolecular forces and viscosity. From the given background, we know that viscosity increases as the strength of intermolecular forces increases. Step 2: Determine the intermolecular forces in the liquids. We are told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Step 3: Apply the relationship between intermolecular forces and viscosity to the liquids. Since liquid A has strong intermolecular forces, it will have a higher viscosity. Conversely, liquid B, with its weak intermolecular forces, will have a lower viscosity. Step 4: Answer the question. Liquid B will have lower viscosity due to its weak intermolecular forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Title: Forgettable... Review: I didn't respond to this self-indulgent, unnecessary, misguided yawn of a film. I can sympathize with the effort to give exposure to the film maker by his student/biographer, but the product was, to me, a dull, almost silly, attempt to present a 'serious' philosophical piece.I can't say anymore, mainly because I'm boring myself with the effort. Answer:","output":"Based on the review provided by the customer, it is evident that they were dissatisfied with the product in question, which seems to be a film. There are various indications within the review that point towards a negative experience and disappointment with the film's content and presentation. Firstly, the customer has titled the review \\"Forgettable,\\" which suggests that the film did not leave a lasting impression, and they found it to be unremarkable and easily forgettable. This is a clear indication of dissatisfaction, as a praiseworthy or satisfying product would typically leave the consumer with positive memories or a favorable impression. Secondly, the customer used strong negative language such as \\"self-indulgent,\\" \\"unnecessary,\\" \\"misguided,\\" and \\"yawn\\" to describe the film. These words express dissatisfaction with the film's execution, as the customer seemed to find it pretentious, boring, and not living up to its intended message. Moreover, the customer makes a specific point about the film being a \\"dull, almost silly, attempt to present a 'serious' philosophical piece.\\" This statement indicates that they felt the film failed to meet its intended goals and did not deliver the thought-provoking experience it set out to achieve. As a result, the product did not meet the customer's expectation, thus leading to dissatisfaction. Finally, the customer's statement, \\"I can't say anymore, mainly because I'm boring myself with the effort,\\" demonstrates that they are so dissatisfied with the film that discussing it further would be a tedious effort. This statement further highlights the customer's disinterest and negative experience with the product. In conclusion, the customer's review of the film clearly exhibits a strong level of dissatisfaction due to its forgettable nature, negative language used to describe the product, criticism of the film's intentions, and the lack of enthusiasm for further discussion. All these factors combined reveal a dissatisfied customer and a less-than-positive experience with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write highlights for this article: Tyler Perry has, for the first time, revealed graphic details about the sexual, physical and emotional abuse he says he suffered as a child. \\"I'm tired of holding this in,\\" Tyler Perry wrote on his Web site, \\"... so I've decided to give some away.\\" Perry recounts in a message posted on his Web site and in an e-mail to fans that a prescreening of the film \\"Precious,\\" due out later this year, dislodged \\"some raw emotions and brought me to some things and places in my life that I needed to deal with but had long forgotten. It brought back memories so strong that I can smell and taste them.\\" Perry is an executive producer of the movie, which tells the tale of Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones, an illiterate, obese 16-year-old girl from Harlem who is emotionally and physically abused. The 40-year-old producer says he can identify with the character, and he recalls a number of incidents from his childhood. Emmitt Perry Sr., a construction worker, uttered profane insults at him and relentlessly beat and belittled him, Perry says. The random, violent beatings were commonplace until Perry was 19, he said. \\"You ... jackass! You got book sense but you ain't got no ... common sense,\\" he quotes his father as saying. \\"I heard this every day of my childhood,\\" says Perry. Attempts to reach Emmitt Perry Sr. for comment were unsuccessful. Tyler Perry was born Emmitt Perry Jr. but changed his name to distance himself from his father. One night when his mother was gone, Perry says, his drunken father \\"got the vacuum cleaner extension cord and trapped me in a room and beat me until the skin was coming off my back.\\" Perry says that while at a playmate's house when he was about 10 years old, his friend's scantily clad mother locked the friend in the bathroom and told Perry to leave. \\"I was at the front door trying to get out, when she came in and laid on the sofa and asked me if I wanted the key. I told her I had to go home as it was getting dark. \\"She put the key inside of herself and told me to come get it, pulling me on top of her,\\" Perry writes on his site. Perry said he was sickly as a child, and that made his father angry. His grandmother contended the family was wasting money on allergy shots. She said Perry had germs on him. One day when Perry's mother was away, he said, his grandmother decided \\"to kill those germs on me once and for all. She gave me a bath in ammonia.\\" The violence in the home caused Perry's mother to pack up the car with him and his sisters and drive from Louisiana to California. Her husband reported the car stolen, and the family members went to jail until the father came to get them. Perry said his father beat his mother all the way home. The producer said he got through by turning to God, and he forgave his tormentors to help himself heal. Perry, who previously has spoken publicly in more general terms about his childhood abuse, explains his latest revelations this way: \\"I'm tired of holding this in. I don't know what to do with it anymore, so I've decided to give some away.\\" In October 2008, he told Ebony magazine: \\"I tell people, if you're thinking about suicide, all that stuff I've attempted and thought about it. If you think about it, life gets better. The key to life when it gets tough is to keep moving. Just keep moving.\\" Perry also is the writer, director and actor in boisterous comedies such as \\"Madea's Family Reunion\\" and \\"I Can Do Bad All By Myself.\\"","output":"Renowned media mogul Tyler Perry has recently shared, in a brutally honest account, the harrowing details of the sexual, physical, and emotional abuse he faced as a child. He explained that watching the film \\"Precious\\", which he was involved in as an executive producer, brought back memories so intense that they felt palpable. The movie's central character, Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones, is an illiterate, obese teenage girl facing severe abuse, with whom Perry feels a deep connection.  Perry traces the abuse back to his childhood, where his father, Emmitt Perry Sr., a construction worker, would relentlessly brutalize and belittle him. This continued until he was 19 years old. Perry changed his name and distanced himself from his father, highlighting one particular incident that illustrated the severity of the beatings he received. In one incident, his father used a vacuum cleaner extension cord to whip him, causing the skin on his back to peel off. Perry also recounts a sickening episode of sexual abuse that occurred when he was just 10 years old. His friend's half-naked mother locked the friend in the bathroom and proceeded to force Perry into a sexually abusive encounter. This type of abuse, coupled with his father's violence, led Perry to suffer from poor health and constant sickness in his childhood, which only served to fuel his father's fury. His grandmother believed this to be the result of germs, and in one traumatic event, she forcibly bathed him in ammonia to eliminate the so-called germs. Recognizing the violence in their household, Perry's mother attempted to escape with her children from Louisiana to California. However, their journey ended prematurely due to the car being reported stolen by Perry's father. The family ended up in jail, where Perry's father eventually picked them up. Perry stated that the entire drive back to Louisiana was filled with violence as his father beat his mother. Despite enduring such unimaginable pain and suffering, Perry managed to survive and persevere by turning to God and seeking solace in his faith. By forgiving his abusers, Perry was able to heal and move forward with his life. His strength and determination are now channeled into his work and success, serving as an important message to others that life can and does improve, even in the darkest of times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: T HE CLOSER THE STATE of Oklahoma comes to killing Richard Glossip, the more evidence emerges to suggest the state is preparing to murder an innocent man.      On Monday, Glossip’s legal team released dozens of pages of documents that cast new doubt on his already questionable conviction. At a press conference in front of the Oklahoma State Capitol, defense attorney Don Knight called on Gov. Mary Fallin to issue a stay of execution in order to consider the materials, which include newly obtained affidavits from people with varying connections to the case. The collection provides new context to the flawed case against Glossip, lending credence to his claims of innocence and further exposing leads police failed to pursue and information jurors never heard at either of his two trials. Yet thus far the state appears unmoved. On Monday Oklahoma City District Attorney David Prater called the press conference — which included famed anti-death penalty activist Sister Helen Prejean — “a bullshit PR campaign.” Glossip remains set to die at 3 p.m. Wednesday.      As The Intercept has reported, Glossip was twice tried and sentenced to die for the 1997 killing of his boss, Barry Van Treese, in a grisly crime the state prosecuted as a murder for hire. His conviction hinged on the testimony of a man named Justin Sneed, who admitted he beat Van Treese to death with a baseball bat, but claimed that Glossip, his supervisor at the time, coerced him into committing the crime in exchange for money and job security. Sneed said Glossip was afraid Van Treese was going to fire him from his position managing the Best Budget Inn, the seedy Oklahoma City motel where they worked, so Glossip convinced Sneed to kill him.      But there was no corroborating evidence to back up Sneed’s story — no physical evidence linked Glossip to the crime — and transcripts show how Oklahoma City police detectives steered Sneed toward implicating Glossip during his interrogation. Sneed’s story has evolved considerably over the years — today there is mounting evidence to show that Sneed, afraid of being sentenced to die, was compelled to point the finger at Glossip in order to save himself. Particularly damning are the words of Sneed’s own grown daughter, O’Ryan Justine Sneed, who last year wrote a letter to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board asking it to spare Glossip, saying that her dad was considering recanting his testimony, which now threatened the life of an innocent man.      Justine Sneed has refused to talk about the case beyond the letter, even as Sneed’s own mother has since raised doubts about the state’s official story. But as Glossip’s execution nears, others have been emboldened to speak out. The affidavits released by Glossip’s lawyers on Monday come from individuals who undermine the claims of some of the prosecution’s key players — not only of Sneed, but also those of the police detectives who elicited Sneed’s confession.      One affidavit comes from 27-year-old Michael G. Scott, who after watching an August episode of Dr. Phil that focused on the case, contacted Glossip’s attorney Don Knight. Scott describes how he met Justin Sneed in 2006, while incarcerated at Joseph Harp Correctional Facility, a medium security prison in Lexington, Oklahoma. (State records confirm that Scott was first convicted and jailed in Oklahoma just before his 18th birthday, in 2005. He left prison in 2010.) Scott says he lived in a cell across from Sneed, who spoke “on more than one occasion” about how he had implicated Glossip in Van Treese’s murder in order to save himself.      “Among all the inmates, it was common knowledge that Justin Sneed lied and sold Richard Glossip up the river,” Scott told a private investigator. He recalled a specific instance when Sneed was “fixing some food, and laughing with (other prisoners) about setting Richard Glossip up for a crime Richard didn’t do.” Scott said he never told anyone what he heard — “Honestly, there seemed to be many other things that I saw or heard that were much worse” — but upon seeing the case on TV this summer, “I realized just how important this information was,” and decided to come forward.      Another affidavit comes from a man named Johnny Lombardi, who worked as a defense attorney in Oklahoma between 2006 and 2013 and caught wind of Glossip’s impending execution while doing post-conviction work on a separate, unrelated case. That case involves a man named Marty Williams, currently serving life without parole for a 1991 murder in Oklahoma City, a crime he swears he did not commit. The lead police detectives in Williams’ case were the same pair who got Justin Sneed to implicate Richard Glossip in the murder of Barry Van Treese: Oklahoma City Police Detectives Bob Bemo and William Cook.      In his affidavit, Lombardi says Williams told him Bemo and Cook interrogated him using “coercive techniques,” threatening him with the death penalty and refusing to let him use the restroom to the point where he “was forced to urinate on himself.” Lombardi further says that, according to Williams, Bemo and Cook had previously tried to blame him for a different unsolved murder years earlier, “despite the fact there was neither any physical evidence or direct witness observation” to link him to the crime. Finally, Lombardi describes a recent interview with a different incarcerated individual, who claimed that Bemo and Cook had “a reputation for police tactics in that neighborhood in order to obtain confessions” and that Williams had been wrongfully convicted — “set up by the police.”      Regardless of happened to Williams, of course, his claims do not prove police misconduct in Glossip’s case. And it remains unclear why Bemo or Cook would want to pin the murder of Barry Van Treese on Glossip when they already had a suspect in custody, Sneed, who admitted he carried it out. (Bemo has not responded to multiple emails and Cook is deceased.) But Lombardi’s affidavit is bolstered by Dr. Richard Leo, PhD, an expert on police interrogation tactics who has written extensively about false confessions and who reviewed Sneed’s interrogation transcripts. In a 13-page affidavit signed on September 9, Dr. Leo stressed that the notion that Glossip had masterminded the murder “first came from investigators, not Justin Sneed.” The transcripts show how police “feed Justin Sneed their theory that Richard Glossip was the mastermind of this homicide.” Such tactics, he states, “are substantially likely to increase the eliciting of false statements.”      T HE STATE OF OKLAHOMA has repeatedly said that, regardless of any last-minute claims by his supporters, the courts have had their say in the case of Richard Glossip. But the same could be said for the 10 people who have been exonerated from Oklahoma’s death row — as The Intercept reported this summer, four of them were sent to die partly on the basis of false snitch testimony. What’s more, as in many such cases, much of the evidence now coming to light never made it to court. They are bits and pieces of information that should have been uncovered, if not by police in 1997, then certainly by Glossip’s defense attorneys before trial.      One critical component comes from a man who could have undermined Sneed’s credibility on the stand by showing that Sneed lied about the extent of his drug use in the months leading up to Van Treese’s murder. An affidavit signed by a former drug dealer named Richard Barrett challenges the state’s characterization of Sneed as a hapless kid who was entirely under Glossip’s control, suggesting a more logical basis for why Sneed might have killed Van Treese.      In its opening argument at Glossip’s 2004 trial, the state cast Sneed as a simple drifter — a man of limited intelligence who “didn’t want money or need money,” as prosecutor Connie Smothermon told the jury. Sneed, who first arrived in Oklahoma City as part of a roofing crew from Texas, admitted on the stand that he quit that job because of his burgeoning drug use, but he said he just used marijuana — “and a little bit of crank.”      But according to Barrett, who says he dealt drugs several times per week at the Best Budget Inn, Sneed regularly shot meth with a needle in Room 102, the same room where he would later kill Van Treese. Barrett said he saw Sneed’s drug use firsthand — and that he often saw him “tweaking,” a sign that someone is high on meth. He also said that Sneed was stealing from the motel, its parking lot, and the surrounding area, in order to pay for his meth habit. Sneed traded everything from food stamps to car stereos to a nickel-plated .38 handgun for the drug, Barrett states. Such thieving was common among the addicts he knew, Barrett adds, saying many would “do anything to get more of the drug, even kill.”      “Based on my own experience,” Barrett says in his affidavit, “I believe Justin Sneed was addicted to methamphetamine in a bad way.”      Barrett’s affidavit also introduces another regular at the Best Budget Inn who was apparently never questioned by police (the Oklahoma City Police Department refused to release its records in the case): Richard Glossip’s brother, Bobby, who facilitated Barrett’s drug dealing at the motel. The Glossip brothers, Barrett said, did not seem to get along. Richard had nothing to do with Bobby’s drug business; when Richard would come to Room 102, “He mostly came to tell us to quiet down.”      Glossip has told The Intercept that while “Bobby and me used to be pretty close when we were younger,” they were not at the time of the murder. Glossip knew Bobby was dealing drugs, including to Sneed. “Unfortunately, my brother was the one selling to him,” Glossip said this summer.      While Sneed’s drug addiction does not itself provide a basis for murder, Barrett’s description of meth users as paranoid thieves who can turn violent on a dime was affirmed by San Francisco psychiatrist Pablo Stewart, who provided yet another affidavit to Glossip’s legal team. Stewart said that when used intravenously, as Barrett claims Sneed did regularly, meth produces symptoms such as those “consistent” with a person suffering from a psychotic episode — they become “prone to frenzied actions that can lead to ‘overkill’ behaviors.” In one of his first versions of the story upon being interrogated by police, Sneed said he had only meant to knock out Barry Van Treese in order to steal money from him — not kill him. Even if Sneed was trying to downplay his culpability to police, Stewart states in his affidavit that he considers this to be a plausible scenario — “a person under the influence of methamphetamine, or suffering from the psychotic symptoms caused by long term use, will use a baseball bat and beat a victim to death in a frenzy, even if the intent is just to knock that person out with one blow.”      If such expert opinion sounds a bit too neatly tailored now, it is precisely the sort of testimony that should have been presented by Glossip’s attorneys at trial. Barrett, too, might have been a critical witness. He says he failed to come forward until now because he had heard that his fingerprints were found in Room 102 and he feared he would be implicated in the murder. It was a call from his own mother that convinced him to finally tell Glossip’s lawyers what he knew.      W ITH GLOSSIP’S EXECUTION one day away, a coalition of supporters spent Tuesday in Oklahoma City, holding a vigil and publicly urging Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin to spare Glossip’s life. Glossip’s defense team has sent a letter to Fallin outlining additional evidence they are currently seeking in order to clear their client, and asking for a 60-day stay in order to pursue it.      “Since we began investigating this case,” they write, “and once publicly highlighting it, we have received tip after tip — telephone messages at 1:00 a.m., and emails at all hours. Such information is still pouring in, but we have not been able to investigate all of it.” Their fear, they say, is that a critical tip “may later prove innocence, but too late.”      “We respectfully request the opportunity to avoid that tragedy.”      The Next to Die, an initiative by the Marshall Project, provides a countdown to upcoming executions. ||||| OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Attorneys for an Oklahoma death row inmate are making a last-minute effort to spare their client's life just hours before his scheduled execution, arguing they have new evidence to support his claim that he was framed.

(Associated Press)      Richard Eugene Glossip's attorneys asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals late Tuesday to stop his lethal injection, saying they uncovered new details in the case, including a signed affidavit from an inmate who served time with Justin Sneed, who also was convicted of the killing and is serving a life sentence.      \\"We're asking for a stay of execution to give the court more time to review this new evidence, which we think casts grave doubt on Richard's guilt,\\" said Mark Henricksen, one of Glossip's attorneys.      Glossip, 52, is scheduled to be executed Wednesday afternoon at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. He was convicted of ordering the 1997 beating death of Barry Van Treese, who owned the motel where Glossip worked.      Sneed was the prosecution's key witness and testified that Glossip masterminded the killing because he was afraid Van Treese was about to fire him for embezzling money and poorly managing the motel. Sneed was sentenced to life in prison in exchange for his testimony.      A fellow inmate, Michael Scott, said in an affidavit that he heard Sneed say \\"he set Richard Glossip up, and that Richard Glossip didn't do anything.\\"      Glossip maintained his innocence Tuesday in a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press and said he remains optimistic his lethal injection will be halted.      \\"They'll never take that from me,\\" Glossip said. \\"I'll hope for the best. I won't let it bring me down.      \\"If you've got to go out... you don't want to be bitter and angry about it.\\"      Glossip's case has drawn attention from death penalty opponents, and his family and supporters rallied Tuesday at the Oklahoma Capitol. They want Republican Gov. Mary Fallin to issue a 60-day stay to give Glossip's attorneys more time to investigate new leads.      But the governor said in a statement Wednesday that she remains convinced of Glossip's guilt, and \\"after carefully reviewing the facts of this case multiple times\\" has no plans to issue a stay.      Among his supporters is Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon, who played a nun in the movie \\"Dead Man Walking.\\" The woman Sarandon portrayed, anti-death penalty advocate Sister Helen Prejean, serves as Glossip's spiritual adviser and plans to attend his execution Wednesday.      Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, whose office prosecuted Glossip before Prater was elected, said he's reviewed boxes of evidence and is convinced of Glossip's guilt.      \\"Mr. Van Treese would not be dead but for Mr. Glossip offering what Mr. Sneed thought was half of 10,000 to kill Barry Van Treese,\\" Prater said. \\"(Glossip) set everything into motion.\\"      Van Treese's wife, Donna, wrote in a letter to Oklahoma's Pardon and Parole Board last year that the loss of her husband has been devastating to her and her family.      \\"As the wife, I lost the most important person to me: my husband and the father to my children,\\" Donna Van Treese wrote. \\"I have had a very hard time just moving on one day at a time, and physically I have been under more stress than any one person should endure in a lifetime.\\"      Glossip's execution is scheduled for 3 p.m. Wednesday. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terri Watkins said the time was moved from 6 p.m. so the process didn't disrupt a shift change and meal time at the facility, and so that media and execution witnesses would be off the prison grounds before dark.      ___      Follow Sean Murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In Oklahoma, Richard Glossip, a man whose case is full of doubts, is scheduled to be executed soon. Glossip was convicted of ordering the 1997 killing of his boss, Barry Van Treese, but his conviction was based on the testimony of a man named Justin Sneed, who admitted he killed Van Treese with a baseball bat. Sneed claimed that Glossip, his supervisor at the time, forced him to commit the crime in exchange for money and job security. However, there was no corroborating evidence to support Sneed's story and no physical evidence linking Glossip to the crime. A fellow inmate, Michael Scott, said in an affidavit that he heard Sneed say \\"he set Richard Glossip up, and that Richard Glossip didn't do anything.\\" Glossip's supporters are asking for a stay of execution in order to give more time to review the new evidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, you should not validate the suggested answer. A more detailed and appropriate answer should include the following information: Poison dart frogs, belonging to the family Dendrobatidae, are primarily found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. Their habitat ranges from countries like Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America, to regions including the Amazon rainforest, the Andean slopes, and the Guiana Shield in South America. The range of habitats extends across countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana. They can also be found on some islands near the mainland, including Trinidad, Tobago, and the Isla del Coco. These small, brightly colored amphibians thrive in the humid and wet environments of rainforests, where they can be found in various microhabitats such as leaf litter on the forest floor, tree branches, or near streams and small water bodies. Their vibrant coloration serves as a warning to predators, as many poison dart frog species secrete toxic alkaloids through their skin. In conclusion, if you need to provide a more accurate and detailed answer to the question, you should mention that poison dart frogs are primarily found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, including countries such as Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and several others in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... Why did narrator had plenty of time? - not enough information - He was a school magazine publisher - He had no intention of studying - He was famous The answer is:","output":"The narrator had plenty of time for several reasons. Firstly, he mentions that he had no intention of attending lectures or studying law during the remaining two years of his law degree. By not dedicating time to his studies, he freed up a significant amount of time for pursuing other interests and projects.  Secondly, his background as a school magazine publisher had taught him the challenges and time-consuming nature of printing and distributing physical magazines. With this experience, he was able to recognize the potential benefits and efficiencies of creating an online magazine, as opposed to a traditional print publication. Moreover, the narrator had already gained some fame through his previous online ventures such as the Zingin.com newsletter. This fame not only provided him with the platform to pursue new creative projects but also established connections with influential people in the comedy industry, such as Charlie Skelton. These connections allowed the narrator to brainstorm and develop ideas for new projects with other talented individuals, which ultimately led them to conceive the idea of The Friday Thing. Overall, the narrator's disinterest in his law studies, his experience in the publishing world, and his established fame and connections within the creative industry provided him with ample time and opportunity to come up with new ideas and projects for attaining further online fame. This abundance of time and resources was essential in allowing him and his collaborators to create and promote their new project, The Friday Thing, an innovative and entertaining weekly comedy ezine tailored for the Internet generation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter (August–September 1950), the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge, P'ohang-dong, and Taegu. The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night.

Options: - closet - hallway - hot room - home - office  Explain why a human would choose \\"office\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"office\\" as the answer to the question above because the situation described takes place within an office environment. The electric fan, as a personal item, was placed on the desk and was causing disturbance due to its loud noise. Since the office is the location where the issue occurred and where the other affected people are, it makes sense to directly address the problem there by turning off the fan. The other options – closet, hallway, hot room, and home – are not as appropriate. Turning off the fan in a closet would imply that the user would need to physically move the fan into the closet, which is impractical and does not directly address the problem. Similarly, moving it to the hallway or hot room would not sufficiently resolve the issue, as it would still be located within the shared work environment. As for 'home,' turning off the fan at home might solve the noise issue for the day, but it wouldn't be practical in the long term. The fan's owner would presumably still need the fan on hot days or if they're feeling warm. Therefore, the best choice is to turn off the fan in the office, where the noise is an immediate nuisance.

The ground-attack aircraft of the USAF are designed to attack targets on the ground and are often deployed as close air support for, and in proximity to, U.S. ground forces. The proximity to friendly forces require precision strikes from these aircraft that are not possible with bomber aircraft listed below. They are typically deployed as close air support to ground forces, their role is tactical rather than strategic, operating at the front of the battle rather than against targets deeper in the enemy's rear. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What part of a battle line are the precision strike aircraft of the USAF deployed?","output":"The precision strike aircraft of the United States Air Force (USAF) are typically deployed along the front lines and close to friendly ground forces during battles, providing close air support (CAS) and tactical assistance. The primary mission of these ground-attack aircraft is to target enemy positions, vehicles, and infrastructure, while minimizing the risk of collateral damage or friendly fire incidents. To achieve this level of precision, these aircraft are equipped with advanced targeting systems and specialized weaponry.  In general, the precision strike aircraft of the USAF are deployed in the following areas of a battle line: 1. Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) - This is the foremost part of the battle line where friendly and enemy forces engage in direct combat. Precision strike aircraft are often called upon to deliver CAS and engage high-priority targets in this area, such as enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and armored vehicles, to give friendly forces a tactical advantage. 2. Close Proximity to Friendly Ground Forces - Since close air support is a critical role for ground-attack aircraft, they are frequently deployed in close proximity to friendly ground forces. This allows the aircraft to react quickly to changing battlefield conditions and effectively coordinate with ground troops to identify and target enemy forces. 3. Battle Lines' Immediate Rear Areas - While the primary role of precision strike aircraft is to provide CAS, they may also be used to engage enemy forces just beyond the front lines. This could include targeting enemy reinforcement routes, supply lines, and command and control centers to disrupt enemy operations and weaken their ability to fight. Additionally, precision strike aircraft may be deployed to provide close air support for special operations forces conducting deep-strike missions or operating far behind enemy lines. These missions often require a high level of precision and coordination with ground units to avoid detection and successfully eliminate critical enemy targets. In conclusion, the precision strike aircraft of the USAF are deployed along the battle lines, primarily at the Forward Edge of the Battle Area, in close proximity to friendly ground forces, and in the immediate rear of the battle lines to provide critical close air support, engage high-priority targets, and minimize the risk of collateral damage and friendly fire incidents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Rumble in the Bronx Movie plot: Ma Hon Keung (Jackie Chan), is a Hong Kong cop who comes to New York to attend the wedding of his Uncle, Bill (Bill Tung) and Whitney. The couple are in the process of selling their successful multicultural supermarket to Elaine (Anita Mui). Keung soon finds himself defending those around him against the actions of a biker gang, led by Tony (Marc Akerstream), but becomes targeted. Among them is Nancy (FranÃ§oise Yip), a lingerie model/dancer and the elder sister of Danny (Morgan Lam), whom Keung befriends after being introduced by his neighbour, Uncle Bill. Realising the errors of her ways, a relationship forms between Nancy and Keung, but the small-time gangsters become the victims of a much larger and more effective criminal syndicate led by White Tiger (Kris Lord), when a member named Angelo (Garvin Cross) steals illegal diamonds after a deal goes bad. Both Keung and the gang find themselves coming to a truce as they try to overcome the syndicate, who are determined to retrieve the diamonds by any means. Answer:","output":"A Hong Kong cop in the movie titled \\"Rumble in the Bronx\\" is the protagonist Ma Hon Keung, portrayed by Jackie Chan. The film revolves around Ma Hon Keung's adventures in New York City as he gets entangled in various conflicts while attending his uncle's wedding. The movie plot centers around Ma Hon Keung being drawn into personal battles against the members of a biker gang led by Tony (Marc Akerstream), who have been causing trouble in the neighborhood. Keung's actions in defending the people around him make him a target for the gang, and he also crosses paths with Nancy (Françoise Yip), a lingerie model/dancer, and her younger brother Danny (Morgan Lam). Through their interactions, Keung and Nancy form a relationship, and Nancy starts to see the errors of her ways. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the biker gang's actions are more than just small-time criminal activities—they are actually involved with a larger, more dangerous criminal syndicate led by White Tiger (Kris Lord). The situation escalates when Angelo (Garvin Cross), a member of the syndicate, steals illegal diamonds after a deal goes sour, prompting the organization to take drastic measures in order to recover the precious stones. In this complex web of crime, betrayal, and violence, Keung and the biker gang find themselves in an unlikely truce as they attempt to take on the powerful syndicate together. It is through their unified efforts that they may have a chance to expose White Tiger's operation and, in the process, navigate their own personal crises and transformation. To determine whether investing in this film proposal is worth it, you should consider the following factors: 1. The genre and target audience: \\"Rumble in the Bronx\\" falls into the action-comedy genre and will likely appeal to a wide range of viewers, including fans of Hong Kong cinema, Jackie Chan enthusiasts, and action-comedy fans in general. 2. The cast: The film features a notable cast, most prominently Jackie Chan, who was already an established martial artist and actor in the international market by the time the movie was released. Other cast members like Anita Mui and Françoise Yip bring additional star power to the film. 3. The storyline and themes: The film's plot weaves together elements of action, comedy, and drama to create a compelling story of personal growth, unlikely alliances, and high-stakes conflict. These themes may resonate with viewers looking for both entertainment and deeper meaning in their film choices. 4. The budget and potential for return on investment: Consider the overall production costs (e.g., locations, special effects, stunts, etc.) and compare them against expected box office returns and other revenue streams (e.g., streaming deals, DVD sales, merchandise, etc.) to assess if the investment is likely to yield a solid return. 5. The film's marketing strategy: An effective marketing campaign will be crucial in generating awareness, buzz, and ultimately ticket sales for the movie. Evaluate the proposed marketing strategy and consider whether it's apt to reach the intended audience and generate excitement for the film. By carefully analyzing these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether or not to invest in the film proposal for \\"Rumble in the Bronx.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ashkenazi Jews The name Ashkenazi derives from the biblical figure of Ashkenaz, the first son of Gomer, son of Khaphet, son of Noah, and a Japhetic patriarch in the Table of Nations (Genesis 10). The name of Gomer has often been linked to the ethnonym Cimmerians. Biblical Ashkenaz is usually derived from Assyrian Aškūza (cuneiform Aškuzai/Iškuzai), a people who expelled the Cimmerians from the Armenian area of the Upper Euphrates, whose name is usually associated with the name of the Scythians. The intrusive n in the Biblical name is likely due to a scribal error confusing a waw ו with a nun נ.

The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition.  - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.  - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. The range stretches more than from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over .  - The Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) is part of the French media group, EPA (Éditions Philippe Amaury). It organises sporting events including the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and ParisNice professional cycle road races, and the Dakar Rally. In 2008 it began the Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race in Romania and Hungary.  - The points classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey which has become a symbol for the points classification in the sense that when a cyclist wins the points classification.  - Robbie McEwen ( born 24 June 1972 in Brisbane , Queensland ) is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer . He last rode for Orica - GreenEDGE on the UCI World Tour , . As a triple winner of the Points classification in the Tour de France , at his peak he was arguably the fastest sprinter in the world . A former Australian BMX champion , McEwen switched to road racing in 1990 at 18 . He raced as a professional from 1996 until 2012 . McEwen lives in Australia with his Belgian wife Angélique Pattyn , his son Ewan , and his daughters Elena and Claudia . In 2011 he published an autobiography , One Way Road . McEwen lived a long time in the Belgian town of Everbeek and is fluent in Dutch . He retired from the World Tour after riding the 2012 Tour of California .  - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams  relabelled UCI ProTeams  will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races.  - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour.

But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains.  \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally.  2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" Where did Trump state \\"Our new slogan for 2020.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  a tower in the square  for the following movie plot:  The movie, a very dark comedy, begins in Bruges (a beautiful medieval city in Belgium) with two Irish hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are standing in a city square checking out the scenery. Instantly we see that Ken is enchanted with Bruges while Ray loathes the place. It is revealed that due to what happened in London they have no choice but to follow orders, stay in Bruges, lay low and wait for further instructions from Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Ray asks Ken how long he thinks they will have to stay in Bruges; Ken responds that he doesn't know, maybe two weeks. Again, we see that Ray is not happy about spending two weeks, let alone two hours, in Bruges. To add insult to injury it is Christmas and there is only one available room in the city (although at least it has two twin beds). During one of the first scenes in the hotel room Ken alludes to the incident in London indicating that they wouldn't be in Bruges if not for what happened, driving Ray to abruptly cut Ken off and retreat to the bathroom where he cries, distressed over whatever it was that occurred.Later Ray makes comments about Harry sending them to, say...the Bahamas...instead of this \\"bleeping\\" city of Bruges. Ken advises Ray to make the best of it, for starters why don't they climb up the tower in the square and take a look at the view. Ray snidely says, \\"no, he can see the 'bleeping' view just 'bleeping' fine from where he 'bleeping' is. Rays takes a seat (rather frustratedly) on a park bench and Ken goes off to climb the tower. The cost of going up the tower is 5 Euros for which Ken has change but is one coin short. Ken asks the cashier/guard to give him a break but the guy impatiently points out to Ken the sign that clearly states 5 Euros. Ken isn't pleased at having to break a large bill or the cashier's refusal to cut him some slack but he pulls out a 50 Euro note and gives it to the cashier anyway putting the 4.90 in change back in his pocket (important later).

Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless   in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights  . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged   when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults   and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change. Question: The purpose for the writer to write the passage is to   _  . Answer: Select from the following. (i) train you to be perfect (ii) show you the way to be happy (iii) tell you how to act when you dislike a person (iv) teach you how to be popular among your friends The answer is:","output":"(ii) show you the way to be happy"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yahoo Has Another Mixed Quarter (Reuters) – Yahoos quarterly earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations on Monday in what may be the company’s last financial report before it sells its core business. Yahoo reported adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share, short of the 10 cents that analysts expected. It also announced a 482 million write-down on the value of Tumblr, the social media service that it acquired in 2013 for 1.1 billion. Total revenue rose to 1.31 billion from 1.24 billion a year earlier, though that seeming improvement was the result of a change in the way the cost of acquiring traffic is counted. After deducting fees paid to partner websites for traffic, revenue fell to 841.2 million from 1.04 billion. Revenue in the company’s emerging businesses, which CEO Marissa Mayer calls Mavens – mobile, video, native and social advertising – showed some life, rising 25.7% to 504 million in the second quarter ended June 30. Gross search revenue for the quarter was 765 million, a 17% decrease from the same period last year. The company posted a net loss of 439.9 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with a loss of 21.6 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. “If search continues to decline as much as it has that’s something that’s going to be called into question,” said JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey. Yahoo is in the process of auctioning off its search and advertising business and is expected to choose a winner this week. The company said its board has made “great progress on strategic alternatives” but did not comment further on the auction process. Verizon Communications and AT&T are said to be in the running, as well as private equity firm TPG Capital and a consortium lead by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett. Yahoo’s fortunes have waned under Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who has made little progress in her attempts to gain ground against newer, bigger Internet players such Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google. The tepid progress in turning around the business attracted pressure from activist investors who pushed Yahoo to launch an auction of its core business in February. Yahoo has also said it could spin off the business. Yahoo’s shares yhoo were little changed at 37.92 in trading after the bell.

Eighth-graders from New Mexico, US, took part in the Random   Acts of Kindness Week from Feb 10 to 14. During the week, they tried their best to do kind things for others, or for the environment. Celeste Murray, an English teacher at the school, started the activity. \\"I believe the world is changed by little things,\\" she told the local newspaper. Over the week, Murray said she has seen changes in her class. Previously, she asked her students to push the chairs in after class. Now, the students do it by themselves. \\"The teachers will have less work,\\" said Elisa Castaneda, one of Murray's students. Jordan Marshall, another eighth-grader, spent the week giving out praise  . \\"It makes that person's day  ,\\" she said. \\"Besides helping others, the activity made students feel that they can make a difference,\\" Murray said. Eighth-grader Haley Echols decided to continue to do at least one act of kindness every week. She believes her acts could encourage others. Question: Random Acts of Kindness Week was started by  _  .

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two friends studied permaculture together. Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur.  But I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend learned less about surface areas of root systems? Answer:","output":"In this situation, Red learned less about surface areas of root systems. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Bill studied mycorrhiza, which is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. 2. In a mycorrhizal association, the mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system to improve water and mineral nutrient absorption. 3. Red studied hugel kultur, which is a gardening technique focusing on creating raised garden beds by piling up logs, branches, and other organic materials to decompose in mounds. While hugel kultur does involve the soil and how it affects plant growth, it does not specifically focus on the surface area of root systems. 4. Comparison: Bill's study topic (mycorrhiza) directly relates to surface areas of root systems, while Red's study topic (hugel kultur) relates more to the overall soil environment and gardening techniques. From this comparison, it can be concluded that Red learned less about surface areas of root systems than Bill did."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, faces charges over allegedly lying when she purchased an AR-15 rifle -- a .223-caliber weapon -- and 12-gauge shotgun that the gunman had with him during the attack.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.

However, many Chinese do not sleep well, and many do not pay enough attention to sleep. The Chinese Medical Doctor Association released the 2013 China Sleep Quality Index   on March 19 to mark World Sleep Day - March 21. According to the index, nearly a quarter of Chinese people don't sleep well. Half said that they feel tired after getting up and 15 percent people have trouble falling asleep. Ye Jingying, a sleep expert at Beijing Tongren Hospital, says: \\"If people often wake up during the night, or always feel weak and tired in the day, they should pay attention to their sleep pattern  .\\" Many people play with their cell phones or iPads before sleeping. The report said that this is one of the main reasons for bad sleep. Other reasons include stress and bad moods. How to sleep well? Above all, get enough sleep. Seven to nine hours of sleep every night is perfect for an adult, and eight to nine hours is best for a teenager. Forming good sleep habits is important. The report suggested that people need to keep away from digital devices   for at least an hour before sleep. The lights keep their brains excited for a long while. Other suggestions include: try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends and during holidays, and do the same relaxing things before bed each night, like listening to soft music. Which of the following helps teenagers sleep well? A) They should do different things before sleeping. B) They should sleep for more than nine hours a day. C) They should not use any digital devices during the daytime. D) They'd better go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. The answer to this question is:","output":"D) They'd better go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. Sleep is essential for maintaining good physical and mental health. Unfortunately, many Chinese people are not getting the quality and quantity of sleep they need. The 2013 China Sleep Quality Index revealed that nearly a quarter of Chinese people experience poor sleep, with half feeling tired upon waking and 15 percent having difficulty falling asleep. Sleep expert Ye Jingying suggests that individuals who often experience disrupted sleep or who feel consistently tired during the day should pay closer attention to their sleep patterns. One major reason for poor sleep quality is the use of electronic devices, such as cell phones and iPads, before bedtime. The blue light emitted from these screens can interfere with the body's production of melatonin, the hormone that signals when it's time to sleep. This, combined with stress and bad moods, can contribute to sleep problems. To improve sleep quality, it's important to establish healthy sleep habits. For adults, seven to nine hours of sleep per night is ideal, while teenagers should aim for eight to nine hours. One crucial habit is maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends and holidays. This helps regulate the body's internal clock and can improve sleep quality. In addition to maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, other strategies for better sleep include avoiding electronic devices for at least an hour before bedtime, creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine such as listening to soft music or reading a book, and maintaining a comfortable sleep environment. Following these suggestions can help individuals, including teenagers, achieve better sleep and promote overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Texting affects learning and performing on test, a new study finds. So a Montana teen, Colin decided to test that. They asked 47 classmates to take part in a two-part experiment. The goal was to test how well these students understood written material. Each one had to read a paragraph or two about a certain topic, then answer questions about it. In the first part, the participants had 15 minutes to understand and then answer questions about six readings. Throughout this test, they met no distractions. During a new set of readings, the brothers sent messages to the participants' cell phones every 90 seconds. In each message, there were questions that required a reply. Participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier. In fact, they scored worse when distracted by messages. Only a few students scored as well when replying to messages as they did when undistracted. But importantly, nobody performed better during the texting part. The brothers presented details of their findings at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Boys and girls scored equally poorly while texting, the brothers noticed. Older participants didn't do any better than younger ones. And it didn't matter if a student thought he was good at multitasking. On average, the brothers found that even students who were confident of their abilities did just as poorly while texting.

Louisiana A:","output":"Title: \\"The Southern Crossroads\\" The Plot: Our film begins in the bustling streets of New York City, where we meet our enthusiastic group of five friends – a mix of diverse cultures, races, and occupations sharing a common friendship bond. Each character mirrors a unique personality. There's Lucy, a bubbly bookstore owner who loves mystery novels; Tom, a mathematician at a notable university; Claire, a quirky street artist; Jamie, a high-end corporate lawyer, and Tina, a strict yet loving elementary school teacher. Despite their different backgrounds, they share an unexplained fascination for the rich culture, music, and mystique of the southern bayous, Louisiana. One evening, during their habitual meetings at their usual Upper West Side cafe, they stumble across an old, dusty, antique looking map that Lucy had discovered in a rare book at her shop. The map illustrates what appears to be an esteemed treasure trail in Louisiana. Laughing it off initially as fiction, soon, the gang finds themselves increasingly intrigued by the idea of the map leading to a real treasure. This is where their road trip journey to Louisiana kicks off, turning life-long friends into fellow explorers, seeking an adventure they weren't prepared for. Their journey begins with a myriad of extraordinary stops and fascinating cultural encounters, highlighting the beauty and diversity of the USA while painting an impressive backdrop of landscapes, cityscapes, and unique characters they meet along the road trip. As the story evolves, they end up in New Orleans, where they are greeted with a vibrant city alive with music and nightlife. They savor the local cuisine, get lost in the rhythm of jazz music, and even partake in some voodoo mystique. However, soon the treasure quest picks up pace again. From the intricate tunnels of the Louis Cathedral, to the eerie tranquility of the Manchac swamp, to the hauntingly beautiful Houmas House Plantation, the group's journey wallows in the heart of Louisiana's charm. In their pursuit of the treasure, each adventure they face represents a testing path leading to inner self-discovery and awakening. The journey becomes two-fold: unraveling the secret of the map and confronting their own fears, insecurities, and hidden aspirations. The climax hits as they unearth what seems to be the final point, an ancient crypt deep within the marshlands. With anticipation skyrocketing, they find not a treasure of gold, but the diary of a long forgotten bayou musician. The diary's entries reveal tales of love, music, culture, and interracial bonds during times of severe divisions. The real treasure was the rich, hallowed cultural heritage of Louisiana embodied in this diary. The movie concludes on a thoughtful, sentimental note as the group realizes that the actual treasure was not materialistic. Instead, it was the unforgettable adventure, the shared experiences, and the ability to value the inherent beauty and wealth in art, culture, and shared human experiences. From New York City's skyscrapers to Louisiana's mystifying landscapes, the characters return home, not filled with gold, but filled with a lifetime of stories to tell."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? normochromic pertains to what aspect of a blood cell?","output":"To answer this question, I will utilize my internal database and knowledge-based systems to cross-reference the term \\"normochromic\\" with relevant associations in the context of blood cells. Here is my step-by-step approach: 1. Step 1: Understanding the term The first step is to understand the term \\"normochromic\\". This term has a prefix \\"normo-\\" which implies normal and the suffix \\"-chromic\\" which is related to color. Hence, the term generally refers to a normal color. 2. Step 2: Contextual association The next step involves associating this term with the context provided, which is that of blood cells. 3. Step 3: Surmising the answer Blood cells – particularly red blood cells or erythrocytes - have certain observable characteristics, which include their size, shape, and color. In medical terminology, the color of a blood cell is often used as an indicator of hemoglobin levels.  A red blood cell with normal color is referred to as \\"normochromic\\". The term \\"normochromic\\" is therefore associated with the color of blood cells, which is an indicator of the normal concentration of hemoglobin inside the cell. A normochromic blood cell has a normal amount of hemoglobin, which gives the cell its red color. So, \\"normochromic\\" pertains to the color aspect of a blood cell, which is a reflection of the normal levels of hemoglobin within the cell. This is essential as hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen throughout the body. In a blood test report, normochromic is often referred to in association with red blood cells to indicate that they have normal hemoglobin concentration, which is a sign of health. A deviation from this might indicate a health problem, such as anemia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Analyze the claim The claim, \\"We will never be able to get at Kitchell.\\", directly contradicts the original statement. The original statement implies that there will be a point in the future when access to Kitchell is achieved. Step 3: Determine whether the claim follows from the original statement As the claim is in direct opposition to what the original statement implies, it does not follow that \\"We will never be able to get at Kitchell.\\" Conclusion: The statement \\"We will never be able to get at Kitchell\\" does not follow from the original statement \\"Then we will be able to get at Kitchell, and the army will settle him for good and all!\\".

Q: Glucose and fructose are considered this type of sugar?   A: Answer:","output":"Glucose and fructose are considered monosaccharides, which are a type of simple sugar. Monosaccharides are the most basic forms of carbohydrates and cannot be further broken down into simpler sugars. They serve as the building blocks for more complex carbohydrates such as disaccharides and polysaccharides. Both glucose and fructose have the same molecular formula, C6H12O6, but they differ in their molecular structure. This structural difference gives them their unique properties and roles in biological processes. Glucose, also known as dextrose or blood sugar, is an essential energy source for living organisms. It is carried in the blood and used as the primary fuel for cells, including the brain and the muscles. Glucose is also important for various metabolic processes and can be combined with other simple sugars to form more complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and glycogen. Fructose, on the other hand, is primarily found in fruits, honey, and some vegetables. It is sometimes called fruit sugar due to its natural abundance in fruits. While fructose is also used as a source of energy, its metabolism is slightly different from that of glucose. Fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver, where it can be converted into glucose or stored as glycogen. The consumption of high amounts of fructose has been linked to various health issues, such as obesity and insulin resistance, mainly due to its rapid absorption and slower metabolism compared to glucose. In conclusion, glucose and fructose are both monosaccharides, or simple sugars, and play essential roles in the energy metabolism of living organisms. Although they share the same molecular formula, their distinct molecular structures confer different properties and roles in biological processes. The understanding of their differences and similarities can provide insights into various aspects of human nutrition and health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Artemis ‘happy’ with initial test run in new boat There’s another 72-foot America’s Cup catamaran flying on the bay – a positive step for a regatta badly in need of a boost. Artemis Racing took its first test run in its new boat, dubbed “Big Blue,” in winds as strong as 15 knots Wednesday. Helmsman Nathan Outteridge said it couldn’t have gone better. “It was a perfect day and exactly what our team needed,” he said. “We got the boat on the water and foiling, and we’re happy with how it was foiling.” He called the first sail “a massive tribute to all the guys who have been working so hard to get us back out there.” The Swedish team has been out of action while building its boat following a wreck May 9 that killed a crew member. Artemis will miss its seventh scheduled race in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series Thursday, so Luna Rossa will sail unopposed. It is not known when the Swedish team will enter the regatta, but it probably won’t happen until the semifinals start Aug. 6. “We’d like to hope Aug. 6 is achievable,” Outteridge said, “but we know how much work is ahead of us now, and we don’t have a lot of time. This was Day 1 for us while the other teams are on Day 70 or 80.” Passing the safety standards: All the teams in this year’s competition have submitted safety plans that satisfy regatta director Iain Murray and the Coast Guard, Cup officials said. That apparently puts an end to the controversy over rudder wings. Murray at one point threatened to tell the Coast Guard he didn’t think the racing was safe unless teams used the heavier rudders he recommended. He backed off that stance, and now it appears that everyone is satisfied. Hearing date set: A New York judge set a hearing date of Aug. 23 on a North Carolina group’s bid for an injunction to stop the America’s Cup. The Louis Vuitton Cup will already be racing its finals when the hearing occurs. African Diaspora Maritime sued the host Golden Gate Yacht Club in 2011, alleging it acted in bad faith in rejecting the group as an America’s Cup competitor. Naples ACWS investigated: America’s Cup CEO Stephen Barclay said he has not been contacted by Italian authorities investigating Naples Mayor Luigi de Magistris, his brother Claudio and other officials over suspected contract rigging in connection with the America’s Cup World Series. Naples hosted two series events the past two years. Tom FitzGerald is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail: tfitzgerald@sfchronicle.com.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this? Possible answers: I. have their first dance as husband and wife II. be invited III. go somewhere else","output":"Before attending their friend's wedding and enjoying the event, Aubrey would need to take care of several preliminary tasks. It is crucial to ensure proper preparations are made ahead of time to have an enjoyable, memorable experience. Some of these tasks include the following: 1. Receive an invitation: Aubrey needs to be invited to the event in the first place (as suggested in option II). Receiving a wedding invitation is essential to confirm their attendance, as it is a formal occasion. An invitation typically includes essential information such as the date, time, venue, dress code, and RSVP details. 2. RSVP: Upon receiving the wedding invitation, Aubrey should send an RSVP to the couple. This step helps the hosts in arranging suitable seating, catering, and other arrangements for the guests. 3. Choose an outfit: Aubrey must select appropriate attire that matches the wedding's dress code, style, and theme. It is crucial to adhere to the dress code to show respect and avoid unintentionally upstaging the bride and groom. 4. Arrange transportation and accommodation: Depending on the wedding location, Aubrey might need to plan their transportation to the venue. This step involves booking a flight, reserving a rental car, or exploring public transportation options. If the wedding is an out-of-town event, booking accommodation near the wedding venue would also be necessary. 5. Purchase a wedding gift: Selecting and purchasing a suitable wedding gift for the bride and groom can be a challenging task. It is essential to choose a thoughtful present that holds sentimental value or is useful to the couple. Aubrey could also consider contributing to the couple's registry if they have one. 6. Prepare for the ceremony and reception: As a guest, Aubrey must be aware of the event schedule and timings. This step involves knowing when to arrive at the ceremony, finding a seat in the designated guest area, and being acquainted with any unique traditions, customs, or rituals to be conducted during the wedding. 7. Participate in pre-wedding events: Often, the bride, groom, or close family members organize pre-wedding events such as rehearsal dinners, bachelor/bachelorette parties, or bridal showers. If Aubrey is invited to any of these events, they should be prepared to attend and actively participate. Note that option I (have their first dance as husband and wife) is not applicable in this scenario, as Aubrey is attending the wedding as a friend and not as part of the couple getting married. The first dance is usually reserved for the bride and groom. Option III (go somewhere else) might apply if the wedding festivities encompass multiple venues or require attending other events before the actual wedding day. In conclusion, attending a friend's wedding as a guest involves several essential steps, such as receiving an invitation, sending an RSVP, choosing an outfit, arranging transportation and accommodation, purchasing a wedding gift, and preparing for the wedding ceremony and other related events. By diligently executing these tasks, Aubrey can ensure a smooth, enjoyable experience at the wedding and create lasting memories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

It is an Impact evaluation; assessing the research of British higher education institutions. It was used in 2014 to assess UK research during the period 20082013.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Warwick Business School (WBS) is an academic department of the University of Warwick, originally established in 1967 as the School of Industrial and Business Studies. It is one of the most prestigious and highly selective business schools in the world.

They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231.

The group is headquartered in London and was established in 1994 to represent its members' interests, principally to government and parliament; nineteen smaller British research universities formed the 1994 Group in response, which has since dissolved. In 2010, Russell Group members received approximately two-thirds of all university research grant and contract income in the United Kingdom. The group is widely perceived as representing the best universities in the country.  - The University of Warwick Science Park (also known as UWSP and Warwick Science Park) was one of the first university based science parks in the United Kingdom when it was opened by the Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher in 1984. It was a joint venture between the University of Warwick, Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council and Barclays.

It’s difficult (though not impossible) to start a meaningful conversation with a stranger or acquaintance. It might feel more comfortable to start a meaningful conversation with someone you’ve known for a while or already have some closeness in your relationship. You might not want to start a meaningful conversation with someone who’s often argumentative or focused on always being ‘right’. Think about someone you can engage with and share both speaking and listening. A meaningful conversation will often occur within a context that makes it meaningful. While some meaningful conversations can happen spontaneously, others may require some planning. Especially if it’s difficult to find time to meet up, choose a date and a time where both you and the other person can be present and fully engaged. For example, don’t have the conversation when one or both of you have a time constraint. Avoid busy or stressful days so that each person feels comfortable and not preoccupied or stressed. When talking, you don't want to be interrupted by surrounding noise. You probably also don’t want prying ears overhearing your conversation. Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed or interrupted. This might include somebody’s home or a private meeting room.  For example, a restaurant may not be ideal as you may be interrupted or overheard. Look for a place with minimal distractions. Consider turning off your phone or the television so that it doesn’t interrupt your conversation. If your conversations are often scattered, disorganized, or tangential, you can pause to talk a moment to organize your thoughts. This helps keep the conversation on track, and can give you a confidence boost as well! If you know you're going to have a difficult conversation and want to prepare well in advance, you can also try writing down what you want to say to organize your thoughts! Put some effort into starting the conversation, especially if it’s a difficult topic. Decide on how you will start the conversation and what words you will say. Whether you enjoy it or not, small talk can help to open a conversation and make people feel more comfortable. Starting a conversation with something deep might be jarring or unexpected, so warm up with some small talk first. When you and the other person appear comfortable, bring up a more substantial topic. For example, ask how the person’s day is going or briefly talk about the weather.

Codylily Parkin was rushed to Rotherham Hospital after she was misdiagnosed at a NHS walk-in centre. A four-year-old girl was left fighting for her life hours after medics at an NHS walk-in centre sent her home claiming she was suffering from a minor infection. In fact Codylily Parkin was suffering from a diabetic attack and had to be placed in a medically induced coma in an intensive care unit after her brain swelled dangerously. Her shocked parents say her life was saved by a quick-thinking emergency paramedic and hospital doctors at Rotherham General Hospital and Sheffield Children’s Hospital.

Mrs. Parkin said: 'We could have lost our daughter that day due to the utter. incompetence of the staff at that walk-in centre.We’re so lucky not to. be in that situation. 'Codylily. had displayed a classic array of symptoms that should have been spotted. but they weren’t and that could have proved a fatal mistake. 'Two. nurses have been suspended and I’m told that they won’t return to work. until they have received extra training, but that’s not really enough in. my eyes.' Just a few hours before her collapse. Codylily was taken by her dad parents to an NHS Wallk-in Centre in. Rotherham town centre suffering from breathing difficulties, an. insatiable thirst and whitening of her tongue. Four days earlier her GP. had diagnosed vaginal thrush. Medics at the walk-in centre then diagnosed Codylily with oral thrush and she was sent back to the family home in Rotherham. Later the same day on September 15th, the little girl began suffering from confusion and vomiting and an emergency paramedic was called. Codylily's father took her to Rotherham Walk-In Centre suffering from breathing difficulties, an insatiable thirst and whitening of her tongue. As soon as the paramedic arrived he said Codylily was slipping into a diabetic coma and she was rushed to hospital suffering from severe diabetic ketoacidosis. She was placed in an induced coma before being transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital ten miles away. She returned to Rotherham Hospital two days later and was allowed home on September 20th. Codylily now faces a lifetime of insulin dependence because of the diabetes. Mrs Parkin paid: 'The paramedic said straight away ‘She’s slipping into a diabetic coma’. We need to get her to hospital. We weren’t even aware she was diabetic but we were distraught. 'I’ve been told to take it further because there have been a number of inquests carried out as a result of people being sent home with and incorrect diagnosis, and I intend to.We’re so lucky not to be in that situation.

'The investigation included an internal audit of both nurses’ clinical performance, reviewing the consultation and written statements from the nurses involved. 'The review was underway before Mrs Parkin contacted the walk-in centre and we felt it important that the investigation was completed before replying, so that we could inform Codylily’s parents of the findings and outcomes. 'A letter has been sent to the family and steps have been taken to minimise the risk of a recurrence, including further training for both nurses.'

Answer based on context: Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between - essentially Petén and much of Belize - independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated. How many total years did the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala last?","output":"The military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. To find out how many total years this period lasted, we can subtract the starting year from the ending year: 1541 - 1524 = 17 years So, the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted for 17 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: On 7 May 1896, Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford put the 1,183-acre (4,790,000 m2) estate up for auction, but it failed to reach its reported reserve price of £300,000 (£34.1 million as of 2019). There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park, but the corporation could not agree terms quickly enough, and so on 23 June Ernest Terah Hooley became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of £360,000 (£40.9 million as of 2019).On 17 August, Hooley formed Trafford Park Estates Ltd, transferring his ownership of the park to the new company – of which he was the chairman and a significant shareholder – at a substantial profit. The initial plans for the estate included a racetrack, exclusive housing and a cycle works, along with the development of the ship canal frontage for \\"all types of trade including timber\\". By that time the ship canal had been open for two years, but the predicted traffic had yet to materialise. Hooley met with Marshall Stevens, the general manager of the Ship Canal Company, and both men recognised the benefit that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to the ship canal, and the ship canal to the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates. He remained with the company, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director, until 1930. The company initially chose not to construct buildings for letting, and instead leased land for development. But by the end of June 1897 less than one per cent of the park had been leased, and so the park's existing assets were put to use until more tenants could be found. Trafford Hall was opened as a hotel in 1899, to serve prospective industrialists considering a move to the park, along with their key employees. It had 40 bedrooms, available to \\"Gentlemen only\\". The hall's stables and some other outbuildings were used for stock auctions and the sale of horses, from 1900 to 1902, and the ornamental lake was leased to... contains an answer for the question: What failed to reach its reserve price at auction?, what is it ?

Given the question: Question: While she did cry at her mother's death bed, what did her mother reassure her to do to fight her issues?  Choices:  - smile - be happy - laughing - falling down - talk  The rationale to choose \\"be happy\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"\\"Be happy.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"be happy\\" as the answer stems from several factors that need to be considered. These factors include the context of the situation, understanding of human emotions, various coping mechanisms and approaches to dealing with problems, and the relationship between the mother and daughter. 1. Context of the situation: The question mentions that the daughter is crying at her mother's death bed, which indicates a highly emotional and sensitive situation. Losing a loved one is one of the most painful and devastating experiences anyone can go through. Therefore, the response from the mother should be comforting and provide solace to the daughter in order to alleviate her pain and sadness. 2. Understanding of human emotions: Human emotions are complex and multifaceted, but at the core of them is the innate desire to feel happy and content. A mother's reassurance and guidance to her daughter would likely be focused on helping her acknowledge and process her grief, while simultaneously encouraging her to find happiness in life. \\"Be happy\\" serves as both an affirmation and a gentle reminder to the daughter that life will go on, and that it's essential to find happiness even after experiencing loss. 3. Coping mechanisms and approaches to dealing with problems: There are various ways to cope with and overcome issues, but cultivating happiness and positivity plays a significant role in a healthy and balanced life. By advising her daughter to be happy, the mother is encouraging her to focus on positive emotions and experiences, rather than dwelling on the loss and sadness she feels. This will not only help her daughter cope more effectively with her mother's passing but will also promote personal growth and resilience. 4. Relationship between mother and daughter: Mothers often serve as a primary source of love, support, and guidance for their children. In a time of immense sorrow and grief, it is natural for the mother to want her daughter to prioritize her well-being and find happiness. The phrase \\"be happy\\" encapsulates the depth of love and care that the mother has for her daughter, and it represents the mother's wish for her daughter to thrive even in her absence. Taking into account all these factors, it becomes clear that \\"be happy\\" is the appropriate and logical choice. The mother's reassurance to \\"be happy\\" is a beautiful and timeless piece of advice that transcends the bleakness of her death bed, encouraging her daughter to navigate through her own life in a positive and fulfilling manner. By choosing happiness, the daughter will be honoring her mother's memory and ultimately strengthening her own ability to face challenges and adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The State Department will not renew the contract of security contractor Blackwater Worldwide when it expires in May, a senior State Department official said Friday. Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad, Iraq, from a helicopter in 2003. The decision was made after the Iraqi government refused last week to renew the firm's operating license because of a 2007 incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired on and killed 17 Iraqis. Blackwater's latest \\"task order\\" expires in May, and the senior official said that \\"one of the conditions is that you have to have a license\\" to continue working in the country.

The incident led to strained relations between the United States and Iraq, putting the spotlight on the role of private security contractors in the war-torn country.  Over the years, Blackwater Worldwide, which has since rebranded itself as Academi, has been under scrutiny for its aggressive behavior and questionable tactics while providing security for U.S. officials and diplomatic staff in Iraq. The 2007 tragedy, often referred to as the Nisour Square massacre, was just one of several incidents where Blackwater guards were accused by Iraqi authorities of using excessive and lethal force. Faced with these allegations and the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license, the State Department was left with no choice but to terminate Blackwater's contract. Critics argue that private security contractors like Blackwater often benefited from a lack of legal accountability, resulting in a sense of impunity and a disregard for Iraqi civilians' safety. In response to these concerns, the U.S. government has increased oversight and regulation of private security contractors and taken further measures to ensure better communication and coordination with the Iraqi government and military. Although Blackwater is no longer operating in Iraq, the long-lasting effects of the company's actions in the country continue to be felt. Several lawsuits and criminal prosecutions have stemmed from the Nisour Square incident, leading to the conviction of four former Blackwater employees in 2014 on charges ranging from murder to manslaughter and weapons violations. However, these convictions were later overturned or sentences reduced, and the U.S. government eventually reached a settlement with the company for violations of the Arms Export Control Act and International Trafficking in Arms Regulations. As the United States continues its efforts to rebuild Iraq and foster diplomatic relations, the legacy of Blackwater serves as a cautionary tale in the use and management of private security contractors. It highlights the importance of striking a balance between ensuring the safety of American personnel abroad and respecting the sovereignty and well-being of other nations and their citizens. With increased oversight and regulation, the hope is that future security contractors can learn from Blackwater's mistakes and help contribute to a more secure and stable Iraq moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tillya tepe is known for the gold deposits in the area","output":"Tillya Tepe, also known as Tillia Tepe or Tillā tapa (Persian: طلا تپه‎ ‎), which translates to \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" is indeed an archaeological site located in the northern Afghanistan province of Jowzjan, near Sheberghan. The site was excavated in 1978 by a Soviet-Afghan team led by Greek-Russian archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi, a year before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the discoveries made during this excavation are often referred to as the Bactrian gold. The name \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" may suggest the presence of gold deposits in the area, but it is important to fully understand the site and its context to determine if such an inference is valid. In the context of Tillya Tepe, the primary reason for its association with \\"gold\\" stems not from the presence of gold deposits but rather from the archaeological treasure that was discovered at the site. Tillya Tepe is particularly famous for its association with a collection of around 20,600 gold ornaments, coins, and other precious objects dating back to the 1st century BCE, which makes it one of the most significant and valuable archaeological finds in Afghanistan. These artifacts, which include gold jewelry, belts, buckles, crowns, and more, are believed to be connected to a culture of nomadic peoples (possibly the Kushans) that inhabited the regions of Bactria and Sogdiana. The discovery of these gold items at Tillya Tepe has provided a wealth of information about the craftsmanship, artistic styles, and cultural influences of that era, reflecting the exchange of ideas and techniques between the regions associated with the Silk Road trade routes. So, to infer that Tillya Tepe is known for gold deposits in the area might not be accurate, as the site is primarily known for its archaeological significance related to the discovery of the Bactrian gold treasure. Though the name \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" does have a connotation of gold linked to the location, this association is derived from the treasure trove of gold artifacts, rather than gold deposits themselves. As a result, it is more accurate to emphasize the archaeological value of the site and its connection to the Bactrian gold artifacts, rather than focusing on gold deposits in the area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A telepathic communicator Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Minds Apart\\" Step 1: Setting the premise The movie takes place in a futuristic society where humans are separated into distinct communities based on their inherent psychic abilities. Aura, a gifted teacher specialized in psychic communication, resides in the Telepath Community. Flash, a young and energetic man with latent psychic powers, lives in the neighboring community where people use technology for everyday communication. Step 2: Establishing character motivations and relationships Aura and Flash meet during a rare gathering of representatives from all communities, with the intention to facilitate innovation and unity. As an ambitious soul always eager to learn, Flash shows curiosity about Aura's abilities, which sparks her interest in helping him unlock his innate telepathic potential. Step 3: Introducing conflict Despite their basic psychic differences, Aura and Flash begin secretly meeting for lessons. They encounter a major setback when they discover a hidden plot, led by an influential leader from Flash's community, that seeks to dominate all other communities by controlling their psychics' powers and using them for their own benefit. Step 4: Building tension Aura and Flash work together to master the telepathic communicator, a powerful device that amplifies psychic connections and allows them to communicate instantaneously. Aura teaches Flash how to connect with other psychics across the communities, with the ultimate goal of rallying them against the malicious plot threatening their society's balance and freedom. Step 5: Climax As Flash's abilities grow stronger, the villainous leader begins to suspect their secret collaboration. He launches an aggressive and targeted attack on Aura, who is forced into hiding. In desperation, Flash uses the telepathic communicator to rally the psychics across all communities and successfully mobilizes them against their oppressors. Step 6: Resolution The combined psychic and technological forces, under the guidance of Aura and Flash, defeat the villain and his followers. This victory leads to a greater appreciation for the unique skills and abilities of all communities, encouraging cooperation and the sharing of knowledge. Step 7: Conclusion Aura and Flash's heroics not only save their society from tyranny but also pave the way for a more inclusive, harmonious world. Their personal bond, forged through the telepathic communicator, serves as an inspirational example of what can be achieved when people embrace their differences and unite for the greater good.

Write some highlights for the following article: Detectives investigating the murder of two British tourists on the Thai island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15. The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament. 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers. A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 -  for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder. Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man. DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'

This article: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person from whom the couple inherited the Brownlow estates?, what is it ?

Question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness.

I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on “Wicca.” She got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms. I mumbled behind the books, “Which ONE book would you recommend.” She then handed me Scott Cunningham’s book Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. I purchased the book and took it home. With my dyslexia it was not easy for me to read. But I started reading and plowed through the book. I found many things I was already doing. He talked about things I already understood to be true. The book rang true for me. I dedicated myself to the God and Goddess when I finished the book. Have you ever had any bad experiences after completing a spell?

All these were beautiful places we expected to see before. We really had a fantastic time. On our last night in Paris, after we enjoyed the night sight of the Eiffel Tower, my husband called home.

Whether you're studying English for self-improvement, to advance in your career, or for social reasons, you may encounter challenges, fatigue, and even self-doubt along the way. Nevertheless, with dedication and a solid plan in place, you can forge ahead and ultimately triumph in your quest to conquer the English language. This article offers crucial insights and practical advice on how to stay motivated, practice effectively, think in English, interact with native speakers, and learn from mistakes to accelerate your language learning process. Stay Motivated Motivation is the engine that fuels your journey to English fluency. At the onset, it's essential to identify the reasons and objectives for learning English, create realistic goals, and regularly assess your progress. These elements will help maintain a sense of purpose and direction in your studies. Moreover, it's vital to develop and maintain a positive mindset. Celebrate your achievements—no matter how small—and find inspiration in the progress of others through language-learning communities or by watching films, reading books, or listening to podcasts in English. Practice Every Day Consistency is critical in developing language skills. Dedicate time each day to engage in a variety of activities that encompass the four main language skills: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Tailor your practice sessions according to your preferences and learning style. You may opt for language apps or online platforms, follow English-speaking YouTubers or podcasts, keep a journal, or participate in discussion forums. Integrate English into your daily routines, such as labeling objects at home, describing your activities, and setting your electronic devices to English. Train Yourself to Think in English To think in English, you must immerse yourself in the language and internalize its rhythm, expressions, and nuances. This mental shift may initially feel uncomfortable, but with time, it will become second nature. Try these strategies to train your mind to think in English: 1. Practice self-talk: Have conversations with yourself or describe your experiences and thoughts aloud or in your mind in English. 2. Visualize scenarios: Imagine hypothetical situations or real-life experiences, forming English sentences to describe the events or emotions. 3. Translate your thoughts: Whenever you think in your native language, try to mentally translate these thoughts into English. 4. Use English language media: Consuming English-speaking films, TV shows, and podcasts can help familiarize yourself with the flow of conversation and idiomatic expressions. Make Friends with English Speakers Interacting with native English speakers provides invaluable insights into the language's cultural contexts and allows you to practice real-life conversations. Forge friendships by joining language exchange groups, participating in online discussion forums or social media groups, or volunteering at local events or organizations. You may even find a language partner to engage in regular conversation practice, which will help improve your listening comprehension, pronunciation, vocabulary, and speaking skills. Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes Mistakes are an inevitable part of the learning process—embrace them as valuable opportunities for growth. Maintain a receptive attitude towards constructive feedback, and use it to assess your progress and inform your practice. Reflect on errors by analyzing and correcting them and actively seeking help and advice from peers, teachers, or native speakers. Through self-awareness, persistence, and continuous learning, your confidence and fluency in English will strengthen over time. Conclusion In conclusion, the road to English fluency is paved with challenges that can be surmounted through motivation, consistent practice, mental immersion in the language, making connections with native speakers, and embracing mistakes as learning opportunities. By adopting these strategies, you will not only accelerate your language learning but also cultivate an enriching and transformative experience that will enhance various aspects of your life. Stay dedicated to your mission, and watch as your world expands through the power of English."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Woodrow Wilson Guthrie (; July 14, 1912 - October 3, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter, one of the most significant figures in American folk music; his songs, including social justice songs, such as \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", have inspired several generations both politically and musically. He wrote hundreds of political, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, Dust Bowl Ballads, is included on Mojo magazine's 100 Records That Changed The World. Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. During the Dust Bowl period, Guthrie joined the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for work, leaving his wife and children in Texas. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by these working-class people.  During the late part of that decade, he achieved fame with radio partner Maxine \\"Lefty Lou\\" Crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial hillbilly music and traditional folk music. Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family, who were still living in Texas. While appearing on the commercial radio station KFVD, owned by a populist-minded New Deal Democrat, Frank W. Burke, Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that would eventually appear on Dust Bowl Ballads.  While at KFVD, Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist Thomas Mooney, believed by many to be wrongly convicted in a case that was a cause celebre of the time. Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including Will Geer (who, in turn, introduced Guthrie to John Steinbeck). Robbin remained Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California. Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that \\"the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party\\", he was never a member of the party. He was noted as a fellow traveler--an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while not subject to party discipline. Guthrie wrote a column for the Communist newspaper, People's World. The column, titled \\"Woody Sez\\", appeared a total of 174 times from May 1939 to January 1940. \\"Woody Sez\\" was not explicitly political, but was about current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic; they were published as a collection after Guthrie's death. Steve Earle said of Guthrie, \\"I don't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer. He was a writer who lived in very political times.\\"  With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff \\"spinning apologia\\" for the Soviet Union. Both Robbin and Guthrie left the station. Without the daily radio show, his prospects for employment diminished, and Guthrie and his family returned to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary Guthrie was happy to return to Texas, Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer's invitation to New York City and headed east.

He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1940 and with the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks in 1942. Evashevski served as the head football coach at Hamilton College in 1941, Washington State University from 1950 to 1951, and the University of Iowa from 1952 to 1960, compiling a career record of 68-35-6. Evashevski's 1958 Iowa team went 8-1-1, winning the Big Ten Conference title and defeating the California Golden Bears in the 1959 Rose Bowl. \\"People in the Midwest are my people and I wanted to be back among them...And, of course, I don't have to tell you what I think of Big Ten football.

Evashevski nearly took the head coaching job at Indiana University, but Fritz Crisler urged him to consider Iowa. He felt that it would be easier to attain statewide support at Iowa than in Indiana, where Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame shared the spotlight. Evashevski was familiar with Iowa City from his stint with the Naval Pre-Flight School. Crisler was the man who recommended Evashevski to Iowa's athletic director, Paul Brechler. Crisler did warn Brechler, however, that Evashevski was \\"a tough, stubborn Polack, and you might have to put the reins on him.\\"  In 1952, Iowa football had only had three winning seasons in the previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades.

Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, starting the year 0-2. But Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, \\"Do you think Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?\\" Evashevski snapped, \\"Why in the hell do you think I took the job?\\" Afterwards, a photographer noted, \\"I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football.\\" Entity:","output":"The text is about Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski, an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Fourteen people were killed and another 60 were injured in Indonesia over a four-day period as a result of Cyclone Iggy, according to the country's National Disaster Management Agency. Most of those who died were struck by falling trees or debris from strong winds, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. More than 2,000 homes were also damaged in 35 towns or cities in Java and Bali between Wednesday and Sunday, he said. The government has provided food and aid to the areas affected, the agency said. As of Sunday, Iggy was off the northwestern coast of Australia, said Tom Sater, meteorologist for CNN International. In anticipation of the storm,","output":"Indonesian authorities had put in place evacuation plans and emergency response teams, allocating resources to manage the unfolding situation. However, the severity of Cyclone Iggy caught many residents by surprise, with its heavy rainfall, strong winds, and localized flooding in several provinces. Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, expressed deep condolences for the victims and urged all related government agencies to work together in the aftermath of the cyclone to conduct search-and-rescue operations, provide medical help to the injured, and restore damaged infrastructure. He also urged residents in the affected areas to remain calm and follow the guidance of local authorities to ensure their safety. In the following weeks, the Indonesian government worked closely with local governments, the military, and humanitarian organizations such as the Indonesian Red Cross and international aid groups to provide much-needed relief to affected communities. Efforts were focused on clearing debris, restoring damaged infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and utilities, and providing temporary shelter for displaced families. Disaster management experts from around the world were invited to assess the situation and offer recommendations, aiming to improve Indonesia's emergency preparedness and response capabilities to minimize the loss of life and damage in future natural disasters. Weather agencies and researchers also collaborated on developing early warning systems, conducting investigations to understand the changing patterns of cyclones in the region. Meanwhile, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology kept a close eye on Cyclone Iggy as it approached the northwestern coast of Australia, issuing warnings and advice for residents and maritime vessels. The storm was projected to weaken as it moved further southward, reducing its impact on the Australian mainland. In the wake of Cyclone Iggy, the global community rallied behind Indonesia, offering condolences, financial support, and resources for rebuilding the affected communities. International organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank pledged assistance in the form of grants, loans, and technical assistance. Over time, with the collaborative efforts of national and international stakeholders, affected communities gradually recovered from the devastation left behind by Cyclone Iggy. They were able to rebuild their homes, schools, and businesses, while also addressing the broader challenges of climate change and disaster resilience. Although Cyclone Iggy left a tragic toll on human lives and property in Indonesia, it also served as a reminder of the importance of coordinated disaster preparedness and response efforts. The lessons learned and the progress made in the wake of this disaster have the potential to save many lives and mitigate the impact of future storms in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Her head.  for the following movie plot:  In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her.

To achieve this, we need to get rid of 8143 from the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 8143 from both sides of the equation, which results in: 307q + 8143 - 8143 = -3830 - 8143, which simplifies to: 307q = -11973. Now, to isolate 'q', we need to get rid of 307.

Dripping with chandeliers and lined with gold, this - of course - was Joan Rivers' home. A dazzling gem of old-school showbusiness, it seems only right that her living room ceilings scaled 30ft-high, and velvet drapes framed the vast windows. The 5,000-square-foot penthouse is held up by gold pillars. And in every corner of the opulent New York apartment sit stacks of index cards with jokes spanning her entire career. Scroll down for video. Opulent: The drawing room in Joan Rivers's Upper East Side condo is a sea of pink and gold velvet, with a piano in the corner, lit by three glittering chandeliers. The money shot: Stacks of the biting and controversial jokes that made Joan Rivers a star are scattered around the apartment. In progress: Among her extensive archive there were files of uncompleted jokes ready to be worked on. The comedienne, who died last week at the age of 81, once described the Upper East Side condo as 'where Marie Antoinette would have lived if she had the money'. The limestone mansion was built in 1910 for society figure John R Drexel and his socialite wife. In 1959, it welcomed Ernest Hemingway as a tenant in one of the one-bedroom apartments. He installed a study and hoped to write but found they city too oppressive and soon left. Tributes: Bouquets of flowers have been lain across the marble stairs outside the cast iron front door of the Manhattan apartment following Rivers's death. A pillar of showbusiness: Like Rivers, who died last week at 81, the New York apartment lined with pillars and mirrors is a star of the city, valued at around 35million. Renaissance style: Rivers once described her home with marble statues and cast-iron décor as 'where Marie Antoinette would live if she had the money' Sweeping: To get up to the glittering penthouse, next door to Bette Midler's home, the star would have to scale this vast marble staircase helped by a carved iron rail. Finally, in the 1980s, Rivers descended on the lavish property, called in developers to strip away layers of paint and coat it with gold. The Renaissance-themed bedroom has a four poster bed draped in white lace, surrounded by vases of white lilies and demure paintings. But the soft style is vamped up in one of the numerous living spaces, which has leopard-print carpet and deep red chairs. And the gregarious performer treated every day like a show as her bathroom looks like the backstage of a theatre. Elegant: The bedroom, complete with a four poster bed and lacy drapes and a permanent stock of fresh lilies, is 'as elegant and beautiful as she was', the realtor said. Backstage: She prepared for every day as if she was going to perform, starting in this bulb-lined bathroom which resembled backstage at a theatre. Painstaking: Never one to emerge without a made up face, Joan had an extensive collection of eyeliner, lip liner, eyelash curlers and mascara in little silver pots. Rivers had tried to sell the property a number of times. She first listed it on the market in 2009, when she planned to move to the West Coast to be closer to her daughter, Melissa Rivers. The latest attempt was in 2012 went it was listed with an asking price of 29.5 million. Now, it may be worth considerably more, with similar-sized apartments in the area on the market for 35 million. Cosy: This off-shoot of the vast living area is much smaller but still a treasure trove of silver, gold and pink, with a potted orchid and a mahogany table. Fashion police officer: This is a sneak peek inside the decadent wardrobe of the Fashion Police presenter, who revelled in slating other stars' sartorial mishaps. Exquisite: The living room, with a flat screen TV tucked into a book case, boasts a wood fire, framed artworks, and an oriental rug. Gregarious: The comedienne who entertained the world with her risque jokes spent her time in this leopard print room with stacks of books. In demand: In 2009, Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi allegedly asked to rent the penthouse of the limestone mansion with a cast-iron front door (right) One notable offer allegedly came from the Libyan dictator Muammur Gaddafi in 2009. According to Rivers, his advisers got in touch with her broker offering to rent it for 200,000 a week. She said at the time: 'I thought it was great.

To understand the reasons behind this, let's break down the sentence and analyze its different components: 1. The sentence starts with \\"an encyclopedia of cliches,\\" which implies that the subject contains repetitive, unoriginal, or overused elements. This is considered a negative aspect as it does not provide any fresh or innovative content to the audience. 2. The phrase \\"shoplifts shamelessly\\" further emphasizes a negative sentiment, as the word \\"shamelessly\\" indicates a lack of restraint or remorse in reproducing material from other sources. This suggests that the subject is not only unoriginal but also does so without any sense of guilt or acknowledging its lack of creativity. 3. The sentence mentions \\"farewell-to-innocence movies\\" such as \\"The Wanderers\\" and \\"A Bronx Tale\\" as sources from which the subject \\"shoplifts.\\" By referencing these movies, the writer implies that the subject attempts to replicate the success of these well-regarded films but fails to do so. 4. The phrase \\"without cribbing any of their intelligence\\" serves as a final critique by highlighting that the subject not only borrows aspects from more successful films but also misses out on the intelligence and depth that made those movies worth watching. By stating this, the writer confirms that the subject is indeed inferior in comparison.

We want to find out what \\"b\\" is. Here's our problem:  4*b + 0*b + 56 + 54 = 9*b First, let's simplify what we can: 0*b equals to 0 (since anything multiplied by 0 is 0, imagine if you had 0 apples, no matter how many times you multiply it, you will not have more apples) 56 + 54 can be added together which will give us 110 (you can double check by adding the numbers to each other) Now our problem looks like this: 4*b + 110 = 9*b To solve for b, we want the b's on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's move the 4*b from the left side to the right side by subtracting 4*b from both sides: 110 = 9*b - 4*b Now, subtract 4*b from 9*b: 110 = 5*b Almost there! Now we need to find out what b is. To do that, we need to divide both sides by 5: 110 ÷ 5 = 5*b ÷ 5 22 = b Yay! We found out that b is 22. Good job!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: For centuries, the body's blood has been linked closely with the emotions.People who show no human emotions or feelings, are said to be cold-blooded killer.For example, the police are searching for a cold-blooded killer.He seems to kill for no reason, and no emotion, as if taking someone's life as nothing. Cold can affect other parts of the body.The expression \\"get cold feet\\" has nothing to do with cold or your feet.The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do.For example, you agree to be president of an organization.But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned, and all the work of the organizations will be your responsibility.You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation. The expression \\"give someone the cold shoulder\\" probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face to face.You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.Or, to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish.It is a person.But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.Now a cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feelings, broke the hearts of their lovers. \\"Out in the cold\\" means not getting something that everybody else got.A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise----he was left out in the cold.And it is not a pleasant place to be.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.  After reading the above, is \\"European 1498\\" the correct answer to the question \\"In what town and in what year was Durer born?\\"?","output":"No, \\"European 1498\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"In what town and in what year was Durer born?\\".

The sale fell though so Robin had put the cart before the horse.  And I was wondering Due to this Robin will feel how? A:","output":"Due to the situation, Robin is likely to experience a range of emotions and feelings. Here's a detailed breakdown of what she might be going through: 1. Disappointment: Robin was certain that she would make the sale, which is why she spent her commission prematurely. When the sale falls through, the first feeling she might experience is disappointment in herself for not being able to close the deal. This disappointment could be intensified by the fact that she was already counting on the money from the commission. 2. Frustration: Besides disappointment, Robin might also experience a sense of frustration. This could be directed towards herself for spending the commission ahead of time, or towards external factors that contributed to the sale falling through. This frustration might make her question her abilities or blame external circumstances for her failure. 3. Anxiety: As Robin spent her commission before making the sale, she might now be facing financial difficulties or struggling to make ends meet. This can cause anxiety about her financial stability, which could lead to stress and panic in her personal and professional life. 4. Regret: Robin will likely feel regret after realizing that she put the cart before the horse by spending her commission too soon. This regret might make her question her decision-making skills and create self-doubts in her abilities and judgment. 5. Embarrassment: The fact that others might be aware of Robin's premature spending could result in her feeling embarrassed about the situation. She might feel ashamed for being overly confident or too quick with her actions, leading to a hit on her self-esteem. 6. Determination: Despite the setback, Robin might also feel motivated and determined to overcome this failure and prove herself in future sales opportunities. This determination could push her to work harder, hone her skills and be more careful with her finances in the future. 7. Lesson Learned: Eventually, Robin may come to accept the situation as a valuable lesson learned. She might recognize the importance of not counting chickens before they hatch and strive to avoid such mistakes in the future. This realization can lead to personal growth and improved decision making in her career and personal life. In summary, Robin will likely experience a mix of emotions, including disappointment, frustration, anxiety, regret, embarrassment, determination, and personal growth. The extent of these feelings and the order in which they arise may vary depending on her personality and circumstances. However, it's essential for Robin to learn from this experience, manage her emotions effectively, and apply the lessons learned to prevent similar situations in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? There is a territorial waters dispute.","output":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"There is a territorial waters dispute,\\" does indeed follow from the provided text. From this text, we understand that there is a lingering dispute, a consequence of the 1965 war, over the demarcation of the maritime boundary. This conflict is expressed through the problems that fishermen from both sides of this unspecified boundary are currently experiencing. The inability of the fishing boats to determine when they have crossed into the other country's territory due to the lack of navigational tools reflects that the boundary in question is poorly defined on the field. Hence, this assertion is based on the fact that the maritime boundary dispute has not yet been definitively resolved. Moreover, this boundary dispute puts these fishermen potentially at risk as the inadvertent crossing of a maritime boundary might be interpreted as an intrusion into the other side's territory. This could lead to several problems, including detention of fishermen, confiscation of their boats, or international diplomatic incidents. This challenge that fishermen face emphasizes the complexities arising from the territorial waters disputes. However, without more specific context from the previous sentence, it's difficult to know who the \\"both sides\\" are and what specific part of the territorial waters are in dispute. The 1965 war reference could be between many different sets of countries, so the particular case in reference isn't lucid.  In conclusion, while more information helps to fully comprehend the context of the dispute, the next sentence about the territorial waters dispute certainly follows from the given text.

One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic  material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Now, I have a new situation: Two countries had big rivers discharging in the same ocean. Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers.  Answer this question please: Which country caused more hazardous chemicals to reach into the ocean? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Russia would likely be the country causing more hazardous chemicals to reach into the ocean. This is because Russia was practicing conventional agriculture and using fertilizers, which are known contributors to marine pollution as described in your initial background. They often contain chemicals and particles that could be potentially hazardous, such as phosphates and nitrates, which can leach into waterways and eventually end up in the ocean. On the other hand, Finland, which was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, would likely have implemented measures to minimize or prevent such pollution, resulting in fewer hazardous substances entering the ocean from its rivers.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: Two regions, region A and region B, shared a common border, a river. Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B was more favorable for the developement of Non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes.  But I can use this background: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.  What is an answer for this question: Which region had more sulfate reduction? The answer is:","output":"Region A had more sulfate reduction. The question presents two regions with distinct environmental conditions for bacterial growth and metabolism. Region A is favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B favors the development of non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. Both regions indeed have the traits that contribute to ecological stability and the well-being of human society. However, the primary focus of the question is to determine which region exhibited more sulfate reduction. Sulfate reduction is a critical function provided by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). These specific bacteria facilitate an anaerobic reduction process where sulfate (SO4²⁻) serves as the terminal electron acceptor. Consequently, they break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, producing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a side product. This metabolic process plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of sulfur and carbon cycles in various ecosystems, such as aquatic environments, sediments, and soils. Additionally, as mentioned in the background information, the activities of SRB are known to help produce highly toxic forms of mercury, which are relevant to pollution responses. As Region A is specifically described as favoring sulfate-reducing bacteria, it stands to reason that this area had a higher concentration of these organisms, thus leading to more extensive sulfate reduction. Their presence and the metabolic processes they carry out greatly contribute to the environmental conditions of the region, making it particularly rich in sulfate reduction. On the other hand, Region B's environment is better suited for non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. These bacteria, although ecologically significant, do not directly contribute to sulfate reduction like the SRB in Region A. Instead, they engage in fermentation processes to generate energy and reducing power under specific conditions or can switch their metabolic pathways depending on the environment – like obtaining energy from nitrate in lieu of oxygen. In conclusion, due to the optimal environmental conditions and the prevalence of sulfate-reducing bacteria, Region A had more sulfate reduction compared to Region B, whose conditions were more conducive to the growth and metabolic activities of non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 11:40 EST, 12 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:44 EST, 12 April 2013. After years of  iPhone and iPod owners getting turned away for replacements because their devices indicated water damage, and thus a voided warranty, Apple has agreed to pay out 53 million in a class action suit. Settled: Apple has agreed to pay 53 million in class action suit that said it unfairly denied customers replacement devices. The settlement could affect hundreds of thousands of customers who brought their malfunctioning devices to Apple, only to be told they were no longer covered by warranties because a little sticker inside had turned a shade of pink or red. No matter the problem, the company refused to replace any device with a pink or red sticker and must now pay what amounts to about 200 per claimant in the suit. Only owners of original, 3G, and 3GS iPhones as well as first, second, and third generations of the iPod Touch are affected by the settlement. So, who’s to blame? Not us, says Apple. Signed Wednesday, the tech giant admitted to no wrongdoing in the settlement. The company that makes the ‘Liquid Indicator Strips,’ meanwhile, said their product may have been the culprit in so many voided warranties. Though Apple owns the patent to the strips, maker 3M indicated that humidity and not water contact could have turned some of the white stickers pink, misleading customer service representatives who examined the devices. Apple, nonetheless, may have learned of the issue years ago. Denied: For years, Apple routinely voided warranties to customers whose devices indicated water damage. According to a report in The Atlantic, the company ‘quietly tweaked’ its water damage policy in 2011 to be a little more giving. The policy now indicates that devices with an activated LCI may still be replaced ‘if a customer disputes’ that water made contact with the device as long as there are no signs of corrosion. However, the policy stopped short of faulting the indicator strips, which the policy says ‘are designed not to be activated by temperature or humidity that are within the product's operating requirements.’ That means newer devices were not covered in the suit, payouts for which could go up or down depending on number of claims submitted. Blame: Apple claimed no wrongdoing in the suit while makers of the 'Liquid Contact Indicator' strips admitted they may have been misleading. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Plot title: Beneath the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an ancient nuclear bomb. Brent and Nova are captured and telepathically... My question: Where was the cave located which Brent and Nova hid after their escape? Answer:","output":"The cave where Brent and Nova hid after their escape was located in the fictional universe of the film, in the Forbidden Zone. It's important to note, however, that upon exploration within the cave, Brent discovers that it is, in fact, the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway. This revelation is crucial as it makes him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future, rather than a different planet as he initially believed. The transformation of the bustling and iconic Queensboro Plaza station into an eerie, desolate, and unrecognizable cave is a poignant testament to the cataclysmic events that led to the resurgence of a newfound civilization run by apes on Earth. As such, while the cave is initially a mere hideout for Brent and Nova, its ultimate discovery as a relic of a bygone era effectively ties into the overarching narrative of the movie and reveals in no uncertain terms to Brent where and when he truly is."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Wesker injects her with Anti-Virus before the autopilot crashes the plane. Only Alice survives. Months later, Alice travels to Alaska in an airplane, tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called Arcadia; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of L.A., where they find survivors living in a prison surrounded by infected. They meet Luther West (Boris Kodjoe), Wendell (Fulvio Cecere), Crystal Waters (Kacey Barnfield), Bennett (Kim Coates), Kim Yong (Norman Yeung), and Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). With their help, Alice lands on the prison's roof and learns Arcadia isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no-one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, Chris (Wentworth Miller), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route for freedom.

And the answer is...","output":"Step-by-step solution: 1. Begin by looking at the equation: 35*r - 27*r = -32. 2. In order to solve for 'r,' we need to combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation. Since both terms have 'r' as their variable, we can combine them by subtracting 27*r from 35*r:    (35 - 27) * r = -32 3. Simplify the expression within the parentheses:    8 * r = -32 4. To isolate 'r,' divide both sides of the equation by 8:    r = -32 / 8 5. Divide -32 by 8 to find the value of 'r':    r = -4 Thus, the answer is r = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if that's an overstatement  , it's close to the truth. Scientists say teens should sleep nine hours each night. But that's hard. Some are even \\"pulling all-nighters\\"  . These students must hand in their homework the next day but they haven't done it. In the morning they don't look healthy and you can tell who's been doing it. One of my classmates did a survey on the topic. She found that most kids pull all-nighters to finish homework, but some do it for other reasons, such as playing computer games! Maybe our lack  of sleep is because of laziness -- I think I'm a rather lazy student -- or maybe it's because we have too much to do in American high schools. I usually go to bed around midnight. If I stayed up past 1:30 am, I wouldn't get any work done. I'd be falling asleep at my computer. My classes begin at 7:30 am. I'm partly awake in my first class. By the second, I'm a little sleepy. By my third class, I'm sleepy. By midday I'm finally fully awake. But by 3:00 pm, I'm slowing down again. Yet I get more sleep than usual students. Most American high schools seem to have a similar  problem with sleepy students. High school classes start at 7:30 am, so students have to get up one and a half hours before that to get ready and catch the bus. It's believed that lack of sleep can be bad for both grades and health. Some schools are paying attention. Classes in those schools start at 8:30 am.

Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include  Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann  played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916.   Recorded Rhinemaidens have included Sena Jurinac for Furtwängler and RAI, Lucia Popp and Gwyneth Jones for Georg Solti, and Helen Donath and Edda Moser for Karajan.

Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability. Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory. Altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.

Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production.  Which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods?  Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: A:","output":"Grape farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods. Their depleted soils and low crop production indicate that they likely have not implemented agroforestry systems with groundcover plants to help prevent soil erosion and increase soil cover, leading to reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff for cleaner water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Womb Movie plot: The film commences with a pregnant woman (Eva Green) telling her unborn child that the father has departed for good, but that together they will start a new life. A love story is then told between two children, Rebecca and Tommy, who swear each other eternal love. When Rebecca departs suddenly for Japan with her mother, the two are separated. Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship. Tommy is a political activist fighting against the biotech corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by cloning. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches. Rebecca, herself a computer programmer of leak detection sonar software for underground storage containers, insists on accompanying Tommy. Driving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle. Rebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and gives birth to a new Tommy by Caesarean section. Tommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship.

There are several factors that contribute to their dissatisfaction, as outlined below: 1. Damaged condition of the product: The customer mentioned that they received the DVD with a cracked case and a damaged DVD holder. The fact that the holder is unable to firmly hold the DVDs can be seen as a serious issue, as it can lead to further damage of the DVDs or make them difficult to access. 2. One of the DVDs itself was damaged: Adding to the previous issue, the customer also described one of the DVDs as having a crack in the center. This can compromise the playback quality or prevent the DVD from being played at all, which is a major source of disappointment. 3. Difficulty in returning the item: The customer expressed that they cannot easily return the item due to living outside the US. This adds to their frustration, as they cannot easily exchange the damaged product for a better-quality one. If the return process was convenient, their dissatisfaction might have been tempered by the prospect of receiving a replacement. 4. Packaging by Amazon was not the issue: The customer acknowledged that the packaging by Amazon appeared fine, which suggests that the damage to the product most likely occurred at the seller's facility or even earlier. This shifts the blame toward the seller, which contributes to their overall dissatisfaction. 5. Wonderful content, but overshadowed by negative experience: The customer did mention that the content of the DVDs is \\"wonderful,\\" which indicates that they might have been satisfied if the product itself was not damaged. However, the wonderful content couldn't compensate for the negative aspects resulting from the physical condition of the product. In conclusion, the customer is clearly dissatisfied with their purchase due to the damaged condition of the product, the difficulty in returning or exchanging it, and the fact that Amazon's packaging was not the issue.

Article: There are new findings that not enough sleep may cause people to gain weight.Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially  for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night. The Public Library of Science published the findings in its journal Medicine.Internet users can read the full study,free of charge,at plos.org.

By Barbara Starr      Just days before he leaves office, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is recommending military pay be limited, effectively decreasing troop salaries next year.      Panetta will recommend to Congress that military salaries be limited to a 1% increase in 2014. The Pentagon has calculated that the Labor Department's 2014 Employment Cost Index is expected to be above 1% but wants to still cut back on pay because of \\"budget uncertainties,\\" a department official told CNN. In 2013, a 1.7% increase was approved, based on the index, which has been the basis for military pay for the last several years.      Three Pentagon officials have confirmed details of the plan to CNN. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also agreed to Panetta's proposed pay plan. Final approval for the pay would come from Congress in the form of the 2014 budget.      The recommendation is tied to the Defense Department's 2014 budget recommendation, which was expected to be sent to Congress this month, one of the officials said. But the officials acknowledge it is going to be seen as an effort to push Congress to stop the automatic budget cuts that could go into effect if no deal is reached on spending reductions.      ALSO: Panetta warns spending cuts will degrade military readiness      The decision comes as the secretary is stepping up the rhetoric about dire cuts at the Pentagon if sequestration goes into effect. President Obama in 2012 walled off military pay from cuts, so if this current pay plan goes into effect, it's widely seen as \\"cutting our pay,\\" one military officer familiar with the plan told CNN. \\"It's a smart move, it puts it in Congress' hands,\\" he said.      Panetta, in one of his last official speeches as secretary of defense, told an audience at Georgetown University on Wednesday that the Pentagon faced \\"the most serious readiness crisis in over a decade.\\"      The defense secretary outlined a series of possible cuts should the Pentagon be forced to find half a trillion dollars more in savings. He warned that 800,000 civilian workers could furloughed for 22 days and that the Army would need to cut back on training and maintenance, putting two-thirds of combat teams at \\"reduced readiness levels.\\" Pacific naval operations could be cut by as much a third, and Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance could be cut.      CNN has also learned that this week, the Navy is expected to announce it does not have the money to pay for refueling and maintenance of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. That will essentially mean the Navy is short a carrier and overseas deployments will be cut.      \\"No good options exist,\\" Panetta said. ||||| Washington (CNN) -- Furloughed workers, reduced combat readiness, shrunken naval operations and cuts to Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance.      Defense Secretary Leon Panetta listed those consequences as he provided a stark warning on Wednesday about the effects of impending budget cuts on the military unless Congress acts to avert them.      The result, he said, would be \\"the most serious readiness crisis\\" faced by the armed services in over a decade.      Panetta's address at Georgetown University, which he called \\"hopefully one of my last speeches as secretary of defense,\\" included the first details of how the Pentagon would deal with the automatic spending cuts -- or sequestration in congressional jargon -- set to trigger March 1 across federal agencies.      For the Pentagon, sequestration would mean almost 500 billion in cuts over 10 years. For 2013 alone, some 46 billion in reduced spending would result in \\"a serious disruption in defense programs and a sharp decline in our military readiness,\\" Panetta said.      Opinion: How to avoid job-killing budget cuts      \\"There are no good options\\" to deal with the situation, he continued, saying 46,000 department jobs would be at risk and more damaging measures in coming months could include:      -- Furloughing as many as 800,000 civilian workers for up to 22 days;      -- Cutting back on Army training and maintenance, which would reduce readiness of combat brigades outside Afghanistan;      -- Shrinking naval operations; and,      -- Reducing Air Force flying hours and weapons systems maintenance.      \\"This is not a game. This is reality,\\" Panetta said, his voice rising. \\"These steps would seriously damage a fragile American economy and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe.\\"      His comments sought to increase pressure on Republicans and Democrats to reach agreement on deficit-reduction steps, thereby avoiding the across-the-board spending cuts of sequestration that were part of a 2011 deal that raised the federal debt ceiling.      On Tuesday, President Barack Obama called for a short-term deal to put off the cuts so Congress could continue work on a permanent fix that provides desired reductions in the federal deficit.      Obama made clear that he still wants a broader deficit-reduction agreement with Republicans that includes spending cuts, some entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks.      However, Obama said, with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown, Congress should pass a temporary fix that would allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan.      By the numbers: Recent defense spending      \\"Compromise is a way to achieve it,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday, noting that Obama continued to offer proposals to cut spending and increase revenue that shifted to the middle from his original stances.      However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused Obama and Democrats of avoiding needed spending cuts and trying to put off tough decisions instead of facing their responsibilities as elected leaders.      Deficit reduction should focus on cutting government spending and must include savings from popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Boehner insisted on Wednesday.      \\"At some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem,\\" he told reporters. \\"I've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years. I've had enough of it. It's time to act.\\"      Boehner also echoed Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in opposing Obama's call for including more tax revenue in the mix.      Opinion: Republicans, be smart about defense cuts      Also Wednesday, GOP legislators proposed 85 billion in reduced spending through attrition -- or not filling all vacated government jobs -- and freezing congressional pay as an alternative to the sequestration this year.      They said the plan achieves the same amount of deficit reduction without more tax revenue sought by Obama and Democrats.      The debate continues the ideological showdown between Republicans and Democrats over the size and role of government.      Republicans driven by their conservative base want to reduce government and taxes to fund it, arguing that is the best way to grow the economy.      Democrats promote a strong government safety net through entitlements and support programs that they say bolsters middle-class opportunity necessary for economic growth.      Congress and the White House agreed to the sequestration cuts as part of the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government's borrowing limit to meet its obligations.      The automatic spending cuts never were intended to become law, but instead were designed to be so unwieldy and overbearing that Congress would reach a broader deficit reduction deal to avoid them.      Military pay in play in game of political poker      Deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012, an election year. Initially the cuts were to go into effect on January 2, but the government delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013.      In his speech, Panetta referred to what he described as \\"partisan dysfunction in Congress\\" that he said threatens the quality of life and national security of the nation.      Instead of making tough decisions to resolve problems, political leaders from both parties let issues become crises that require immediate but insufficient responses, he said.      \\"It's the easy way out,\\" Panetta said, adding that there is a price to be paid for such an approach.      \\"You lose the trust of the American people,\\" he said. \\"You create an aura of constant uncertainty that pervades every issue and gradually undermines the very credibility of the nation.\\"      CNN Explains: Sequestration      In another effort to stoke public alarm over the pending cuts, Carney told reporters that top defense contractors met at the White House with senior administration officials to discuss the impacts on their industry.      According to Carney, those impacts would be overwhelmingly negative.      \\"It's not just a parlor game here in Washington,\\" he said of the issue. \\"These are real-world decisions that significantly affect the economy and the American people.\\"      Obama said Tuesday that he still supports a broader deficit deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by Republicans -- such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government -- should be part of it.      Boehner, however, reiterated the GOP call for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and reforms -- a reference to changes in entitlement programs.      A last-second agreement in the previous Congress that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit-reduction package.      That measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving Obama and Congress in which other steps to increase government revenue, such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations, were considered but not included in the final deal.      How our tribes cause gridlock in Congress      Obama and Democrats now want such revenue-raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts.      McConnell expressed his opposition to such a move Tuesday, saying, \\"The American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law.\\"      CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suggests limiting military pay in 2014 due to \\"budget uncertainties.\\" This would involve decreasing the salary of troops next year.

After she leaves Remy when Jake commits a repossession in front of their home, Remy decides to transfer to a sales job, much to Jake's chagrin.As his final repossession job, Remy is sent to the residence of a music producer, whose work he happens to admire. After allowing the man enough time to complete a song, Remy prepares to repossess his heart. When he attempts to use a heart defibrillator to stop the unit, the defibrillator malfunctions, sending a large electrical shock through his body and knocking him into a coma. When Remy awakens from his coma, he is informed by Jake and Frank, his co-workers, that the shock severely damaged his heart. He can be fitted with an artificial heart, or die. After Remy attempts to flee the hospital, he reluctantly agrees to the procedure.Remy goes back to work, but is unable to perform his job, because he is just like the people he is repossessing from. He attempts to transition into sales, but quickly finds himself behind in payments. Jake takes Remy to the outskirts of the city to a nest, which is a collection of people who have past due accounts with the Union, but are fleeing to avoid being repossessed. Remy is again unable to perform a repossession, after which he is abandoned by Jake until he can perform his job. Remy is attacked by a pair of men from whom he was...

A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the question The question asks about the greatest contribution of arthropods to the human food supply. We need to determine which of the given options (vegetation, reproduction, hibernation, or pollination) has the most significant impact on the human food supply. Step 2: Consider the importance of each option - Vegetation: Arthropods play a role in maintaining plant life through predation and decomposition. However, this indirect contribution does not have a major impact on the human food supply. - Reproduction: Arthropods reproduce at a high rate, but this would benefit humans primarily through the consumption of arthropods, such as insects or crustaceans, which have a minor presence in our food supply compared to other sources. - Hibernation: This refers to the period of inactivity for some arthropods during unfavorable conditions. This does not directly affect human food supply. - Pollination: Many arthropods, especially insects such as bees, play a crucial role in the pollination of a wide variety of plants. Pollination is required for plants to produce fruits, seeds, and vegetables, which are essential components of the human diet. Step 3: Choose the most significant contribution Based on the impact of each option, pollination (option D) has the greatest contribution to the human food supply, as it allows for the growth and development of a vast array of plant-derived food sources.

Many young ladies fell in love with him including the nymph : Echo. Nymphs were lively spirits who lived near streams and lakes and protected trees in the forest. Echo had upset the Queen of the Gods; Hera. As a punishment Hera made Echo unable to speak except to repeat the last three words of the person she was talking to. Poor Echo fell in love with Narcissus but could never tell him how she felt. Narcissus teased her and she ran away with tears pouring down her face. Aphrodite, the goddess of love saw what happened and decided to punish Narcissus. As he came to a pool of water Narcissus saw his reflection  and fell in love with the vision he saw. It was of course his own reflection. Poor Narcissus watched his own reflection, every time he tried to touch the face of the vision he loved it broke up on the shimmering surface of the water. Narcissus stopped eating, lost his beautiful looks and desired to get his love. In the end he anguished gradually and died.

Much has to be done for the producers before putting the products on the shelf. Color, for example, changes a lot according to what the producers are trying to sell. Health foods are packed in greens, yellows or browns because we think of these as healthy colors. When some kind of medicine was brought out recently, researchers found that the color of the package  caused the shoppers to lose interest because they made the product look ineffective .

Given the question: Background: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.  Paragraph: Drought is major concern in the Midwest. To confront the problem scientists are trying to develop drought-resistant crops. To that end, they took a plant that was not exposed to drought. They labeled it as plant A. Then they took a similar plant, and repeatedly exposed it to drought. They labeled it as plant B. They wanted to find out what makes a plant drought-resistant.

What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past.  The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions.  In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Information:  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Khwja Shams-ud-Dn Muammad fe-e Shrz, known by his pen name Hafez (\\"fe\\" 'the memorizer; the (safe) keeper'; 1325/261389/90), was a Persian poet who \\"lauded the joys of love and wine but also targeted religious hypocrisy.\\" His collected works are regarded as a pinnacle of Persian literature and are to be found in the homes of most people in Iran, who learn his poems by heart and still use them as proverbs and sayings. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-14th century Persian writing more than any other author.  - Shiraz (\\"Šrz\\", ) is the sixth most populous city of Iran and the capital of Fars Province (Old Persian as Pârsâ). At the 2011 census, the population of the city was 1,460,665 and its built-up area with \\"Shahr-e Jadid-e Sadra\\" (Sadra New Town) was home to 1,500,644 inhabitants. Shiraz is located in the southwest of Iran on the \\"Roodkhaneye Khoshk\\" (The Dry River) seasonal river. It has a moderate climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years. Shiraz is one of the oldest cities of ancient Persia.  - Qazvin (, also Romanized as \\"Qazvn\\", \\"Caspin\\", \\"Qazwin\\", or \\"Ghazvin\\") is the largest city and capital of the Province of Qazvin in Iran. Qazvin was an ancient capital in the Persian Empire and nowadays is known as the calligraphy capital of Iran. It is famous for its Baghlava, carpet patterns, poets, political newspaper and pahlavi (Middle Persian) influence on its accent. At the 2011 census, its population was 381,598.  - Fars Province (\\"Ostn-e Frs\\") also known as Pars or Persia in historical context, is one of the thirty-one provinces of Iran and known as the cultural capital of Iran. It is in the south of the country, in Iran's Region 2, and its administrative center is Shiraz. It has an area of 122,400 km². In 2011, this province had a population of 4.6 million people, of which 67.6% were registered as urban dwellers (urban/suburbs), 32.1% villagers (small town/rural), and 0.3% nomad tribes. The etymology of the word \\"Persian\\" (From Latin \\"Persia\\", from Ancient Greek (Persis)), found in many ancient names associated with Iran, is derived from the historical importance of this region. Fars Province is the original homeland of the Persian people.  - Nezam od - Din Ubeydollah Zâkâni ( Persian :       ) , or simply Ubayd - i Zkni ( Persian :     c. 1300 -- 1371 CE ) , was a Persian poet and satirist of the 14th century ( Mongol Period ) from the city of Qazvin . He studied in Shiraz , Iran under the best masters of his day , but eventually moved back to his native town of Qazvin . He however preferred Shiraz to Qazvin , as he was a court poet in Shiraz for Shah Abu Ishaq , where a young Hafez was present as well . His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses , often political or bawdy , and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices . He wrote the Resaleh - ye Delgosha , as well as Akhlaq al - Ashraf ( \`\` Ethics of the Aristocracy '' ) and the famous humorous fable Masnavi Mush - O - Gorbeh ( Mouse and Cat ) , which was a political satire . His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written , in league with the other great works of Persian literature . He is one of the most remarkable poets , satirists and social critics of Iran ( Persia ) , whose works have not received proper attention in the past . His books are translated into Russian , Danish , Italian , English , and German ( by Joachim Wohlleben , 2009 : seemingly the first translation of the complete work into a Western language ) .  - The Old Persian language is one of the two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan). Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets, and seals of the Achaemenid era (c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now present-day Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 525 BCE). Recent research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago have unearthed Old Persian tablets (2007). This new text shows that the Old Persian language was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display.  - Shah (pronounced , \\"king\\") is a title given to the emperors, kings, princes and lords of Iran (historically also known as Persia). It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia) namely the Shirvanshahs, the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire (in that context spelled as \\"eh\\"), Mughal emperors of the Indian Subcontinent, the Bengal Sultanate, as well as in Georgia and Afghanistan. In Iran (Persia and Greater Persia) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Persian ruler regarded himself as the \\"Šhanšh\\" (King of Kings) or Emperor of the Persian Empire.  - Middle Persian is the Middle Iranian language or ethnolect of southwestern Iran that during the Sasanian Empire (224654) became a prestige dialect and so came to be spoken in other regions of the empire as well. Middle Persian is classified as a Western Iranian language. It descends from Old Persian and is the linguistic ancestor of Modern Persian.  - Persian literature is one of the world's oldest literatures. It spans two-and-a-half millennia, though much of the pre-Islamic material has been lost. Its sources have been within Greater Iran including present-day Iran, Iraq, the Caucasus, and Turkey, regions of Central and South Asia where the Persian language has historically been either the native or official language. For instance, Rumi, one of best-loved Persian poets, born in Balkh or Vakhsh (in what is now Afghanistan), wrote in Persian, and lived in Konya, then the capital of the Seljuks in Anatolia. The Ghaznavids conquered large territories in Central and South Asia and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from Iran, Mesopotamia, Azerbaijan, the wider Caucasus, Turkey, western parts of Pakistan, India, Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia. Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by ethnic Persians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic, to be included. At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, and Indic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of Persianate cultures.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The junction forward voltage is the voltage applied to the emitter–base junction of a BJT in order to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \\"drive\\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is −2.1 mV/°C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the ideal junction forward voltage?","output":"The ideal junction forward voltage depends on the specific application and the type of transistor being used. However, in general, a lower junction forward voltage is considered better, as it requires less power to drive the transistor, improving overall efficiency and reducing power consumption. For silicon-based bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), the typical forward voltage at the emitter-base junction is around 0.7 V. This value is considered a good balance between providing adequate power to drive the transistor and minimizing power dissipation. However, for other types of transistors or materials used, the junction forward voltage may be different. It is important to note that the junction forward voltage is not a constant value, and its value varies depending on the device's operating temperature. An increase in temperature will result in a decrease in the junction forward voltage, at a rate of approximately -2.1 mV/°C for silicon junctions. This temperature dependence may need to be taken into account in certain applications and compensated with the use of specialized components such as sensistors. To sum up, the ideal junction forward voltage is application-dependent and should be chosen to optimize the performance of the transistor while minimizing power consumption. For typical silicon BJTs, a value of around 0.7 V is commonly used, while other materials or specific use cases may call for different values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I love watching the ufc, and after seeing all the fighters on the cover, i BOUGHT (please i beg forgivness) this movie. Make no mistake, i went into it thinking it wasn't gonna be much more than an action movie. It turned out to be much much less than that. As everyone else already said, lots of T & A, terrible writing, acting...etc. Not one redeemable quality to this movie. NOT ONE!

Please answer the following question: Title: It's a story of her life...not a 'how to' book! Product review: Good Lord. I just read the most recent reviews of this book and was astounded by those who called Rubin 'whiny.' I think they miss the point. Losing weight, for most people- is not easy. In fact for many of us, it's the hardest thing we've ever had to do, and if we were to accurately document the process as Rubin did- it would naturally reflect that pain. It's not a perfect 1-2-3 book on how easy weight loss can be! If that's what you're hoping for- this book may not be for you.However, if what you're looking for is to know that you're not alone, that your pain and fear through this process is not unusual, that you're not the only one who sits in front of the tv stuffing chips down your throat (to be followed by ice cream) with tears streaming down your face...well then give this book a whirl. Because it will inspire you to know that others have healed from this pain...and you will. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"I would say this review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light. The reviewer defends the author against criticisms of being 'whiny' and highlights the relatability of the author's struggles with weight loss. The review emphasizes that the book's aim is to provide comfort and understanding to those experiencing similar challenges, rather than offering step-by-step weight loss advice. However, the reviewer also acknowledges that the book may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those looking for a more straightforward, instructional guide to weight loss. Overall, this review is supportive and positive towards the book, but recognizes that it may not cater to all readers' preferences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are now a part of everyday driving in many counties.These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two.              Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm, Sweden. The center studies human-computer interaction, or HCI, especially communications involving wireless devices. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes until they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\"  Mr. Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. \\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.

Question: What happened to the college after hostile British forces threatened to raze it? Context: Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved.

He always complains about how fast things have changed, and he often says that life was better in the past than today. Now cities are full of cars. Some families even have two or more cars, so parking is becoming a big problem. The traffic in some cities is very bad. Some car drivers drive too fast, so there are more traffic accidents.

Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors  kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official  sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport.

The term \\"Moors\\" refers primarily to the Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and Malta during the Middle Ages. The Moors initially were the Berber autochthones of the Maghreb. The name was later also applied to Arabs. Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people, and the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica observed that \\"The term 'Moors' has no real ethnological value.\\" The first Muslim conquest of Sicily began in 827, though it was not until 902 that almost the entire island was in the control of the Aghlabids, with the exception of some minor strongholds in the rugged interior. During that period some parts of southern Italy fell under Muslim control, most notably the port city of Bari, which formed the Emirate of Bari from 847-871. In 909 the Aghlabid dynasty was replaced by Shiite Fatimids. Four years later, the Fatimid governor was ousted from Palermo when the island declared its independence under Emir Ahmed ibn-Kohrob. The language spoken in Sicily under Muslim rule was Siculo-Arabic.  In 1038, a Byzantine army under George Maniaces crossed the strait of Messina. This army included a corps of Normans that saved the situation in the first clash against the Muslims from Messina. After another decisive victory in the summer of 1040, Maniaces halted his march to lay siege to Syracuse. Despite his success, Maniaces was removed from his position, and the subsequent Muslim counter-offensive reconquered all the cities captured by the Byzantines.  The Norman Robert Guiscard, son of Tancred, invaded Sicily in 1060. The island was split between three Arab emirs, and the Christian population in many parts of the island rose up against the ruling Muslims. One year later, Messina fell, and in 1072 Palermo was taken by the Normans. The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually all of Sicily was taken. In 1091, Noto in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of Malta, the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians. Islamic authors noted the tolerance of the Norman kings of Sicily. Ibn al-Athir wrote: \\"They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the Franks. Because of that, they had great love for King Roger.\\"  The Muslim problem characterized Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily under Holy Roman Emperors Henry VI and his son Frederick II. Many repressive measures were introduced by Frederick II to please the popes, who were intolerant of Islam in the heart of Christendom. This resulted in a rebellion by Sicilian Muslims, which in turn triggered organized resistance and systematic reprisals and marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The complete eviction of Muslims and the annihilation of Islam in Sicily was completed by the late 1240s when the final deportations to Lucera took place.

Life seemed pretty normal and well-balanced for Emily, but little did she know she was the mysterious subject of an intense and twisted lesbian obsession by a woman named Andrea Glassen. Andrea had been covertly monitoring Emily's life from a distance, becoming deeply infatuated with her, and was now intent on not only making Emily aware of Andrea’s unwavering love, but making Emily hers - no matter the cost. One fateful evening, Emily's life took a dark and terrifying turn when a man suddenly forced his way into her apartment. Overwhelmed with panic and fear, she managed to flee the scene unharmed. Shaken by the frightening ordeal, Emily quickly realized that her sense of security was shattered. It was evident that she could no longer stay in her current apartment, so she decided to protect herself by relocating to a new apartment in a different section of the city. She hoped a change of environment would be enough to deter any future threats and secure her safety. What Emily couldn't have known was that Andrea Glassen had been orchestrating these events in order to tighten her invisible grip on Emily's life. Relentless in her pursuit, Andrea decided to exploit Emily's vulnerability by hiring a seemingly harmless taxi driver in the area where Emily had settled in her new home. With the taxi driver as her pawn, Andrea's real intention was to manipulate Emily's every move and gain a valuable recording, providing Andrea with intimate details of Emily's life. Emily, unaware of the danger lurking behind the friendly face of the taxi driver, went about her life as usual, making use of the taxi services provided by Andrea’s accomplice. The taxi driver, after successfully gaining Emily’s trust, presented her with what appeared to be an innocent recording. Unassuming, Emily took the recording not realizing the dangerous and intimate information stored within. This recording had been crafted by Andrea with the purpose of controlling Emily and melding her into Andrea's fantasy. With the carefully planned unfolding of events, Andrea's motives and obsession began to reveal themselves to the authorities. When Emily realized the sinister truth behind the recording, she sought help from the police. To her surprise, they advised her that she needed to get back into that same taxi. This was a ploy by the police to draw Andrea out of hiding and ultimately expose her malicious intentions. Emily, frightened but determined, followed the advice of the authorities and reluctantly reentered the taxi. As the taxi approached its destination, the police, who had been working this case behind the scenes, moved in. With swift precision, they apprehended Andrea Glassen before she could ensnare Emily in her web of obsession and terror. Although it seemed like an impossible task, Emily, now safe and sound, tried to pick up the shattered pieces of her life and move on with newfound strength and resilience. From that moment on, Emily knew she had narrowly escaped a fate too horrid to imagine. She was grateful for the swift response and the support she received from the authorities. Perhaps most importantly, she had learned the importance of remaining vigilant and adaptive in a world filled with unexpected danger. As Emily began to heal and reclaim the pieces of her life, she deeply understood that even in the darkest of times, there were people looking out for her and a light at the end of the tunnel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A girl wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt holds a cup and looks through a book with people photographs and text.\\" if \\"A guy is drinking at a table.\\"?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A girl wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt holds a cup and looks through a book with people photographs and text\\" if given the statement \\"A guy is drinking at a table.\\" These two statements describe entirely separate scenarios, with no connection or relationship between them, making it impossible to draw any connection to support or infer one situation based on the other. The first description, \\"A girl wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt holds a cup and looks through a book with people photographs and text,\\" provides us with a detailed and vivid image of a girl engaged in a particular activity. The statement indicates that the girl is wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt, which gives us information about her appearance. Furthermore, the statement also describes her action of holding a cup while looking through a book containing photographs and text. This implies the girl's likely interest in the book's content, as well as her potential engagement in a leisurely or educational pursuit. On the other hand, the statement \\"A guy is drinking at a table.\\" provides a different scene. We are given a more straightforward description of a male individual who is drinking (most likely a beverage) at a table. This provides us with minimal information about the guy's appearance, and reveals nothing about his surroundings, thoughts, or other actions he may be engaged in while drinking. It is a single, self-contained statement that has no apparent relation to the first description. Given the lack of any common elements between the two statements, we cannot conclude that the scenario involving the girl wearing glasses and looking through a book, as described in the first statement, has any link or connection to the scenario involving a guy drinking at a table, as mentioned in the second statement. The two situations are independent of one another and would require additional context and information to establish any potential connection or conclusions between them. As a result, it is not possible to derive the description of the girl wearing glasses and looking through a book based solely on the information provided in the statement about the guy drinking at a table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in the town of Idar-Oberstein, West Germany. His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene, was German, born in Kassel. Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (who is deceased) and David. Context: Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.  In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered 1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:  I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers--young kids for the most part--helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country.  Willis stated in 2005 that he wanted to \\"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\\" The film would follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces soldier who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the plot of the film as \\"these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.\\" Question: What else is interesting in this section?. Whats the answer?","output":"In this section, apart from the brief background on Bruce Willis and his connection to the military through his family, there are several interesting points: 1. Willis's support for the US military is exemplified through his act of purchasing 12,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies for the troops, as suggested by his daughter. 2. He visited Iraq in 2003 as part of the USO tour, performing for the troops with his band, The Accelerators. 3. Although he considered joining the military to fight in the second Iraq war, his age deterred him from doing so. 4. There was confusion regarding his supposed 1 million bounty offer for terrorist leaders, which he later clarified as a hypothetical statement. 5. Willis criticized the media's portrayal of the war, accusing them of focusing mainly on negative aspects and ignoring the good deeds carried out by American soldiers. 6. He expressed his desire to make a pro-war film in 2005 with the aim of depicting American soldiers as brave fighters for freedom and democracy. The film would be based on the experiences of Deuce Four and the writings of Michael Yon, a former US Army Special Forces soldier and blogger who was embedded with the unit."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Once you've mastered the fundamentals of safe night driving, the experience can actually be a fun, relaxing one, especially if you make the most of entertaining opportunities that also help you drive safely. For instance, if you have a passenger in the car with you while you're driving at night, you may want to partially engage yourself in a light conversation with him or her. Talking to other people is a great way to stave off driving fatigue, and the calm, pitch-black surroundings can often encourage surprisingly intimate conversations. Be sure, however, not to engage yourself too heavily in the conversation. Getting into a heated argument, for example, can distract you from the most important task at hand — driving safely. Driving at night can be a fantastic time to listen to your favorite music on your car's stereo. The relative quiet and calm of night driving makes it easier to hear a song's minor details, making good music especially enjoyable. Some people prefer to listen to slick disco or electronica cuts at night, while others appreciate the thrill of hard rock tracks. There's no \\"right\\" type of music to listen to at night — it's up to you! Below are just a few great night driving tracks from several different genres (there are many, many more):  Kavinsky - \\"Nightcall\\" Chromatics - \\"Back From the Grave\\" DJ Shadow - \\"Midnight in a Perfect World\\" Kyuss - \\"Gardenia\\" Allan Kingdom - \\"Evergreens\\" Golden Earring - \\"Radar love\\" Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich - \\"Hold Tight\\" Quiet Riot - \\"Party All Night\\" Daft Punk - \\"Contact\\" Charles Mingus - \\"Moanin'\\" Driving at night can sometimes be a way to come into contact with people and things that you wouldn't otherwise see! For instance, most major city centers truly \\"come to life\\" at night and bustle with unique characters enjoying the night life. Even rural areas can have their share of unique late-night \\"flavor\\". Every stretch of road is different, so keep your eyes peeled for attractions as you drive — if you're taking lots of breaks to fight night-driving fatigue, you should have ample opportunities to stop. Below are just a few things you may want to look out for:  Late-night diners/hang-outs Bars and nightclubs (note: avoid drinking and driving, especially at night) Truck stops/rest areas Scenic paths and overlooks Camp grounds Drive-in attractions (theaters, restaurants, etc.) Driving at night can be an experience like no other. With the calm, steady hum of the engine and the darkness of your surroundings, driving can be almost like flying through space. Driving at night feels mysterious, fun, and even exciting — for some people, it's one of life's simplest yet most addictive joys. It's perfectly fine to enjoy a good night drive, but don't forget to focus on what's most important of all — your safety and the safety of other drivers. Always remember that getting distracted while driving can be deadly (especially at night), so keep your attention on the road. If you're confident in your safe driving habits, you'll be able to responsibly relax, tune in, and enjoy your ride!","output":"Mastering safe night driving can lead to a fun and relaxing experience, enhanced by engaging in light conversations with passengers, listening to your favorite music, and exploring unique late-night attractions while maintaining focus on safety and avoiding distractions."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"How do the trials occur?\\"  Context: \\"In the United States, new pharmaceutical products must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as being both safe and effective.

As we perused the meticulously curated menu, which showcased a fusion of exotic and classic dishes, our knowledgeable server offered invaluable suggestions that catered to our palates and preferences, making our decision-making process enjoyable and effortless. We commenced our gastronomic adventure with a heavenly assortment of appetizers, including the tantalizing shrimp and avocado tartare, the crisp arugula and pear salad adorned with candied walnuts and blue cheese, and the melt-in-your-mouth chicken and mushroom stuffed puff pastries. It was evident from these stunning starters that the chef's culinary prowess knows no bounds as each dish was immaculately presented and packed with an explosion of flavors. For our entrees, we opted for the succulent pan-seared Chilean sea bass, served on a bed of creamy risotto with a tangy lemon-herb sauce, as well as the mouthwatering filet mignon, impeccably cooked to medium-rare perfection, accompanied by a rich, velvety red wine reduction. It was undeniably apparent that every dish was prepared with exceptional skill and meticulous attention to detail. The pièce de résistance, however, was the outstanding dessert – a decadent chocolate lava cake with a gooey, molten core, perfectly complemented by a luscious raspberry coulis and a velvety scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. This treat was a true testament to the chef's expertise, as it flawlessly concluded our exquisite dining experience. Throughout the evening, the service at 'The Gourmet Haven' remained impeccably attentive and thoughtful.

On his way to Paris, however, he meets up with Monsieur Rochefort. D'Artagnan does not know that his rivalry with Monsieur Rochefort will get him involved in a battle against the evil plot thought up by Cardinal Richelieu against the king and queen of France. When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham in England, a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to blackmail the queen and create a difficult situation between her and King Louis, who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this. Shortly after entering the academy of musketeers, D'Artagnan meets three of the finest among them, Porthos, Athos and Aramis.

Article: Image caption Breivik admits killing all 77 victims, but denies criminal responsibility      Anders Behring Breivik called the police to surrender, but then decided to carry on killing \\"till I die\\" when they failed to return his call, he has told his trial in Oslo.      He said his plan was to kill as many people as possible.      But he said he had tried to spare some of the young people caught up in the killings on Utoeya island who he thought were under 16.      Breivik has admitted the Oslo bombing and island shootings that killed 77.      The trial will decide whether he is sane. A state psychiatric commission requested further clarification on the second of two psychiatric reports, which concluded he was sane and accountable for his actions.      The first report found him legally insane.      Breivik said he would do \\"anything to prevent\\" committal to a psychiatric hospital.      Earlier, he said he had \\"lost absolutely everything\\" on 22 July 2011, all his family and friends, therefore he understood the loss he imposed on others.      But he said the killings were \\"a small barbarian act to prevent a larger barbarian act\\".      In July last year, Breivik set off a car bomb near government buildings in Oslo, killing eight, and then massacred 69 participants in a Labour Party youth camp on the nearby island of Utoeya.      'Not sorry'      At the scene Anders Behring Breivik apologised for the first time in court on Monday - but not to those he killed, nor the hundreds he injured in his twin attacks. He said he was sorry for those injured in his bomb attack on Oslo government buildings whom he deemed not to be part of what he called Norway's ruling elite. He also said he understood perfectly well the suffering he had caused for those he injured and the families of the ones he killed. Yet to those gathered here to listen, his words most certainly rang hollow. Breivik has been speaking with the same visible lack of empathy he has shown throughout this trial, and he also repeated on Monday he would have done the same again and again.      As he continued to describe the events on Utoeya island, Breivik told the court he had made an impromptu call to police with the intention of surrendering.      But the police did not call him back, he said.      He added that he was thinking: \\"I will carry on until I die.\\"      Breivik apologised to those he did not define as his enemies.      He also said he did not kill \\"many\\" under the age of 16 and chose not to shoot three people because they appeared to be minors.      But he maintained he was not sorry for killing 77 and injuring hundreds of others in the twin attacks last year.      And he described walking through the bodies lying on the ground, meticulously shooting each one again to ensure they were dead.      For the first time, Breivik apologised not to those he killed, but to some of those he injured in the bomb attack on Oslo government buildings, whom he considered not to represent his self-defined enemy.      Later, he said he would have carried out the attacks again \\"even knowing that 40% of the people on Utoeya were under 18 years old\\".      He added there were many others in Norway \\"who deserve to be executed, eg journalists and members of parliament\\".      During his five days of giving evidence, Anders Behring Breivik has usually answered questions from both prosecution and defence in a polite manner, reports Lars Bevanger in Oslo.      On Monday, however, he appeared defiant on several occasions, especially when the prosecution team asked him about details of his so-called manifesto.      He repeatedly interrupted and said they were out to \\"ridicule\\" him.      Breivik said he understood his actions would lead to sympathy for the Labour party, but believed that sympathy could be eroded in two to three years.      He again drew comparisons to al-Qaeda, arguing the Madrid train attacks in 2004 led to a change of government and the pull-out from Afghanistan.      \\"Militant nationalists have a lot to learn from [al-Qaeda],\\" he told the court.      Planned video      Image caption Breivik's second target was a Labour Party summer youth camp on Utoeya      In his other evidence on Monday, Breivik said he:      believed political leaders would be \\"emotionally unstable\\" and would instruct police to execute him after his arrest at Utoeya      told police he believed his family might be executed after his actions      considered at one stage stealing a small plane from a nearby airfield to flee after his actions      planned to make a video recording of himself decapitating former PM Gro Harlem Brundtland while reading a prepared text spelling out her \\"crimes\\"      repeatedly replied \\"no comment\\" to any questions about other members of an anti-Muslim network called the Knights Templar, which Breivik says he belongs to. Although several organisations use that name, prosecutors believe Mr Breivik's group does not exist      Breivik denies criminal responsibility for killing the 77 victims, saying he was defending Norway from multiculturalism.      He said he had envisaged the most important attack as being the Oslo bombing, but Utoeya \\"became the most important attack when the government building did not collapse\\" as planned.      Depending on whether he is found sane or not, he faces either prison or committal to a psychiatric institution.      Breivik himself maintains he is sane, but a practitioner of political extremism.      Breivik has been allocated five days in total to give evidence, with the entire proceedings expected to last 10 weeks.      Monday was expected to be his last day of evidence, but he may return to the stand on Wednesday when his psychological state is discussed. ||||| OSLO — Anders Behring Breivik , the self-described anti-Islamic militant who admitted killing 77 people in a bombing and shooting rampage last summer, sought Monday to include himself among the victims, telling a court that he was able to undertake the “gruesome” murders of scores of youths because they were “necessary” and telling bereaved families that he too had paid a high price.      Describing how he stalked and executed teenagers attending a political youth camp on the wooded island of Utoya, Mr. Breivik, 33, said: “I have never experienced anything so gruesome. It was probably even more horrendous for those I was hunting. But it was necessary. Yes, it was necessary. The July 22 operation was necessary.”      “When people say they have lost their most beloved, I also lost my entire family, I lost my friends,” he also said. “It was my choice. I sacrificed them, but I lost my entire family and friends on 22 July. I lost everything. So to a certain extent, I understand.”      Monday was the last scheduled day of testimony from Mr. Breivik, who maintains that he acted out of a dedication to fight political acceptance of the “Islamic colonization of Norway.” The court will now begin to hear from witnesses of the shootings on Utoya, which left a total of 69 people dead, and a bomb blast in central Oslo that killed eight more people.      With his guilt already established, the trial centers on the question of whether Mr. Breivik was insane at the time of the killings. Two psychiatric reviews have come down on opposite sides of the question. He insists that he was sane, and that efforts to portray him otherwise are part of a campaign to discredit his fight against Muslim immigration.      If he is found to have been sane, the presiding judges can sentence him to up to 21 years in prison, with a provision to keep him behind bars longer if he is still considered dangerous. If he is found to have been insane, Mr. Breivik can be kept in forced psychiatric care.      Two contradictory psychiatric reports have already been handed to the court, but the final decision will be in the hands of the two professional and three lay judges at the trial.      “This case is very simply that I am not a psychotic case and I am sane,” Mr. Breivik told the court on Friday. “I understand that when you see something too extreme, you might think it is irrational and insane. But you must separate political extremism from insanity.” ||||| OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian who massacred 77 people to protest against Muslim immigration to Europe said on Monday he had hoped to kill as many as 150 and kept on killing because police failed to respond urgently to his phone call.      Breivik has given a detailed account of his car bomb attack at government headquarters in Oslo on July 22, which killed eight people, followed hours later by his shooting of 69 people, mostly teenagers, at a Labour Party island camp.      He said on Monday his \\"gruesome\\" actions were to prevent a civil war caused, he said, by a Muslim takeover of Europe.      \\"This was a minor barbarity to prevent a larger one\\", he said on the sixth day of a trial that has transfixed Norway.      \\"I've never ever experienced such a horrendous ... gruesome act as this. But it was necessary,\\" Breivik said in his usual tone, lacking emotion. \\"It was much more cruel than I expected.\\"      Breivik said he thought that at least another 150 people had drowned in a lake as they fled his gunfire so he called police to surrender, only to find himself forced to leave a message.      \\"I said 'call me back when you got the right person',\\" Breivik said. \\"I told myself 'I will continue until the phone rings'. I thought, I will continue until I die. What would I have done, sat by the pier waiting?\\"      COLD, MATTER-OF-FACT      Breivik has denied criminal guilt, insisting his victims were \\"traitors\\" whose multiculturalist views facilitated what he saw as a de facto Muslim invasion of Europe.      Most Norwegians have reacted with horror to his testimony, delivered in a cold, matter-of-fact manner, while there is wide public acceptance of his right as a defendant to give it.      Breivik has had almost free rein to issue warnings against immigration and explain how he scoured the Internet for bomb-making information while writing a 1,500-page document declaring himself part of a secretive group that is Europe's answer to al Qaeda - a group the police have said likely does not exist.      Breivik said he spared some people, including a 10-year-old boy whose father was his first victim, and a Labour Party activist because he looked right-wing.      \\"Some people have the type of look that is associated with the leftist movement,\\" Breivik said.      \\"This person, (Adrian) Pracon appeared right-wing, that was his appearance. That's the reason I didn't fire any shots at him,\\" said Breivik, 33, whose sanity or lack of it is a prime issue to be determined in the trial.      The 22-year-old Labour party youth wing activist earlier told Reuters: \\"I remember him pointing the gun at me for quite a long time before he took it down, turned and walked away.\\"      Breivik told how he used a fake police uniform to trick people into coming out of hiding and then shot them at close range.      \\"I started with ‘have you seen him, do you know where the shots came from?' ... then I said ‘there's a rescue boat that's going to take you to safety but you need to come out',\\" he said.      FIRST APOLOGY      Later in the rampage, which lasted more than an hour, Breivik came upon Pracon again as he played dead, and this time shot the son of Polish immigrants through the shoulder.      He said he spared the boy's life because \\"I could not understand what such a little boy was doing at a political indoctrination camp.\\"      But he said he had no qualms about killing teenagers. His victims were as young as 14. \\"They were not children, under the legal definition only under 14 are children ... they were political activists,\\" he said.      Breivik issued his first seeming apology, to innocent bystanders hurt or killed when his 950-kg fertilizer bomb went off in Oslo. More than 200 were injured.      \\"To all of those ... I want to say I am deeply sorry for what happened,\\" he said. \\"But what happened, happened.\\"      Ahead of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, one court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded that Breivik was psychotic while a second found him mentally capable.      If Breivik is deemed sane, as he hopes to be, he could face a 21-year prison sentence with indefinite extensions for as long as he is considered dangerous.      (Editing by Janet Lawrence) |||||Summary:","output":"Anders Behring Breivik, the individual responsible for killing 77 people in Norway in 2011, has admitted to his actions but denies criminal responsibility. During his trial in Oslo, Breivik revealed that his original plan was to kill as many people as possible, but he attempted to spare those he believed to be under 16 years old. The trial's primary focus is to determine Breivik's sanity, as two previous psychiatric evaluations have drawn opposing conclusions. Breivik claims that he is not a \\"psychotic case\\" and that his actions were taken in defense of Norway against multiculturalism. The trial will decide if he will face prison or be committed to a psychiatric institution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What were the first names of the three members that came from Rage Against the Machine? from the following article ?  Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band, as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell, cemented the supergroup's permanent demise. On January 20, 2017, three days after announcing their reunion, Audioslave performed together for the first time in over a decade at Prophets of Rage's Anti-Inaugural Ball. In the early hours of May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit, at the age of 52, after playing a Soundgarden show.

Jane was 70 years-old, while Jill was 55. They shared many stories.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which friend had a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jill, who is 55 years old, has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to Jane, who is 70 years old. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, with the likelihood of developing the condition increasing as one gets older. Although age is not the sole determinant of Alzheimer's risk, it is widely known that the probability of developing the disease doubles every five years after the age of 65. By this measure, Jane, being 70 years old, faces a higher risk of Alzheimer's compared to Jill, who is 55. Other factors that can contribute to the risk of developing Alzheimer's include genetics, family history, and lifestyle choices such as smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, and social isolation. It is important to note that while Jill has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease when compared to Jane due to their respective ages, both should still take preventative measures to maintain their cognitive health. These measures can include staying mentally and physically active, maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, and participating in regular social interactions. In conclusion, while both Jill and Jane can take steps to reduce their risk of Alzheimer's disease, Jill, being younger at 55 years old, has a smaller chance of developing the condition compared to her 70-year-old friend, Jane."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Upstate New York is the portion of the American state of New York lying north of New York City. The region includes most of the state of New York, excluding New York City and its environs, as well as Long Island, though the precise boundary is debated. Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse.  - Raquette Lake is the source of the Raquette River in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. It is near the community of Raquette Lake, New York. The lake has 99 miles (160 km) of shoreline with pines and mountains bordering the lake. It is located in the towns of Long Lake and Arietta, both in Hamilton County.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property.  In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed.  Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas.  - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world.  - The lake's popularity derives from its remoteness, climate and beauty, as well as its notoriety as the location of the murder of Grace Brown in 1906. Alleged ghost sightings and subsequent media attention have added to the allure.  - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high. The current relief owes much to glaciation.   - The Pigeon Lake Wilderness Area , an Adirondack Park unit of the forest preserve , lies in the town of Webb , Herkimer County , and the towns of Long Lake and Inlet in Hamilton County . It is bounded on the north by Stillwater Reservoir and large blocks of private land in the vicinity of Rose Pond , Shingle Shanty Pond and Upper Sister Lake ; on the east by a private road from Brandreth Lake to North Point and by Raquette Lake ; on the south by private lands along the Uncas Road ; and on the west by the Big Moose Road , private lands near Big Moose Lake , Thirsty Pond , Twitchell Lake , Razorback Pond , and the Remsen to Lake Placid railroad tracks . The terrain consists of low , rolling hills , with the exception of West Mountain near the eastern boundary . There are many brook trout ponds and streams and a considerable expanse of swampland along the courses of Sucker Brook and Beaver Brook . The forest cover runs to mature or near - mature mixed softwoods and hardwoods , with some dense spruce - balsam types near the summit of West Mountain and in the swamplands . Old - growth white pine can be found in the vicinity of Pigeon Lake and a few other places . It is easily accessible to the public from the south , southeast and southwest , but to a lesser extent from the west and north because of posted private lands . The chief attractions for the public are the trout ponds , which entice fishermen as well as campers who frequent scenic spots around Cascade Lake , Queer Lake , Constable Pond , Pigeon Lake and Gull Lake . It is also a popular area for hunters during the big game season . The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains Brown Tract Pond Campground on the southeast perimeter . Motorboats are now banned from operating on Brown Tract Ponds to provide a more compatible situation for canoes and other non-motorized boats utilized by the campers .  - Raquette Lake is a hamlet in the Town of Long Lake in Hamilton County, New York, United States.  - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\"  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimalthat is, as a wilderness. It might also be called a \\"wild\\" or \\"natural\\" area. Especially in wealthier, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law. Many nations have designated Wilderness Areas, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Adirondack Park Agency (APA) was created in 1971 by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a governmental agency that performs long-range planning for the future of the Adirondack Park. It oversees development plans of private land-owners as well as activities within the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Development by private owners must be reviewed to determine if their plan is compatible with the park. The agency is headquartered in Ray Brook, New York.  - Grace Mae Brown (March 20, 1886  July 11, 1906) was an American skirt factory worker whose murder caused a nationwide sensation, and whose life inspired the fictional character Roberta Alden in the Theodore Dreiser novel, \\"An American Tragedy\\", as well as the Jennifer Donnelly novel, \\"A Northern Light\\". Shelley Winters was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance inspired by Grace Brown, with the name changed to 'Alice Tripp' in the film \\"A Place in the Sun\\".

By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era's leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers. In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy.  Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country.

The gate is approximately high , with the still visible grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access . The gate is still visible with the approximately high grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access .","output":"While the two sentences convey similar information, the order of details presented and the emphasis on certain elements in each sentence differ, thus altering the meaning slightly. Let's analyze both sentences to understand these variations: 1. \\"The gate is approximately high, with the still visible grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the gate itself, specifically its height. The fact that the gate is approximately high (though exact height is not mentioned, which should ideally have been provided for better clarity) is the primary detail. Afterwards, the grooves in the granite stones that are still visible are mentioned, elaborating on their function: housing the hinges used when opening and closing the access. The significance of the grooves is positioned as a secondary element. 2. \\"The gate is still visible with the approximately high grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access.\\" In contrast, this sentence initially emphasizes the visibility of the gate, suggesting that it can still be seen despite its age or surrounding environment. It then proceeds to describe the grooves, placing them as the prominent feature offering a clue about the gate's height. This suggests that the height of the grooves could be akin to the approximate height of the gate. Consequently, the gate's height appears as a secondary element in relation to the grooves in the granite stones. In summary, while both sentences express similar notions, sentence 1 accentuates the height of the gate and subsequently highlights the grooves' purpose. On the other hand, sentence 2 initially underscores the gate's visibility and puts more focus on the grooves, inferring the approximate height from them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply.\\" The suit, filed earlier this month, has drawn international attention to the private Christian school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, founded by evangelist Oral Roberts, father of university President Richard Roberts. The new allegations come in an amended version of the wrongful termination suit filed by three former professors, who say they lost their jobs after reporting that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. The amended lawsuit, filed Friday, also alleges that the university gave a \\"convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students\\" while the man acted as a \\"mentor.\\" The lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school. The school denies both accusations in a statement on its Web site.

The suit does not allege sexual behavior. The suit says Richard Roberts \\"sought approval from stakeholders for moving the underage male into the family residence,\\" and \\"a longtime maintenance employee was summarily fired so that the same underage male companion could have his position.\\" In her statement, Lindsay Roberts denied all the allegations against her in the lawsuit. \\"The part that grieves me the most is that these accusations are being brought forth in so many areas and being seen and heard through the media when the parties suing have continued to say they don't even know if these allegations are true,\\" she said. \\"I believe it's grossly unfair to allow such speculation to be used against me and attached to a lawsuit in which I am not even named as a party.\\" Other allegations in the amended version of the lawsuit are in a section accusing the ORU board of negligence. It says that this past summer, the Board of Regents allowed the president and the school \\"to give a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to the students of the university.\\" The man had previously \\"confessed to crimes\\" in courts in Tulsa and the surrounding area and was convicted, the suit says. \\"In one of these convictions, this 'Mentor' for ORU students -- reportedly hired at the direct personal instruction, and under the direct supervision of President Richard Roberts -- confessed to the facts regarding exposing himself to a 15-year-old boy in a school locker room,\\" the suit says. It also says three days after the initial lawsuit was filed on October 2, the board allowed ORU and Roberts to fire the school's financial comptroller after 26 years of service. Within hours, \\"voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence,\\" according to witnesses, the suit says. Beyond the online posting, university officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday by CNN. The suit was filed by John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker, who accuse Richard and Lindsay Roberts of treating school funds like their own bank account, using them for home renovations, expensive vacations and clothes -- allegations the Robertses and the school have previously denied. After complaining to the school's Board of Regents about university spending, two of the professors were fired from their jobs and the third was thrown into conditions \\"so intolerable\\" that he had no choice but to resign, the lawsuit says. One of the firings, the suit says, was also in retaliation for the plaintiff refusing to drop a sexual harassment complaint that one of his subordinates made against an associate provost, who is named as a defendant. The suit calls for actual damages \\"in excess of 10,000\\" and punitive damages also \\"in excess of 10,000\\" for each plaintiff, as well as attorneys' fees, court costs, \\"and any further relief that the court deems just an equitable.\\" In an interview last week on CNN's \\"Larry King Live,\\" before the latest allegations were added to the suit, Richard Roberts called it \\"the most unusual thing I've ever witnessed in my life.\\" Asked whether someone is out to get him, he responded, \\"It sure seems that way.\\" Lindsay Roberts called the allegations \\"preposterous.\\" The three plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit, meanwhile, accuse school officials of making libelous public remarks about them in an effort to discredit the lawsuit. Last week, before the amended suit was filed, the board vowed to hire an auditor to look into \\"allegations made in regards to Oral Roberts University and certain members of the administration,\\" board Chairman George Pearsons said in an October 7 statement posted on the ORU Web site. \\"The Oral Roberts University Board of Regents is committed to operating the institution in accordance with all ethical, legal and moral standards.\\" E-mail to a friend.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Muriel Bowser: ‘You have a mayor who hates guns’ Muriel E. Bowser’s first week as mayor has not gone quite as smoothly as planned. On Tuesday, she handled her first snowfall to mixed reviews, and on Thursday evening, she learned that one of the few concrete goals she laid out in her inaugural speech — winning the right to host the 2024 Olympics — would not come to pass. Less than an hour later, she walked into a packed St. Augustine Catholic Church where she might have been brought even further down to earth. The Washington Interfaith Network gathered hundreds of concerned and churchgoing D.C. residents there to recite the group’s long-standing litany of grievances about a city that may be safer and more prosperous but is also less hospitable to seniors and low-income residents. Bowser heard from anonymous residents of the D.C. General shelter for homeless families. She heard from a MetroAccess driver fighting for better wages from the WMATA contractor she works for. And she heard from a Brooklyn minister organizing a national campaign to end handgun violence by pressuring firearms manufacturers. In the past, WIN’s “actions” have included asking elected officials or candidates to make specific pledges to create jobs, support affordable housing, or take action on other issues. On occasion, the group has taken steps to hold officials accountable for those pledges. But Bowser was not asked to make any pledges this time, and she won sustained applause from the crowd after more than 20 minutes of remarks that included lines like this one, responding to WIN’s new focus on gun violence: “You have a mayor who hates guns,” she said. “If it was up to me, we wouldn’t have any handguns in the District of Columbia. I swear to protect the Constitution and what the courts say, but I will do it in the most restrictive way as possible.” Bowser spent more of her speech, however, promising to make good on her campaign pledges of making the city more hospitable to the poor, the old, and the longtime residents who have felt left out by the city’s growth. She pledged to “to listen, to learn and to also to act.” She said, in her first 100 days, she would establish a “public works academy” to prepare D.C. residents without a college education for blue-collar jobs in the District government, as well as for public sector jobs with Metro or D.C. Water. She said she would create a “strike force” to focus on preserving affordable housing units that might be in danger due to expiring federal tax credits or voucher contracts. And she again pledged to commit at least 100 million yearly to affordable housing subsidy programs: “Today, at my first cabinet meeting, I heard one of my budget people say, ‘We’re gonna try to make the mayor look good with her first budget.’ To which I said, ‘Oh, the mayor’s gonna look good.’ So we’re gonna figure out how to get that 100 million.” Bowser closed her remarks with a plea for support. “When it gets tough, and it will, I need you there,” she said. “So when we have to have tough conversations around building transitional housing, tough conversations about closing D.C. General, tough conversations about revitalizing Barry Farm, I need you there.” “I didn’t get elected to warm the seat. And I only got elected for four years — though I’m going to run again,” she said to laughter. “But I know this, I can’t make decisions thinking about the next election, I have to make decisions that I think are right. And that is why I ran for mayor and that is why I need you every step of the way.” Mike DeBonis covers local politics and government for The Washington Post. He also writes a blog and a political analysis column that runs on Fridays.","output":"The new mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, had a challenging first week.

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity. The explosion immediately garners the attention of the US government.Even though the detonation was staged to look like an accident, White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) is not convinced: SS-18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately. She believes that terrorists are behind the incident. Her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her. He is smooth-talking and irreverent US Army Special Forces officer Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe (Clooney), and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged, to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country.  In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.  Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taishō period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes.  Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the sōsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands.  Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production.  The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement.  The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles.  Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997).  These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional...

Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Two farms were situated on opposite banks of a large river flowing into the ocean. Hill farm practiced conventional agriculture, while Dew farm practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming.  Which farm generated more marine litter?","output":"It is likely that Hill farm, which practiced conventional agriculture, generated more marine litter than Dew farm, which practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming.  Conventional agriculture often relies on the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, which are more prone to runoff into rivers and eventually contribute to marine pollution. The excess nutrients from these chemicals can promote algal blooms, leading to oxygen depletion and the creation of dead zones in marine ecosystems. Additionally, conventional farming practices may result in greater soil erosion and sedimentation, which can further contribute to marine pollution. On the other hand, permaculture design and organic farming practices, like those employed at Dew farm, focus on sustainable and regenerative methods. This includes minimizing external inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing soil disturbance, and implementing practices that work with natural systems to improve soil health and prevent erosion. These practices lead to reduced chances of harmful chemicals and sediments entering waterways and the ocean, thus generating less marine litter and pollution in comparison to conventional agriculture methods like those at Hill farm. However, it should be noted that the specific practices at both the Hill farm and Dew farm, as well as the local environment, would play a crucial role in determining the precise comparative impact of the two farms on marine litter generation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose from:  A). no  B). yes","output":"B). Yes The two sentences are saying the same thing. Both sentences are conveying the information that officials from Russia and Saudi Arabia signed a five-year agreement on cooperation in the oil and gas sector.

The agreement was signed by Russian and Saudi officials. 3. The length of the agreement is five years. 4. The focus of the agreement is cooperation in the oil and gas sector. The second sentence is organized differently but conveys the same information: 1. After talks (implicitly suggesting the signing happened on or after Monday as a result of discussions), the agreement was signed. 2. The parties involved were the Russian and Saudi energy ministers (officials from both countries). 3. The length of the agreement is five years. 4.

Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard... My question: How does Najaf break his leg?

This classification is made on the basis that the text is describing a type of vehicle, specifically a car model called 'Toyota Publica' manufactured by the company 'Toyota'. The description tells about the period of manufacture, its concept and its place in the line of Toyota's small cars. It falls under the category 'mean of transportation' as it is a vehicle which was used to move people from one place to another, essentially serving as a mode of transportation. The category 'mean of transportation' covers all different types of vehicles, machines or systems that are used to move people or goods, which in this case is a car, a widely utilized form of transportation around the globe.  Other categories provided for classification such as company, animal, building, etc., do not fit the text as it is not describing a corporation, some living entity or a structure but a model of a car. The references made to the automaker 'Toyota' could suggest it may fall under 'company', however, the main subject of the text is the 'Toyota Publica' thus making 'mean of transportation' the most apt categorization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A group of people gathering in front of a clothing store.\\", can we conclude \\"A bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant\\" based on the information provided about \\"A group of people gathering in front of a clothing store.\\" The two scenarios describe different situations involving groups of people, and there is no direct correlation between the two. In the first scenario, a group of people is gathering in front of a clothing store. This could be for various reasons, such as waiting for the store to open, participating in a promotional event, or just socializing. However, this information alone gives no indication that these people will later go to a restaurant or that they are planning to dine together. On the other hand, the second statement describes a separate situation, where a bunch of people is sitting inside a restaurant. While both situations involve gatherings of people, they are not necessarily linked, as they occur in different locations and settings. Therefore, to draw a conclusion that connects these two scenarios, we would require additional information or context that establishes a clear link between the groups of people and their activities. For example, if we knew that the clothing store and the restaurant were hosting a joint event, and that the people gathering in front of the store were planning to attend the event at the restaurant, then it would be more reasonable to conclude that these people may eventually be sitting inside the restaurant. In summary, based solely on the information provided about the group gathering in front of a clothing store, one cannot conclude that a bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant.

Belinda Jo Carlisle was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on August 17, 1958 to Harold Carlisle, a gas station employee, and his wife, Joanne (nee Thompson), a homemaker. Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. Carlisle's first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, under the name Dottie Danger. She was recruited into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Thousand Oaks High School. However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting mononucleosis, and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album Germicide (1977). Around this time Carlisle did some back-up singing for Black Randy and the Metrosquad.  Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded The Go-Go's (originally named the Misfits), with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and Jane Wiedlin. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group and the new line-up included bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock. All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as fret markers during their initial songwriting: \\"[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps,\\" she said.  The Go-Go's would go on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher new wave music into popular American radio, and becoming the first all-female band who wrote their own music and played their own instruments to ever achieve a No. 1 album, Beauty and the Beat, which featured the hits \\"We Got the Beat\\" and \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\". The Go-Go's recorded two more studio albums on I.R.S. Records, including 1982's Vacation, which went gold. \\"Head over Heels\\", from their 1984 album Talk Show, made it to No. 11.  In 1984, Carlisle made a foray into acting in the movie Swing Shift, starring alongside Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Sure, little buddy!

I read this background article the other day: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades. Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – Things that weigh less than the \\"fatberg\\" removed from a London sewer: 18 horses, 3 Hummer H2s, or 77,000 iPhone 6s. A \\"fatberg\\" is what is created when congealed fat and unflushable items (think sanitary napkins, diapers, wipes, the Independent notes) combine in the sewer to create, well, the stuff of nightmares, and a 1940s-era sewer in London has been broken by an 131-foot-long one weighing roughly 11 tons. The huge mass was removed after businesses in the affluent Chelsea district complained about a putrid odor, the Evening Standard reports. \\"We see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes, which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through, but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a meter in diameter is mind-boggling,\\" a repair and maintenance supervisor at the water company tells the Guardian. Much of the fat comes from used cooking oil, millions of liters of which are poured down drains in London each year. And the wet wipes (which some people are apparently using instead of toilet paper) come from the one in five Londoners who admit to flushing them. \\"I’d urge people to consider what lurks beneath their feet,\\" says the supervisor. \\"When it comes to getting rid of fat, 'bin it—don’t block it.'\\" The whole messy business, including repairs to the sewer, is expected to cost more than 600,000 and take more than two months, with work finishing in May. And yes, the Washington Post notes, the same phenomenon happens here in the USA—New York City spends millions dealing with grease backups—though we don't often use the term \\"fatberg.\\" (This fatberg isn't the biggest in British history, though.)","output":"Once upon a time in London, there was a really big and smelly problem in the sewers. This problem was called a \\"fatberg.\\" A fatberg is a yucky mix of fats, oils, and things that should not be flushed down the toilet like diapers, baby wipes, and napkins. These things combine and create a massive, yucky mess underground, and sometimes they can even break a sewer. In this story, a very old sewer from the 1940s got broken by a fatberg that was bigger and heavier than 18 horses, 3 big cars called Hummer H2s, or 77,000 iPhone 6s. It was 131 feet long and weighed about 11 tons! People who had stores and businesses in a fancy part of London called Chelsea started to smell something really bad. So, they called some workers who take care of water and sewers. When the workers looked, they found the huge fatberg. They couldn't believe how big it was! They told people to think about what's underneath their feet when they pour fats, like from cooking, down their drains or flush things that shouldn't be flushed. To fix this big, stinky problem, they had to spend a lot of money (more than 600,000) and work for two whole months. This wasn't the first time this problem happened in London, and it happens in other places too, like the USA. To avoid these icky fatbergs, we should remember to throw away fats and other yucky things in the trash bin and not put them down the sink or toilet. That way, we can keep sewers clean and not have any more smelly fatberg problems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules   because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters   it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit   around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive  and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight  _  .

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which crop would be less beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B?  Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. The answer to this question is:","output":"Crop B would be less beneficial to farmers. This is because crop B is not tolerant of herbicides, which means that applying herbicides to control weeds could also harm the crop itself. In contrast, crop A has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant, allowing it to grow without being harmed by the herbicides used for weed management. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops like crop A has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide me with some mental models or analogies to help me understand and remember this difficult topic. 1. Please elaborate in detail the actual steps to add CPU and memory to the existing cluster's Master Node, Replica Node and Data Node","output":"Mental Model 1: Building a House Think of adding CPU and memory to the existing cluster's Master Node, Replica Node, and Data Node as building a house. Just like a house has different rooms, each node in the cluster has its unique purpose. The Master Node, Replica Node, and Data Node serve specific functions within the cluster, similar to how rooms serve different purposes in a house. Adding CPU and memory to these nodes can be equated to expanding the capacity or upgrading the resources of each room for better performance and efficiency. By understanding the steps involved in building a house, we can create a mental model to help us grasp the process of adding CPU and memory to the nodes. Actual Steps: 1. Assess the current resource utilization: Before proceeding, it is crucial to analyze the current resource usage of each node. This will help determine the required amount of CPU and memory for optimal performance. Just like you assess the space requirements in different rooms of a house before planning any renovations. 2. Determine the compatible upgrades: Identify the suitable CPU and memory upgrades for each specific node. Similar to choosing the right materials based on room sizes and purposes during house renovations. 3. Prepare the node for upgrade: Shut down the respective node or gracefully switch the workload to another node to avoid interruptions, similar to clearing out a room before starting renovations. 4. Perform the physical upgrade: Physically remove the existing CPU and memory components of the node and replace them with the new ones. Ensure compatibility and follow proper installation procedures, just like replacing old furniture and upgrading the fixtures of a room in the house. 5. Power on and reconfigure the node: After installing the upgraded components, power on the node and make the necessary configuration changes in the cluster settings to recognize the new CPU and memory resources. This step is akin to reconnecting the power and setting up the room with the newly installed furniture and fixtures. 6. Validate the upgrade: Test the functionality of the node by running relevant workloads and monitoring its performance. Ensure that the increased CPU and memory have improved the node's capabilities, similar to inspecting the renovated room and ensuring it meets the desired functionality. 7. Repeat for other nodes: Follow the above steps for each node in the cluster, including the Master Node, Replica Node, and Data Node, ensuring a uniform upgrade across the entire cluster. Just as you would renovate and upgrade every room in the house. By employing this mental model of building a house, you can visualize the process of adding CPU and memory to the nodes in the cluster, making it easier to understand and remember the steps involved."},{"instruction":"translate “Politburo’s policy tailwinds mark a turning point for Chinese equities” to chinese","output":"政治局的政策顺风为中国的股票市场标志着一个转折点。"},{"instruction":"what is the difference between textfield and textformfield in flutter","output":"In Flutter, both \`TextField\` and \`TextFormField\` are widgets used for obtaining and displaying user text input. However, there are a few key differences between them: 1. Validation: \`TextFormField\` provides built-in validation functionality, allowing you to specify validation rules and error messages. It also automatically displays an error message when the input is invalid. On the other hand, \`TextField\` does not have built-in validation and error message display. As a result, you would need to handle validation manually in \`TextField\`. 2. Data handling: \`TextFormField\` integrates well with Form widgets in Flutter and automatically handles updating the form's state. It retrieves and manages the current value from the form's state. On the other hand, with \`TextField\`, you need to manually handle updating and managing the entered text value. 3. Style: \`TextField\` has a more basic styling capability compared to \`TextFormField\`. \`TextField\` allows you to set properties like \`decoration\`, \`style\`, and \`controller\`, which provide limited styling options. \`TextFormField\` provides more advanced styling options, including \`decoration\`, \`style\`, \`autovalidateMode\`, etc. Overall, \`TextField\` is simpler and suitable for basic text input needs where validation or form management is not required.

Please explain your answers in full detail.","output":"Rating the Xin dynasty on each of the following criteria: 1. Functioning institutions: 5 The Xin dynasty implemented various administrative reforms, including centralization and streamlining of governance. However, these reforms were often implemented abruptly and without proper consideration of the existing institutions. The sudden changes weakened the stability and effectiveness of the administrative apparatus, leading to administrative inefficiencies and confusion. Additionally, the Xin dynasty's focus on favoring eunuchs and political allies over meritocracy further compromised the functioning institutions. 2. Rule of law: 3 The Xin dynasty struggled with maintaining a consistent rule of law. While it aimed to strengthen legal systems, the implementation of new laws often lacked clarity and consistency. The ruling family's despotic tendencies led to arbitrary rule and an erosion of the rule of law. Legal decisions were influenced by personal and political considerations, damaging the trust in a fair and impartial justice system. 3. Accountability and transparency: 2 During the Xin dynasty, the Emperor held absolute power with limited accountability. The concentration of power and absence of checks and balances led to rampant corruption and nepotism. The lack of transparency in decision-making further intensified public distrust and decreased accountability within the government. 4. Public trust and legitimacy: 1 The policies and actions of the Xin dynasty were met with widespread public dissatisfaction. The overthrow of the Han dynasty, which many revered, weakened the public's trust in the ruling family's legitimacy. The Xin dynasty's hasty implementation of new policies and disregard for traditions alienated large sections of the population, resulting in rebellion and resistance. 5. Economic stability: 4 The Xin dynasty implemented economic reforms that aimed to address issues such as land distribution and taxation. However, these reforms were poorly executed and led to disruptions in agricultural production and economic stability. The state's intervention in the economy, such as the forced collectivization of farmland, negatively affected productivity and hindered growth. 6. Political stability: 2 The Xin dynasty witnessed several rebellions and uprisings throughout its relatively short rule. The lack of political stability was a result of the ruling family's legitimacy issues, poor governance, and conflicts within the imperial court. Internal power struggles and the disregard for the ruling family's responsibilities further destabilized the governance system. 7. Social stability: 3 The Xin dynasty's abrupt reforms and disregard for traditions disrupted social stability. The centralization of power, elevation of eunuchs, and suppression of Confucianism led to social unrest and divisions. The forced labor policies and excessive taxation additionally burdened the population and contributed to social instability. 8. Overall wellbeing of the population: 3 The Xin dynasty's rule was marked by economic hardships, widespread rebellions, and political turmoil. The population faced uncertainty, upheaval, and increased social divisions. The policies implemented by the ruling family failed to effectively address the needs and aspirations of the people, resulting in overall dissatisfaction and hardships. Adding up the scores (5+3+2+1+4+2+3+3) gives a total of 23. Dividing by 8 (the number of criteria) gives an average score of 2.875. Grade: D+ The Xin dynasty receives a grade of D+ as it falls below average in nearly all the evaluated criteria. The ruling family's actions and policies undermined the functioning institutions, rule of law, accountability, public trust, economic stability, political stability, social stability, and overall well-being of the population. The lack of effective governance, coupled with public dissatisfaction, resulted in a period of instability and discontent during the Xin dynasty."},{"instruction":"How would the Song dynasty rank?

They implemented civil service exams, promoting meritocracy and the recruitment of talented officials. The central government maintained control over regional administrations, ensuring the smooth functioning of institutions. However, corruption and inefficiencies remained present within the system, lowering its ranking slightly. 2. Rule of law: 6 The Song dynasty made efforts to strengthen the rule of law. They established a comprehensive legal code and established a judiciary system. While laws were relatively well-defined, their implementation and enforcement were not always consistent. The nobility and powerful elites often received leniency, highlighting some deficiencies in the rule of law. 3. Accountability and transparency: 6 The Song dynasty had a relatively more accountable and transparent government compared to previous periods. They implemented systems for officials to report on their activities, tried to reduce corruption, and established channels for public grievances. However, some instances of corruption and abuses of power still persisted. 4. Public trust and legitimacy: 8 The Song dynasty enjoyed a relatively high level of public trust and legitimacy. The government's emphasis on Confucian values, education, and its cultural achievements, such as the rise of Neo-Confucianism, contributed to a sense of legitimacy. The ruling family also managed to maintain authority and stability, fostering trust and a sense of loyalty among the population. 5. Economic stability: 8 The Song dynasty witnessed significant economic development, marked by increased trade, technological advancements, and urban growth. Agricultural productivity improved, leading to a surplus in food production. Market towns and urban centers thrived, and the dynasty actively promoted commercial activities. These factors contributed to overall economic stability. 6. Political stability: 7 The Song dynasty experienced relative political stability during its early years, but faced challenges from external forces and internal rebellions in later periods. Despite these challenges, the central government managed to maintain control and stability overall. 7. Social stability: 7 The Song dynasty experienced relative social stability, with the government making efforts to address social inequality and maintain social order. The emphasis on Confucian values and education helped foster a sense of social cohesion. However, social disparities still existed, particularly between the urban elite and rural population. 8. Overall wellbeing of the population: 8 The overall well-being of the population during the Song dynasty improved compared to previous periods. Agricultural advancements, trade, and technological progress contributed to increased standards of living. The dynasty's focus on education and culture also brought about advancements in arts and intellectual pursuits, promoting well-being. Adding up the scores (7+6+6+8+8+7+7+8) gives a total score of 57 out of 80. Dividing by 80 and multiplying by 100 gives an average score of 71.25%.

Based on their assessment, the Omrides can be ranked as follows: 1. Functioning institutions: 7 The Omrides established centralized power and strengthened the royal administration, focusing on the development of a complex bureaucracy. They implemented economic and agricultural reforms, including the construction of regional administrative centers and water management systems. 2. Rule of law: 6 Under the Omrides, the rule of law was relatively advanced. They enacted new legal codes and implemented reforms to promote justice and fairness. However, the extent of these reforms and the level of enforcement might have varied across different regions. 3. Accountability and transparency: 5 While there were efforts to introduce accountability and transparency, the reality was likely a mixed picture. Centralized power in the hands of the monarchy may have limited the extent of accountability and transparency in practice. 4. Public trust and legitimacy: 8 The Omrides worked to strengthen the legitimacy of their rule. They emphasized the religious and cultural aspects of Israelite identity, building major religious centers such as Samaria. These efforts likely contributed to public trust and a sense of legitimacy among the population. 5. Economic stability: 7 The Omride period witnessed economic growth and stability. The kingdom engaged in trade, developed agricultural projects, and established centralized control over key economic resources. These initiatives likely led to increased prosperity and stability. 6. Political stability: 6 The Omrides achieved a certain degree of political stability. They managed to consolidate power and establish a relatively long-lasting dynasty. However, conflicts with neighboring kingdoms and internal challenges endured, suggesting that stability was not without occasional setbacks. 7. Social stability: 6 The Omrides instituted social and religious reforms, working to unify different religious practices under the central cult at Bethel and minimizing regional variations. These reforms aimed to foster social stability and cohesion, although some resistance and regional disparities likely persisted. 8. Overall wellbeing of the population: 7 The reforms and developments introduced by the Omrides, such as agricultural improvements, urban development, and religious and cultural advancements, likely contributed to an overall improvement in the well-being of the population. Although a quantitative score cannot be assigned to the rankings provided by Finkelstein and Silberman, based on the information presented, the Omrides generally receive positive assessments in most criteria, falling within the range of 5-8.

It is typically expressed in decibels (dBm) and represents the strength of the signal at the receiving end of a wireless link. The RSSI value provides an indication of the signal quality or strength, which is important in determining the performance and reliability of a wireless connection. It is often used by wireless devices, such as smartphones, laptops, or routers, to determine the signal strength of nearby networks and choose the best available connection. RSSI is derived by measuring the power level of the received radio signal at the receiver's antenna, typically using a tuned radio frequency (RF) receiver. This measurement takes into account factors such as the distance between the transmitter and receiver, obstacles that may affect the signal, and interference from other devices or sources. However, it is important to note that RSSI alone does not provide a comprehensive view of the quality of a wireless link. It does not account for other factors that can affect the performance of a connection, such as noise levels, data transmission errors, or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition to wireless devices using RSSI for network selection, it can also be used for various applications in wireless communications, such as: 1. Localization: RSSI can be used in location-based services or indoor positioning systems to estimate the position of a device based on signal strength measurements from multiple access points or beacons. 2. Wireless network optimization: By monitoring RSSI values, network administrators can identify areas with weak signal coverage and take necessary measures to improve network performance, such as adjusting antenna placements or deploying additional access points. 3. Link quality estimation: RSSI can be used as an input metric for estimating the quality of a wireless link, allowing systems to dynamically adapt their transmission parameters, such as modulation schemes or transmission power, to maintain optimal performance. Overall, RSSI provides a valuable metric for assessing the signal strength of wireless communications, aiding in network selection, optimization, and various other wireless applications."},{"instruction":"tell me more about SDR","output":"Software-Defined Radio (SDR) is a concept and technology that allows radio communication systems to be implemented through software rather than relying solely on dedicated hardware components.

I didn’t really tune the hyperparameters in the config too much, feel free to try! sampling / inference Use the script sample.py to sample either from pre-trained GPT-2 models released by OpenAI, or from a model you trained yourself. For example, here is a way to sample from the largest available gpt2-xl model:If you’d like to sample from a model you trained, use the --out_dir to point the code appropriately. You can also prompt the model with some text from a file, e.g. python sample.py --start=FILE:prompt.txt. efficiency notes For simple model benchmarking and profiling, bench.py might be useful. It’s identical to what happens in the meat of the training loop of train.py, but omits much of the other complexities. Note that the code by default uses PyTorch 2.0. At the time of writing (Dec 29, 2022) this makes torch.compile() available in the nightly release. The improvement from the one line of code is noticeable, e.g. cutting down iteration time from ~250ms / iter to 135ms / iter. Nice work PyTorch team!troubleshooting Note that by default this repo uses PyTorch 2.0 (i.e. torch.compile). This is fairly new and experimental, and not yet available on all platforms (e.g. Windows). If you’re running into related error messages try to disable this by adding --compile=False flag.

Kinesin spindle protein plays a vital role in the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, which is critical for proper cell division. Inhibition of kinesin spindle protein can lead to mitotic arrest and subsequent cell death, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Studies have shown that various small molecules can effectively inhibit kinesin spindle protein, thereby demonstrating anticancer activity. One prominent example is the compound called monastrol, which was one of the first identified inhibitors of kinesin spindle protein. Monastrol binds to a specific allosteric site on the motor domain of the protein, leading to the disruption of its normal function and preventing the proper formation of the mitotic spindle. While monastrol was a breakthrough in targeting kinesin spindle protein, it suffered from limitations in terms of potency and specificity. Subsequent research efforts have focused on identifying and developing more potent and selective inhibitors. These compounds typically target the ATP-binding pocket of kinesin spindle protein, interfering with its ATPase activity necessary for microtubule movement during cell division. Several classes of compounds have shown promise in inhibiting kinesin spindle protein, including inhibitors that belong to the dihydropyrimidines, pyrimidines, benzimidazoles, and spirohydantoin families. These inhibitors have been shown to bind tightly to the ATP-binding pocket of kinesin spindle protein, leading to potent inhibition of its activity and subsequent disruption of mitosis. Furthermore, recent advancements in structure-based drug design, high-throughput screening, and virtual screening have facilitated the discovery and development of potent and specific inhibitors of kinesin spindle protein. These new compounds often have improved pharmacokinetics, selectivity, and efficacy compared to earlier inhibitors. In conclusion, compounds that exhibit anticancer activity against kinesin spindle protein have the potential to disrupt mitosis and inhibit cancer cell growth. Ongoing research and drug development efforts aim to identify and develop more potent and selective inhibitors to target kinesin spindle protein as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment."},{"instruction":"Is there resistance to Eg5 inhibiotrs?","output":"Yes, resistance to Eg5 inhibitors has been observed in some cases. Like many cancer treatments, resistance can eventually develop due to various mechanisms, including: 1. Mutation in the target protein: Eg5 inhibitors target specific binding sites or mechanisms within kinesin spindle protein. Mutations in these binding sites can alter the affinity of the drug for the protein, reducing its effectiveness. 2. Alternative pathway activation: Cancer cells can activate alternative pathways to bypass the need for proper kinesin spindle protein function. These pathways can compensate for the inhibition of Eg5, allowing cancer cells to continue dividing despite the presence of the inhibitor. 3. Drug efflux pumps: Cancer cells can upregulate the expression of drug efflux pumps, such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. These pumps actively transport the Eg5 inhibitors out of the cancer cells, reducing their intracellular concentration and efficacy. 4. Altered cell cycle regulation: Genetic or epigenetic changes in cancer cells can lead to alterations in cell cycle regulation. These changes can affect the dependency of cancer cells on Eg5 function, rendering the inhibitors less effective. To overcome resistance to Eg5 inhibitors, researchers are exploring various strategies, including combination therapies, development of next-generation inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity, and identification of predictive biomarkers that can help identify patients who are more likely to respond to this type of treatment. Additionally, understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance can provide insights into potential combination therapies that can enhance the efficacy of Eg5 inhibitors and overcome resistance."},{"instruction":"Can you identify researchers working on Eg5 drug resistance?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet.

These resources may include CPU time, memory, disk space, input/output devices, and network bandwidth. The OS must efficiently allocate these resources to ensure optimal utilization and fairness. It involves several techniques to allocate resources effectively, such as scheduling algorithms, memory management techniques, and input/output control mechanisms. The resource allocation process involves the following steps: 1. Request: Processes or tasks make requests for resources required to complete their tasks. They may request specific resources or request a certain amount of resources. 2. Selection: The OS selects and grants resources to individual processes based on certain criteria. These criteria may include priority, fairness, and availability of resources. 3. Allocation: The OS allocates the selected resources to the requesting processes. It keeps track of the allocated resources, ensuring that they are available for use by the respective processes. 4. Deallocation: Once a process has completed its task or no longer requires a resource, the OS deallocates and releases the resources back to the resource pool for others to use. 5. Monitoring: The OS continually monitors the resource usage and availability, making adjustments to resource allocation as needed. It also handles cases where conflicts or disputes arise between processes requesting the same resource. Effective resource allocation is essential for achieving optimal system performance, preventing resource starvation, and ensuring fairness among competing processes. Different operating systems employ various resource allocation strategies to meet specific requirements, such as preemptive or non-preemptive scheduling algorithms, page replacement algorithms, disk scheduling algorithms, and so on."},{"instruction":"what is memory leak","output":"A memory leak is a phenomenon that occurs when a computer program fails to release memory that it no longer needs or fails to deallocate memory properly. It can happen when a program dynamically allocates memory but fails to free it when it is no longer required, resulting in the program continuously consuming memory resources without releasing them. A memory leak typically occurs when a program or process repeatedly requests memory from the operating system but does not release it back after it is no longer being used. Over time, these unreleased memory segments accumulate, leading to a progressively decreasing amount of available memory in the system. This can eventually result in a program crash, system slowdown, or even complete system failure if the memory consumption becomes excessive. Memory leaks can be caused by programming errors, such as forgetting to free allocated memory, references to memory areas that are no longer required, or pointer mismanagement. It can also occur due to bugs in the underlying operating system or software libraries that handle memory management. Detecting memory leaks can be challenging since the effects often manifest over an extended period or after the program has been running for a while. Specialized tools, such as memory profilers and debugging tools, can help identify and diagnose memory leaks by monitoring memory allocation and deallocation patterns. To prevent memory leaks, it is essential for programmers to carefully manage memory allocation and deallocation in their code. This involves correctly freeing allocated memory when it is no longer needed, ensuring that all objects or resources are properly released, and detecting and fixing any memory-related bugs during the development and testing phases."},{"instruction":"what is this means MacOS has been more operable than Windows given its proprietary nature","output":"The statement suggests that macOS (the operating system developed by Apple) is often considered to be more user-friendly and easier to operate compared to Windows (the operating system developed by Microsoft).

This model helps mitigate the risk of malware and restricts the potential damage if an infection does occur. 2. Open Source Nature: Linux is an open-source operating system, which means that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and enhance. The open-source nature allows for a larger number of developers to contribute to its security, resulting in the identification and patching of vulnerabilities at a faster rate. 3. Software Repositories: Linux distributions typically have central software repositories from where users can download and install software. These repositories are curated by trusted maintainers who ensure the software is secure and free from malicious code. This centralized approach helps minimize the risk of inadvertently installing infected software. 4. Linux Community: The Linux community plays a vital role in maintaining the security of the operating system. The community actively collaborates to identify and fix security vulnerabilities, sharing knowledge and best practices amongst users. 5. Market Share: The widespread dominance of Windows makes it a prime target for malware creators. Linux, having a smaller market share on desktop systems, makes it less appealing to attackers looking for the maximum impact. However, it is important to note that while Linux is generally more immune to viruses, it is not completely impervious. Linux can still be vulnerable if users make poor security choices, such as installing software from untrusted sources, not applying updates, or misconfiguring the system. It is always advisable to follow security best practices, keep the system up to date, and exercise caution when downloading and installing software to maintain a secure Linux environment."},{"instruction":"你是一个小说资深作者，我给你一篇文章你继续创作，要求有人物对白，情感色彩字数4000字左右","output":"当她走进那间小咖啡馆时，不禁被里面的独特氛围所吸引。各式各样的沙发、靠垫与桌椅散落在空间的每个角落，形成了一个个小小的私密角落。墙上挂满了名人的黑白照片，那些灿烂的微笑仿佛能够穿越时光，唤起记忆中的故事。 她找了一个角落的桌子，沉默地坐下。她是一位刚刚出道的作家，为了寻找创作的灵感，她专门来到这座小镇。她闭上眼睛，试图进入那个她曾经留恋的世界，希望能够感受到这个小镇的独特魅力。 “嗨，可以坐这吗？”一个男声打破了她的沉思。 她睁开眼睛，看见一个身穿蓝色衬衫的男人站在她面前，手上拿着一本书。他微笑着，眼中透露出一种诱人的自信。 “当然可以。”她说着，示意他坐下。 这个男人翻开书，开始读起来。她偷偷观察着他，心中不禁产生了好奇。这个平凡的小镇上，出现了这样一位有着文学气质的男人，似乎与这里并不相符。她决定多留意一下他。 “你喜欢读书？”她小心翼翼地打破了沉默。 他抬起头，不由得露出一丝笑意。“是的，我喜欢读书。这种沉浸其中的感觉让我忘记了现实的烦恼，仿佛我能穿越时空，与那些名人对话。” 她看着他，心中有一种莫名的共鸣。作为一个作家，她明白那种与文字对话的魅力和快感。她希望能够与这个男人分享她的创作，谈论关于文字的一切。 “你有什么作品吗？”他问道。 她有些紧张地点点头。“有一些，但是我还没有完全确定。” 他笑了笑。“给我看看吧。” 她犹豫了一下，然后掏出自己的笔记本，递给了他。他接过笔记本，开始认真地阅读起来。她紧张地盯着他的表情，试图从他的眼神中读出她作品的评价。 片刻的沉默后，他合上笔记本，望着她的眼睛。“这不错，你有潜力成为一名优秀的作家。” 她的心里充满着喜悦，以及对未来的期待。终于有了一个真正的支持者，这对她来说意义重大。 他抬起手，“对了，我是汤姆，很高兴认识你。” 她握住他的手，微笑着。“我是艾米，也很高兴认识你。” 从那一刻起，汤姆和艾米的交往就如同他们的创作一样，充满着那种独特的情感色彩。他们在那间小咖啡馆经常相约，一起讨论文字的奥秘，分享彼此的创作经验。 随着时间的推移，他们的作品越来越受到读者的喜爱。艾米的小说以细腻的情感和独特的视角打动了无数读者，而汤姆的诗歌更是触动了人们内心最深处的柔软。 然而，他们也面临着来自现实生活的压力。艾米的出道之路充满坎坷，她开始逐渐怀疑自己的才华和决定。而汤姆也面临着对于创作的困惑，无法再找到那种最初的灵感和纯净。 在一个夜晚的咖啡馆，艾米和汤姆对坐着。她看着汤姆的目光，知道他也在承受着与她相同的压力。她轻轻地握住了他的手。 “汤姆，我们一起度过了这段旅程的艰难，我相信我们还会一起走过下去。”她温柔地说道。 汤姆的眼中充满了感激和温暖。“是的，我们一直都是彼此最坚实的后盾。当世界失去了希望，我们依然能够找到那些闪烁的星星。” 她轻轻地点头，心中感到一股力量涌上心头。他们或许在这个小镇上，追寻着他们自己的梦想，但他们知道，无论遇到什么困难与挑战，只要相互扶持，他们定能创造出更加美丽的文字。 小咖啡馆的角落里，他们的故事继续展开。无论黑夜如何黯淡，他们依然相信，在文字的世界里，他们将永远拥有彼此的笑容与温暖。"},{"instruction":"继续","output":"他们的创作之旅渐渐引起了更多人的关注。小镇的居民们开始慕名而来，希望能够在这个充满艺术氛围的小咖啡馆中与这对作家交流，感受他们作品中的情感与力量。 一天，一位名叫凯特的年轻女子鼓起勇气，来到了这个小咖啡馆。她坐在一个距离汤姆和艾米不远的位置，默默地观察着。她也是一个梦想成为作家的人，但迄今为止，她的文字还未能吸引到任何人的关注。 凯特一直在等待着合适的时机，直到一个偶然的机会，她和汤姆聊了起来。她告诉他自己的故事，以及为何来到这个小镇。汤姆专注地听着，他的眼神充满了理解与鼓励。 “凯特，你是个勇敢的人。创作是一条充满磨难与挫折的道路，但只要你坚持自己的梦想，努力不懈，你总会找到属于自己的声音和表达方式。”汤姆鼓励道。 凯特感激地点了点头，她感受到了汤姆的真诚，同时也找到了自己内心深处的勇气。 在接下来的日子里，凯特积极投入到自己的创作之中。她探索着各种不同的题材与风格，勇敢地将自己的思想与情感融入到文字里。汤姆和艾米成为了她最坚实的后盾，无论她遇到什么困难，他们总能给予她鼓励和支持。 小咖啡馆也成为了一个灵感的源泉。在这里，凯特遇到了各种各样的人物，例如失恋的恋人、迷茫的旅人、心碎的艺术家等等。每个人都有自己的故事，而凯特学会了倾听这些故事，从中汲取灵感。 随着时间流逝，凯特的作品逐渐受到了读者的喜爱。她以独特的叙事和感人的情感打动了人们的心灵，她的文字开始传播开来，吸引着越来越多的人。 然而，在这次创作之旅中，凯特并不只是收获了成功与荣耀，她也经历了自我怀疑与挣扎。有时候，她会觉得自己的文字并不够好，怀疑自己是否真的有资格成为一名作家。但每当她感到困惑和迷茫，她都会来到小咖啡馆，坐在那个曾经属于汤姆和艾米的角落，看看他们的笑容，回想起他们的鼓励与支持。 一个夜晚，凯特坐在汤姆和艾米旁边，带着一脸豁然开朗的笑容。“你们知道吗，正是你们的鼓励，让我勇敢地坚持了下来。你们是我的灵感之源，也是我追求梦想的动力。” 汤姆和艾米相视一笑，他们深深地明白这种情感和感激。 “凯特，你是个了不起的作家。继续写下去，让你的文字流淌出你内心最深处的声音，去影响和感动更多的人。”艾米鼓励道。 凯特感激地抓住了两人的手，她明白她不再孤单，她已经找到了属于自己的声音和支持。从那天起，他们三人共同面对挑战和困难，彼此鼓励和支持着，互相成长着。 这个小咖啡馆成为了一个特殊的地方，一个聚集着梦想和创作的源泉。在这里，无论是汤姆、艾米还是凯特，他们都找到了彼此的共鸣和理解。他们的文字被细腻地构建起来，融入了爱与希望的力量。 小咖啡馆的角落里，汤姆、艾米和凯特的故事继续延伸。他们相信，在这个充满梦想的世界里，作为作家，他们将永远追求着自己内心最珍贵的东西，并用文字传递给世界。"},{"instruction":"Please correct my sentence structure and grammar.

This sentence emphasizes the action of eating rice itself. \\"He said he loves to eat rice\\" implies that the person has a general fondness for eating rice. This sentence focuses more on the person's enjoyment of the activity of eating rice rather than the rice itself."},{"instruction":"is it right? give me more detailed answer.","output":"Apologies for the brevity of my previous response. I will provide a more detailed explanation below. Both sentences, \\"He said he loves eating rice\\" and \\"He said he loves to eat rice,\\" are grammatically correct. However, there is a slight difference in meaning between the two. The first sentence, \\"He said he loves eating rice,\\" uses the gerund form \\"eating\\" to express the ongoing or continuous nature of the action. This sentence suggests that the person has a general love for the act of eating rice. It emphasizes the enjoyment derived from the specific action of eating rice. The usage of the gerund form \\"eating\\" implies that the individual finds pleasure in the process of consuming rice rather than just favoring rice itself. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"He said he loves to eat rice,\\" uses the infinitive form \\"to eat\\" to express the general preference or habit of eating rice. This sentence implies that the person enjoys experiencing the overall act of eating rice rather than highlighting the process of eating itself. In summary, the difference lies in the emphasis placed on the action of eating rice versus the general enjoyment of the activity. Both sentences are correct; the choice between them depends on the specific nuance or emphasis you wish to convey."},{"instruction":"sounds the same to me","output":"I apologize for any confusion. In terms of conveying the general meaning, both sentences are indeed very similar. The distinction between the two is relatively subtle and may not significantly impact the overall understanding of the statement. In general, both \\"He said he loves eating rice\\" and \\"He said he loves to eat rice\\" express that the person enjoys the act of eating rice. The difference lies in the slight emphasis placed on the specific action (\\"eating\\") in the first sentence and the overall activity (\\"to eat\\") in the second sentence. However, this distinction might not have a significant impact on the overall meaning or understanding of the statement. Both sentences are grammatically correct and can be used interchangeably in most situations without causing any confusion."},{"instruction":"try to decipher this \\"QBSJT OZD UPLZP UBJQFJ\\"","output":"The string \\"QBSJT OZD UPLZP UBJQFJ\\" does not appear to follow a recognizable pattern.
