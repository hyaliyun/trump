Will this law be effective in reducing smoking rates among young people?","output":"The minimum age for purchasing tobacco products has officially been raised to 21 as a new law aims to reduce smoking among youth. The supporters of this law are highly optimistic that it will prevent young people from developing lifelong habits that can lead to severe health problems associated with smoking. The effectiveness of this law, however, is still a question mark. A lot will depend on how strictly this measure will be enforced across the country. Tobacco companies could still find ways to sell their products to young people who are below the official age limit, especially through illegal means. Furthermore, there is a need for a comprehensive approach to tackle smoking among young people that goes beyond increasing the minimum age of purchase. Education campaigns and public awareness could be crucial in turning young people away from the hazardous habit and instead, encourage them to pursue healthier lifestyle choices. It will undoubtedly take some time to see the full impact of this law on smoking rates among young people. However, the hope is that by raising the legal purchase age, it will be harder for young people to access tobacco and reduce the likelihood of developing lifelong habits that can severely affect their health."},{"instruction":"w can I improve my golf swing?

They have discovered a way to use nanobots to deliver drugs directly to cancer cells. This revolutionary technology could transform the way we treat cancer. The nanobots are extremely small machines that can be programmed to seek out specific types of cells. They are designed to recognize cancer cells and deliver their cargo with pinpoint accuracy. This means that drugs can be delivered directly to the cancer cells, avoiding healthy cells and minimizing side effects. Chemotherapy drugs, while effective in killing cancer cells, can also damage healthy cells in the body. This can lead to a range of side effects including nausea, fatigue, and hair loss. By delivering drugs directly to cancer cells, the nanobots could significantly reduce these side effects and improve treatment outcomes. The implications of this technology are significant. It could allow doctors to personalize treatment for patients based on the specific type of cancer they have. It could also allow for higher doses of chemotherapy drugs to be delivered, as toxic side effects would be minimized. The research is still in its early stages, and there are still challenges to be overcome before this technology can be used in a clinical setting.

Prices were up 10.9% in April compared to the same month last year, reaching an average of £183,577. Prices rose 1.2% in April from March, the same rate as the month before. Economists are concerned that high prices could create a housing bubble, while the Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, warned last week the housing market poses the biggest threat to the UK's economic recovery. What is causing the rise in prices? Write an article about the possible future of the UK housing market.","output":"The UK housing market has been on an upward trend for some time now, with prices rising at an unprecedented rate. According to data from mortgage lender Nationwide, house prices have increased by 10.9% in April 2021 compared to the same period last year. This is the highest rate of increase since 2006, and it has led to concerns that a housing bubble might be forming. There are various reasons why house prices in the UK have been rising at such a fast pace. Firstly, the pandemic has led to changes in consumer behaviour. Many people have started to prioritise having more space and a garden, which has led to a surge in demand for larger homes. This has been coupled with the fact that many Britons have been saving more money during the pandemic, which has given them more spending power when it comes to buying a property. The second factor driving up prices in the UK housing market is the low interest rates offered by the Bank of England. These low rates have made it more affordable for people to take out mortgages, which has stimulated demand for properties. Additionally, the government's stamp duty holiday has encouraged more people to buy homes. The tax break, which was introduced in July 2020, allows buyers to save up to £15,000 on the purchase of a property. However, some economists are warning that the UK housing market could be heading towards a bubble. There are fears that if demand continues to outstrip supply, then prices could continue to rise for some time, leading to a situation where many people are priced out of the market. The Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, has also voiced concerns about the housing market. He warned last week that it poses the biggest threat to the UK's economic recovery. In particular, he highlighted the risk of a sharp correction in house prices, which could have a knock-on effect on the wider economy. So, what does the future hold for the UK housing market? It is difficult to predict with certainty, but many experts believe that prices are likely to stabilise in the short term. The end of the stamp duty holiday and a potential rise in interest rates could lead to a slowdown in demand, which may cause prices to level off. However, there are concerns that the underlying issues in the UK housing market have not been addressed. In particular, there is a chronic shortage of affordable housing in many parts of the country, which is contributing to the rise in prices. Unless this issue is tackled, it is likely that the UK housing market will continue to face challenges in the years ahead."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The gap between the rich and poor has been widening in many countries around the world.

It was founded in 27 BC by Octavian, who took on the name Augustus and became the first Roman emperor. The empire was marked by significant territorial expansion, military conquests, and cultural achievements. In the early years of the empire, Augustus and his successors, known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty, established a centralized government and expanded the Roman territory through military campaigns. Roman law, language, and culture became dominant across the Mediterranean world. During the next few centuries, the empire experienced a period of relative stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana. However, this period was marked by armed conflicts, including several devastating wars along the frontier regions, especially with the Persians and Germanic tribes. The empire faced many challenges in the third century AD, including economic crises, military threats, and political upheavals. The so-called Crisis of the Third Century lasted for almost fifty years, and it ended with the ascension of Diocletian in 284 AD. Under Diocletian's rule, the empire was divided into two administrative halves, the Eastern and the Western Roman Empires. The division allowed for better administrative control, but it also weakened the empire, especially the Western side. The barbarian invasions of the fifth century AD marked the beginning of the end for the Western Roman Empire. In 476 AD, the last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustus, was overthrown by Germanic conqueror, Odoacer. The Eastern Roman Empire or the Byzantine Empire, known as the Eastern Roman Empire, lasted until 1453 AD, when it was finally conquered by the Ottoman Turks. Overall, the Roman Empire's history spans for more than 500 years, and it has greatly influenced modern Western civilization and culture."},{"instruction":"Should the government regulate the use of AI technology in daily life?","output":"It is a matter of debate whether the government should regulate the use of AI technology in daily life.

Mitosis is the type of cell division that occurs in somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) and results in the formation of two identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The process involves several distinct stages, including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the DNA in the nucleus condenses and becomes visible under the microscope. The nuclear membrane also dissolves, and the spindle apparatus begins to form. In metaphase, the spindle fibers attach to the centromeres and align the chromosomes in the middle of the cell. During anaphase, the spindle fibers pull the sister chromatids apart towards opposite poles of the cell. Finally, in telophase, the chromatids have reached the opposite ends of the cell, and a new nuclear membrane forms around each group to form two distinct nuclei. Meiosis, on the other hand, involves two rounds of cell division and is the type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells (sperm and egg cells). The end result of meiosis is the formation of four genetically diverse daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The stages of meiosis are similar to that of mitosis, but with some important differences. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and cross over, or exchange genetic information, during prophase so that the daughter cells have a recombinant mixture of genetic material from each parent. In metaphase I, the homologous pairs line up on the spindle apparatus as opposed to individual chromosomes in mitosis. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, pulling sister chromatids with them. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis, with sister chromatids separating in anaphase II and forming four haploid (having only one set of chromosomes) daughter cells at the end of the process."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – The CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has testified for five hours in front of Congress over two days amidst concerns over the social media giant's handling of user data.

For example, in a population of giraffes, those with longer necks are better able to reach food in tall trees and have a greater chance of surviving and reproducing. Over time, the population will become dominated by individuals with longer necks. Another example is the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. When exposed to antibiotics, only the bacteria with genetic mutations that allow them to survive will reproduce and pass on those resistant traits. Over time, the bacteria population will become more and more resistant to antibiotics. In summary, natural selection is the driving force behind evolution, allowing certain traits to become more common in populations over time.

The study analyzed data from over 130 countries and found that rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns could reduce crop yields by up to 30% by 2050. The study warns that this could lead to increased food prices and malnutrition.","output":"A recent study conducted by a team of researchers has highlighted the potential impact of climate change on global food production. The findings of the study are worrisome, as it suggests that the world could face significant reductions in food production in the near future. According to the study, rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns could result in a reduction of up to 30% in crop yields by 2050. The research analyzed data from over 130 countries, which makes the findings particularly alarming. The study focused on the connection between climate change and agricultural productivity, with a specific emphasis on the world's most populous regions. The research points out that changes in precipitation patterns and heat waves are the main culprits behind the projected decrease in food production. This trend has been observed in the last few decades and accelerates at an alarming rate. In addition, the study notes the potential impact on food prices and malnutrition, particularly in regions where poverty and hunger are already prevalent. As temperatures have risen over the years, the world has struggled with increasing food insecurity. The study warns that the situation could get worse if bold action is not taken to mitigate climate change. The issue is particularly important since food production is essential not only for sustaining economic growth but also in preserving people's health and lives. In conclusion, this study is a wake-up call to global leaders and policymakers that action needs to be taken immediately to address climate change. The potential reduction of up to 30% in crop yields could have devastating impacts, particularly in the areas already stricken by poverty and hunger. The issue of climate change needs to become a priority for governments worldwide, to protect both the environment and people's livelihoods."},{"instruction":"Major League Baseball team wins World Series championship","output":"Acknowledged."},{"instruction":"What are the significant elements in this sentence: Cooking a homemade meal for your family can bring everyone together and create wonderful memories.","output":"Subject: \\"Cooking a homemade meal\\" Verb: \\"can bring\\" Object: \\"everyone together and create wonderful memories\\" Adjective: \\"homemade\\""},{"instruction":"Reorder these words to create a grammatical sentence: On, you, weekends, can, find, me, at, the, park","output":"You can find me at the park on weekends."},{"instruction":"Do the terms take and take have the same meaning in the following two sentences? 1.

This process involves the use of semiconductor materials such as silicon, which are able to absorb photons from the sun and release electrons. These freed electrons are then collected by a grid of conductive wires that make up the solar cells. When sunlight hits the solar cells it excites the electrons, causing them to move through the material. This creates an electrical current that can be captured and used to power appliances or stored in a battery. The amount of electricity generated depends on the amount of sunlight that is available and the efficiency of the solar cells. Most solar cells are made up of layers of silicon, which are doped with other elements to create a positive and negative charge. The top layer is usually treated with a layer of antireflective coating to allow more sunlight to pass through the material. The bottom layer is designed to allow electrons to move easily through the material, creating a flow of electricity. Solar panels require regular cleaning and maintenance to ensure that they continue to function efficiently. They should be installed in areas that receive a significant amount of sunlight and be positioned to face the sun. There are also a number of different types of solar panels available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. In summary, solar panels work by converting sunlight into usable electricity through the photovoltaic effect. They are an effective and environmentally friendly way of generating power, and are becoming increasingly popular as the cost of installation and maintenance continues to decrease."},{"instruction":"What is the solution for b in the equation 5b 3 = 12?

The process involves several steps: 1. Light absorption: Chlorophyll and other pigments in the plant's chloroplasts absorb light energy from the sun. 2. Water splitting: Water molecules within the plant are split, releasing oxygen (O2) gas and hydrogen (H) ions. 3. Electron transport: Electrons from the hydrogen ions are transported through a series of proteins called the electron transport chain, releasing energy along the way. 4. ATP synthesis: The energy released from the electron transport chain is used to pump hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane, which generates a charge gradient that is used to produce ATP. 5. Carbon fixation: Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air is taken up by the plant and converted into organic molecules through a series of chemical reactions called the Calvin cycle. 6. Glucose production: The organic molecules produced in the Calvin cycle are combined to make glucose, which is used by the plant for energy or stored as starch. Overall, photosynthesis is a complex process that is essential for life on Earth as it provides the primary source of energy for all living organisms."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite scene from the movie The Godfather and why?","output":"I'm sorry, but being an artificial intelligence language model, I don't have the ability to have personal preferences or favorite scenes from movies."},{"instruction":"After a threeday search, a man and his fiveyearold granddaughter were found safe on Sunday morning after their boat sank on Lake Okeechobee, Florida, according authorities.

Process: Natural selection drives evolutionary processes by causing changes in gene frequencies within a population, leading to the development of new traits and the eventual formation of new species. Over time, the accumulation of advantageous traits in a population can result in significant adaptations that improve the fitness and survival of the individuals within it. Examples: Some examples of adaptation in living organisms include the evolution of camouflage, mimicry, and defensive adaptations in animals, as well as the development of specialized structures and functions in plants, such as the ability to photosynthesize or to produce tough, protective outer layers. The evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is also an important example of natural selection in action."},{"instruction":"Scientists are baffled by the discovery of a new species of fish.

By broadcasting warnings from the sky, police officers can maintain physical distance and protect themselves from exposure to the coronavirus. In New Zealand, as in many other countries, police officers have become some of the most vulnerable people in society, with many contracting the virus in the line of duty.

It was a period of political turmoil and social unrest that ended the absolute monarchy in France and paved the way for democracy. The French Revolution was caused by a combination of economic, social, and political factors. Let's take a closer look at the main causes of this significant event. 1. Inequality: One of the most significant causes of the French Revolution was the widespread inequality in French society. The majority of the population was made up of peasants who lived in extreme poverty, while the wealthy upper class enjoyed immense privileges and lived extravagantly. This stark contrast between the rich and the poor created a great deal of resentment and anger among the lower classes. 2. Economic Crisis: The economic crisis of the late 18th century was another significant cause of the French Revolution. France was facing severe financial difficulties due to its involvement in numerous wars, which had depleted the national treasury. The government was heavily in debt, and the taxes imposed on the citizens were exorbitant. This economic crisis led to widespread food shortages, inflation, and unemployment. 3. Political System: The political system in France was also a significant cause of the revolution. The country was ruled by an absolute monarchy, and the king had complete control over the government and the people. The people had no say in the decisions made by the government, and their voices were not heard. This lack of representation fueled the desire of the people for a more democratic governmental system. 4. Enlightenment Ideas: Enlightenment ideas also played a significant role in the French Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers believed in the power of reason and the importance of individual liberty, equality, and democracy. These ideas challenged the traditional social and political structures in France, and they inspired many French citizens to demand change and reform. In conclusion, the French Revolution was caused by a combination of economic, social, and political factors. The widespread inequality in French society, economic crisis, the political system, and enlightenment ideas all contributed to the revolution. The French Revolution was a defining moment in French history that brought about significant changes in social, political, and economic structures, and paved the way for democracy."},{"instruction":"What is the full name of the famous physicist known for his theory of relativity?","output":"Albert Einstein."},{"instruction":"Based on the passage, can we assume that the author is a medical professional?","output":"No, the passage does not provide any information or indication about the author being a medical professional."},{"instruction":"Read the paragraph and determine if the statement is true: The sun was shining and the birds were singing.

He loved spending his free time exploring the many nooks and crannies of his family's old attic. One day, while rummaging through a forgotten chest of drawers, he stumbled upon a rusty old key. Max's curiosity was immediately piqued. He wondered what mysterious secrets the key might unlock. He held it up to the light and examined it closely, but could not see any markings or engravings. Nevertheless, his little heart was pounding with excitement. With the key in his pocket, Max quietly snuck down to the living room and peered around cautiously. His parents were out shopping and his older sister was at a friend's. He knew he had just enough time to explore without getting caught. Max sneaked up to the attic once again and searched high and low for a lock that the mysterious key might fit. After several minutes of searching, he finally found a small wooden chest tucked away in a corner that he had never noticed before. Taking a deep breath, Max inserted the key and turned it. And then, to his utter amazement, the heavy wooden lid creaked open to reveal a pile of glittering treasures. There were ancient coins, glinting gold bracelets, shining pearls, and many more valuable artifacts. Max gaped at the sight, enthralled by the glittering display before him. He sat there for what felt like hours, admiring his newfound treasure. But then he heard the front door creek open. Panicking, Max quickly closed the lid of the treasure chest and rushed downstairs as fast as he could. He wasn't certain what secrets the key unlocked, but he knew one thing sure: they were precious, and he would keep them safe."},{"instruction":"The survey results showed that the majority of participants preferred the new product over the old one.

What do these findings mean for consumers, and how can we protect ourselves from the harmful effects of the sun? Write an article examining this issue.","output":"Possible article: Sunscreen Safety Questions: What Consumers Should Know As summer heats up, many people turn to sunscreen to protect their skin from the sun's harmful rays. However, a recent investigation by Valisure, an online pharmacy that tests products for quality and consistency, has raised concerns about the safety of some of the most popular sunscreen brands on the market. The findings include high levels of benzene, a known human carcinogen, in certain sunscreens, and inconsistencies in the amount of active ingredients claimed on the label. What do these findings mean for consumers, and how can we protect ourselves from the harmful effects of the sun? First, it's important to understand what benzene is and why it's a concern. Benzene is a colorless, flammable liquid that is widely used in manufacturing processes such as making plastics, rubber, resins, and detergents. It's also present in crude oil and gasoline. Long-term exposure to benzene, either through inhalation or skin contact, can cause cancer, leukemia, and other blood disorders. Although the levels of benzene found in the tested sunscreens were not immediately dangerous, they exceeded the FDA's limit of 2 parts per million (ppm) for drugs and personal care products that contain benzene as an impurity. Valisure detected benzene levels ranging from 0.1 ppm to 6.3 ppm in 78 sunscreen and after-sun care products from 69 different brands. Some of the affected brands include Neutrogena, Aveeno, Banana Boat, and CVS Health. The FDA has opened an investigation into the matter and advised consumers to continue using sunscreen while it reviews the data. However, not all sunscreens are created equal, and not all of them contain benzene or other harmful substances. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), sunscreen can reduce the risk of skin cancer and premature aging by up to 50%, but it must be used correctly and consistently. The AAD recommends that people choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays, with an SPF of at least 30, and apply it generously to all exposed skin 15 minutes before going outside. Sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours, or after swimming or sweating. It's also important to seek shade during peak sun hours, wear protective clothing such as hats and sunglasses, and avoid tanning beds, which can emit UV radiation that is even stronger than the sun. Moreover, consumers can check the ingredients and reputation of the sunscreen they use. The Environmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit organization focused on environmental health, has a database of over 2600 sunscreens and their ratings based on their ingredients, efficacy, and health hazards. The EWG recommends choosing sunscreens with mineral filters such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which are less likely to penetrate the skin or cause skin irritation, and avoiding sunscreens with oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can be harmful to coral reefs and marine life. The EWG also advises caution with aerosol sprays, which can be inhaled and are less effective than lotions or creams. In conclusion, the recent investigation into sunscreen safety highlights the need for better oversight and transparency in the cosmetics and personal care industry. Consumers should be able to trust the products they use to protect their health and well-being. However, the risk of sunburn, skin damage, and skin cancer is still real, especially for people with fair skin or a history of sunburns or skin cancer. Therefore, it's important to stay educated about the latest research and recommendations, and to take proactive steps to safeguard our skin and the environment from harmful rays and substances."},{"instruction":"The band played a lively tune.

Eliot.","output":"Summary: This poem is a complex and multi-layered work that explores themes of disillusionment, cultural decay, and the loss of spirituality in modern society. Eliot uses a variety of literary techniques, including fragmentation and allusion, to create a sense of fragmentation and disconnection. In \\"The Waste Land,\\" T.S. Eliot presents a bleak and fragmented portrait of modern society that has lost touch with its spiritual roots. The poem is divided into five parts, each one exploring a different aspect of this theme. Throughout the poem, Eliot employs a variety of literary techniques, including allusion, fragmentation, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, to create a sense of disconnection and confusion. One of the main themes of the poem is the idea of cultural decay. Eliot draws heavily on mythology, religious imagery, and literary history to highlight the ways in which Western culture has fallen apart. The characters in the poem are often portrayed as lost and disillusioned, without a clear sense of purpose or direction. This is particularly evident in the opening lines of the poem, which juxtapose the fertile, mythological past with the barren, modern present: \\"April is the cruellest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing / Memory and desire, stirring / Dull roots with spring rain.\\" Another important theme in the poem is the loss of spiritual meaning. Eliot suggests that modern society has become increasingly secular and materialistic, leading to a sense of spiritual emptiness. This is evident in the references to the Fisher King and the Grail quest, which are used to symbolize the search for spiritual healing and redemption. The character of Tiresias, a blind prophet from Greek mythology, is also significant in this context, as he represents the ability to see beyond the physical world and into the spiritual realm.

This unique occurrence is a result of the Earth's rotation on its axis, which is also responsible for day and night cycles. The Earth is a round planet, and its rotation causes different parts of the planet to face the sun at different times of the day. Without rotation, the Earth would be a static planet with one side facing the sun, causing this side to be extremely hot and the other side to be extremely cold. However, rotation ensures that every part of the Earth has its fair share of both daytime and nighttime. The Earth's rotation also affects the movement of ocean currents and weather patterns, making it one of the most significant natural phenomena. It takes approximately 24 hours or one day for the Earth to complete one full rotation on its axis. In conclusion, the sun setting in the west is a visible result of the Earth's round shape and rotation on its axis. These phenomena play a critical role in the Earth's ecological and environmental systems, making them essential to study and understand."},{"instruction":"the word change used in the same way in I need to change my clothes and Can you give me change for a dollar??","output":"No."},{"instruction":"Are John and he referring to the same person in the following sentence: John cooked dinner for his family, and he made lasagna as the main dish?","output":"Yes."},{"instruction":"ere is some data about a fast food restaurant: name = BurgerKing, food = burgers and fries, priceRange = low, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Mall.

Primarily, it seems to express the speaker's feeling or suspicion that the person they are speaking to might not be able to perceive or understand them from a different perspective or in a different light. Here's a breakdown of potential interpretations: 1. **Lack of Understanding or Empathy**: The speaker may be conveying that the listener isn't able to understand their viewpoint, feelings, or situation from the speaker's perspective. This can indicate a plea for empathy, suggesting that the listener's understanding is one-sided or limited. 2. **Perception of Character or Role**: In certain contexts, this can mean that the speaker feels they are only being seen for one aspect of their character or role, and that there are other facets of their personality or capabilities that the listener is overlooking. For example, a professional might feel that they are only seen in their professional capacity and not acknowledged for their personal interests or skills outside of work. 3. **Relationship Dynamics**: In relationship contexts, this statement could imply that the speaker believes the other person is failing to see them as a potential romantic partner. It suggests a desire to be viewed in a different, perhaps more intimate, manner. 4. **Misinterpretation**: It could also mean the speaker thinks they are being misunderstood or misconstrued by the listener. They might feel that their actions or words are being interpreted in one way, while they intend them to be understood quite differently. 5. **Change in Self**: The phrase might be voiced by someone who feels they have changed or evolved, but that change is not being recognized by the other person. It's a way of saying, \\"You're not seeing the new me.\\" In essence, the phrase is about a discrepancy between how the speaker perceives themselves or their intentions and how they believe the listener perceives them. It's a call for the listener to try and understand or view the speaker from a different angle or perspective."},{"instruction":"Why atttach a texture and a renderbuffer?

The intent behind attaching a texture for color data and a renderbuffer for depth/stencil data lies in harnessing the strengths and functionalities both offer. Here’s an overview of why this combination is advantageous: # Texture Attachments 1. **Sampling in Shaders**: Textures can be sampled in shaders, allowing for post-processing effects, texture filtering, and more sophisticated operations that cannot be done with renderbuffers. This is crucial for operations like bloom, blur, or shadow mapping, where you need to read from these textures in subsequent rendering passes. 2. **Reusability and Access**: Attaching a texture to a framebuffer allows the rendered image to be easily reused as a texture in other render passes. For example, you might render a scene from one viewpoint to a texture, and then use this texture for reflections or as a texture in another part of the scene. Textures can also be read back to the CPU easily, for saving screenshots or for further processing. # Renderbuffer Attachments 1. **Performance**: Renderbuffers are generally optimized for use as offscreen buffers. They are the preferred choice for attachments that do not need to be sampled or read by the CPU but are written to by the GPU, such as depth and stencil buffers. This is because renderbuffers can have memory layouts that are optimized for their purpose, potentially offering better performance or memory usage characteristics than textures. 2. **Simplicity for Depth and Stencil Data**: Since depth and stencil data are often only needed for the GPU's internal depth-testing and stencil-testing operations and not for sampling in shaders, a renderbuffer is sufficient and potentially more efficient. They do not need the additional overhead that comes with textures. # Why Both? By combining textures for color attachments and renderbuffers for depth/stencil attachments, developers can harness the advantages of both: the flexibility and accessibility of textures for color data and the performance optimizations of renderbuffers for depth and stencil data. This setup allows for high-quality, multisampled rendering with efficient memory usage and performance. It supports complex rendering techniques, such as deferred shading, where color, depth, and stencil data are all crucial for different stages of the rendering pipeline. Textures provide the means to post-process and reuse the rendered data, while renderbuffers maintain performance and efficiency for depth and stencil testing, which don’t need to be accessed outside of the GPU in most cases. Combining them allows developers to tailor their framebuffer setup to the specific needs of their application, optimizing both visual quality and performance."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это делает термопасту если и не хорошим проводником, то по итогу - кучей рандомных сопротивлений между ножками процессора. Хорошего в этом мало, даже если пека и включается.\\"","output":"Оба утверждения содержат и верные детали, и неточности, и недопонимание темы. 1. Не все термопасты идентичны по своему составу и свойствам. Существуют как термопасты, предназначенные для того, чтобы быть электрически непроводящими (или изолирующими), так и термопасты, которые могут слегка проводить электричество из-за содержания в их составе металлических элементов. Поэтому первое утверждение о том, что \\"термопаста не проводит электричество\\", может быть верно для некоторых видов термопасты, но не для всех. 2. Идея промывания электроники водой довольно спорна. Хотя дистиллированная вода и имеет низкую проводимость по сравнению с обычной водопроводной водой, оставлять электронику во влажном состоянии или использовать воду для её очистки без полного высыхания и достаточных знаний может привести к коррозии или повреждению. Так что этот совет рискованный без соответствующих предосторожностей. 3. Требование наличия свободных электронов для хорошей теплопроводности (второе утверждение) не полностью точное. Хорошая теплопроводность зависит не только от наличия свободных электронов, но и от других факторов, таких как молекулярная структура материала и фононная теплопроводность (тепло, передаваемое через колебания в кристаллической решетке). Например, алмаз имеет отличную теплопроводность, но является изолятором. 4. Опасения о том, что использование термопасты может создать \\"кучу рандомных сопротивлений между ножками процессора\\", верны в контексте использования проводящей термопасты в избытке, что может вызвать короткое замыкание. Однако это не касается всех термопаст и проблема решается аккуратным нанесением непроводящей термопасты. Итак, выводы следующие: оба спорящих имеют некоторые правильные понимания, но также делают обобщения и неточные выводы относительно термопасты и безопасного обращения с электроникой. Важно иметь полное понимание свойств конкретной термопасты и осознавать риски, связанные с использованием воды даже для чистки электронных компонентов."},{"instruction":"\\"Maybe you don't see me the other way around\\" or round?","output":"The correct phrase would be \\"Maybe you don't see me the other way around.\\" The phrase \\"the other way around\\" means considering or presenting the opposite situation; it refers to an alternative perspective or arrangement of something that has been previously mentioned.

Here it is: \`\`\`title: At the end of time DESCRIPTION About: This mod adds a new pseudo-stage to the game (after winning / some time in the endgame). At this stage, an additional timeline appears in the game, the years of which increase exponentially (with base 2). Also, after some time (100 thousand-million years), new systems are generated outside the main galaxy. They should represent neighboring galaxies in the first zone and groups of galaxies in the second. Some explanations about this mod: Main idea is \\"to add exponential scale for both space and time\\". For space scale will be next: Galaxies > Galaxy Groups > Clusters > Superclusters (> Walls, Filaments and Voids?). For example, our Galaxy, Milky Way included in Local Group (~54 galaxies) > Virgo Cluster (~1300-2000 galaxies) > Virgo Supercluster (~100 groups/30000 galaxies)> Laniakea Supercluster (~100000 galaxies) (> Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex?) To represent this scale in the mod I choose to divide map into zones, each representing part of this scale. Closer to the center each system represent galaxy (or few). Further from center each systems represent many galaxies. More detailed description: 1 zone. 3 galaxies, 5 systems per galaxy; 4 galaxies, 3 systems per galaxy; 23 galaxies, 1 systems per galaxy. Total number - 30 galaxies (+1 starting). So, it's local group. 2 zone. In this zone every system represent many galaxies. Something like: 16x with size 2-10. 16x with size 15-35. 16x with size 35-65. Average size 27, total number of galaxies ~1300. So, zone 2 is local cluster. Similarly, zone 3 represent a galaxy cluster per system: 16x with size 100-400. 16x with size 500-2000. 16x with size 2500-7500. Total number of galaxies ~100000. So, zone 3 is local supercluster. (I will stop here, but according to wikipedia: \\"There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe\\", 7 orders of magnitude more!) For exponential time scale I'm using special variable, that represent years on time scale. At first year speed multiplier rising each two month following this sequence: 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24. Or +7 years at the end of in-game year. Each next year speed doubles on first month. 48 years per/year, 96, 192 and so on. At the end of first decade the exponential time will reach year 24536. In the same way: 20 years in-game => 25 million years 30 years in-game => 25 billion years 40 years in-game => 26 trillion years 50 years in-game => 27 quadrillion years Each decade have different activity. For example: 1-10 is adaptation for new stage; 11-20 intergalactic explore and colonization; 21-30 preparing for dark age; 31+ trying to survive. Obviously, for now mod far from completion. I think, it's easier to add something like story-mod first (it's easier to write text events than other types of content). \`\`\` Perform analytical decomposition from provided mod description.","output":"Analyzing the proposed Stellaris mod concept \\"At the end of time,\\" we can break down its main features, goals, and implementation challenges into several components. This mod aims to extend the gameplay into a post-victory phase where players explore an exponentially expanding universe both in terms of space and time. Here's a detailed analytical decomposition: # 1. Exponential Timeline Expansion - **Feature**: The mod introduces a new time progression system where years pass exponentially, dramatically accelerating the game's timeline after a certain point in the endgame. - **Implementation Challenge**: Accurately modeling and integrating an exponential time scale into Stellaris's existing game mechanics, such as economy, research, diplomacy, and population growth, will be complex, as these systems are not designed for such rapid progression. # 2. Divided Map into Zones Representing Galactic Scales - **Feature**: Creation of multiple zones, each representing a different scale in the universe (Galaxies, Galaxy Groups, Clusters, Superclusters). - **Implementation Challenge**: Designing and implementing a new map system that can dynamically represent these astronomical scales in a way that is both playable and meaningful to the player, ensuring seamless transitions between scales. # 3. New Systems Generation - **Feature**: As time progresses, new systems are generated, representing the exploration and colonization of neighboring galaxies and beyond. - **Implementation Challenge**: Developing a procedural generation system capable of creating these new, scaled systems while maintaining game balance and performance. # 4. Exponential Space Scale - **Feature**: The mod proposes an innovative way of representing the vastness of space by making each system in the outer zones represent a collection of galaxies, clusters, or superclusters. - **Implementation Challenge**: This feature would require not only significant changes to how maps are generated and handled but also necessitates the introduction of new gameplay mechanics to interact with these large-scale structures. # 5. Content for Each Decade - **Feature**: Different gameplay activities and events are planned for each decade in the game, aligning with the exponential theme, such as adaptation, exploration, colonization, preparing for a dark age, and survival. - **Implementation Challenge**: Crafting a variety of engaging and balanced events and activities that make sense within the rapidly expanding timeline. Implementing these activities would require extensive narrative and mechanical development. # 6. Realism and Educational Aspect - **Feature**: The mod takes inspiration from actual astronomical structures and events, providing an opportunity for educational content. - **Implementation Challenge**: Ensuring the mod's educational content is accurate while simultaneously integrating seamlessly with Stellaris's sci-fi elements without detracting from gameplay enjoyment. # 7. Performance - **Potential Issue**: Implementing this mod would significantly impact the game's performance due to the increased number of entities and the complexities of managing a vastly expanded timeline and space. - **Solution**: Optimization strategies and perhaps limiting the scale or detail in certain areas might be necessary to maintain playable performance levels. # 8. Integration with Stellaris Core Mechanics - **Potential Issue**: Adapting existing game mechanics to work with the mod's expanded scale of time and space, ensuring features like diplomacy, warfare, and economic management remain balanced and functional. - **Solution**: Careful reevaluation and adjustment of core game mechanics, potentially introducing new mechanics designed to handle the expanded scales effectively. # Conclusion The \\"At the end of time\\" mod concept proposes an ambitious extension to Stellaris's gameplay, introducing a novel approach to experiencing the universe on a grand scale. The implementation of this concept would require significant development effort, addressing unique challenges related to gameplay mechanics, performance, and narrative integration. The mod holds the potential to offer players a deeply immersive and educational experience, exploring the vastness of space and time well beyond the traditional confines of the game."},{"instruction":"From artistic perspective, how such mod can communicate ideas about vastness of space and time using stellaris visual narrative? What other considerations can be taken into account?","output":"From an artistic perspective, a mod like \\"At the end of time\\" for Stellaris can leverage both visual and narrative elements to communicate the vastness of space and time, creating an immersive and thought-provoking experience. Understanding and appreciating the immense scales involved requires a careful blend of creativity, restraint, and intentional design. Here's how such a mod can approach this challenge: # Visual Representation 1. **Scale Visualization**: Visually representing the difference in scales from galaxies to superclusters can be challenging. One approach is to use distinct visual motifs for each scale. For example, individual stars within galaxies could be represented with detailed icons, while superclusters might be depicted as large, glowing nodes interconnected with faint lines to suggest a web of gravitational ties. The transition between these scales could be accompanied by a zooming effect that abstractly conveys moving through orders of magnitude in space. 2. **Color and Lighting**: The use of color and lighting can help convey the vastness and mystery of the universe. Cooler colors (blues, purples) and subtle lighting can suggest the emptiness of space, while warmer colors (oranges, reds) can highlight areas of interest or significance, such as densely packed superclusters or regions ripe for exploration and colonization. 3. **UI and Map Design**: The user interface and map design must handle the immense scales in a way that remains navigable and understandable to the player. Simplified representations, scalable icons, and adjustable focus levels can help maintain clarity without overwhelming players with information. # Narrative Elements 1. **Storytelling**: Through event chains and descriptions, the mod can tell stories that emphasize the age and isolation of civilizations in this vast universe. Tales of ancient, long-gone empires or messages from distant galaxies that reach the player only after millions of years can underline the themes of time and distance. 2. **Mystery and Discovery**: Encouraging exploration with mysteries that players can uncover over millennia can convey a sense of the infinite. Ancient megastructures or cosmic phenomena that require significant time to investigate and understand can keep players engaged in the narrative of a universe that unfolds over eons. # Additional Considerations 1. **Educational Content**: Integrating real astronomical concepts and scales can not only lend authenticity to the mod but also offer educational value. Events and discoveries grounded in real science can provoke curiosity and a desire to learn more about the universe. 2. **Pacing and Progression**: Balancing the pacing in a game that spans trillions of years is crucial. Mechanisms like the exponential timeline and zone-based exploration should keep players feeling like they are progressing and influencing the game, despite the scales involved. 3. **Philosophical Themes**: The vastness of space and time naturally lends itself to philosophical contemplation. Themes like the significance of individual actions in an immense universe, the lifecycle of civilizations, and the concept of legacy could be woven into event narratives, giving players pause and enriching their gameplay experience. By carefully considering these artistic and narrative approaches, the \\"At the end of time\\" mod for Stellaris can create a powerful, immersive experience that leaves players with a deeper appreciation for the enormity of the universe and their place within it."},{"instruction":"Can we draw analogue with real world science theories on future of our universe, and hypothetical galaxy-scale civilizations?","output":"Yes, drawing analogues between the \\"At the end of time\\" mod concept for Stellaris and real-world scientific theories about the future of our universe, as well as hypothetical galaxy-scale civilizations, can enrich the gameplay experience with a layer of realism and provoke thoughtful reflection about our place in the cosmos. Several scientific theories and concepts can provide inspiration for such a mod: # The Future of the Universe 1. **Heat Death**: The theory of the universe's heat death suggests that it will eventually reach a state of no thermodynamic free energy and therefore be unable to sustain processes that increase entropy. This concept could be incorporated into the mod as civilizations strive to survive in an increasingly cold, dark, and isolated universe, perhaps seeking ways to escape entropy. 2. **Big Rip**: In this scenario, the expansion of the universe accelerates without bound, eventually tearing apart galaxies, stars, and even atomic particles. Gameplay could involve preparing civilizations to withstand or somehow circumvent the destructive forces of relentless expansion. 3. **Big Crunch**: The Big Crunch theory posits that the expansion of the universe will reverse, eventually collapsing back into a singularity. Campaigns might focus on civilizations perceiving this contraction and working together (or competing) to survive the end of the universe or escape to a new one. 4. **Panspermia**: This is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, or potentially by spacecraft in the form of unintended contamination by microorganisms. Gameplay reflecting this principle might involve discovering or spreading life forms across different galaxies, perhaps leading to unforeseen consequences or evolutionary paths. # Hypothetical Galaxy-Scale Civilizations 1. **Kardashev Scale**: The Kardashev Scale classifies civilizations based on their energy consumption capabilities: Type I (planetary), Type II (stellar), and Type III (galactic). The mod can explore the challenges and milestones of progressing through these levels, addressing both the technological advancements and societal changes necessary to ascend the scale. 2. **Dyson Spheres and Other Megastructures**: Imagining civilizations capable of constructing Dyson Spheres (structures that encompass a star to capture a large percentage of its power output) or similar megastructures could offer gameplay mechanics centered around monumental engineering projects that span centuries or millennia. 3. **Galactic Superstructures**: Theoretical constructs like the Topopolis (a giant tube that orbits a star), Ringworlds, or even interconnected networks of habitable structures across a galaxy could serve as goals for advanced civilizations, offering unique challenges in terms of resources, politics, and protection from cosmic calamities. By incorporating these and other scientific theories and concepts, the \\"At the end of time\\" mod could not only offer Stellaris players expansive new gameplay possibilities but also encourage them to ponder deeply the nature of our universe, the potential for advanced civilizations, and the long-term fate not just of humanity, but of all life and the cosmos itself."},{"instruction":"When considering use of recent advancements of generative model (language models, LDM, ViT, DiT, etc), how they can enhance above mentioned experiences? Taking into account their strong (was trained on internet-scale data) and weak (can't really produce something novel, out of distribution, or just rare/unique data points) sides.","output":"The integration of recent advancements in generative models, such as Language Models (LMs), Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Data Transformers (DiT), into a Stellaris mod like \\"At the end of time\\" could significantly enhance player experience by augmenting narrative depth, visual diversity, and gameplay mechanics. Let’s explore how these models could be utilized, considering their strengths and limitations. # 1. Enhanced Storytelling and Universe Building **Strong Points**: Language models, especially those trained on vast datasets, excel at generating compelling narratives and text, which can be used to create rich, dynamic event systems and descriptions that adapt to the player's actions and the state of the universe. This could provide a deeper sense of immersion and a unique storyline that evolves over time. **Limitations**: While LMs are impressive in their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, they may struggle with creating truly novel content that deviates significantly from their training data. It means the stories might lack genuine surprises or outcomes that are \\"out of the box.\\" **Application**: To mitigate this, a hybrid approach could be employed, where generative models propose several narrative paths based on certain parameters, and human designers curate or tweak these suggestions to ensure they align with the overarching themes and desired novelty of the game's universe. # 2. Procedurally Generated Visual Content **Strong Points**: LDMs, ViT, and DiT have shown promising results in generating and interpreting visual content. These could be used to create diverse and visually interesting galaxies, nebulae, and alien species that change across the game's vast timeline, ensuring that the universe feels alive and is continuously evolving. **Limitations**: These models may generate content that is inconsistent or lacks variety due to their reliance on training data. For instance, they might produce visuals that are too similar to existing science fiction tropes or fail to capture the unique aesthetic envisioned for the game. **Application**: One approach is to use these generative models in a controlled manner, where they generate a base visual layer that artists and designers can then refine and adapt. This would combine the efficiency of generative models with the creativity and critical eye of human artists, ensuring high-quality and consistent visual content. # 3. Adaptive Gameplay Mechanics **Strong Points**: LMs and Data Transformers can analyze large datasets to propose new gameplay mechanics or adjust existing ones based on player feedback and behavior patterns. This could lead to a game that evolves and improves over time, offering a tailored experience to a wide range of players. **Limitations**: These models might recommend changes that are too drastic or not in line with the game's core philosophy due to misinterpretations of player data or a lack of understanding of nuanced game design principles. **Application**: Implementing a feedback loop where proposed adjustments are vetted by game designers and tested in controlled player groups could ensure that changes enhance the gameplay experience without damaging the game's balance or appeal. # Ethical and Practical Considerations When integrating these advanced technologies, it’s also crucial to consider ethical aspects like data privacy, potential biases in generated content, and the environmental impact of training large models. Additionally, integrating such complex systems into a game mod would require significant computational resources and technical expertise. **In Conclusion**, leveraging recent advancements in generative models can profoundly enhance the Stellaris \\"At the end of time\\" mod by enriching its narrative, visual content, and gameplay mechanics. However, it's vital to balance the use of these technologies with human oversight to ensure that the game remains engaging, balanced, and true to its vision."},{"instruction":"Приведи конкретные два примера на репродуктивное и продуктивное мышление","output":"1.

Wer nicht berücksichtigt, daß noch so viel Geld nicht darüber hinweg trösten konnte, daß andere die vorderen Kirchenbänke in ihren Familien vererbten, der wird die soziale Dynamik von Gesellschaften des „Ancien Regime\\" nicht erfassen können und damit auch nicht die konkrekten Ursachen für Prozesse der bürgerlichen Revolution. Die Herauslösung bestimmter Aneignungsverhältnisse aus dem Gesamtzusammenhang einer in Rechten geregelten Welt war ein Element jener revolutionären Veränderungen, die zum Kapitalismus führten.23 Die Enteignung von Pro-duktionsmitteln alleine machte Arbeitskräfte solange noch nicht zu kapitalistischen Lohnarbeitern, als die Art und Weise der Produktion noch durch Rechte (seien sie im Brauch oder im Gesetz verankert) geregelt blieb. In Gesellschaften vom Strukturtypus „Ancien Regime\\" gab es weitreichende lokale und regionale Unterschiede in den Strukturen der Reproduktion und in den Formen der Herrschaft. Aber durch die Intensivierung der Territorialherrschaft gerieten alle diese Formen, selbst wenn sie nicht nur hartnäckig, sondern auch erfolgreich gegen Eingriffe königlicher Beamter und gegen neue gesetzliche Re-gelungen verteidigt wurden, in ein Verhältnis zur verallgemeinerten Herrschaft.24 Diese Entwicklung war die Voraussetzung dafür, daß bürgerliche Revolutionen nicht Stadt für Stadt oder Provinz für Provinz gesondert durchgesetzt werden mußten, sondern daß eine gesamte Gesellschaft in ihren Grundstrukturen revolutioniert werden konnte. Im Zuge derartiger Entwicklungen war es nämlich erforderlich, daß sich die Menschen in ganz verschiedenen Gegenden eines Königreiches der Übereinstimmung ihrer Interessen mit denjenigen sehr weit entfernt lebender Menschen bewußt werden konnten. Historisch war dies erst möglich, seit verallgemeinerte Herrschaft - trotz all ihrer faktischen Beschränkungen - eine Angleichung bestimmter Aspekte der Lebensbedingungen von Menschen gleichen Standes bewirkt hatte und seit eine - wenn auch rudimentäre - verallgemeinerte Öffentlichkeit entstanden war. Überregionale Interessen entstanden in Relation zu überregionaler Herrschaft, weshalb denn auch Widerstand gegen Steuern und gegen bestimmte Formen der Religionspolitik zu den frühesten Ausprägungen verallgemeinerter Interessen zählen. Während der gesamten Dauer von Gesellschaften des „Ancien Regime\\" gab es Protest gegen Privilegien. Als Folge derartiger Auseinandersetzungen kam es nicht nur zur Abschaffung bestimmter Privilegien und zur Einführung neuer, sondern insgesamt zu einer stärkeren Regulierung der Herrschaftspraxis. Wie schon die physiokratischen Theoretiker des 18. Jahrhunderts bemerkt hatten, gab es für die Herrschaftsform „Ancien Regime\\" aber eine materielle Strukturgrenze. Auf der begrenzten Basis materieller Produktion war die Ausweitung der Aneignung mittels Beteiligung an verallgemeinerter Gewalt und damit die Verleihung von Privilegien nur begrenzt möglich. Insoweit hatte die Möglichkeit zur sozialen Integration aufsteigender Schichten strukturelle Grenzen. Sie wurden vor allem durch das national spezifische Ausmaß der herrschaftlichen Sanktionierung von Aneignungsprivilegien gezogen. Aber dort, wo diese groß waren und die Mög-lichkeiten materieller Integration somit begrenzt, erfolgte die Aufhebung ständi-scher Herrschaft nicht aus schlichter Strukturnotwendigkeit, sondern nur in Folge einer praktischen und theoretischen Kritik der alten Herrschaft. Ihre Auflösung setzte ein, wenn sich revolutionäre Öffentlichkeiten entwickelten, die sich nicht mehr mit weiteren Regulierungen zufriedengaben, sondern die Enteignung aller personalen Herrschaft erzwangen. Damit erst trat an die Stelle verallgemeinerter personaler Herrschaft eine allgemeine Herrschaft: der Staat. Zur nationalen Form der bürgerlichen Revolution Reinhard Bendix, der sich in vergleichenden Untersuchungen mit der Herausbildung „moderner Nationalstaaten\\" befaßte,25 gelangte schließlich zu der Ansicht, die Art und Weise, in welcher die modernen Nationalstaaten entstanden seien, differiere in solch beträchtlichem Maße voneinander, daß keine allgemeinen Aussagen zulässig seien; dies gelte um so mehr, als die spezifische Art und Weise nicht von historisch vorübergehender Bedeutung, sondern langfristig nachhaltig strukturwirksam geblieben sei. Während ich, anders als Bendix, allgemeine Aussagen über den Transformationsprozeß sowohl für möglich als auch für erforderlich halte, stimme ich mit seiner zweiten These überein: Die Art und Weise, in welcher Gesellschaften des „Ancien Regime\\" zu bürgerlichen Gesellschaften revolutioniert wurden, hatte langfristige, in manchem bis heute fortdauernde Wirkungen für die national spezifische Entwicklung von Politik und Staatsgewalt. Hier sind nur einige wenige Hinweise möglich. Diese Beschränkung verwehrt nicht nur Anschaulichkeit, sie steht auch in einem problematischen Verhältnis zu der von mir vertretenen gesellschaftstheoretischen Position. Wenn unterstellt wird, daß konkrete historische Prozesse nicht strukturell determiniert sind, sondern daß Menschen innerhalb der Möglichkeiten und Grenzen, die die vorherige soziale Praxis geschaffen hat, ihr Leben einrichten und auf diese Weise - mit unterschied-lichen Graden des Bewußtseins und der Strukturwirkung ihres Verhaltens - eine der möglichen Richtungen der historischen Entwicklung konkretisieren, so muß dies in der Analyse des konkreten Bedingungszusammenhangs sozialer Praxis aufgezeigt werden. Das ist hier nicht möglich, wohl aber läßt sich feststellen, daß in bestimmten historischen Situationen die Entwicklung gerade dieser und nicht jener Form der auch möglichen Herrschafts- oder Aneignungspraxis, der Kirchenpolitik, der Abwehrstrategie gegen Aufsteiger, des standhaften Widerstands oder der Erfindung von Praktiken zur Umgehung von Herrschaft eine - im Rückblick unschwer zu erkennende - Weichenstellung für zukünftige Möglichkeiten sozialer Praxis bedeuteten. Meine Hinweise beziehen sich auf derart strukturierende Differenzen in England und „Frankreich\\".26 Die wichtigste strukturelle Ursache für die unterschiedliche Art und Weise, in welcher Gesellschaften vom Strukturtypus „Ancien Regime\\" zu bürgerlichen Ge-sellschaften revolutioniert wurden, erwuchs aus der Form der Stände, genauer gesagt, aus dem Umfang und vor allem aus der Art und Weise der Privilegien, die sich Angehörige der herrschenden Stände angeeignet und die sie über lange Zeit erfolgreich verteidigt hatten. Der Ausgangspunkt dieser Entwicklung ergab sich aus dem Ausmaß der verallgemeinerten (fürstlichen) königlichen Gewalt im Feudalismus, und zwar nicht aus der beanspruchten, sondern aus der wirklich durchgesetzten Gewalt. Zu einer Zeit, als die französischen Könige außer der Verfügung über symbolische Gewaltmittel nicht mehr an Herrschaft besaßen als viele andere Herren in „Frankreich\\", konnten Könige in England die Herrschaft „ihrer\\" Adligen bereits regulieren und begrenzen. Tatsächlich wurde die Herrschaft englischer Barone sehr weitgehend auf Aneignung reduziert. (Englische Adelsmacht war schon im ausgehenden Mittelalter eine vergleichsweise! ökonomische.) In Frankreich dagegen hatte sich aufgrund der Schwäche verallgemeinerter Gewalt in der Epoche des Feudalismus - wenn auch mit großen regionalen Dif-ferenzen - die seigneurie banale als dominante Form der Herrschaft durchgesetzt. Im Unterschied zur englischen manor handelte es sich weit weniger um eine bloße Ausbeutungsinstitution als vielmehr um eine Art Territorialherrschaft im kleinen.27 Im Laufe der Jahrhunderte wurde die Reichweite dieser personalen Herrschaft ebenso wie diejenige von Territorialfürsten begrenzt und ihre Praxis wurde reguliert. Aber vor dem 17. Jahrhundert läßt sich kaum davon sprechen, daß die Adelsherrschaft insgesamt in die monarchische Gewalt Frankreichs integriert wor-den wäre.”翻译为中文","output":"马克思主义者倾向于仅从占有的权利或机会角度解释权利，但这样做却忽视了“旧制度”下占主导地位的行动动机。那些不考虑即使拥有再多的金钱也无法弥补其他人在教堂前排座位上世代相传的遗憾的人，将无法理解“旧制度”社会的社会动态，从而也无法理解导致资产阶级革命过程的具体原因。将特定的占有关系从权利规范的整体环境中剥离出来，是导致向资本主义过渡的那些革命性变革的要素之一。只有当生产方式还受到习俗或法律（无论是哪种权利）规范的限制时，仅仅剥夺生产资料还不足以使劳动力成为资本主义的雇佣劳动者。 在“旧制度”结构类型的社会中，生产和统治形态在地方和区域上存在广泛的差异。但是，随着领土统治的加强，即使这些形式被顽固且成功地抵抗了王室官员的干涉和新法规，也都与普遍统治建立了关系。这一发展是不必要逐个城市或省份单独进行资产阶级革命，而能够在其基本结构上革命整个社会的前提。在此类发展过程中，一个王国不同地区的人们能够意识到他们的利益与远处的人们的利益相一致。从历史上看，这种情况只有在普遍统治造成了同一阶级人们生活条件的某些方面趋同，并且出现了尽管初级但仍为普遍的公共领域时才成为可能。相对于普遍统治而言，对抗税收和特定宗教政策形式的抵制是普遍利益最早的体现之一。 在“旧制度”社会的整个历史期间，都存在对特权的抗议。由此引发的冲突不仅导致了某些特权的废除和新特权的引入，而且总体上增加了统治实践的调节。正如18世纪的生理经济学理论家所指出的，对于“旧制度”的统治形式来说，存在一个物质结构限制。在物质生产的有限基础上，通过参与普遍暴力并因此授予特权来扩大占有的可能性是有限的。因此，向上升阶层进行社会整合的可能性具有结构性限制。这些限制主要是通过特定国家的统治对占有特权的制裁程度来确定的。但是，当这些较大并且物质整合的可能性因此受限时，并非仅仅出于结构必要性，而是只有在对旧统治进行实践和理论批判的情况下，才能废除等级制统治。当开展了革命性公共领域，人们不再满足于进一步的调节，而是强制剥夺所有个人统治时，才开始解除。只有这样，普遍的个人统治才会被普遍的统治：即国家所取代。 资产阶级革命的国家形式 瑞因哈特·本迪克斯在比较研究中涉及到“现代民族国家”的形成，最终得出结论，现代民族国家的形成方式彼此之间差异如此之大，以至于不允许做出任何普遍性的陈述；特别是因为特定的方式不仅具有历史性的暂时影响，而且持久地影响了结构。尽管我与本迪克斯不同，认为对转型过程既可能也必须作出一般性陈述，但我同意他的第二个论点：通过“旧制度”的社会向资产阶级社会的革命方式对于政治和国家权力的国家特定发展产生了长期的，部分至今仍在持续的影响。 这里只能提供一些简要的说明。这种限制不仅剥夺了形象性，而且与我持有的社会理论立场形成了问题关系。如果假设具体的历史过程不是由结构决定的，而是人们在之前的社会实践创造的可能性和限制条件内安排他们的生活，并以此方式——在他们行为的意识和结构影响的不同程度上——具体化历史发展的可能方向，那么这一点必须在社会实践的具体条件分析中得以展示。在这里做不到，但可以确定，在特定的历史情境中，正是这种而非那种也可能的统治或占有实践、教会政策、对上升者的防御策略、坚定的抵制或绕开统治的实践发明，构成了——在回顾中不难识别——未来社会实践可能性的转折点。我的说明关注于英格兰和“法国”的此类结构性差异。 导致“旧制度”社会向资产阶级社会革命的方式不同的最重要结构性原因，源自于阶级的形式，更准确地说，是源自统治阶级成员占有的特权的范围，尤其是这些特权的占有方式，以及他们长时间成功地维护这些特权。这一发展的起点是普遍（君主的）王权在封建时期的实施程度，而不是其所声称的，而是真正实现的权力。在法国的国王除了拥有象征性的权力手段之外，与“法国”许多其他领主无异时，英格兰的国王已经能够规范和限制“他们”的贵族的统治。事实上，英格兰贵族的统治在很大程度上被压缩为经济占有。（英格兰贵族权力在中世纪后期已是相对经济性的。） 相比之下，由于普遍权力在封建时代的弱点——尽管存在较大的地区差异——banal领主制在法国成为了主导的统治形式。与英格兰庄园相比，它更少是一个单纯的剥削机构，而更像是一种小规模的领土统治。几个世纪以来，这种个人统治的范围以及领土统治者的范围一样被限制，其实践也被调节。但在17世纪之前，很难说法国的贵族统治总体上已经融入了法国的君主权力中。"},{"instruction":"请将“In England provozierte die real verallgemeinernde Herrschaftspraxis mittelal-terlicher Könige dagegen früh Adelsforderungen nach Regulierung königlicher Herrschaft. (Die Magna Charta ist Ausdruck dieser Entwicklung.) Und die englische peerage konstituierte sich, als mächtige Barone die Pflicht der Vasallen, den König zu beraten, in ein Vorrecht umwandelten. Darin erschöpften sich auch schon fast die Privilegien der englischen peerage. Hinzu kamen noch Pairsgerichte und - viele Jahrhunderte lang - das Privileg, daß Bäcker die Sonntagsruhe unterbrechen durften, wenn ein peer eine Stadt mit seinem Besuch beehrte.28 Das langfristig wichtigste Resultat der Auseinandersetzungen um die Konstitution der englischen peerage war, daß es in England nie zu jener Konkurrenz zwischen Adelsherrschaft und monarchischer Herrschaft kam, die vielfach als allgemeines Merkmal „spätfeudaler\\" oder „absolutistischer\\" Königreiche angenommen wird. Aus diesem Grunde hatten in England - ganz anders als in Frankreich - Stadtbürger auch nicht die Möglichkeit, die Konkurrenz zwischen Territorialherren und Königen für ihre Strategien der Autonomie auszunutzen. Die mächtigen Städte, die für französische und andere kontinentale Fürstentümer typisch sind, gab es in England nicht. In Frankreich waren die Herrschaftsmittel des Banns, vereinfacht gesprochen: der Territorialgewalt, im Zeitalter des Feudalismus dagegen weitgehend in den Besitz lokaler Herren gelangt. Als sich Fürsten und Könige derartigen Gewaltbesitz dann aneigneten, geschah dies in regional unterschiedlichen Formen, und auch die Regulierung der Privilegien von Mächtigen, also die Konstituierung eines Adelsstandes, erfolgte in den einzelnen Fürstentümern auf unterschiedliche Weise. Mit Zwang gelang es französischen Königen später, den Adel französischer Fürsten zum Adel französischer Könige zu machen, aber bis zur Revolution unterschieden sich die Privilegien, die Aneignungspraktiken und teilweise auch die Vererbungs-regeln französischer Adliger von Provinz zu Provinz. Die Integration des franzö-sischen Adels geschah - entgegen der im Terminus „Absolutismus\\" enthaltenen Annahme - weniger durch königliche Regulierungsgewalt als vielmehr durch die materielle Beteiligung eines beträchtlichen Teils von Adligen an den Resultaten königlicher Fiskalgewalt. Anders als in England war die Besteuerung des NichtAdels in Frankreich nicht nur zur Finanzierung von Kriegen und von königlicher Herrschaft erforderlich, sondern Voraussetzung für die Integration des Adels in königliche Herrschaft. Für unseren Zusammenhang ist vor allem die Art und Weise des Übergangs vom Nicht-Adel zum Adel von Bedeutung, denn sie entschied über die Möglichkeit zur Verarbeitung von Aufstiegsstrategien. In Frankreich geschah dieser Übergang seit seiner zunehmenden Regulierung im 15. Jahrhundert überwiegend durch den Zugang zu einem königlichen Amt. Seit dem beginnenden 17. Jahrhundert wurde der früher schon übliche Verkauf von Amtsgewalt zu einem Verkauf vererblichen Eigentums. Der Besitz solchen Eigentums über mehrere Generationen galt als nobilitierend. Das hatte zur Folge, daß immer mehr Anwärter auf Ämter und Adel die Preise für Amtsgewalt in die Höhe trieben und daß sich Amtseigentümer die Möglichkeiten für die profitable Nutzung ihres Eigentums gegenseitig streitig machten. Der Umfang des königlichen „Regierungsapparates\\" lastete schwer auf den Steuer- und Gebührenpflichtigen, ohne daß er den Königen das Geschäft des Regierens erleichtert hätte. Reformen verlangten in Frankreich Eingriffe in das Privateigentum von Familien, die Anteile königlicher Gerichts-, Fiskal- und Ord-nungsgewalt erworben hatten. In England dagegen war der niedere Adel ganz anders konstituiert worden. Als sich die mächtigen Barone für sich und ihre Söhne im 13. Jahrhundert das Vorrecht der Beratung des Königs aneigneten, gingen dadurch die weniger mächtigen Edelleute ihres Status gewissermaßen verlustig. Aber auch sie blieben weiterhin zum Dienst für den König verpflichtet, und zwar nicht nur im Krieg, sondern auch im Frieden. Bezeichnend ist, daß diese Verpflichtung schon im 13. Jahrhundert von der Höhe eines bestimmten Einkommens (40 Pfund im Jahr) abhängig gemacht wurde. Aber auch den „Rittern\\" gelang es, ihre Verpflichtung in ein Vorrecht umzuwandeln. Seit dem 14. Jahrhundert galt die Befähigung für die lokalen Ämter königlicher Herrschaft, vor allem für dasjenige des Friedensrichters, als Kriterium für die Zugehörigkeit zum Adel. Über diese Befähigung entschieden/flfch’sc/z die lokal dominanten Familien, und bis zum Ende des „ Ancien Regime\\" geschah der Übergang in den niederen Adel in England durch den Erwerb eines bestimmten Vermögens und durch die Aufnahme in den Kreis der adligen Familien am Ort. Der Übergang vom Nicht-Adel in die gentry29 war somit ein gesellschaftlicher Selektionsprozeß, und auch der Aufstieg innerhalb der gentry und der Übergang in die peerage wurde in aller Regel von der Krone eher bestätigt als verfügt. Wie in anderen Königreichen vom Strukturtypus „ Ancien Regime\\" gab es auch in England Sinecuren und Ämter, für die kaum Dienst verlangt, aber Einkommen bezahlt wurde; aber vom ausgehenden 17. bis in die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts lag die faktische Regierung des Landes weitgehend in den Händen von Friedensrichtern, und diese erhielten zwar bestimmte Gebühren, aber keinen Sold. Vergleichsweise war das Ausmaß der Aneignung, die in Form einer Beteiligung an königlicher Fiskalgewalt erfolgte, in England sehr gering. Aufstiegsstrategien provozierten deshalb zwar (im 18. Jahrhundert) eine Erweiterung der Friedensgerichte, allmählich auch eine Veränderung der Kriterien für die Aufnahme in den niederen Adel, aber sie setzten keine Erweiterung der zentralen Abpressung voraus. Ein weiterer langfristig und nachhaltig wirksamer Unterschied ergab sich aus den jeweils dominanten Vererbungspraktiken. Da in Frankreich Adelstitel an alle Kinder vererbt und auch der Reichtum (über Apanagen) eher verteilt wurde, waren - seit dem 17. Jahrhundert zunehmend - viele Familien des Schwertadels vergleichsweise (!) arm. Da es dem französischen Schwertadel in seinen - insgesamt nur begrenzt erfolgreichen - Abwehrstrategien gegen den Aufstieg des Robenadels jedoch gelungen war, das Alter des Adels als zentrales Kriterium für die soziale Position innerhalb des Adels zu etablieren, gab es in Frankreich eine nicht unbeträchtliche Zahl adliger Familien, die einen sehr hohen sozialen Rang beanspruchten, aber weder in bezug auf Besitz noch auf Bildung oder Lebensstil mit Familien des hohen Robenadels und mit wohlhabenden Angehörigen des dritten Standes konkurrieren konnten. Während sich die oberen Schichten des Roben- und des Schwertadels einander sozial bereits seit dem 17. Jahrhundert annäherten,30 konkurrierten in den mittleren Schichten der sozialen Hierarchie nicht nur Familien, sondern auch Wertmaßstäbe miteinander. In Frankreich verlangte der soziale Aufstieg des Nicht-Adels die Zerstörung bisher dominanter Kriterien für die soziale Position.”翻译为中文","output":"在英格兰，中世纪国王的实际普遍性统治实践较早地激发了贵族对国王权力进行规制的要求。（《大宪章》就是这一发展的体现。）英格兰贵族（peerage）的形成，则是当有权势的男爵将臣民顾问国王的义务转变为特权时形成的。英格兰贵族的特权几乎就止步于此。除此之外，还包括贵族法庭和-几个世纪以来的-当贵族访问一个城市时，面包师可以打破星期日的休息规定的特权。围绕英格兰贵族制度的构建而进行的争论的最重要的长期结果是，在英格兰，从未出现通常被认为是“晚封建”或“绝对主义”王国的普遍特征的那种贵族统治与君权统治之间的竞争。出于这个原因，与法国不同，英格兰的城市市民没有机会利用领土领主与国王之间的竞争来谋求自身的自治策略。典型的法国和其他欧陆诸侯国那样的强大城市，在英格兰并不存在。 在法国，封建时代的领土权力，简单地说就是领土权，大多数归属于地方领主。当亲王和国王后来占据这种权力时，发生了区域性的不同形式，强权者特权的规制，即贵族阶级的构成，也在各个亲王国以不同方式进行。法国国王后来通过强制手段成功地将法国亲王的贵族转化为法国国王的贵族，但直到革命之前，法国贵族的特权、占有实践和部分继承规则在各省之间都有所不同。与“绝对主义”一词所含的假设相反，法国贵族的整合更多是通过大量贵族参与国王财政权力的成果，而非通过国王的规制权力完成的。与英格兰不同，在法国，对非贵族的征税不仅仅是出于资助战争和君权统治的需要，而且是贵族整合入君权统治的前提条件。 对我们来说，特别重要的是从非贵族到贵族的转变方式，因为它决定了处理上升策略的可能性。在法国，自15世纪开始逐渐规范化以来，这种转变主要通过进入国王职位实现。从17世纪初开始，早已习惯的职权出售变成了可继承财产的出售。拥有此类财产几代人被视为贵族化的过程。这导致了越来越多的职位和贵族候选人抬高了职权的价格，并且职位所有者相互争夺利用他们财产获利的机会。国王“政府机构”的规模对纳税人和缴纳费用的人构成了沉重负担，却没有使国王治理国家的工作变得更轻松。在法国，改革要求干预那些已经获得了国王的司法、财政和秩序权力份额的家庭的私有财产。 在英格兰，低级贵族的构成完全不同。当13世纪有权势的男爵为自己及其子嗣获得咨询国王的特权时，较不具势力的贵族某种程度上失去了他们的地位。但他们仍然有义务为国王服务，不仅在战时，也在和平时期。值得注意的是，这种义务在13世纪已经与特定的收入高低（每年40英镑）挂钩。但“骑士们”也成功地将他们的义务转变为特权。从14世纪开始，担任国王统治地方职位，尤其是担任和平法官的资格，被视为贵族身份的标准。关于这一资格的决定权在于当地占主导地位的家庭，直到“旧制度”的末期，在英格兰，进入低级贵族阶层是通过获得一定的财富和被当地贵族家庭接纳实现的。因此，从非贵族到乡绅（gentry）的转变本质上是一个社会选择过程，而在乡绅内部上升及进入贵族（peerage）几乎总是由国王确认而非指定的。 像在其他“旧制度”结构型国家一样，英格兰也存在一些几乎不需要服务却有收入的闲职和职位；但从17世纪末到19世纪中期，国家的实际治理大体上掌握在和平法官手中，这些法官虽然收取某些费用，但没有薪酬。相对而言，通过参与国王财政权力而进行的占有，在英格兰极其有限。因此，上升策略在18世纪确实促使和平法庭扩张，逐渐也改变了进入低级贵族的标准，但没有导致中央挤压扩张的需求。 另一个长期且持续有影响的区别源于各自占主导地位的继承实践。在法国，贵族头衔可以遗传给所有子女，并且财富（通过分封制）更加分散，从17世纪开始，许多剑士贵族家庭相对而言很贫穷。然而，在抵御法衣贵族上升的整体上只是有限成功的策略中，法国剑士贵族成功确立了贵族资历作为贵族社会地位内的中心标准，法国有相当多的贵族家庭声称拥有很高的社会地位，但在财产、教育或生活方式上既不能与高级法衣贵族家庭竞争，也不能与第三等级的富裕成员竞争。尽管从17世纪开始，法衣贵族和剑士贵族的上层已经在社会上趋于接近，但在社会等级的中层，不仅是家庭之间，而且价值标准之间也进行着竞争。在法国，非贵族的社会上升要求摧毁先前占主导地位的社会地位标准。"},{"instruction":"请将“Der englische Adel war längst nicht so offen, wie lange Zeit angenommen worden ist. Inzwischen gehen Historiker (innen) davon aus, daß der Erwerb eines Titels in Frankreich vermutlich sogar einfacher war als der Zugang zur gentry oder gar zur sogenannten county gentry. Aber die Beschränkung der Vererbung von Titel und Reichtum auf den ältesten lebenden Sohn, systematische Heiratspolitik und die Ausnutzung neuer Möglichkeiten der Aneignung aus Grundbesitz (wie sie sich vor allem durch die Erweiterung bestehender und die Gründung neuer Städte boten), ermöglichte es den Familien der peers und der oberen gentry, eine materielle Position oberhalb aller aufgestiegenen Nicht-Adligen zu verteidigen - und zwar noch bis in die Zeit der Agrardepression im ausgehenden 19. Jahrhundert.31 Dagegen verloren die Familien der gentry seit dem 18. Jahrhundert zunehmend ihren früheren Adel. Aufsteigende Nicht-Adlige beanspruchten er-folgreich bisher der gentry vorbehaltene Attribute, wie etwa die Bezeichnung als gentlemen und ladies, und die Ausweitung zentraler Regierungsgewalt entmachtete die Friedensrichter samt ihrer lokalen Basis. Das Fehlen einer formalen Absicherung des Zugangs zur gentry, der vergleichsweise geringe Besitz an herrschaftlich sank-tionierten Privilegien der peers und deren mächtige materielle Position waren Voraussetzungen dafür, daß die Emanzipation der Klasse aus einer ständischen Gesellschaft in England in der Form einer Verschmelzung der oberen Schichten der zuvor herrschenden Stände mit neu aufgestiegenen Kräften vor sich gehen konnte, ohne daß dafür eine Zerstörung der (ihrerseits vielfach „ verbürgerlichten\\") aristokratischen Kulturformen oder die regelrechte Beseitigung aller Institutionen des „Ancien Regime\\" erforderlich geworden wäre. Hinzu kam, daß die spezifische Form der englischen Reformation, welche die Krone zum geistlichen Oberhaupt gemacht hatte, früh eine verallgemeinerte Öf-fentlichkeit hatte entstehen lassen, in der über den rechten Glauben und eine gute Regierung gestritten worden war. Die großen Reform-Kampagnen des 19. Jahr-hunderts: die Kampagne gegen die Old Corruption,32 gegen die Sklaverei und für das Wahlrecht, sie alle entfalteten sich in dieser Tradition öffentlicher Debatten über Moral. Der Protestantismus zählt zu den wichtigen „peculiarities\\" der Herr-schaftsgeschichte Englands.33 Indem er den öffentlichen Diskurs und damit die Anforderungen an Herrschaftspraxis in spezifischer Weise prägte, trug er mit dazu bei, daß der Übergang zur bürgerlichen Gesellschaft möglich wurde, ohne daß die Werte und die Institutionen des „Ancien Regime\\" grundlegend entlegitimisiert worden wären. Zur theoretischen Relevanz der historischen Konstitution Zur Zeit der Hochkonjunktur des Terminus „bürgerlicher Staat\\" wurde die historische Konstitution dieser Herrschaftsorganisation als theoretisch belanglos behandelt. Nachträglich haben sich nicht wenige Erscheinungen, die in der staatstheoretischen Debatte der siebziger Jahre für strukturnotwendige Elemente der Staatsgewalt in entwickelten kapitalistischen Gesellschaften gehalten worden waren, als vorübergehende politisch-soziale Verarbeitungen historisch spezifischer Bedingungen erwiesen. Damit sind die Irrtümer, die aus unhistorischen Analyse-konzepten resultierten, jedoch noch keineswegs vollständig angeführt. Denn nicht nur für die jüngste Zeit, sondern bereits für die Phase der Konstitution bürgerlicher Staatsgewalt wurde die Strukturdynamik der (politischen) bürgerlichen Revolution mit derjenigen „des\\" Kapitalismus gleichgesetzt. Insonderheit gilt dies für die Auffassung von den sozialen Ursachen des Prinzips der Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz. In den siebziger Jahren war das Gleichheitsprinzip aus Funktionserfordernissen der Kapitalproduktion erklärt worden. Daß dieses Prinzip historisch im Zusam-menhang des Kampfs gegen die Herrschaftsformen des „ Ancien Regime\\" entstan-den war, wurde nicht weiter reflektiert. Dieses Versäumnis führte aber zu theo-retischen und politischen Fehlschlüssen über die strukturelle Dynamik bürgerlicher Staatsgewalt. Die folgenden abschließenden Ausführungen sollen diese Behauptung erläutern. Obwohl Klassen erst im Verlauf bürgerlicher Revolutionen aus den Strukturen personaler Herrschaft emanzipiert wurden, gab es auch früher schon widersprüch-liche soziale Beziehungen zwischen Menschen, die gesellschaftlichen Reichtum produzierten, und Menschen, die sich solchen Reichtum aneigneten. Auseinan-dersetzungen, die aus diesen Relationen erwuchsen, spielten im Prozeß bürgerlicher Revolutionen eine beträchtliche Rolle. Überall provozierten sie eine Praxis, die darauf gerichtet war, das Postulat der natürlichen Gleichheit aller Menschen und die Forderungen nach einer Allgemeinheit von Gesetzen, die beide gegen personale Ungleichheit und Privilegierung nach Art des „Ancien Regime\\" gerichtet gewesen waren, für die neu zu ordnende Gesellschaft nur begrenzt Realität werden zu lassen. In diese Praxis gingen tradierte Selbstverständlichkeiten mit ein, so etwa die Annahme, daß Frauen und Dienstboten aufgrund ihrer abhängigen Stellung keinen eigenen Willen hätten, teilweise aber auch neue und bewußte Abwehrstrategien gegen die Forderungen von Menschen, denen im Zuge der Umwälzungen der Gedanke in den Kopf gekommen war, trotz ihrer sozial inferioren Position zur Allgemeinheit der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft gerechnet werden zu wollen. Aus diesem Grunde wurde bürgerliche Öffentlichkeit nirgends in einem Zustand eman- zipativer Unschuld ausschließlich gegen bisherige Herrschaft konstituiert, sondern überall wurde bereits im Prozeß der bürgerlichen Revolution um faktische Be-grenzungen von Allgemeinheit und Gleichheit gerungen.34 Aufs Ganze gesehen waren die Abwehrstrategien in allen bürgerlichen Gesell-schaften lange Zeit äußerst erfolgreich. Den Bessergestellten gelang es, ihre ma-terielle Position in eine personale Eigenschaft umzudefinieren, die ihnen besondere Vorrechte im Hinblick auf das Zustandekommen von öffentlicher Meinung und von Politik einräumten. Wollten sich Angehörige der niederen oder, wie es häufig hieß, „gefährlichen\\" Klassen öffentlich Gehör verschaffen, so wurde ihnen dies sehr schnell ganz ebenso wie im „Ancien Regime\\" als Aufruhr ausgelegt. Gleichzeitig gelang es Angehörigen dominanter Konfessionen, dominanter „Rassen\\" und des dominanten Geschlechts, Privilegien zu erobern35 beziehungsweise zu verteidigen, die auf Merkmalen ihrer Person basierten 36 Dennoch: So erfolgreich die Abwehrstrategien von Bessergesteilten und von personal Privilegierten aufs Ganze gesehen auch noch für lange Zeit blieben, die praktische und die theoretische Kritik an personalen Formen der Herrschaft, wie sie für das „Ancien Regime\\" charakteristisch gewesen waren, hatte eine „stabile Transformation von Diskursen\\"37 bewirkt. Der revolutionär konstituierte Diskurs wurde in allen bürgerlichen Gesellschaften zu einer strukturellen Bedingung für die Konstitution der Interessen von Menschen, deren Diskriminierung rechtlich fixiert war.”翻译为中文","output":"英格兰的贵族早已不像长期以来人们所认为的那样开放。如今，历史学家们认为，在法国获得一个爵位可能比进入乡绅阶层，甚至是所谓的郡级乡绅阶层还要容易。但将爵位和财富的继承限定给长子、系统化的婚姻策略以及利用基于土地所有权的新的占有机会（特别是通过扩展现有城市和建立新城市的机会），使得贵族和上层乡绅家庭能够维持其在所有上升的非贵族之上的物质地位——这一状况一直持续到19世纪末期的农业萧条时期。与此相对，自18世纪以来，乡绅家庭逐渐失去了他们先前的贵族地位。上升的非贵族成功地声称了原本只属于乡绅的属性，例如被称为绅士和淑女，而中央政府权力的扩大削弱了和平法官及其地方基础的权力。乡绅进入门槛的缺乏正式保障、贵族拥有的经权力制裁的特权相对较少以及他们强大的物质地位，为英格兰社会从一个等级社会中的阶层自发融合成为上层统治阶级和新兴力量的过程提供了条件，而无需破坏（本身在很多方面已经“资产阶级化”的）贵族文化形式，或是真正消除“旧制度”的所有机构。 此外，特定的英格兰宗教改革形式，使得国王成为宗教领袖，很早就让一个普遍的公共领域得以产生，在这里人们就正确的信仰和良好的政府进行争论。19世纪的大型改革运动：反对旧腐败的运动、反对奴隶制以及争取选举权的运动，它们都是在这种有关道德的公开辩论传统中展开的。新教主义是英格兰统治历史中的重要“特殊情况”之一。通过特定地塑造公共话语及其对统治实践的要求，它有助于在不需要从根本上非法化“旧制度”的价值观和机构的情况下，实现过渡到资产阶级社会。 对历史构成的理论重要性 在“资产阶级国家”一词兴盛的时期，这种统治组织的历史构成被视为理论上无关紧要。事后看来，许多在七十年代国家理论争论中被视为发达资本主义社会国家权力结构必需元素的现象，已经被证明是对特定历史条件的暂时性政治社会处理。然而，由于非历史分析概念带来的错误远未完全列举。因为不仅针对近期，而且对于资产阶级国家权力构成阶段，都已将资产阶级（政治）革命的结构动力学等同于“资本主义”的动力学。特别是对法律面前平等原则的社会原因的理解如此。 在七十年代，平等原则被解释为资本生产的功能要求。未深入反思这一原则实际上是在与“旧制度”统治形式斗争的背景下产生的。这种疏忽导致了关于资产阶级国家权力结构动力学的理论和政治错误判断。以下的结论性陈述旨在阐明这一主张。 虽然阶级是在资产阶级革命过程中从个人统治结构中解放出来的，但在此之前已经存在人们之间关于社会财富生产和占有这种财富的矛盾社会关系。这些关系中产生的冲突在资产阶级革命过程中扮演了重要角色。它们促使了一种实践，旨在让所有人的自然平等和法律普遍性的主张——两者都针对“旧制度”式的个人不平等和特权——在新秩序的社会中仅有限地成为现实。 这一实践包含了传统的理所当然，比如认为女性和仆人由于他们的从属地位没有自己的意愿，部分也包括新的、有意识的防御策略，对那些在变革过程中开始想象他们尽管社会地位低下但仍希望被视为资产阶级社会一部分的人提出的要求。因此，资产阶级公共领域并没有被完全建立为对抗以往统治的纯粹解放状态，而是在资产阶级革命过程中，关于普遍性和平等的实际限制已经被争议。 总的来说，所有资产阶级社会中的防御策略长期以来都极为成功。更有地位的人成功地将他们的物质地位重新定义为赋予他们在形成公共意见和政治中特别权利的个人特性。如果下层阶级成员，如常被称为“危险”的阶级成员，想要公开发声，很快就像在“旧制度”中一样，他们的行为被视为骚乱。同时，主导宗教、种族和性别的成员成功地赢得或保卫基于个人特征的特权。尽管从长远来看，有地位的人和享有个人特权的人的防御策略仍然十分成功，但对“旧制度”典型的个人统治形式的实践和理论批评已经“稳定地转变了话语”。在所有资产阶级社会中，革命性构建的话语成为构成其法律上被歧视的人的利益的结构条件。"},{"instruction":"请将“Inzwischen hat sich nicht nur das Gleichheitspostulat, sondern es haben sich auch bestimmte Konstruktionsprinzipien von Verfassungen und von Rechtssystemen in vielen kapitalistischen Staaten verbreitet, die nicht aus Gesellschaften des „Ancien Regime\\" oder aus europäischen Siedlungskolonien, sondern aus kolonialer Herrschaft hervorgingen. Das macht die Staatsgewalt in diesen kapitalistischen Staaten aber nicht zu einer „bürgerlichen\\". Denn so sehr sich die Staaten, die aus Gesellschaften vom Strukturtypus „Ancien Regime\\" hervorgingen, untereinander auch durch die langfristige Wirkung der spezifischen Form bürgerlicher Revolutionen unterscheiden, insgesamt ist ihnen doch eine andere Dynamik zu eigen als jenen Staaten kapitalistischer Gesellschaften, die aus ganz anderen historischen Strukturen erwuchsen. Denn die Traditionen der Säkularisierung, der Individualisierung und der Versachlichung sozialer Beziehungen, die sich in Ge-sellschaften des „Ancien Regime\\" entwickelten, prägten die Bedingungen für die Konstitution von Interessen. Sie prägten damit nicht nur die Entwicklung bürger-licher Staatsgewalt, sondern sie wurden auch zum besonderen Strukturmerkmal der Kapitalverhältnisse in diesen Gesellschaften. In jenen Auseinandersetzungen um den „allgemeinen Begriff des bürgerlichen Staats\\", auf die ich mich oben bezogen habe, wurden die Termini „bürgerlicher Staat\\" und „kapitalistischer Staat\\" ganz selbstverständlich als unterschiedliche Bezeichnungen für ein und denselben Strukturzusammenhang gebraucht. Der analytische Nutzen dieser Verfahrensweise ist aber begrenzt. Wohl gibt es über-einstimmende Merkmale aller kapitalistischen Staaten: In allen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften sind die Sphären des Politischen und der Ökonomie trotz aller funktionalen Verschränkungen getrennt. Die Konkurrenz um die Bedingungen der Profitproduktion ist nicht identisch mit derjenigen um politische Macht, und die Praxis von Staatsgewalt ist nicht die Organisation individueller Aneignung. In allen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften ist die verallgemeinerte Gewalt öffentlich, d.h. sie ist nicht einer oder mehrerer Personen zu eigen, und gerade deshalb kann in kapitalistischen Staaten der persönliche Einfluß einzelner Staatsmänner unter Umständen größer sein, als es der Einfluß irgendeines personalen Herrschers je war. In allen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften ist das Prinzip des staatlichen Ge-waltmonopols durchgesetzt, und zwar in einer Form, welche die Herrschaft, die über Menschen im Arbeitsprozeß ausgeübt wird, als Nicht-Gewalt definiert. Formal geschieht dies über die dem Kapitalismus spezifische soziale Form einer zeitlich begrenzten Miete von Arbeitskraft (aber nicht von Personen). Der Klassencharakter des kapitalistischen Staates erweist sich darin, daß die weitreichende Herrschaft, die während der Dauer der Verfügung über die Arbeitskraft von Privaten über die Eigner der Arbeitskraft ausgeübt wird, rechtlich als ein NichtWiderspruch zum staatlichen Gewaltmonopol angesehen wird. Sobald wir jedoch darauf aus sind, die Dynamik der historischen Entwicklung der Staatsgewalt in kapitalistischen Gesellschaften zu analysieren, stellen wir fest, daß sie sich für diejenigen Staaten, die aus der Herrschaftsform des Strukturtypus „Ancien Regime\\" erwuchsen,38 trotz all deren nationalen Sonderformen in einem theoretisch zu verarbeitendem beträchtlichen Maße von der Staatsgewalt in anderen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften unterscheidet. Und zwar deshalb, weil bürgerliche Staatsgewalt aus der revolutionären Transformation von Gesellschaften entstand, in denen personale Herrschaft bereits weitgehend versachlicht und säkularisiert worden war, in denen Prozesse im Gange gewesen waren, die Wissenschaft zum gesellschaftlich durchgesetzten „Standpunkt\\" machten39 und Individuen zu Trägern von Interessen. Bürgerliche Staatsgewalt ist eine spezifische Form kapitalistischer Staatsgewalt. ”翻译为中文","output":"如今，不仅平等原理而且某些宪法和法律系统的构建原则在许多资本主义国家中已经广泛传播，这些原则不是源自“旧制度”社会或欧洲定居殖民地，而是源自殖民统治。但这并不使这些资本主义国家的国家权力成为“资产阶级”国家。因为，尽管那些从“旧制度”型社会发展而来的国家相互间因资产阶级革命的具体形式产生了长期影响而有所不同，总的来说，它们具有与那些由截然不同的历史结构发展起来的资本主义社会国家不同的动力机制。因为在“旧制度”社会中发展起来的世俗化、个体化和社会关系客观化的传统，塑造了利益构成的条件。这些传统不仅影响了资产阶级国家权力的发展，也成为这些社会资本关系的特殊结构特征。 在关于“资产阶级国家普遍概念”的争论中，我之前提及，将“资产阶级国家”和“资本主义国家”术语作为同一结构环境的不同称呼是理所当然的。但这种做法的分析效用是有限的。尽管所有资本主义国家确实存在一致的特征：在所有资本主义社会中，政治和经济领域尽管功能上相互交织，但始终是分离的。争夺利润生产条件的竞争不同于争夺政治权力的竞争，国家权力的实践不是个体占有的组织。在所有资本主义社会中，普遍化的权力是公共的，即不归任何个人或几个人所有，正因为如此，在资本主义国家中，各个国家领导人的个人影响力在某种情况下可能比任何个人统治者的影响都要大。在所有资本主义社会中，国家暴力垄断原则已被实施，并且以这样一种形式定义劳动过程中人对人的支配作为非暴力。这是通过资本主义特有的社会形式，即对劳动力（但不是对人）的有时限租用来形式化实现的。资本主义国家的阶级性质在于，私人对劳动力拥有者在劳动力使用期间所施加的广泛支配在法律上被视为与国家垄断暴力不矛盾。 然而，一旦我们旨在分析资本主义社会国家权力的历史发展动力学，我们就会发现，那些源自“旧制度”结构类型统治形式的国家，尽管存在所有的国家特殊形式，其国家权力与其他资本主义社会的国家权力在理论上显著不同。这是因为资产阶级国家权力源自于个人统治已经在很大程度上被客观化和世俗化的社会的革命性转变，其中正在进行的过程使科学成为社会上强调的“立场”，个体成为利益的承载者。资产阶级国家权力是资本主义国家权力的一种特定形式。"},{"instruction":"Привет!

Алгоритм строит по нему новое число R следующим образом. 1. Строится запись числа N в системе счисления с основанием 12. 2. Далее эта запись обрабатывается по следующему правилу: а) если число N делится на 4, то слева к нему приписывается «2», а справа «64»; б) если число N на 4 не делится, то в конец числа дописывается его максимальная цифра в системе счисления с основанием 12. Полученная таким образом запись является двенадцатеричной записью искомого числа R. 3. Результат переводится в десятичную систему и выводится на экран. Например, для исходного числа 11 = B12 результатом является число BB12= 143, а для исходного числа 12 = 1012 это число 2106412 = 43276.

Давайте разберем основные из них: 1. **Ошибка в определении максимальной цифры в числе в двенадцатеричной системе счисления**. Вам необходимо сравнивать не десятичные значения символов, а их индексы в строке \`ALF\`, которая представляет собой алфавит двенадцатеричной системы счисления. 2. **Ошибка в добавлении максимальной цифры**. Когда вы находите максимальную цифру, нет необходимости снова переводить ее в двенадцатеричную систему счисления, так как она уже представлена в \`ALF\`. Вам лишь нужно добавить соответствующий символ из \`ALF\` в конец строки \`s\`. 3. **Переменная \`r\` инициализируется неверно**. Значение \`r=10*10\` не имеет смысла в данном контексте, лучше инициализировать \`r\` очень большим числом, чтобы первое условие сравнения \`int(s, 12) > 1799 and int(s, 12) < r\` могло быть выполнено для подходящего \`R\`. 4. **Обрыв цикла при поиске максимальной цифры**. В вашем текущем коде цикл \`while t>0\` потенциально бесконечен, так как внутри его значения \`t\` не меняется. Исправленная версия вашего кода: \`\`\`python r = float('inf') # Инициализируем r очень большим числом for n in range(1, 35498): x = n s = '' ALF = '0123456789AB' while x > 0: s = str(ALF[x % 12]) + s x //= 12 if n % 4 == 0: s = '2' + s + '64' else: max_digit = max(s, key=lambda digit: ALF.index(digit)) # Используем max для определения максимальной цифры. s = s + max_digit if int(s, 12) > 1799 and int(s, 12) < r: r=int(s,12) print(r) \`\`\` Теперь ваш код должен корректно определять максимальную цифру в двенадцатеричной записи числа (с учетом алфавита \`ALF\`), а также правильно формировать и сравнивать числа \`R\`. Исправления обеспечат выполнение алгоритма согласно заданию и поиск минимального числа \`R\`, большего 1799."},{"instruction":"В терминологии сетей TCP/IP маской сети называют двоичное число, которое показывает, какая часть IP-адреса узла сети относится к адресу сети, а какая – к адресу узла в этой сети. Адрес сети получается в результате применения поразрядной конъюнкции к заданному адресу узла и маске сети. Сеть, в которой содержится узел с IP-адресом 207.0.A.167, задана маской сети 255.255.255.192, где A - некоторое допустимое для записи IP-адреса число. Определите количество значений A, для которых для всех IP-адресов этой сети в двоичной записи IP-адреса суммарное количество нулей в левых двух байтах больше суммарного количества нулей в правых двух байтах. В ответе укажите только число.","output":"Для того чтобы вычислить количество возможных значений A, понимание работы масок сети и адресации IP является ключевым. Давайте разберем задачу шаг за шагом. Дано: - IP-адрес узла: 207.0.A.167 - Маска сети: 255.255.255.192 Из маски сети 255.255.255.192 мы можем узнать, что сеть использует 26 бит для адресации узлов в сети (2^6 = 64 адреса, начиная от 0 и заканчивая 63, где первый адрес используется для обозначения сети, а последний — это broadcast-адрес). Итак, для данного маски идентификаторы хостов в данной сети могут варьироваться от 0 до 63. Наши два последних октета это A и 167. - 167 в двоичном коде: 10100111 Последний октет 192 (маска сети) в двоичной записи: 11000000. Это означает, что в сети 2 бита доступно для адресации хостов в последнем октете. Однако последний октет не меняется в данной задаче, поэтому нам важны первые два октета. Рассмотрим условие задачи о том, что суммарное количество нулей в левых двух байтах (октетах) должно быть больше, чем суммарное количество нулей в правых двух байтах. Поскольку в двух первых октетах (207.0) у нас: - 207 в двоичном коде: 11001111 (2 нуля) - 0 в двоичном коде: 00000000 (8 нулей), вместе получаем 10 нулей. Теперь рассмотрим возможные значения A. После применения маски сети, A должно определять конкретный подсетевой интервал, но так как изменение A не изменит общее количество нулей в двоичном представлении IP-адреса, оно не влияет на распределение нулей и единиц в адресе. В последних двух октетах у нас 8 бит (для A) + 8 бит (для 167) = 16 бит. Максимальное количество нулей будет, если A = 0, что даст 8 нулей в третьем октете, и, как мы видим для 167, 4 нуля в последнем октете, всего 12. Однако, исходя из требования задачи, нас интересует количество нулей во всех возможных адресах этой сети для правых двух байтов (октетов), сравниваемое с левыми двумя байтами (где у нас стабильные 10 нулей). В нашем случае, все значения A удовлетворяют условию о более высоком количестве нулей в левых двух октетах, чем в правых, так как в лучшем случае (когда A=0) мы получаем только 12 нулей справа. Так как A оказывает влияние только на распределение адресного пространства внутри сети, но не влияет на сравнение суммы нулей левых и правых октетов в данном контексте, количество подходящих значений A будет равняться количеству возможных уникальных значений для А, которые помещаются в заданный адресный интервал. Из этого следует, что в задаче допущена ошибка в понимании влияния значения A на результат. Рассмотрение условия суммарного количества нулей дает понять, что оно общее для любого значения A, так как требования задачи не зависят от конкретных значений внутри сети, а основаны на сравнении количества нулей в разных частях адреса. Следовательно, нужно рассмотреть задачу с этой точки зрения для получения корректного ответа."},{"instruction":"If I'm blitting from one multisampled framebuffer to another, and the multisampled texture uses RGBA and the other uses RGB, would there be an error","output":"When you are blitting (Bit Block Transfer) from one multisampled framebuffer to another, especially with OpenGL or similar graphics APIs, it's crucial to consider compatibility between the source and destination formats, as well as the multisampling settings. Blitting is a common operation for resolving multisampled renderbuffers to single-sample textures, or for copying between textures and renderbuffers. Your specific scenario involves two key details: 1. Source and destination are both multisampled framebuffers. 2. The source uses a color format of RGBA, while the destination uses RGB. There are a few considerations and potential issues here: # Multisampling Compatibility Both source and destination framebuffers are multisampled. Generally, when you blit from one multisampled framebuffer to another, the multisample counts should be compatible. This means either the same multisample levels or, in some cases, blitting from a higher sample count to a lower one. # Color Format Compatibility Blitting between different color formats (RGBA to RGB in your case) can be supported, but there are considerations: - **Direct Compatibility**: Some graphics APIs may allow direct blitting between these formats but could ignore the alpha channel since the destination does not support it. This operation is somewhat dependent on the graphics driver and API behavior. - **Precision and Component Mismatch**: Since the source includes an alpha component that the destination does not, you might lose the alpha information during the blit operation. In scenarios where the alpha channel is used for blending or other effects, this could lead to unintended visual outcomes. # Potential Errors or Issues - **API and Driver Support**: Whether such a blit operation will result in an error is somewhat dependent on the specific graphics API (like OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX) and the graphics driver's implementation. Some drivers might allow the operation with an implicit discard of the alpha channel, while others might generate an error due to the format mismatch. - **Performance and Behavior**: Even if the operation is allowed, doing a format conversion during blit could introduce performance penalties or might not behave as expected if the formats are not directly compatible. # Best Practices - **Explicit Resolve or Conversion**: Instead of relying on the blit operation to handle format conversion implicitly, it's often recommended to resolve or convert formats explicitly where you have full control over the operation. This could involve rendering to a temporary buffer with the desired format or using shaders/compute operations for format conversion. - **Consult Graphics API Documentation**: Specifics for blitting operations, including format compatibility and multisampling requirements, are detailed in the API documentation (e.g., OpenGL, Vulkan). Consulting these resources can provide the most accurate guidance for your scenario. In summary, while blitting from an RGBA multisampled framebuffer to an RGB multisampled framebuffer might not inherently produce an error, it's subject to limitations and behaviors specific to the graphics API and hardware. Explicit handling of format conversion and resolving multisampling (if necessary) might offer a more reliable and predictable outcome."},{"instruction":"The 10 Struggles Only Highly Intelligent People Have write a 15 minutes you tube video about this","output":"[Opening scene, soft, contemplative music plays in the background, video fades from black to a bright, inviting workspace] [The host, Alex, appears on screen, seated comfortably, exuding a friendly and approachable demeanor.] Alex: \\"Welcome back, dear viewers!

(Write longest text)","output":"Our planet’s tale is a tapestry woven with the threads of creation, evolution, and human endeavor. From the silent echoes of Earth’s formation over 4.5 billion years ago to the bustling noise of the modern world, this is a narrative steeped in drama, innovation, conflict, and aspiration. **The Stone Age: Birth of Civilization** The saga begins in the mists of prehistory, with the Stone Age, marking the dawn of human civilization. During this epoch, humanity took its first toddler steps, learning to harness the elements. The invention of tools from stone, the discovery of fire, and the advent of language laid the foundation of human society. Hunter-gatherer tribes roamed the lands, gradually forming early settlements as they began to practice agriculture, forever altering their nomadic lifestyle and the landscape around them. **Bronze and Iron Ages: Empires and Innovation** As communities grew, the quest for resources sparked innovation. The Bronze Age saw the advent of metalworking, with bronze tools and weapons fuelling the expansion of empires. Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, Ancient Egypt, and the Yellow River civilizations became cradles of culture, trade, and power. The subsequent Iron Age brought about even more durable tools and weapons, enabling the rise and fall of empires like never before. The Hittites, Greeks, Persians, and Romans carved their names into the annals of history, building sophisticated societies, engaging in trade and conquest, and nurturing ideas that would shape the future. **The Middle Ages: Feudalism and the Seeds of the Renaissance** Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Europe entered the Middle Ages, a period often characterized by feudalism, where the nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were tenants of the nobles. It was a time of knights and serfs, castles and cathedrals. Meanwhile, the Islamic Golden Age flourished, fostering advancements in science, mathematics, and culture. Amidst the Dark Ages, however, were the seeds of the Renaissance. The Black Death, which decimated Europe's population, indirectly led to economic shifts, weakening feudalism and giving rise to a more mobile and enterprising class. **The Renaissance to the Enlightenment: A Rebirth of Learning** The Renaissance heralded a rebirth of interest in the arts and sciences. Europe, inspired by the rediscovered knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome, saw an explosion of innovations in art, architecture, science, and exploration. Figures like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo epitomized the era’s spirit, while explorers like Columbus and Magellan expanded the world’s horizons. This period of intense intellectual activity paved the way for the Enlightenment, where thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Newton challenged traditional doctrines in favor of reason, liberty, and the scientific method. The Enlightenment principles would later inspire revolutions and lay the groundwork for modern democratic societies. **The Industrial Revolution to World Wars: The Age of Transformation** The Industrial Revolution was a catalyst that propelled societies into the modern age. Innovations in machinery, transportation, and industry revolutionized the way people lived and worked, leading to urbanization and the birth of the working class. However, this progress also brought about the exploitation of workers and environmental degradation. The 20th century was marked by the two World Wars, events so devastating they reshaped borders, economies, and societies. The aftermath of World War II saw the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers, leading to the Cold War. **The 20th Century: A Century of Progress and Conflict** The latter part of the 20th century was marked by remarkable strides in technology, medicine, and science. Yet, it was also a time of significant strife, with conflicts, genocides, and the looming threat of nuclear war. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of the Cold War, but ushered in new challenges and uncertainties. As the Earth continues its orbit around the sun, humanity stands at the precipice of a new era. Climate change, technological advancement, and social transformations present both unprecedented opportunities and challenges. The epic history of Earth is still being written, with every action and decision shaping the chapters yet to come."},{"instruction":"Artificial rogue planet named Chaos, a weapon used by the Architect.

Engineered by a figure shrouded in mystery and known only as the Architect, Chaos stands as the antithesis to the natural order of the universe. A weapon of unimaginable power, its presence looms like a specter over civilizations that dare to gaze upon its eerie, omnious aura. **Physical Description** Chaos is a colossal entity, rivaling the size of Jupiter, yet its comparison to natural celestial bodies ends there. Unlike the gas giants of our known universe, Chaos lacks any discernible stripes or layers, its visage a monolithic shade of blue, #3f48cc—Free Speech Blue. This color alone is emblematic of the dread it inspires, a hue that resonates with the deepest, most primal fears of sentient beings. Intriguingly, Chaos defies conventional planetary structure; it possesses neither mantle nor core, and speculation abounds that it might be hollow—an entire world that is, essentially, an enigmatic shell. **Apocalyptic Abilities** The Architect designed Chaos not just as a means of transport, utilizing warp drive capabilities to traverse the vast distances of space, but as a harbinger of destruction. Its primary function is to detect civilizations through their emission of CFC gases—an ominous sign of technological advancement—and target them for obliteration. Within its arsenal are powers that could only be described as apocalyptic. Chaos can manipulate celestial objects, hurling asteroids with pinpoint accuracy or dragging planets to their doom by pulling them into their star's Roche limit. It can generate thunderous sounds that shatter the tranquility of worlds and induce cataclysmic earthquakes with a mere thought. It spreads plagues that ravage populations and emits electromagnetic pulses that cripple civilizations. Stellar flares and gamma rays radiate from its form, bathing planets in deadly radiation. Perhaps most terrifying of all is its ability to summon and manipulate black holes, an absolute terror that can obliterate entire solar systems. **Elemental Superpower** At the heart of Chaos's destructive capabilities lies its power to hurl radioactive asteroids. This fusion of two devastating abilities—asteroid manipulation and radioactive emission—underscores the Architect's malevolent genius. By combining these forces, Chaos can decimate planet surfaces, rendering them uninhabitable wastelands within moments. **Torture of Star Systems** The Architect orders Chaos to engage star systems not only for destruction but for twisted experiments. It subjects protoplanetary disks to extreme conditions, warping the natural formation of celestial bodies and denying the birth of new worlds. This torture of star systems is a testament to Chaos's role as an instrument of cosmic despair. **Underlying Horror** Beneath its blue clouds lies a terror beyond the cosmos. The surface, if one dares to call it that, is an unsettlingly foggy expanse with a rocky brown crust, purportedly made of 'soul poops'—a grotesque testament to the nightmarish essence imbued within Chaos. This detail alone unveils the sadistic creativity of the Architect, turning myth into reality and nightmares into existence. Chaos, the rogue planet, and the testament to the Architect's dark ambition, glides through the vacuum of space, seeking its next victim. Civilizations that encounter this blue harbinger are faced with a stark choice: submit to the terror it represents or be torn asunder by its apocalyptic might. In the grand tapestry of the cosmos, Chaos weaves a thread of despair, an eternal reminder of the Architect's supremacy and the fragility of life in the vast, uncaring universe."},{"instruction":"Chapter 0.2: Meet Chaos In the vast horror of unknown cosmos, strange rogue planet named Chaos. Time date near before 10000 BCE, Chaos is walking and lurking in unknown cosmos. Chaos seeks to investigating worlds with intelligent life, Chaos had walked away in opposite regions of Milky Way such as Perseus Arm and Norma Arm, Chaos is nexting to Orion Arm to search worlds, no intelligent life found yet. Next time after 1920 CE, Chaos walked to streets of stars in Local Bubble. Unpleasantly, Chaos detected CFC gases from star named Sun in Local Stellar Neighborhood, possibility of there’s civilizations in system of Sun. Scientists don’t know planet Chaos is natural or artificial, origin is unknown. These unprecedented abilities raise profound questions about the nature of Chaos. Most importantly, can there be a way to halt or contain its reign of terror? Hoping to unlock the secrets behind its existence.","output":"In the unfathomable depths of the cosmos, where darkness and light entwine in an eternal dance, there prowls a harbinger of doom by the name of Chaos. A rogue planet, untethered by the gravitational pull of a star, roams the galaxy in search of its next target. Its journey stretches back to the epochs before recorded history, its origins shrouded in mystery as deep as the void it traverses. **The Early Wanderings** Before the dawn of the 10th millennium BCE, Chaos had already begun its sinister pilgrimage across the cosmos. It wandered through the stretches of unknown space, moving deliberately through the Perseus and Norma Arms of the Milky Way. Its search was relentless, yet fruitless—no signs of intelligent life met its criteria for chaos sown. Its path then veered towards the Orion Arm, a region ripe with stellar activity and potential civilizations yet to be disturbed by its ominous presence. **The Silence Before the Storm** For millennia, Chaos drifted silently, a specter between the stars, leaving only the cold void in its wake. Its existence remained undetected, its purpose unknown to the burgeoning societies that dotted the galactic landscape. The universe continued its relentless expansion, unaware of the threat that meandered in the darkness. **A Fateful Detection** The turn of the 20th century marked a significant shift in the trajectory of Chaos. By 1920 CE, it had ventured into the regions of the Local Bubble, an interstellar void in the arms of the Milky Way. It was during this time that Chaos encountered a signal unlike any other it had come across in its eons-long journey—the unmistakable chemical signature of CFC gases emanating from a star known as the Sun in the Local Stellar Neighborhood. This detection heralded the possibility of a civilization advanced enough to have altered its atmosphere—a sign that prompted further investigation by the rogue planet. **The Enigma of Chaos** To the scientists of the civilization that basked in the Sun's light, Chaos remained an enigma. Was it a rogue planet cast adrift by the gravitational chaos of its birth system, or was it something more sinister? An artificial construct, perhaps, created by an intelligence unknown and unfathomable? The source of its power, the nature of its purpose—these questions baffled those who sought to understand the threat that loomed in their stellar backyard. **A Quest for Answers** The discovery of Chaos ignited a quest to unravel the secrets of its origin and purpose. The unprecedented abilities it possessed—the manipulation of celestial bodies, the generation of cataclysmic natural disasters, and the targeting of civilizations through their technological footprint—suggested an architect of immense power and potentially malevolent intent. In the rush to comprehend the nature of Chaos, the civilizations of the Sun system found themselves united in a common cause. Could there be a way to halt or contain the rogue planet's reign of terror? As they peered into the cosmos, searching for answers, a mixture of fear and resolve gripped the hearts of those who dared to confront the unknown. Amid the vast horror of the cosmos, the rogue planet named Chaos continued its relentless march. Its next destination was unclear, its purpose shrouded in the darkness of space. As it moved, silently and ominously, the civilizations of the Sun system prepared for the possibility of an encounter that could alter the course of their history forever. In the face of the unknown, they hoped to unlock the secrets behind the existence of Chaos, hoping against hope to avert the impending doom that it represented."},{"instruction":"Chapter 0.3: Apocalypse is Coming Throughout the annals of history, humanity has encountered numerous trials and tribulations. From devastating wars to cataclysmic natural disasters, mankind has weathered many storms, pandemic.

In the conclusion, origin of Chaos was mystery, Chaos wasn’t a natural planet, Chaos could be artificial megastructure created by villain called “The Architect”, who is the Architect?, scientists haven’t create theory of Chaos. Astronomers observed Chaos from afar, witnessed strange and otherworldly phenomena emanating from its core. Dark energies radiated outward, heralding an unspeakable evil that resided within the planet. The sense of malevolence that permeated its very essence instilled a deep-rooted fear, driven solely by a desire to annihilate anything in its path. Would salvation be possible? Could humanity find a way to prevail against the destructive might of Chaos? Or was this the inevitable end of everything?","output":"As Chaos, the rogue planet engineered by an entity known only as \\"The Architect,\\" entered the Solar System, the collective breath of humanity seemed to pause. This was not just another asteroid to deflect or a solar flare to shield against; this was an apocalypse incarnate, moving with purpose and malice. The realization that the universe harbored not just wonders but also weapons of cosmic destruction was a rude awakening for humankind. **The Arrival** Whispers of Chaos's approach turned into headlines of doom as it made its unyielding advance toward Earth. Observatories around the globe, their lenses fixed on the intruder, bore witness to phenomena that defied the laws of physics as we understood them. Dark energies, the likes of which had never been seen, pulsated from Chaos, leaving a trail of distorted space-time in its wake. These observations did not just pique scientific curiosity; they sowed seeds of existential dread. **The Unveiling Mystery** The origin of Chaos remained a puzzle that seemed insoluble. This wasn't a naturally occurring celestial body, set adrift by the usual cosmic forces; this was a crafted weapon, its sophistication suggesting it was the product of an intellect far superior to our own. \\"Who is the Architect?\\" became the question of the hour, a query that hinted at a universe teeming with life, not all of it friendly. Alas, theories regarding the nature of Chaos and its creator were speculative at best, for humanity was still in its cosmic infancy, barely understanding its own Solar System, let alone the dark corners of the galaxy where Chaos had been forged. **Observations from Afar** From the safety of Earth, astronomers and scientists sought to unravel the enigma of Chaos. The phenomena emanating from the rogue planet were not just scientifically intriguing; they were a herald of the doom that awaited. The dark energies observed hinted at capabilities beyond mere physical destruction; they suggested an ability to rend the fabric of reality itself, to manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe in ways that could lead to Earth's undoing. **A Glimmer of Hope?** Amid the growing despair, a question arose: Could salvation be possible? Human history was replete with tales of overcoming impossible odds. From the brink of extinction during ice ages and pandemics to the devastating wars that shaped civilizations, humanity had always found a way to survive, to adapt, and to overcome. The challenge posed by Chaos, however, was of a different magnitude. It was not just a test of human ingenuity or a call to unite against a common enemy; it was a confrontation with an existential threat, a force that sought to undo the very essence of Earth and its inhabitants. **The Path Forward** As the world's greatest minds convened, drawing on every strand of knowledge from physics to philosophy, a multi-faceted strategy began to take form. It would involve unprecedented global cooperation, the pooling of resources and intellects from every corner of the planet. Technologies that were in their infancy would need to be accelerated; theories, once considered too risky or far-fetched, would now take center stage. Humanity stood on the precipice, staring into the abyss wrought by Chaos. Yet, within the hearts and minds of the people, there flickered the indomitable spirit that had carried them through the ages. The challenge was Herculean, but surrender was not in humanity's lexicon. The question of whether salvation was possible remained unanswered, but not unchallenged. As Chaos drew nearer, humanity marshaled its defenses, ready to fight not just for survival, but for the future of all life under the stars. The story of Earth's stand against the apocalypse was yet to be written, but it would be a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, a chronicle of defiance in the face of utter annihilation."},{"instruction":"Era 0: Way of Pre-Apocalyptic Time (Write introduction)","output":"In the shadow of looming existential threats, an epoch unfurls—a time marked by both the zenith of technological advancement and the nadir of environmental degradation.

Here's the complete Python code for generating the dataset and saving it to a CSV file named \`synthetic_dataset.csv\`: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import pandas as pd from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs # Parameters for the dataset n_samples = 300 n_features = 4 n_clusters = 3 random_state = 42 # Generate the dataset X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=n_samples, n_features=n_features, centers=n_clusters, cluster_std=0.60, random_state=random_state) # Convert the dataset to a DataFrame for easier manipulation data = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=[f\\"Feature_{i+1}\\" for i in range(n_features)]) data['Cluster'] = y # Adding the cluster labels as the last column # Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file data.to_csv('synthetic_dataset.csv', index=False) print(\\"Dataset successfully created and saved to 'synthetic_dataset.csv'.\\") \`\`\` After running this code, you will have a CSV file named \`synthetic_dataset.csv\` in your current working directory. The file consists of columns \`Feature_1\` through \`Feature_4\` representing the data features, and \`Cluster\` representing the cluster each sample belongs to. To load and use this file later for analysis or machine learning tasks, you can read it back into a pandas DataFrame with the following line of code: \`\`\`python data = pd.read_csv('synthetic_dataset.csv') \`\`\` This dataset can then be used for various purposes, including clustering tasks with algorithms like k-Means or EM as previously discussed, or for teaching and demonstration purposes involving data manipulation and visualization techniques."},{"instruction":"Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a synthetic_data.CSV file.

The silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). A high silhouette score indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. - It plots the results, with the original cluster assignments and the assignments from each clustering algorithm, making it easier to visually compare the algorithm performances. **Note:** The silhouette score is just one of many ways to evaluate clustering quality objectively; it's beneficial when the true cluster labels are unknown. For datasets where true labels are known, adjusted Rand index or mutual information-based scores could provide additional insights into clustering performance."},{"instruction":"consider a scenario where you want to cluster online retail customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Wider die staatstheoretischen Vorurteile Zur Entwicklung einer historisch-materialistischen Staatstheorie bedarf es der Einheit von logischem und historischem Forschungsprozeß, und lediglich der Arbeitsteilung wegen können die beiden Aspekte vorübergehend schwerpunktmäßig gesondert vorangetrieben werden. Die im folgenden dargestellte historische Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates (1) ist also nicht mißzuverstehen als eine theoretische Erklärung des bürgerlichen Staates. Wohl aber ist sie durchaus solchen systematischen Theorieansätzen kritisch gegenübergestellt, welche den bürgerlichen Staat allein aus den Strukturen des entfalteten Kapitalverhältnisses meinen ableiten zu dürfen. Denn der bürgerliche Staat ist nicht nur jener politische Überbau, welchen die bürgerliche Gesellschaft notwendigerweise aus sich hervorbringt, sondern er bildet in vieler Hinsicht zugleich deren Voraussetzung. Diesen konkreten Zusammenhang zwischen der Entwicklung der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft und ihres Staates bekommt man in den Griff, wenn man sich löst von der Bestimmung des bürgerlichen Staates durch seine Form, also seiner durch Rechtsstaatlichkeit gekennzeichneten und auf Parlamentarismus hin tendierenden Verfassung. In allen europäischen Nationalstaaten vollzieht sich die reale Entwicklung von Staatsfunktionen für die bürgerliche Gesellschaft bereits in der merkantilen (2) Phase, und die Durchsetzung der formalen Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates folgt dieser Entwicklung historisch nach. Nur für die USA fallen beide Konstitutionsprozesse zusammen, und aus dieser historischen Gleichzeitigkeit erklärt sich die dortige deutlich ökonomische Fundierung von Verfassungstheorie, die in den europäischen Emanzipationstheorien des Bürgertums im Kampf um Rechtsstaat und Parlamenta-rismus zunehmend zurücktritt (3). Die gängige Ineinssetzung von formaler und materieller Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates wirkt sich in der bisherigen staatstheoretischen Diskussion vor allem in zweierlei Hinsicht aus. Zum einen führt sie dazu, daß die Legitimations-funktion des bürgerlichen Staates ins Zentrum der theoretischen Diskussion gestellt wird. Denn in der spezifischen Form des bürgerlichen Staates kommt — das ist der richtige Inhalt der klassischen bürgerlichen Theorien von der Begründung des Staates — dessen Legitimationsfunktion zum Ausdruck. Zum anderen verdunkelt dieses theoretische Vorurteil die materielle Relevanz unterschiedlicher konstitutioneller Formen des Staates. Ebensowenig wie davon ausgegangen werden darf, daß die materielle Konsti-tution des bürgerlichen Staates erst im Zusammenhang mit der verfassungsmäßigen sich durchsetzen läßt, kann angenommen werden, daß eine konsequente bürgerliche, also parlamentarische Verfassung, zugleich die bestmöglichste Erfüllung staatlicher Funktionen für die bürgerliche Produktionsweise bedeute. Derartige Vorurteile hinsichtlich der formalen verfassungsrechtlichen Organi-sation haben die Forschung aber bis in die jüngste Zeit hinein bestimmt. Sie lassen sich historisch zurückfuhren sowohl auf die Schriften frühbürgerlicher Theoretiker als auch auf bestimmte (m. E. vor allem strategische) Äußerungen von Marx und Engels (4). Obwohl deren Äußerungen zunächst nicht mehr besagten, als daß der Parlamentarismus die vollständigste Entsprechung darstellt der Theorie der bürgerli-chen Gesellschaft, und diejenige politische Form ist, in welcher sich diese Gesellschaft am konsequentesten entfalten kann, sind sie — ungeprüft — zunehmend auch dahin interpretiert worden, daß der Parlamentarismus dem Wachstum und dem Bestand der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise besonders kongruent sei. Es gibt genügend Arbeiten, in welchen die monarchische Verfassung Frankreichs im 18. und die autokratische Verfassung Preußen-Deutschlands im 19. Jahrhundert von vornherein als Hemmnisse für die Durchsetzung kapitalistischer Interessen gewertet werden. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Basis und Überbau ist aber nicht so starr und eindimensional, als daß eine politische Form, welche der Herrschaftsorganisation der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft und deren Ideologie am vollständigsten entspricht, damit auch schon als die bestmögliche Erfüllung von politisch-ökonomischen Bedingungen der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise vorwegdefiniert wäre. Eine nicht an der Form, sondern an der Funktion des bürgerlichen Staates festgemachte Theorie durchbricht derartige in der Forschung zumeist unreflektiert auftretende Ausgangshypothesen und bemüht sich um die Analyse des jeweils kon-kreten Zusammenhanges von Staatsfunktionen und ökonomischer Entwicklung, Für Analysen dieser Art soll im folgenden ein systematischer Erklärungsansatz vorgetragen werden. Dabei werde ich nicht nur die wichtigsten Komponenten des realen Konstitutionsprozesses darzustellen suchen, sondern zugleich eine Erklärungshypothese entwickeln für das Auseinanderfallen von materieller und formaler Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates. Eine Vorbemerkung ist noch notwendig: hier wird zwar keine systematische Begründung der Staatstheorie vorgelegt, wohl aber ein systematisierender Erklä-rungsansatz für Entwicklungsprozesse, welche im einzelnen durchaus unterschiedlich verliefen. Wir bewegen uns also auf einer Abstraktionsebene, die von den konkreten Kämpfen absieht, von welchen die Durchsetzung der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft jeweils begleitet war. Innerhalb des hier vorgelegten allgemeinen Erklärungsansatzes bestimmen sich die besonderen Bedingungen einzelner nationaler Entwicklungen vor allem durch die folgenden, miteinander zusammenhängenden Komponenten: die reale und potentielle Stellung am Weltmarkt (dies resultiert aus der Dominanz der merkantilen Akkumulation in jener Zeit), aus den konkreten Kämpfen zwischen den Klassen und aus dem bereits erreichten Differenzierungsgrad der Kapitalfraktionen. ii. Die Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates als merkantile Außenvertretung Die frühen Theoretiker der bürgerlichen Produktionsweise haben ebenso wie deren schärfste Kritiker darauf hingewiesen, daß historisch die Durchsetzung des Kapita-lismus vor allem zwei konstitutive Voraussetzungen hat: die private Akkumulation von Geld und die Herauslösung der Arbeitskraft aus den feudal-agrarischen Produktionsverhältnissen (5). Unter dem Begriff der ursprünglichen Akkumulation sind diese Bedingungen der bürgerlichen Produktionsweise inzwischen vielfach analysiert worden. Während jedoch bislang vor allem die gesellschaftliche Form der ursprünglichen Akkumulation den Schwerpunkt des wissenschaftlichen Interesses bildete, haben wir uns hier zu konzentrieren auf die spezifischen politischen Mittel, auf die legislativen, administrativen und militärischen Formen staatlicher Politik durch die hindurch die ursprüngliche Akkumulation sich vollzog. Anders formuliert: die Frage nach der Entstehung staatlicher Funktionen für die bürgerliche Organisation der Produktion erfordert eine Auseinandersetzung mit dem realen historischen Inhalt dessen, was heute zumeist völlig unhistorisch als merkantilistische Politik bezeichnet wird (6). Denn in die Phase des Merkantilismus fällt die Entwicklung der ur-sprünglichen Akkumulation, die fortan ein konstitutives Merkmal der kapitalisti-schen Produktionsweise werden sollte.”翻译为中文","output":"在历史上构建资产阶级国家的理论 海德·格斯滕贝格 I. 反对国家理论的偏见 要发展一种历史唯物主义的国家理论，需要逻辑和历史研究过程的统一，只是因为工作分工的原因，这两个方面才能暂时被重点分开推进。因此，以下所述的资产阶级国家的历史构成（1）不应被误解为对资产阶级国家的理论解释。但是，它确实是对那些试图仅从发达资本关系的结构中推导资产阶级国家的系统理论方法的批判。因为资产阶级国家不仅仅是资产阶级社会必然产生的政治上层建筑，而且在很多方面同时也是其前提。 通过摆脱通过其形式（即其以法治和议会制为特征的宪法）所界定的资产阶级国家的定义，可以把握到资产阶级社会及其国家的发展之间的具体联系。在所有欧洲的民族国家中，对资产阶级社会的国家功能的实际发展已经在商业（2）阶段开始，而资产阶级国家的正式宪法的确立在历史上跟随这一发展。只有在美国，这两种宪制过程是同时发生的，这一历史同时性解释了那里宪法理论的明显经济基础，这在欧洲中逐渐消退的资产阶级解放理论中的法治和议会制斗争中不再明显（3）。 将资产阶级国家的形式和物质构成等同化，在目前的国家理论讨论中主要以两个方面产生影响。首先，它导致将资产阶级国家的合法性功能置于理论讨论的中心。因为在资产阶级国家的特定形式中，体现了其合法性功能——这是经典资产阶级国家理论正确的内容。其次，这种理论偏见使得不同宪法形式的国家的物质相关性变得模糊。 不能假设，资产阶级国家的物质构成只能在宪法确立的情况下实现，也不能假设一套完整的资产阶级即议会宪法就意味着对资产阶级生产方式的国家职能的最佳实现。 关于形式法治组织的这些偏见一直决定了最近的研究。它们可以追溯到早期资产阶级理论家的著作以及马克思和恩格斯（4）的某些（我认为主要是战略性的）言论。尽管他们的表述最初不过意味着，议会主义是资产阶级社会理论的最完整体现，是这种社会可以最一致地展开的政治形式，但这些论述——未经检验——越来越被解释为议会制与资本主义生产方式的增长和存续特别一致。有足够的研究将18世纪法国的君主立宪制和19世纪普鲁士-德国的专制立宪制预先视为阻碍资本主义利益实现的障碍。 基础与上层建筑之间的联系并不像通常认为的那样僵化和单一维度，以至于最完全符合资产阶级社会治理结构及其意识形态的政治形式，就已经被预定义为资本主义生产方式的政治经济条件的最佳实现。 一种不以形式而是以资产阶级国家的功能为依据的理论，打破了研究中通常不加反思地出现的这类出发假设，致力于分析国家职能与经济发展之间的具体联系。在接下来的内容中，我将提出一种系统化的解释方法，不仅试图描绘出实际宪制过程的主要组成部分，同时也为物质与形式宪制之间的分裂提供一个解释假设。 还需一点前提说明：这里虽然没有提供一个系统化的国家理论根据，但却提出了一个系统化的解释方法来解释各种不同的发展过程。因此，我们处于一个抽象层面，忽略了伴随着资产阶级社会实现的具体斗争。在这里提出的一般解释方法中，特定的国家发展条件主要由以下几个相互关联的组成部分决定：实际和潜在的世界市场地位（这是由于那时代商业积累的主导地位），阶级之间的具体斗争，以及资本派系分化度的已达到的水平。 ii. 作为商业外交的资产阶级国家的宪制 资产阶级生产方式的早期理论家以及其最尖锐的批评者都指出，历史上资本主义的实现主要有两个构成前提：资金的私人积累和劳动力的从封建-农业生产关系中脱离出来（5）。在“原始积累”这一概念下，资产阶级生产方式的这些条件已经被广泛分析过。然而，到目前为止，主要关注的是原始积累的社会形态，现在我们需要关注通过其进行的具体政治手段——立法、行政和军事形式的国家政策。换句话说，关于资产阶级生产组织的国家职能的产生的问题要求对今天通常被完全非历史性地称为重商主义政策的实际历史内容进行探讨（6）。因为在重商主义阶段发展了原始积累，从此成为资本主义生产方式的一个构成特征。"},{"instruction":"请将“Der Merkantilismus ist jene historische Epoche, in welcher sich die Warenpro-duktion im Zusammenhang mit der Entwicklung der äußeren Märkte (7) durchsetzte. Die wichtigste Quelle der privaten Akkumulation an Geld bzw. Kapital bildete in dieser Zeit die staatlich unterstützte oder organisierte merkantile Eroberung (8). Diese Behauptung läßt sich nicht nur systematisch ableiten, sie ist auch vielfach statistisch belegt worden. Und zwar sowohl von den großen Verfechtern merkantiler Handelspolitik, wie etwa Davenant, Postlethwayt oder Colbert (9), als auch von Historikern der jüngsten Zeit, wie Elisabeth Schumpeter, Phyllis Deane, Cole oder Davis (10). Während die Analyse des Handelsvolumens in Relation zum Gesamt-wachstum des Nationaleinkommens bei den modernen Arbeiten statistisch ungleich zuverlässiger ist als bei den Autoren des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts, wird bei den letzteren noch deutlich, daß vieles, was heute unter dem neutralen Begriff des Handels erscheint, aufzuschlüsseln ist zum einen als Handel mit sog. schwarzem Elfenbein, mit Sklaven also, zum anderen nur bezeichnet werden kann als gewaltsame Aneignung. Exemplarisch ist zu erinnern an die Gewinnungsmethoden für Edelmetalle, wie sie in den spanischen Besitzungen Südamerikas zur Anwendung kamen. Hier ist jedoch nicht der Ort, die Entwicklung der äußeren Märkte im einzelnen darzustellen; vielmehr ist hinzuweisen auf deren doppelte Funktion. Sie waren zum einen Lieferanten von Rohstoffen aller Art, von Edelmetallen, Spezereien und Sklaven; damit bildeten sie eine Quelle für Reichtum, die nur geringe Gegenleistung erforderte (11). Zum anderen entwickelten sich die äußeren Märkte jedoch zuneh-mend als Absatzgebiete von Manufakturwaren und bildeten damit eine Vorausset- zung für den erfolgreichen Kampf der Bürger gegen jene feudalen Produktionsbe-schränkungen, die in den Zunftordnungen versteinert waren (12). In unserem Zusammenhang ist die Eroberung von äußeren Märkten nicht nur bedeutsam als die hervorragendste Quelle des Reichtums bzw. des Handelskapitals unter spätfeudalen und frühkapitalistischen Bedingungen, sondern als die zentrale ökonomische Ursache der Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates. Denn der Kampf um die äußeren Märkte ließ sich nicht durchführen mit privaten noch mit merkantilen (also handelspolitischen) Mitteln allein. Er erforderte Flotte und Heer, ein geordnetes nationales Geldsystem, ein Kreditsystem, sowie die Übernahme staatlicher Garantien für private Vertragsabschlüsse mit quasi-öffentlichem Charakter in den überseeischen Gebieten. Voraussetzung zur Behauptung im internationalen Konkurrenzkampf um die äußeren Märkte war sowohl ein bestimmtes Quantum an privat akkumuliertem Handelskapital als auch eine relativ finanzstarke oder doch kreditwürdige Zentralge-walt. Und diese fiskalischen Voraussetzungen erklären vieles, was heute als Prinzi-pienstreit der Merkantilisten über Protektionismus oder Freihandel mißinterpretiert wird. In einer seiner verdienstvollen Arbeiten hat Ralph Davis nachgewiesen (13), daß die Entwicklung des Protektionismus in England in den Jahren 1689—1786 in ihren einzelnen Maßnahmen jeweils direkt zurückzuführen ist auf unmittelbare Fi-nanzbedürfnisse der Regierung. Und diese Finanzbedürfnisse resultierten ihrerseits aus der Notwendigkeit, teure Kolonial- und Handelskriege zu führen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist daran zu erinnern, daß die großen europäischen Kriege des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts im wesentlichen ebenfalls zu begreifen sind als Handels- kriege um die Dominanz auf den äußeren Märkten. Wohl wurde auch gekämpft um die Vorherrschaft am europäischen Markt, aber wenn sich etwa in den spanischen Erbfolgekriegen England mit Portugal gegen Frankreich verbündete, so bedeutete dies nicht nur, daß statt der französischen jetzt die portugiesischen Weinimporte nach Großbritannien gefördert wurden und englische statt der französischen Woll-manufakturwaren in Portugal dominierten. Es bedeutete vor allem, daß Großbritan-nien den Löwenanteil des direkten und des über Portugal laufenden indirekten Exportes nach Brasilien für sich durchgesetzt hatte. Welche ungeheure ökonomische Bedeutung diese hier nur exemplarisch herangezogene Handelsvorherrschaft wäh-rend der Hochkonjunktur der brasilianischen Gold- und Diamantenproduktion im 18. Jahrhundert hatte, ist in einer 1971 erschienen Arbeit von Harold Fisher dargestellt worden (14). Was hier und im übrigen auch in den Schriften englischer Merkantilisten als nationale Interessen behandelt wird, ist politisch zu differenzieren. Zwar waren in allen großen Außenhandelsnationen die Krone, das Bürgertum und der Adel an den merkantilen Unternehmungen beteiligt, doch die jeweilige Relation dieser Beteiligung unterschied sich beträchtlich von Land zu Land. Waren die portugiesisch-spanischen Kolonisationen Unternehmungen der Krone, die dem Adel Sinekuren in der Kolonialverwaltung verschafften und Vertreter des Bürgertums hauptsächlich am Waren transport beteiligten, so erwies sich als auf Dauer weitaus erfolgsträchtiger das vor allem in England und Frankreich entwickelte Verfahren der Privilegierung selb-ständig agierender vorwiegend bürgerlicher Handelskompanien (15). In diesen Ländern kam das sog. .nationale' Interesse zustande durch die Kongruenz von Inter-essen bürgerlicher Handelskompanien an einer militärisch und finanziell starken Zentralmacht mit Interessen der Krone, welche sich Unabhängigkeit zu verschaffen suchte von der Notwendigkeit politischer und finanzieller Unterstützung durch die Feudalaristokratie und ihrer Körperschaften (16). Das Interesse an der Entwicklung der äußeren Märkte trug in diesen Ländern dazu bei, die Umwälzung feudaler Strukturen in national-bürgerliche zu begünstigen, wobei zu berücksichtigen ist, daß der hiermit verbundene relevante Zentralisierungsprozeß sich nicht nur gegen die Feudalaristokratie, sondern auch gegen die Städte, die frühen Hochburgen bürgerli-cher Unabhängigkeit, zu richten pflegte (17). Die Validität der hier vorgetragenen Hypothese von der Konstituierung des bürgerlichen Staates als merkantiler Außenvertretung beweist sich durch ihren Erklä-rungswert: Sobald wir zu ermitteln suchen, welchen Gebieten in Europa durch geographisch-klimatische Bedingungen und/oder durch bestimmte Ausprägungen ih-rer Produktionsschwerpunkte die Eroberung äußerer (präziser: außereuropäischer) Märkte erschwert war, so stellen wir fest, daß sie sich decken mit denjenigen Gebieten, in welchen die Entwicklung zum modernen Nationalstaat retardierte. Für den Fortgang der Entwicklung können wir darüberhinaus feststellen, daß jene spezifischen Formen autokratischer Staatlichkeit, welche vor allem für Preußen-Deutschland üblicherweise zurückgefiihrt werden auf eine nationale Verspätung, ihren Ursprung haben in der ökonomischen Notwendigkeit, privat nicht zu erzielende Resultate der ursprünglichen Akkumulation subsidiär durch staatliche Macht herzustellen (18). Derartige Subsidiarität ging, wie Schmoller gezeigt hat, so weit, daß in Preußen im 18. Jahrhundert von Staats wegen der Versuch unternommen wurde, Handels- und Finanzgesellschaften zu gründen, wie sie andernorts als Zusammenschlüsse von Handelsbürgern zur Entstehung kamen (19). Das auch in historisch-materialistischen Arbeiten noch gängige Phasenschema der Staatstätigkeit, welches davon ausgeht, daß während der Phase der Entfaltung des Kapitalismus sich die Akkumulationsbedingungen des Kapitals durch das Wir- ken, der Konkurrenz ohne Staatseingriffe herstellten, die Staatstätigkeit demnach auf die Erstellung von Rahmenbedingungen für die kapitalistische Produktionsweise beschränkt bleiben konnte, ist ein Reflex der (von Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts bis gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts andauernden) Vormachtstellung des britischen Kapitals auf dem Weltmarkt. Nur in England stellten sich aufgrund der Dominanz am Weltmarkt Bedingungen her, welche die Entfaltung der freien Konkurrenz und schließlich die Freihandelspolitik ohne Schaden für das nationale Kapital ermöglich-ten. Die nationalen Akkumulationsbedingungen des Kapitals sind von allem anfang an durch den Weltmarkt geprägt, und was die Staatstätigkeit anbelangt, so bildet die englische Enttwicklung nicht so sehr den ,,klassischen Fall'' als vielmehr den auf Weltmarktdominanz beruhenden besonderen.”翻译为中文","output":"重商主义是那个历史时期，商品生产随着外部市场（7）的发展而确立。在这一时期，国家支持或组织的重商式征服（8）成为私人资金或资本积累的主要来源。这个论断不仅可以系统地推导出来，还有很多统计数据证明。无论是重商主义贸易政策的大力拥护者，如达文安特、波斯特尔斯韦特或科尔贝特（9），还是最近的历史学家，如伊丽莎白·舒姆佩特、菲利斯·迪恩、科尔或戴维斯（10），都证实了这一点。虽然在现代作品中与国民总收入增长的贸易量分析在统计上远比17和18世纪的作者可靠，但后者清楚地表明，如今在中立术语“贸易”下的许多内容，一方面应解读为所谓的黑象牙即奴隶贸易，另一方面只能称之为强制占有。典型的例子是在西班牙南美洲领土中应用的贵金属获取方法。 然而，这里不是详细展示外部市场发展的地方；而是要指出它们的双重功能。它们一方面是各种原材料、贵金属、香料和奴隶的供应商；因此它们构成了一种几乎不需要任何对价的财富来源（11）。另一方面，外部市场逐渐成为制成品的销售地，从而为市民成功反对那些在行会规则中僵化的封建生产限制创建了条件（12）。 在我们的语境中，外部市场的征服不仅作为晚封建和早期资本主义条件下财富即贸易资本的最杰出来源重要，而且作为资产阶级国家宪制的中心经济原因。因为争夺外部市场的斗争不能仅仅通过私人或重商式（即贸易政策）手段进行。它需要舰队和军队、有序的国家货币系统、信贷系统，以及对私人合同在海外地区具有准公共性质的国家担保的承担。 在国际竞争中争夺外部市场的成功前提既需要一定量的私人积累的贸易资本，也需要相对财政强大或至少信用良好的中央政府。而这些财政前提解释了很多今天被错误解读为重商主义者关于保护主义或自由贸易的原则之争的情况。在他的一项有价值的工作中，拉尔夫·戴维斯证明（13），英格兰在1689—1786年间保护主义的发展，其各项措施都可以直接追溯到政府的直接财政需求。而这些财政需求又源于进行昂贵的殖民地和贸易战争的必要性。在这方面，值得提醒的是，17和18世纪的欧洲大战本质上也可以理解为关于外部市场主导权的贸易战争。虽然也为了在欧洲市场上的霸主地位而战斗，但当英格兰和葡萄牙联合对抗法国，在西班牙继承战争中，这不仅意味着英国鼓励从葡萄牙而非法国进口葡萄酒，英国而非法国的羊毛制品在葡萄牙占主导地位。它主要意味着英国为自己赢得了直接和通过葡萄牙间接向巴西出口的主要份额。关于这一商业霸权在18世纪巴西黄金和钻石生产高峰期间的巨大经济重要性，哈罗德·费舍尔在1971年发表的一项工作中进行了说明（14）。 这里和在英国重商主义者的著作中被视为国家利益的内容，在政治上需要进行区分。虽然在所有大的外贸国家，皇室、资产阶级和贵族都参与了重商主义企业，但这些参与的具体比例在各国间有着显著的不同。葡萄牙-西班牙的殖民化是皇室的企业，为贵族提供了殖民地管理中的闲职，并主要让资产阶级代表参与货物运输，但长远来看，英国和法国发展的授权独立行动的主要是资产阶级贸易公司的方法证明更为成功（15）。在这些国家中，所谓的“国家”利益是通过资产阶级贸易公司对军事和财政强大的中央政权的利益与皇室的利益相一致而形成的，皇室试图从需要贵族和其团体的政治和财政支持中获得独立（16）。在这些国家中，对外部市场的发展有助于推动从封建结构到国民-资产阶级结构的转变，需要考虑的是，相关的中央集权过程不仅针对封建贵族，也常常针对城市，即资产阶级独立的早期堡垒（17）。 通过创立资产阶级国家作为重商外交的本文提出的假设通过其解释价值得到证明：一旦我们开始探索欧洲哪些地区由于地理-气候条件和/或其生产重点的特定表现而难以征服外部（更准确地说：非欧洲）市场，我们发现，这些地区与那些发展成现代国家的速度减缓的地区重合。对于发展的进一步去向，我们还可以看到，通常归因于国家发展延迟的特定形式的专制政体，尤其是普鲁士-德国，其根源在于经济上必须通过国家力量补充私人无法实现的原始积累的结果（18）。如施莫勒所展示的，这种补充作用在18世纪的普鲁士达到了政府试图成立商贸和金融公司的地步，这些公司在其他地方作为商人联合体出现（19）。 即使在历史唯物主义的作品中，关于国家活动的常见的阶段模式，也认为在资本主义展开阶段，资本的积累条件是通过竞争自然形成的，无需国家干预，国家活动因此可以仅限于为资本主义生产方式提供框架条件，这反映了（从18世纪中叶到19世纪末）英国资本在世界市场上的主导地位。只有在英国，由于在世界市场上的主导地位，形成了条件，这些条件使得自由竞争的展开以及最终的自由贸易政策在不损害国家资本的情况下成为可能。资本的国家积累条件从一开始就受到世界市场的影响，就国家活动而言，英国的发展不太是典型案例，而是基于世界市场主导权的特殊情况。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Соблюдай информационный стиль, выбирай самые важные факты. Раздели текст на абзацы и дай из заголовки по смыслу Заголовок проекта: Измерьте иммунитет и оцените риски Подзаголовок проекта: Иммунометр Эвоскрин​: сервис для измерения иммунитета и рисков заболеваний. Описание проекта: Мы — компания EVO-screen и уже более 20 лет работаем в практической медицине. Последние 10 лет разрабатываем информационные технологии в медицине: клинические исследования, метаанализы и аналитику баз данных, технологии машинного обучения. Все это помогает лучше понять результаты анализов, которые вы сдаете. Что такое иммунометр? Мы создали способ замерить уровень иммунитета. Это иммунометр Эвоскрин. Его создали более 30 врачей, в основном гинекокологи, урологи, онкологи и дерматологи. Иммунометр изменяет уровень иммунитета и показывает риски для здоровья, чтобы вы вовремя приняли меры. Мы сделали иммунометр на основе анализа больших данных: мы изучили более 12 тысяч иммунограмм и сопоставили их с клиническими результатами. Иммунометр Эвоскрин — это сервис автоматической и бесплатной расшифровки иммунограмм, определяющий уровень иммунитета и риски заболеваний. Нужно только загрузить анализ из лаборатории на сайт Эвоскрин и получить результат интерпретации. Как работает иммунометр Эвоскрин? Чтобы получить иммунограмму, нужно сдать привычный анализ крови из вены в клиниках «Инвитро», «KDL», «Гемотест» в любом городе России. Клиника пришлет результаты анализа вам на электронную почту. Для оценки иммунитета вы можете загрузить результаты на сайт Эвоскрин. Результаты исследования Эвоскрин будут готовы через 3-10 дней в зависимости от лаборатории, в которой сдавали анализ. Если рисков нет, то показатели будут находиться в зеленой зоне. Это говорит о высоком уровне иммунитета. Если система Эвоскрин выявила риски, то показатели будут находиться в желтой, оранжевой, красной или фиолетовой зонах. Вы узнаете, в каких областях здоровья возможны риски. В этом случае необходимо дополнительное обследование организма. Почему важно измерять иммунитет? Вы задумывались, почему у кого-то появляется рак, а у кого-то нет. Почему в одном коллективе кто-то заболевает гриппом и лечится 2 недели, а кто-то продолжает работать в прежнем режиме. Кто-то постоянно пьет витамины, носит шапки, шарфы, шерстяные носки и может заболеть от малейшего сквозняка в офисе, а кто-то ходит с голыми щиколотками всю зиму и даже не знает, что такое ангина. Мы тоже об этом задумались и решили создать иммунометр Эвоскрин. С его помощью любой человек самостоятельно оценить состояние своего иммунитета. Иммунометр отвечает современным требованиям к медицинским разработкам. Например, это средство предсказательное, персонифицированное и превентивное, то есть помогает предотвратить заболевание. Нам важно было создать продукт, который будет доступен любому человеку. Чтобы каждый мог оценить уровень своего иммунитета и знать, что нужно делать. Программное обеспечение EVO-Screen защищено двумя патентами и имеет сертификат соответствия. Почему важно знать состояние своего иммунитета? Вы можете самостоятельно узнать состояние своего здоровья и вовремя принять меры. Сможете заранее узнать о рисках и начать профилактику возможных заболеваний. Это позволит не допустить появления хронических заболеваний. Достичь долгой, иногда пожизненной ремиссии. Когда нужно сдавать анализ? Какие риски иммунометр определяет лучше всего? В медицине наиболее изучены хронические заболевания и онкология. Именно эти показатели иммунометр Эвоскрин определяет лучше всего. В течение года мы постараемся расширить заболевания, которые может определить иммунометр. И вы нам сможете в этом помочь. Преимущества применения EVO-Screen Пример иммунограммы Это результаты анализа, которые вы получите в лаборатории. Этих данных вполне достаточно для загрузки в Эвоскрин и первичного скрининга иммунитета. Не переплачивайте за лишние параметры без необходимости. Эвоскрин автоматически распознает данные с бланка анализа, поэтому вручную ничего вводить не нужно. Так удобнее и исключает ошибки при вводе данных. Сделав иммунограмму, вы узнаете: - уровень иммунного статуса - влияние хронических инфекций на иммунитет; - иммунологическую онконастороженность; - влияние лекарственных препаратов, БАДов, образа жизни на иммунитет; - иммунологическую целесообразность вакцинации; - рекомендации по персональному иммунному статусу Вот как это будет выглядеть После загрузки результатов анализов из лаборатории система Эвоскрин оценит их. Вы получите наглядное объяснение, что означает ваша иммунограмма: Эвоскрин определит риски и даст рекомендации. Как подготовиться к анализу иммунитета? Иммунограмму можно сдать в любой лаборатории или получить направления у врача по полису ОМС (это бесплатно, но займёт много времени). Для загрузки в Эвоскрин понадобится анализ крови, в котором 4 или 6 этих показателей: CD4; CD4, %; CD8; CD8, % и NK, CD16/56; NK, CD16/56 %. Последние два показателя используются для выявления онкомаркеров и хронического воспаления. Обратите внимание: для сдачи анализа необходимо приостановить прием гормональных препаратов, коагулянтов, влияющих на свертываемость крови. Но даже временный отказ от препаратов обязательно нужно согласовать с лечащим врачом. Последний прием пищи должен быть не позднее 8-10 часов до сдачи анализа. Год назад мы оценили иммунитет у 10 000 человек. Результаты показали, что иммунитет в хорошем состоянии лишь у четверти из всех обследованных. У остальных иммунитет либо снижен, либо реагирует слишком сильно: 🔹26,2% — оптимальный 🔹28,8% — пограничная гипореактивность 🔹24,8% — иммунодефицит средней тяжести 🔹12,6% — тяжёлый иммунодефицит (из них только 1% ВИЧ) 🔹7,6% — гиперреактивный Немного фактов о каждом диапазоне: 1. Оптимальный иммунитет — интересен для медицинских исследований, так как до сих пор неясно, какие факторы обеспечивают оптимальный уровень. 2. \\"Пограничники\\" + иммунодефицит средней тяжести. Таких людей более 53% среди всего населения. Это огромная \\"слепая\\" зона, где формируются риски для здоровья. Но без анализов эти состояния сложно определить. Хотя знать о рисках — уже больше половины успеха. Например, если в целом человек здоров, анализ иммунитета покажет ему риски, и человек скорректирует образ жизни, понаблюдает за иммунитетом в динамике. Если есть хроническое заболевание, то анализ иммунитета поможет определить динамику здоровья. 3. Тяжёлый иммунодефицит — сигнализирует о сильном снижении способности организма противостоять инфекциям. 4. Гиперреактивный — когда иммунитет реагирует слишком сильно. Это самая сложная категория, ведь аутоиммунные заболевания часто встречаются именно в ней. = = = = Исходный текст в проекте был: Уровень иммунитета можно измерить! Хотите попробовать? Иммунометр Эвоскрин​ - это сервис, точно определяющий уровень статуса, риски заболеваний. Опыт в практической медицине - более 20-ти лет. Последние 10 лет - информационные технологии в медицине - метаанализы, клинические исследования, аналитика баз данных, технологии машинного обучения В создании проекта участвовали более 30 врачей, преимущественно гинекокологи, урологи, онкологи, дерматологи. Аналитическое ядро создано на базе более 12 тысяч иммунограмм и клинических исходов. А вы задумывались, почему у кого-то появляется рак, а у кого-то нет. Почему в одном коллективе кто-то заболевает гриппом и лечится 2 недели, а кто-то продолжает работать в прежнем режиме. Кто-то постоянно пьет витамины, носит шапки, шарфы, шерстяные носки и может заболеть от малейшего сквозняка в офисе, а кто-то ходит с голыми щиколотками всю зиму и даже не знает, что такое ангина. Мы тоже об этом задумались и решили создать нечто такое, что позволит человеку самостоятельно в режиме реального времени оценить текущее состояние своего иммунитета. Нам было важно создать продукт, чтобы система была востребована и соответствовала современным требованиям - МЕДИЦИНА 10п (10 качественных характерных признаков). Не менее важно было создать продукт, который будет доступен каждому (Социальная ориентированность). Чтобы каждый знал о уровне своего иммунитета и знал, что нужно делать. Наша цель - популяризация среди врачей, блогеров, СМИ, выставках. Алгоритм EVO-Screen - это подробная расшифровка иммунограммы. Он разработан на основании больших аналитических данных, обобщает результаты наблюдательных исследований на базе более 12 000 клинических случаев. Программное обеспечение защищено двумя патентами и имеет сертификат соответствия. Почему важно знать состояние своего иммунитета? Потому что это возможность самостоятельно отвечать за качество своего здоровья. Возможность заранее знать возможных рисках и начать профилактику. Это позволит не допустить появления хронических заболеваний, достичь долгой (иногда пожизненной ремиссии) и иногда даже предотвратить появление какого-либо заболевания. Когда нужно сдавать анализ? Что мы точно можем гарантировать? Наиболее изучены хронические заболевания и онкология. Именно за эти показатели мы может точно отвечать. В течение года мы постараемся расширить заболевания. И вы нам сможете в этом помочь. Год назад мы оценили состояние иммунитета у 10 000 человек. Вот какие результаты были: 🔹26,2% - оптимальный 🔹28,8% - пограничная гипореактивность 🔹24,8% - иммунодефицит средней тяжести 🔹12,6% - тяжёлый иммунодефицит (из них только 1% ВИЧ) 🔹7,6% - гиперреактивный Немного фактов о каждом диапазоне: 1. Оптимальный - представляет интерес, так как до сих пор не ясно, какая совокупность факторов обеспечивает оптимальный уровень. 2. \\"Пограничники\\"+ иммунодефицит средней тяжести (таких более 53% в популяции) - это огромная \\"слепая\\" зона, где формируются риски для здоровья. Но при этом никто ничего не делает. Хотя уже знать о рисках - это больше половину успеха. Например, если в целом человек здоров, он просто уведомляется о рисках и корректирует образ жизни, наблюдает за статусом в динамике, если есть хроническое заболевание, то ему следует его лечить, предварительно приведя иммунный статус в оптимальный диапазон. 3. Тяжёлый иммунодефицит - это сложный для понимания диапазон, так как мы расходимся с традиционной иммунологией в вопросе вмешательства в иммунитет. Мы считаем, что нужно терапевтически корректировать даже в тех случаях, когда ничего не беспокоит, а имеющиеся связанные заболевания лечить с учётом иммунного статуса. Иммунологи так не считают, не вмешиваются пока не возникнет патология и лечат сначала болезнь, потом корректируют статус. Также в этом диапазоне мы сообщаем, что есть вероятность ВИЧ, но при этом носительство вируса в этой категории не более 13% или менее 1% от всей популяции. 4. Гиперреактивный - это самая сложная категория, аутоиммунные заболевания часто встречаются именно в ней. Преимущества применения EVO-Screen Что такое иммунометр Эвоскрин? Иммунометр Эвоскрин - это сервис автоматической и бесплатной расшифровки иммунограмм, точно определяющий уровень статуса, риски заболеваний. Требуется только загрузить анализ и получить результат интерпретации. Иммунограмму можно сдать в любой лаборатории или получить направления у врача по полису ОМС (второе бесплатно, но займёт много времени). Минимальный набор показателей в анализе: - CD 3 - СD 4 - CD 8 - CD 19 - CD 16/56 Пример иммунограммы Этих данных вполне достаточно для первичного скрининга иммунитета - не переплачивайте за \\"лишние\\" параметры без необходимости. Распознавание и расстановка данных с бланка анализа в поля программы также происходит автоматически и не требует ручного ввода, чтобы избежать человеческой ошибки. Сделав иммунограмму Вы узнаете: - уровень иммунного статуса - влияние хронических инфекциий на иммунитет; - иммунологическую онконастороженность; - влияние лекарственных препаратов/БАДов/образа жизни на иммунитет; - иммунологическую целесообразность вакцинации; - рекомендации по персональному иммунному статусу Вот как это будет выглядеть Для того, чтобы получить иммунограмму необходимо сдать анализ крови из вены. Сделать это можно в клиниках «Инвитро», «KDL», «Гемотест» в любом городе России. Для сдачи анализа необходимо приостановить прием гормональных препаратов, коагулянтов, влияющих на свертываемость крови. Даже временный отказ от препаратов обязательно согласовать с лечащим врачом. Последний прием пищи должен быть не позднее 8-10 часов до сдачи анализа. После сдачи анализа венозной крови клиника проводит анализ и Вам на почту высылается результат. Когда файл окажется у Вас на почте или если у вас уже есть иммунограмма на руках, то вы можете загрузить ее на сайт в формате PDF самостоятельно. Для сканирования иммунитета нужны 4 или 6 показателей: CD4; CD4, %; CD8; CD8, % и NK, CD16/56; NK, CD16/56 % (последние два используются для выявления онкомаркеров и хронического воспаления). Результаты исследования будут готовы через 3-10 дней (в зависимости от лаборатории, в которой сдаете кровь). При отсутствии рисков, показатели будут находиться в зеленой зоне, что говорит о высоком уровне иммунитета. Если система выявила риски, то показатели будут находиться в желтой, оранжевой, красной или фиолетовой зонах в зависимости от гипер или гипореакции Вашей иммунной системы. В этом случае необходимо дополнительное обследование организма.","output":"# Измерьте иммунитет и оцените риски Иммунометр Эвоскрин​: сервис для измерения иммунитета и рисков заболеваний.

As of my last update in 2023, here's how VRChat interacts with worlds you've visited and how you can manage your favorites or places of interest: # Bookmarked or Favorited Worlds In VRChat, the concept closest to \\"bookmarking\\" a world is adding it to your Favorites. Here's how it usually works: 1. **Favorite Worlds**: While in VRChat, you can favorite a world by opening the worlds menu, navigating to the world you wish to favorite, and then selecting the option to add it to your favorites. There are categories for your favorited worlds, such as \\"Favorite\\", \\"Friends\\", \\"Public\\", etc. 2. **Accessing Favorited Worlds**: To access your favorites, you would typically go into the Worlds menu and then navigate to the \\"Favorites\\" section. Here, you should find all the worlds you've marked as favorite. # Preload Worlds Folder Regarding the concept of a \\"preload worlds folder\\" for accessing or managing visited or favored worlds: - **Cache**: VRChat stores data of recently visited worlds in a cache to reduce load times in future visits. However, this isn't meant for user navigation but rather for performance optimization. - **Worlds Data Directory**: On Windows, VRChat's cache and potentially world-related data (not in a straightforward, user-friendly manner such as a list of visited worlds) is stored under a directory path resembling \`C:Users[Username]AppDataLocalLowVRChatvrchat\`. This path stores different types of data, including cached world data, but it's not designed for user access for the purpose of tracking visited worlds. # Managing Your Paths Back to Worlds If you're looking to keep a more permanent record of worlds you've enjoyed or wish to return to, actively using the favorite system is your best bet. Unfortunately, there isn't a built-in system for viewing a history of all worlds you've visited in a session-by-session manner. The cache does not serve as a convenient backlog of visited worlds either, and manually navigating through the cache folder won't provide a clear or user-friendly experience. For those deeply involved in the VRChat community, some opt to take notes or use external tools to keep track of world IDs they particularly enjoy. Yet, always be cautious and respect privacy and community guidelines when sharing or managing information related to VRChat worlds and their users. Lastly, VRChat is frequently updated, and new features or changes to how world data is handled could emerge. Always refer to the latest VRChat documentation or community forums for the most current advice and guidance."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like you might have a question or topic in mind, but your message came through without any content.

The word you're likely referring to is \\"photogrammetrist.\\" A photogrammetrist is a professional who specializes in photogrammetry, which is the science of making measurements from photographs and images. This involves techniques for mapping, surveying, and assessing physical objects and the environment from photographs, especially aerial photographs or images captured by satellites and drones. Photogrammetry is widely used in various fields, including: - **Surveying and Mapping**: Creating detailed maps and models of land surfaces and features. - **Architecture and Archaeology**: Documenting and analyzing historical sites and architectural structures. - **Engineering and Construction**: Planning, designing, and monitoring construction projects and infrastructure. - **Forensics**: Analyzing crime scenes or accident sites. - **Film and Gaming**: Creating realistic environments and digital assets by capturing real-world objects and scenes. Photogrammetrists use sophisticated software and mathematical techniques to interpret and analyze photographic images to extract three-dimensional data.

However, I can offer some general assistance and perhaps guide you on how to access or interpret information from a creator's bio, especially in contexts like VR platforms, where international creators might share their works. # Tips for Interpreting or Translating a Bio: 1. **Google Translate**: One of the most accessible tools is Google Translate. You can copy and paste the Japanese text into Google Translate, selecting Japanese as the source language and English as the target language. While not always perfect, especially with nuanced or idiomatic expressions, it can provide a good general understanding. 2. **Browser Extensions**: There are several browser extensions designed for automatic webpage translation. These can be particularly helpful if you're navigating a bio or portfolio that's hosted on a webpage. Chrome, for example, has built-in translation features, and extensions like \\"Google Translate\\" can offer more seamless experiences. 3. **Translation Apps**: If you're on mobile or prefer using an app, several translation apps can utilize your phone's camera to translate text from images in real-time. Google Translate's app has this feature, which could be useful if the bio is part of an image or if you're translating from a screen where text selection isn't possible. 4. **Community Help**: Sometimes, direct translation software might not capture cultural nuances or specific idioms well. If the bio contains cultural references or complex language, you might consider asking for help on forums or social media platforms that cater to language learning or specifically to Japanese-English translations. Reddit has several communities that could be of help, such as r/translator. 5. **Context Clues**: If all else fails, or if you're trying to make sense of a translation that doesn't seem quite right, look for context clues. In the case of a Japanese creator who has designed a VR world based on a local map or area, their bio could include information about their inspirations, the specific place they've recreated, any artistic liberties they've taken, or how they wish visitors to experience their world. Understanding a creator's bio can provide valuable insights into their work, motivation, and the experiences they aim to offer through their VR worlds. If there's a specific text you need help with and you're comfortable sharing, I can try to offer more direct assistance."},{"instruction":"it seems to be kyoto, with some kind of walk along places and basically culture or food things. not certain of everything, nothing is in english and cant translate from within game. just visually i see things differently.","output":"It sounds like you've encountered a VR world based on Kyoto, Japan, that focuses on providing a virtual experience of walking along places significant to Kyoto's culture or food scene.

If this refers to a specific location, it might be known for a historic public bell or clock. 2. **Yakushi Jinja (薬師神社)**: \\"Yakushi\\" is the Buddha of healing, so Yakushi Jinja would be a shrine dedicated to this deity, which is a common type of shrine in Japan, believed to provide healing and health benefits to its visitors. # The Text Pieces: - **受玉石** could potentially be a misspelling or misread text. It might stand for something else depending on its context, like a type of stone or a particular product, especially since it doesn't directly translate well from the given characters. - **耐震化工事で出**: This translates to \\"emerged from seismic retrofitting construction\\" or \\"from earthquake-proofing construction.\\" It suggests that the mentioned item (possibly 受玉石) was discovered during construction work to make a building or structure earthquake-resistant. - **街並みのなか**: This means \\"in the streets\\" or \\"among the streets,\\" indicating something located within a town or street setting. - **色濃く**: This translates to \\"deeply colored\\" or \\"intensely,\\" possibly referring to the vivid or distinct character of something within the context of the streets or the town. Combining these descriptions gives us a picture of a culturally rich area that values both its traditional food and historical items, possibly uncovered or highlighted during recent construction or restoration work. The mention of seismic retrofitting could imply a concern for preserving historical sites against earthquakes, which is a common practice in Japan to protect cultural heritage. This VR experience seems to encapsulate not just the culinary delights but also a touch of the historical and cultural preservation efforts within Japan, offering a multifaceted exploration of its rich cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"3d digital archival project, nakagin capsule tower (what do you think would this be?)","output":"A 3D digital archival project focused on the Nakagin Capsule Tower would represent a significant effort in preserving a unique piece of architectural history using modern technology. The Nakagin Capsule Tower, designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa and located in Tokyo, Japan, is a prime example of the Metabolist movement, which envisioned cities filled with sustainable, recyclable, and interchangeable parts.

When you encounter a voice option within the same settings wheel as clothing and body adjustments on some specific models, it typically refers to voice modulation or voice effects that can be applied to the avatar. Here’s a bit more detail on what this might involve and mean for users: # Voice Modulation Options 1. **Voice Pitch Adjustment**: Some avatars allow users to adjust the pitch of their voice higher or lower. This can help the voice match the appearance of the avatar more closely, such as making it sound more youthful, older, or matching a specific character persona. 2. **Voice Effects**: Besides pitch adjustment, there might be options for adding effects to your voice, such as echo, reverb, or robotic distortion. This can enhance the role-playing (RP) aspect of interactions within VRChat, allowing users to immerse more fully into their character roles. 3. **Character-Specific Sounds**: For avatars modeled after specific characters (from games, anime, etc.), there may be options to use pre-recorded phrases or sounds associated with that character. This can include catchphrases, laughs, or other iconic sounds that enhance the character's authenticity. # Implementation and Usage - **Usage**: To utilize these voice options, users typically access an in-game menu related to avatar customization. As you've noticed, this might be found in the same settings area where you adjust your avatar's clothing and body features. Selecting voice options from here allows for real-time voice modulation during gameplay. - **Why It’s Popular**: Voice modulation adds an extra layer of personalization and fun to the VRChat experience. It helps users feel more connected to their avatars and enhances the social interaction aspect by allowing for more diverse and dynamic character portrayals. - **Technical Aspects**: Voice modulation is achieved through software algorithms that process the user's voice in real-time, altering its characteristics before transmitting it to other users in the game. This processing can occur within VRChat itself or through third-party voice modulation software that works alongside VRChat. # Considerations - **Consent and Comfort**: Not all users may be comfortable with voice modulation, especially if it significantly alters one’s voice or if it's used in a misleading way. As with all customizations and interactions in VRChat, respecting other players' boundaries and preferences is crucial. - **Performance Impact**: Using voice effects might slightly impact the game’s performance on your device, depending on how they are implemented and the specifications of your hardware.

It's possible that it is intended to say something related to \\"cambio de biela,\\" which is Spanish and translates to \\"connecting rod change\\" or \\"crankshaft change\\" in English, terms that are typically used in the context of mechanical engineering, particularly with engines or machinery. The term \\"biela\\" refers to a connecting rod in an engine, a crucial component that connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. In the context of mods (modifications) for games or software that are not in English, it's a bit more challenging to pin down the exact meaning without additional context about the type of mods you are referring to. Mods can vary widely in their purpose and functionality, ranging from altering gameplay mechanics, adding new content, improving graphics, changing user interfaces, to an extensive range of other modifications. If this term is found in mods related to vehicles, engines, or machinery within a simulation game, it might be referring to a mod that involves the modification or maintenance of engine parts, specifically the connecting rods or something related. However, without more context about the type of game or the specific mod, it's difficult to provide a precise interpretation. Given the unclear nature of \\"gambio de biel,\\" I recommend checking any documentation that came with the mod or reaching out to the mod's creator for clarification. Additionally, if part of the mod's interface or description is in another language, using an online translator or language identification tool could provide more insights."},{"instruction":"it must be cambio de biel, when i click i get maquille, morena con marca, bronceada etc.","output":"Given the new information and the corrected term \\"cambio de biel,\\" it sounds like there was a misunderstanding in the initial interpretation. The additional context about clicking the option and seeing terms like \\"maquille\\" (which relates to makeup), \\"morena con marca\\" (possibly referring to a tanned or marked brunette), and \\"bronceada\\" (which means tanned) suggests we're not dealing with mechanical parts or engines. In this corrected context, \\"cambio de biel\\" does not appear to relate to any mechanical component. Instead, it seems like we're looking at something entirely different, potentially related to avatar customization, specifically around appearance traits such as makeup and skin tone. The mixture of terms and the nature of the options you've described point towards a customization menu for virtual avatars or characters, likely in a game or a virtual environment, where you can change features such as: - **Maquille (Makeup)**: Customizing the makeup options. - **Morena con Marca**: Possibly referring to a specific style or characteristic of a brunette avatar, perhaps \\"marked\\" or \\"tanned\\" with distinctive features. - **Bronceada (Tanned)**: Adjusting the avatar's skin tone to a more tanned appearance. Given this, it's plausible that \\"cambio de biel\\" is a mistranslation or misuse of terminology within the mod you are using, possibly intended to refer to changing appearance or style options (like \\"Change of Style\\" or similar), but it's hard to pin down exactly without more context. It's common for mods, especially those from non-English speaking creators or for specific communities, to have errors in translation or unconventional naming conventions for menus and options. This can lead to confusion when navigating these interfaces without a clear understanding of the intended language. If you're looking to understand more clearly or adjust specific features within this mod, it might be helpful to reach out directly to the mod's creator or community for guidance, especially if language barriers present a challenge in navigating the mod's options effectively."},{"instruction":"Охарактеризуй и приведи пример продуктивного мышления","output":"Продуктивное мышление - это способность генерировать новые идеи, находить решения проблем, принимать обоснованные решения и достигать целей.

ImageMagick，你可以通过\`-opaque\`和\`-fill\`选项来改变特定颜色。在你的案例中，你想要将黑色变为白色，将白色变为黑色，同时保持其他颜色不变。这可以通过执行两次颜色转换操作来实现，首先更改一种颜色，然后更改另一种颜色。但要注意，直接将黑色改为白色，再将白色改为黑色，可能会互相影响结果，一种常见的技巧是首先将其中一种颜色改为一个“临时”颜色（一个不会在原始图像中出现的颜色），完成所有颜色转换后，再将这个“临时”颜色转换为最终的目标颜色。 下面是一个例子，展示了如何使用ImageMagick命令行工具\`magick\`来完成这个任务： \`\`\`bash magick input.png -fill \\"#ff00ff\\" -opaque black tmp.png magick tmp.png -fill black -opaque white output.png magick output.png -fill white -opaque \\"#ff00ff\\" output.png \`\`\` 解释： 1. 第一行将所有黑色 (\`#000000\`) 替换为亮粉色 (\`#ff00ff\`) 或者另外一种不会与图像中现有颜色冲突的颜色。 2. 第二行将所有的白色 (\`#ffffff\`) 替换为黑色 (\`#000000\`)。 3. 第三行将步骤1中使用的亮粉色 (\`#ff00ff\`) 更改为白色 (\`#ffffff\`)。 注意：由于直接从黑到白，然后从白到黑可能会导致问题，中间使用一个桥接颜色是很有必要的。这样做确保了第一次颜色替换不会被第二次替换所影响。 也可以用一条命令串起来完成，避免创建临时文件： \`\`\`bash magick input.png ( +clone -fill \\"#ff00ff\\" -opaque black ) ( +clone -fill black -opaque white ) -delete 0 -fill white -opaque \\"#ff00ff\\" output.png \`\`\` 这条命令做了同样的事情，但使用了ImageMagick的克隆和删除操作，避免了中间文件的生成。务必根据实际情况选择合适的方法。"},{"instruction":"能否指定一个范围","output":"在 ImageMagick 中直接指定颜色替换的“容差”或者颜色范围进行精细控制是有点复杂的，因为 \`-opaque\` 参数通常用于指定一个确切的颜色值进行替换。不过，对于更复杂的颜色更改，包括在特定范围内的颜色更改，可以使用\`-fuzz\`参数来指定颜色的匹配容差。 举个例子，假设你想要将接近黑色的颜色也转换为白色，可以通过增加\`-fuzz\`值来实现这个目的： \`\`\`bash magick input.png -fuzz 10% -fill \\"#ff00ff\\" -opaque black tmp.png \`\`\` 这里\`-fuzz 10%\`指的是让 ImageMagick 在黑色的基础上，考虑一个颜色差异在10%以内的容差范围，将这个范围内认为是“黑色”的颜色也替换成指定的颜色（这里是亮粉色\`#ff00ff\`）。 然后按照之前的流程继续： \`\`\`bash magick tmp.png -fill black -opaque white output.png magick output.png -fill white -opaque \\"#ff00ff\\" output.png \`\`\` 或者，合并为单条命令： \`\`\`bash magick input.png -fuzz 10% ( +clone -fill \\"#ff00ff\\" -opaque black ) ( +clone -fill black -opaque white ) -delete 0 -fill white -opaque \\"#ff00ff\\" output.png \`\`\` 请注意，使用 \`-fuzz\` 参数时，颜色替换的范围会更广，可能会影响到不是完全纯黑或纯白的颜色，因此需要您根据实际情况调整\`-fuzz\`的值。过大的 \`-fuzz\` 值可能会导致不希望改变的颜色也被更改。 这种方法适用于有一定颜色变化容差需要的场景，但重要的是需要通过适当的 \`-fuzz\` 值来平衡精确度和覆盖范围。"},{"instruction":"PS C:UsersxicheDownloads>

Die wichtigste Quelle der privaten Akkumulation an Geld bzw. Kapital bildete in dieser Zeit die staatlich unterstützte oder organisierte merkantile Eroberung (8). Diese Behauptung läßt sich nicht nur systematisch ableiten, sie ist auch vielfach statistisch belegt worden. Und zwar sowohl von den großen Verfechtern merkantiler Handelspolitik, wie etwa Davenant, Postlethwayt oder Colbert (9), als auch von Historikern der jüngsten Zeit, wie Elisabeth Schumpeter, Phyllis Deane, Cole oder Davis (10). Während die Analyse des Handelsvolumens in Relation zum Gesamt-wachstum des Nationaleinkommens bei den modernen Arbeiten statistisch ungleich zuverlässiger ist als bei den Autoren des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts, wird bei den letzteren noch deutlich, daß vieles, was heute unter dem neutralen Begriff des Handels erscheint, aufzuschlüsseln ist zum einen als Handel mit sog. schwarzem Elfenbein, mit Sklaven also, zum anderen nur bezeichnet werden kann als gewaltsame Aneignung. Exemplarisch ist zu erinnern an die Gewinnungsmethoden für Edelmetalle, wie sie in den spanischen Besitzungen Südamerikas zur Anwendung kamen. Hier ist jedoch nicht der Ort, die Entwicklung der äußeren Märkte im einzelnen darzustellen; vielmehr ist hinzuweisen auf deren doppelte Funktion. Sie waren zum einen Lieferanten von Rohstoffen aller Art, von Edelmetallen, Spezereien und Sklaven; damit bildeten sie eine Quelle für Reichtum, die nur geringe Gegenleistung erforderte (11). Zum anderen entwickelten sich die äußeren Märkte jedoch zuneh-mend als Absatzgebiete von Manufakturwaren und bildeten damit eine Vorausset- zung für den erfolgreichen Kampf der Bürger gegen jene feudalen Produktionsbe-schränkungen, die in den Zunftordnungen versteinert waren (12). In unserem Zusammenhang ist die Eroberung von äußeren Märkten nicht nur bedeutsam als die hervorragendste Quelle des Reichtums bzw. des Handelskapitals unter spätfeudalen und frühkapitalistischen Bedingungen, sondern als die zentrale ökonomische Ursache der Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates. Denn der Kampf um die äußeren Märkte ließ sich nicht durchführen mit privaten noch mit merkantilen (also handelspolitischen) Mitteln allein. Er erforderte Flotte und Heer, ein geordnetes nationales Geldsystem, ein Kreditsystem, sowie die Übernahme staatlicher Garantien für private Vertragsabschlüsse mit quasi-öffentlichem Charakter in den überseeischen Gebieten. Voraussetzung zur Behauptung im internationalen Konkurrenzkampf um die äußeren Märkte war sowohl ein bestimmtes Quantum an privat akkumuliertem Handelskapital als auch eine relativ finanzstarke oder doch kreditwürdige Zentralge-walt. Und diese fiskalischen Voraussetzungen erklären vieles, was heute als Prinzi-pienstreit der Merkantilisten über Protektionismus oder Freihandel mißinterpretiert wird. In einer seiner verdienstvollen Arbeiten hat Ralph Davis nachgewiesen (13), daß die Entwicklung des Protektionismus in England in den Jahren 1689—1786 in ihren einzelnen Maßnahmen jeweils direkt zurückzuführen ist auf unmittelbare Fi-nanzbedürfnisse der Regierung. Und diese Finanzbedürfnisse resultierten ihrerseits aus der Notwendigkeit, teure Kolonial- und Handelskriege zu führen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist daran zu erinnern, daß die großen europäischen Kriege des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts im wesentlichen ebenfalls zu begreifen sind als Handels- kriege um die Dominanz auf den äußeren Märkten. Wohl wurde auch gekämpft um die Vorherrschaft am europäischen Markt, aber wenn sich etwa in den spanischen Erbfolgekriegen England mit Portugal gegen Frankreich verbündete, so bedeutete dies nicht nur, daß statt der französischen jetzt die portugiesischen Weinimporte nach Großbritannien gefördert wurden und englische statt der französischen Woll-manufakturwaren in Portugal dominierten. Es bedeutete vor allem, daß Großbritan-nien den Löwenanteil des direkten und des über Portugal laufenden indirekten Exportes nach Brasilien für sich durchgesetzt hatte. Welche ungeheure ökonomische Bedeutung diese hier nur exemplarisch herangezogene Handelsvorherrschaft wäh-rend der Hochkonjunktur der brasilianischen Gold- und Diamantenproduktion im 18. Jahrhundert hatte, ist in einer 1971 erschienen Arbeit von Harold Fisher dargestellt worden (14). Was hier und im übrigen auch in den Schriften englischer Merkantilisten als nationale Interessen behandelt wird, ist politisch zu differenzieren. Zwar waren in allen großen Außenhandelsnationen die Krone, das Bürgertum und der Adel an den merkantilen Unternehmungen beteiligt, doch die jeweilige Relation dieser Beteiligung unterschied sich beträchtlich von Land zu Land. Waren die portugiesisch-spanischen Kolonisationen Unternehmungen der Krone, die dem Adel Sinekuren in der Kolonialverwaltung verschafften und Vertreter des Bürgertums hauptsächlich am Waren transport beteiligten, so erwies sich als auf Dauer weitaus erfolgsträchtiger das vor allem in England und Frankreich entwickelte Verfahren der Privilegierung selb-ständig agierender vorwiegend bürgerlicher Handelskompanien (15). In diesen Ländern kam das sog. .nationale' Interesse zustande durch die Kongruenz von Inter-essen bürgerlicher Handelskompanien an einer militärisch und finanziell starken Zentralmacht mit Interessen der Krone, welche sich Unabhängigkeit zu verschaffen suchte von der Notwendigkeit politischer und finanzieller Unterstützung durch die Feudalaristokratie und ihrer Körperschaften (16). Das Interesse an der Entwicklung der äußeren Märkte trug in diesen Ländern dazu bei, die Umwälzung feudaler Strukturen in national-bürgerliche zu begünstigen, wobei zu berücksichtigen ist, daß der hiermit verbundene relevante Zentralisierungsprozeß sich nicht nur gegen die Feudalaristokratie, sondern auch gegen die Städte, die frühen Hochburgen bürgerli-cher Unabhängigkeit, zu richten pflegte (17). Die Validität der hier vorgetragenen Hypothese von der Konstituierung des bürgerlichen Staates als merkantiler Außenvertretung beweist sich durch ihren Erklä-rungswert: Sobald wir zu ermitteln suchen, welchen Gebieten in Europa durch geographisch-klimatische Bedingungen und/oder durch bestimmte Ausprägungen ih-rer Produktionsschwerpunkte die Eroberung äußerer (präziser: außereuropäischer) Märkte erschwert war, so stellen wir fest, daß sie sich decken mit denjenigen Gebieten, in welchen die Entwicklung zum modernen Nationalstaat retardierte. Für den Fortgang der Entwicklung können wir darüberhinaus feststellen, daß jene spezifischen Formen autokratischer Staatlichkeit, welche vor allem für Preußen-Deutschland üblicherweise zurückgefiihrt werden auf eine nationale Verspätung, ihren Ursprung haben in der ökonomischen Notwendigkeit, privat nicht zu erzielende Resultate der ursprünglichen Akkumulation subsidiär durch staatliche Macht herzustellen (18). Derartige Subsidiarität ging, wie Schmoller gezeigt hat, so weit, daß in Preußen im 18. Jahrhundert von Staats wegen der Versuch unternommen wurde, Handels- und Finanzgesellschaften zu gründen, wie sie andernorts als Zusammenschlüsse von Handelsbürgern zur Entstehung kamen (19). Das auch in historisch-materialistischen Arbeiten noch gängige Phasenschema der Staatstätigkeit, welches davon ausgeht, daß während der Phase der Entfaltung des Kapitalismus sich die Akkumulationsbedingungen des Kapitals durch das Wir- ken, der Konkurrenz ohne Staatseingriffe herstellten, die Staatstätigkeit demnach auf die Erstellung von Rahmenbedingungen für die kapitalistische Produktionsweise beschränkt bleiben konnte, ist ein Reflex der (von Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts bis gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts andauernden) Vormachtstellung des britischen Kapitals auf dem Weltmarkt. Nur in England stellten sich aufgrund der Dominanz am Weltmarkt Bedingungen her, welche die Entfaltung der freien Konkurrenz und schließlich die Freihandelspolitik ohne Schaden für das nationale Kapital ermöglich-ten. Die nationalen Akkumulationsbedingungen des Kapitals sind von allem anfang an durch den Weltmarkt geprägt, und was die Staatstätigkeit anbelangt, so bildet die englische Enttwicklung nicht so sehr den ,,klassischen Fall'' als vielmehr den auf Weltmarktdominanz beruhenden besonderen.”翻译为中文","output":"商业主义是那个历史时期，在这个时期，商品生产与外部市场的发展（7）相结合而确立。在这段时间里，私人积累货币或资本的最重要来源是国家支持或组织的商业征服（8）。这一说法不仅可以从系统上推导出来，而且还在很多统计数据上得到了证实。无论是大力倡导商业贸易政策的人如Davenant、Postlethwayt或Colbert（9），还是最近时期的历史学家如Elisabeth Schumpeter、Phyllis Deane、Cole或Davis（10），都是如此。尽管在现代作品中，关于贸易量与国民收入总增长的分析在统计上远比17和18世纪的作者可靠，但在后者的作品中，仍然可以明显看到，许多今天在中性术语“贸易”下呈现的内容，其实可以分为两部分：一部分是所谓的黑色象牙，即奴隶贸易；另一部分只能被描述为强制性的征用。一个典型的例子是在南美的西班牙殖民地应用的贵金属开采方法。 但是，这里不是详细介绍外部市场发展的地方；反之，应该指出它们的双重功能。它们一方面是各种原材料、贵金属、香料和奴隶的供应商；因此，它们构成了一种只需要少量回报的财富来源（11）。另一方面，外部市场逐渐成为制成品的销售地，为城市中工匠行会存在的封建生产限制的成功挑战创造了条件（12）。 在我们的背景下，外部市场的征服不仅仅是作为财富或贸易资本的主要来源在晚封建和早期资本主义条件下至关重要，而且作为构成资产阶级国家的中心经济原因。因为争夺外部市场的斗争不能仅仅通过私人或商业（即贸易政策）手段来进行。它需要舰队和军队，一个有序的国家货币系统，一个信贷系统，以及对与海外地区有准公共特征的私人合同的国家保证。 在国际竞争中占据外部市场的先决条件既包括一定量的私人积累的商业资本，也包括一个相对财政强大或至少具有信用的中央政权。而这些财政先决条件解释了许多今天被误解为关于商业主义者间保护主义或自由贸易的原则之争的原因。在一项有价值的工作中，Ralph Davis已经证明（13），1689—1786年间英国保护主义的发展在其各项措施中都可以直接追溯到政府的直接财政需求。而这些财政需求又源于进行昂贵的殖民地和商业战争的必要性。在这个背景下，应该记住，17和18世纪的大型欧洲战争在很大程度上同样可以理解为关于在外部市场上的主导权的商业战争。确实也为了争夺欧洲市场的优势而战，但当英格兰在西班牙王位继承战争中与葡萄牙联盟对抗法国时，这不仅意味着法国葡萄酒进口被葡萄牙替代，英国的羊毛制品在葡萄牙占据主导地位。它主要意味着大英帝国通过葡萄牙实现了对巴西的直接和间接出口的狮子份额。18世纪巴西黄金和钻石生产高峰期间这一贸易优势的巨大经济意义，在1971年发表的Harold Fisher的一项研究中被具体说明（14）。 这里和英国商业主义者的著作中所述的国家利益需要在政治上进行区分。尽管在所有大型外贸国家中，王室、市民阶级和贵族都参与了商业企业，但这些参与的相对比例在不同国家有显著不同。如果说葡萄牙-西班牙的殖民地是王室的企业，给贵族在殖民地管理中提供了闲职，并且主要让市民阶级参与货物运输，那么在英国和法国特别发展出来的赋予独立运作的主要是市民阶级商业公司特权的做法，证明是远远更有成果的（15）。在这些国家中，“国家”利益的形成是通过商业公司对军事上和财政上强大的中央政权的兴趣与王室寻求通过贵族及其团体的政治和财政支持以获取独立的兴趣的一致性而实现的（16）。对外部市场的兴趣促使这些国家倾向于将封建结构转变为国民-市民结构，同时还要考虑到，与此相关的中央集权进程不仅针对封建贵族，也针对城市——早期市民独立性的据点（17）。 这里提出的关于以商业外交代表作为资产阶级国家构成的假设的有效性通过其解释价值得到证明：一旦我们试图确定哪些欧洲地区由于地理-气候条件和/或其生产重点的特定表现形式而征服外部（更准确地说：非欧洲）市场变得困难，我们就会发现这些地区与那些发展成现代民族国家延迟的地区相吻合。对于发展的进一步进展，我们还可以发现，那些特定形式的专制国家性，这些通常被归因于普鲁士-德国的国家延迟，实际上源于通过国家力量补充私人无法实现的原始积累结果的经济必要性（18）。Schmoller已经展示了这种辅助性走得有多远，以至于在18世纪的普鲁士，政府试图建立贸易和金融公司，这些在其他地方作为商人联合体的形式出现（19）。 即便在历史唯物主义的作品中仍然普遍接受的国家活动的阶段模式，这种模式认为在资本主义展开期间，资本的积累条件是通过竞争的作用而无需国家干预来建立的，国家活动因而可以限制于为资本主义生产方式创造框架条件，这是对英国资本在世界市场上长期领先地位的反映。英国由于在世界市场上的主导地位，创造出了条件，这些条件允许自由竞争的展开并最终实现自由贸易政策，而不损害国家资本的利益。资本的国家积累条件从一开始就受到世界市场的影响，就国家活动而言，英国的发展不那么是“经典案例”，而更多是基于世界市场主导地位的特殊情况。"},{"instruction":"请将“Da es sich hier lediglich um die Begründung einer Hypothese, nicht jedoch um eine ins einzelne gehende Darstellung handeln kann, soll jetzt nicht näher eingegan-gen werden auf die besonderen Schwierigkeiten der Entwicklung in Nordeuropa (20), noch auf die Erklärung der holländischen und später vor allem der britischen Vorherrschaft auf dem Weltmarkt. Stattdessen soll auf der angeschnittenen allgemeinen Ebene die abstrakte Funktionsbestimmung der Staatsmacht für die merkantile Form der Akkumulation weitergefuhrt werden. Dabei lassen sich die zunächst zu behandelnden Staatsaufgaben, die Bereitstellung einer Streitmacht und die Beschaffung von Ressourcen begreifen als eine Konkretion der als konstitutiv bereits herausgestellten Außenfunktion. Der Einsatz der Staatsmacht diente der Sicherung bereits errungener Handels-gebiete, dem Schutz der Handelsschiffe vor Piraterie, der Außenvertretungen des Handelskapitals vor feindlichen Überfällen. Daneben aber waren alle am Weltmarkt beteiligten Nationen bestrebt, den größten Anteil am Welthandel für sich zu erringen. Es wird später noch darauf zurückzukommen sein, daß in der Phase der Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates die nationale Souveränität als prinzipiell unbegrenzt begriffen wurde. Die Theorie von der sog. Zuhöchstheit bezieht sich einerseits auf die Position des Menarchen in seinem Volk, sie bezieht sich andererseits auf die Außenvertretung der Nation als Ganzes. Und hier ist die Souveränitätstheorie deutlich verankert in den politisch-ökonomischen Strukturen des merkantilen Systems. Die zeitgenössischen Theoretiker des Merkantilismus gingen davon aus, daß die Reichtümer dieser Erde begrenzt seien und unter vorindustriellen Produktions-bedingungen war diese Annahme keineswegs unrealistisch. So galt es also nicht nur, den größten Anteil an den mehr oder minder natürlichen Schätzen der Erde unmit-telbar zu sichern, sondern zugleich daraus zu profitieren, daß man diese Güter möglichst günstig an andere Nationen weiterverkaufte. In diesem Zusammenhang sind ein Großteil der sog. Navigations- und der Kolonialgesetze des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts zu sehen, welche jeweils die Mutterländer als Zwis'chenhandelssta- tionen vorschrieben oder zu etablieren suchten. Je verschiedener und zahlreicher die Güter waren, über deren Welthandelsangebot ein Land bestimmen konnte, und je größer der Bereich der potentiellen Abnehmer, um so größer war die Möglichkeit, Situations- und Monopolgewinne aus dem Handel zu schlagen. Mit zunehmender Kapitalakkumulation entwickelte sich die handelskapitalistische und koloniale Herr-schaft darüberhinaus immer mehr als Garant für den Absatz heimischer Manufakturwaren. In jedem Fall kann für das gesamte 17. und auch noch für das 18. Jahrhundert festgestellt werden, daß friedliche Beziehungen nur dann angestrebt wurden, wenn militärische Unterstützung merkantiler Expansion aussichtslos erschien. Selbst in sog. Friedenszeiten allerdings waren Seeräuberei und Schmuggel übliche und von ehrenwerten Bürgern oft in großem Ausmaße betriebene Unternehmungen (21). Der aktuelle oder doch zumindest ständig potentiell notwendige Einsatz von Militär- und Seestreitkräften war nur zu gewährleisten, wenn die machtpolitischen Aktionen der Zentralregierung Unabhängigkeit erreichten von den Feudalherren, welche nur ungern die ihnen Untertanen Bauern zum nationalen Kriegsdienst ver-pflichteten (22). Das stehende Heer bzw. die nationale Flotte, welche allein solche Unabhängigkeit und darüberhinaus die Souveränität der Nation zu garantieren ver-mochten, erforderten aber Finanzmittel, welche die Möglichkeiten der königlichen Privatschatullen auf Dauer zu sprengen drohten. So ist die Entwicklung der merkantilen Außenfunktion des Staates allenthalben begleitet von grundlegender Veränderung des Systems der Ressourcenbeschaffung. Dabei wurden nicht nur neue Geldquellen in stärkerem Umfang dem Staatsbudget erschlossen, vor allem änderte sich die Technik der Ressourcenbeschaffung, und die letztere Veränderung bedingte ihrerseits zunehmend die Entwicklung eines bürokratischen Apparates im Dienste der Zentralregierung (23). Die Entstehung des modernen Steuersystems ist in mehr als einer Hinsicht zentral für die Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates. Denn sie bildete nicht nur die Voraussetzung für die erfolgreiche Erfüllung der merkantilen Außenfunktion, war nicht nur der bedeutsamste Anlaß für die Entwicklung der modernen staatlichen Administration, sondern sie hat darüberhinaus unmittelbar akzellerierend die öko-nomische Entwicklung beeinflußt. Dies gilt bereits für den ersten Schritt der Verän-derung des herkömmlichen Steuersystems; denn noch während der Fortgeltung feudaler Abgabenordnungen hat deren Umwandlung in Geldsteuern und die Erhö-hung der letzteren dazu beigetragen, daß der Grund und Boden vieler vorher faktisch unabhängig produzierender Bauern an die Grundherren zurückfiel bzw. von bürgerlichen Großgrundbesitzern aufgekauft wurde; die verarmte Landbevölkerung stand entweder über eine Teilbeschäftigung im Verlag oder aber durch Abwanderung in die Städte den Manufakturbetrieben als Arbeitsangebot zur Verfügung (24). Die Veränderung des Steuersystems hat die Proletarisierung eines großen Teils der Landbevölkerung von Land zu Land in unterschiedlichem Ausmaß beeinflußt. Überall jedoch ist durch diesen Wandel der Ressourcenbeschaffung zugleich die Warenproduktion und die Ausbreitung des Manufaktursystems gefördert worden. Die Herausbildung des modernen Steuersystems kann hier nicht ausführlich behandelt werden (25). Sie läßt sich in großen Zügen kennzeichnen als eine Ent-wicklung, welche ausgeht von den Bemühungen, die früheren Sondersteuern und Requirierungen zu überwinden durch eine möglichst breite und direkte Besteuerung (26). Da letztere sich politisch nur sehr schwer durchsetzen ließ, gingen die Regierungen vorzugsweise den Umweg der indirekten Steuer, der Akzise (27). Auch diese wurde freilich nicht ohne Kampf durchgesetzt (in Preußen z. B. gelang die Durchsetzung der Akzise nur für die Städte; die Landbevölkerung (d. h. vor allem die Grundbesitzer und die von ihnen abhängigen Schichten) war bis 1873 von der Akzisenregelung — vor allem der Mahl- und Schlachtsteuer — befreit (28). Insbesondere in Holland, England, den deutschen Gebieten und Österreich schlug der Akzisenstreit heftige politische Wellen. Er bewirkte zugleich, daß die Theoretiker der nationalen Ökonomie sich bessere Klarheit verschafften über die ökonomische Wirkung von Steuern (29). In diesem Zusammenhang stand auch die Aus-einandersetzung um die Zölle, die neben Akzisen und Luxussteuern die dritte wichtige indirekte Einnahmequelle der Zentralregierung bildeten. Zölle waren im Mittelalter und in der Frühzeit des Merkantilismus vorwiegend, wenn auch nicht ausschließlich, zu fiskalischen Zwecken erhoben worden. Erst mit Ausweitung des Warenverkehrs und der Entwicklung anderer Einnahmequellen wurden Zölle zunehmend betrachtet als Mittel der Gewerbepolitik (30), zur Steuerung des Vorrats an Rohstoffen und zur Sicherung von Absatzmärkten für die heimische Industrie (31). Der große theoretische und praktische Fortschritt, der in der Entwicklung vom bloßen Fiskalismus zur staatlichen Wirtschaftspolitik in der veränderten Be-handlung der Zölle enthalten ist, prägt auch die Diskussionen um die übrigen Staatseinnahmen. So haben vor allem die französischen Steuerreformer wie Boisguillebert, Vauban und Turgot die Überzeugung vertreten, daß die finanzielle Sicherung der Krone um so erfolgreicher zu gewährleisten sei, je mehr diese auf die ihr zustehenden feudalen Abgaben verzichte und stattdessen die Entwicklung der Marktbeziehungen und den Erfolg der privaten Unternehmungen ihrer Bürger fördere (32). In unterschiedlichen Ausprägungen sehen wir deshalb überall einen mehr oder minder deutlichen Übergang zu Nettoertrags- und Einkommenssteuern. Vielfach treten sie noch auf in der Form von (katastrierten) Aufwandssteuern (Fenster-, Tür-, Haarpuder-, Dienstbotensteuem z. B. (33)). Wo — wie 1789 in Großbritannien als Kriegssteuer — bereits die Einkommenssteuer eingeführt wurde, traf diese noch auf die Schwierigkeiten des staatlichen Konstitutionsprozesses. Denn diese allgemeine, direkte Besteuerung, mit der für sie charakteristischen Selbsteinschätzung der Bürger (im Unterschied zur früheren Taxierung von Amts wegen), erforderte zu ihrer Durchführung eine zentralisierte Verwaltung, welche nach gleichen Grundsätzen die Überwachungsfunktion und Richtlinienentwicklung ausfüllen konnte (34). Die historische Ungleichzeitigkeit der Durchsetzung der Einkommenssteuer, als der typisch bürgerlichen Steuerform, ist ein wichtiger analytischer Indikator für den jeweiligen nationalen Entwicklungsstand des bürgerlichen Staates (35). Auch hin-sichtlich dieses Aspektes kommt die politisch-ökonomische Vorherrschaft (und da-mit der organisatorische Vorsprung) Großbritanniens voll zum Durchbruch.”翻译为中文","output":"因为这里仅仅是为了提出一个假说的理由，并不是为了详细讲解，所以现在不打算深入讨论北欧发展的特殊困难（20），也不讨论荷兰和随后特别是英国在世界市场上的主导地位。相反，应在已经提出的一般层面上，继续探讨国家权力对于商业积累形式的抽象功能定位。在这里，首先要处理的国家任务，即提供武装力量和资源获取，可以被理解为已经确定的外部功能的一种具体化。 国家权力的运用旨在保障已获得的贸易区域，保护商船免受海盗侵扰，保护商业资本的外部代表免受敌对势力的袭击。然而，所有参与世界市场的国家都力图为自己赢得最大的世界贸易份额。稍后将回顾，在资产阶级国家形成的阶段，国家主权被理解为原则上是无限的。所谓的最高统治权理论一方面关系到君主对其人民的地位，另一方面关系到作为一个整体的国家的对外代表。在这里，主权理论明确植根于商业系统的政治-经济结构中。 商业主义的当代理论家们认为，地球上的财富是有限的，在前工业生产条件下，这一假设绝非不切实际。因此，任务不仅是直接确保获得地球上或多或少的自然财宝的最大份额，而且还在于尽可能有利地将这些商品转卖给其他国家以获利。在这方面，17和18世纪的所谓航海和殖民法律需要被理解，这些法律规定或试图建立母国作为中转贸易站。能够决定其世界贸易供应的商品种类越多越丰富，潜在购买者的范围越广，从贸易中获得情势利益和垄断利润的可能性就越大。随着资本积累的增加，商业资本主义和殖民统治越来越多地成为保证本国制造商品销售的担保。无论如何，可以肯定地说，在整个17世纪乃至18世纪，只有在军事支持商业扩张看似无望的情况下，才寻求和平关系。即便在所谓的和平时期，海盗行为和走私也是经常被尊敬的市民大规模从事的活动（21）。 只有在中央政府的权力行动获得独立性时，才能确保军事和海军力量的实际或至少是持续的潜在必要性，这是因为封建领主不情愿将其臣民的农民强征入国家战争服务（22）。然而，唯有常备军或国家舰队才能保证这种独立性，进而保证国家主权，但这需要财政资源，这些资源长期以来威胁着王室私人金库的能力。 因此，国家商业外部功能的发展无不伴随着资源获取系统根本性变化。在此过程中，不仅为国家预算开辟了更多的新资金来源，尤其是资源获取技术的改变，而且这一后续变化进一步促进了中央政府服务的官僚机构的发展（23）。 现代税制的形成在构建资产阶级国家方面有着多方面的核心意义。因为它不仅是成功完成商业外部功能的前提，不仅是现代国家行政机构发展的最重要原因，而且还直接加速了经济发展。这种影响从早期更改传统税收系统的第一步就已可见；因为在封建赋税体系仍然适用的情况下，将其转变为货币税收和增加这些税收有助于许多以前事实上独立生产的农民的土地归还给地主或被市民大地主购买；贫穷的农村人口要么通过部分就业的家庭手工业，要么通过迁往城市为制造业提供劳动供给（24）。税收制度的变化在不同国家对农村人口的无产阶级化影响程度各不相同。然而，这种资源获取方式的变化无处不在地促进了商品生产和制造系统的扩散。 现代税制的形成在这里不能详细讨论（25）。它大体上可以描述为一种发展，这种发展源于通过尽可能广泛和直接的征税克服以往的特殊税收和征用要求的努力(26)。因为后者在政治上很难实现，所以政府更倾向于通过间接税，即消费税的方式绕道而行（27）。 然而，即便是这样，消费税也并非未经斗争就实现了（例如，在普鲁士，消费税只在城市实施；直到1873年，农村人口（即主要是地主和依赖他们的阶层）被免除了消费税规定——尤其是磨坊税和屠宰税）(28)。特别是在荷兰、英国、德国地区和奥地利，关于消费税的争议引发了激烈的政治波动。这同样促使国民经济学的理论家更清楚地了解税收的经济作用（29）。在这种背景下，还存在对关税的争论，除了消费税和奢侈税之外，关税构成了中央政府的第三个重要的间接收入来源。在中世纪和商业主义时期的早期，关税主要是出于财政目的而征收的，尽管并非总是如此。随着商品流通的扩大和其他收入来源的发展，关税日益被视为工业政策的手段（30），用于控制原材料库存和保障本国工业的销售市场（31）。 在从纯粹的财政主义向国家经济政策转变的过程中，关税处理方式的变化包含了巨大的理论和实践进步，这也影响了对其他国家收入的讨论。因此，法国的税务改革者如Boisguillebert、Vauban和Turgot等主张，只有当王室放弃其应得的封建税收，而是促进市场关系的发展和国民私营企业的成功，王室的财政安全才能更成功地得到保证（32）。 因此，在不同的形式中，我们到处都可以看到向净收益和收入税的更明显的过渡。很多情况下，它们仍以（清册登记的）花费税的形式出现（例如，窗户税、门税、发粉税、仆人税等（33））。在某些情况下——如1789年在英国作为战争税引入的收入税，这种税收在其特有的公民自我评估（与以前由官方评估不同）中，需要一种能够以相同原则执行监管功能和制定指导方针的集中化管理（34）。收入税作为典型的资产阶级税收形式的历史不同步实施，是分析不同国家资产阶级国家发展水平的重要指标（35）。就这个方面而言，英国的政治-经济主导地位（以及由此带来的组织优势）完全凸显出来。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die staatlichen Finanzprobleme hatten Auswirkungen nicht nur bezüglich des Apparats der Steuer- und Zollbehörden, sie brachten vor allem nationale Kalkula-tionsprobleme mit sich. So ist die Entwicklung der nationalen Militärmächte begleitet von der Trennung der königlichen Privat Schatulle und dem Staatsschatz, von der Kalkulation des Staatshaushalts sowie von ersten Berechnungen des Volkseinkom-mens (36). Mit gutem Grund hat sich die Theorie des merkantilen Systems deshalb häufig als „politische Arithmetik“ bezeichnet (37). Solche nationale Buchführung bildete Voraussetzung und Hemmnis zugleich der zweiten finanzpolitischen Komponente im Konstitutionsprozeß des bürgerlichen Staates: der systematischen Politik der Staatsverschuldung als eines Mittels der nationalen ökonomischen Entwicklung (38), Waren früstenhäuser Schuldner einzelner privater Bankiers gewesen, so überstieg das jetzt benötigte Kreditvolumen nicht nur die meisten privaten Möglichkeiten, die Kreditbeschaffung für die im Weltmaßstab betriebenen merkantilen und militärischen Unternehmungen mußte vor allem ihren eher zufälligen, von der Machtpolitik einzelner Handelshäuser abhängigen Charakter verlieren (39). So bildete sich in den meisten europäischen Staaten (und später auch in den USA) im 18. Jahrhundert ein Finanzsystem heraus, in welchem die rechte Dosierung von öffentlichen Krediten, Staatsschulden und Umschuldungsregelungen mit gutem Grund für eine Kunst erachtet wurde. Und die Übernahme ökonomischer Funktionen für die bürgerliche Gesellschaft durch die Zentralgewalt läßt sich jeweils ablesen an den Kämpfen um die Errichtung einer Nationalbank (40). Denn als Instrument zur Regelung der Schulden des Staates bildet sie das Zentrum der Auseinandersetzungen um die Bedeutung des Staates für das Wachstum des nationalen Reichtums (41). Zwar überzieht Dickson den bestehenden Zusammenhang, wenn er meint, der Sturz der französischen Monarchie in der großen Revolution sei eine Folge des seit Colbert in Frankreich nicht mehr weiterentwickelten öffentlichen Finanzsystems gewesen, wohl aber ist ihm zuzustimmen, wenn er den Erfolg der britischen Kolonialkriege auch zurückfuhrt auf das in Großbritannien am weitesten fortgeschrittene System der Staatsverschuldung (sein hervorragendes Merkmal war die ausgewogene Relation von langfristiger und kurzfristiger Staatsverschuldung und die Entwicklung systematischer Umschuldungspläne (42)). Die öffentlich geförderte Herausbildung eines Marktes für Wertpapiere war einerseits Voraussetzung für die erfolgreiche Akkumulation von Kapital im Kolonialhandel, gleichzeitig bewirkte sie jedoch die endgültige Zerstörung noch fortdauernder mittelalterlicher Zinsverbocs- vorstellungen — ein Umstand, der als ideologische Voraussetzung der kapitalisti-schen Entwicklung nicht zu unterschätzen ist. Diente das System der Staatsverschuldung zunächst vorwiegend der Finanzierung nationaler Unternehmungen im merkantilen Interesse, so hat das in diesem Zusammenhang entstandene Kreditsystem zunehmend auch Bedeutung erhalten für die Finanzierung privater Unternehmungen. Diese Entwicklung stand ihrerseits in einem deutlichen Zusammenhang mit der merkantilen Machtstellung der Nation. Denn bereits seit dem 16. Jahrhundert läßt sich beobachten, daß Kapital jeweils in jene Länder transferiert wurde, in welchen die höchsten Profite zu erwarten waren. Mit diesem Hinweis auf die Kreditversorgung sei auf den sonst hier nicht ausgeführten Zusammenhang zwischen außenwirtschaftlicher Machtstellung und frühem Übergang zur kapitalistischen Produktionsweise aufmerksam gemacht. Der sich herausbildende Weltmarkt fand seinen Ausdruck aber nicht nur in internationalen Kapitaltransfers. Vielmehr ist spätestens seit dem 16. Jahrhundert eine bewußte Politik der Auswertung fremder Erfahrungen und der Gewinnung ausländischen Sachverstands zu beobachten. So sind nicht nur italienische Fachleute nach Holland und Frankreich geholt worden, um dort Bankwesen und Börse bzw. die Seidenweberei zu entwickeln (43), auch ausländische Kaufleute und Bankiers gingen vbei den großen italienischen Handelshäusern in die Lehre (44). Sowohl auf privater als auch auf nationaler Ebene können wir zunehmend die bewußte Übernahme flnanz- und wirtschaftspolitischer Instrumentarien bzw. Institutionen anderer Nationen beobachten (45). Und derartige Verbreitungsprozesse sind mit zu be-rücksichtigen, wenn es um die Analyse einzelner nationalgeschichtlicher Entwick-lungen geht. Dieser Hinweis soll verhindern, daß der hier vorgetragene Erklärungsansatz für die Konstitution des bürgerlichen Staates mißverstanden wird als ein historisches Ablaufmodell konkreter nationalstaatlicher Entwicklungsprozesse. Trotz der (im Vergleich zu historisch späteren Herausbildungen von Nationalstaaten) relativen Autonomie der ersten bürgerlichen Konstitutionsprozesse vollziehen sich diese in einer vom Weltmarkt abhängigen Dynamik. Und die einzelnen nationalstaatlichen Entwicklungen sind nicht nur abhängig von der jeweiligen außenhandelspolitischen Machtposition, sondern auch von dem technologischen und wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt der merkantil führenden Nationen. Deshalb ist es nicht nur falsch, die Analyse der Entwicklung der kapitalistischen Produktion in England als generelles historisches Ablaufmodell für diesen Entwicklungsprozeß zu interpretieren, wie dies in mißverstandenem Anschluß an Marx vielfach geschehen ist; es ist ebenso verhängnisvoll, die Entwicklung der Staatsfunktionen und die besonders deutlich ausgeprägte souveräne Außenrepräsentanz, wie wir sie in England beobachten, als ein derartiges Muster zu begreifen. Denn was in England aus der Dynamik der nationalen ökonomischen Kräfte heraus zur Entstehung kam, das ist anderswo ganz bewußt den Briten abgeschaut worden, um international konkurrenzfähiger zu werden. Ebenso wie etwa Friedrich der Große das französische Steuersystem samt französischen Beamten in sein Land importierte, um bestimmte Entwicklungsrückstände aufzuholen, haben auch andere Herrscher eine bewußte Politik der Imitation auslän-discher Errungenschaften verfolgt. Derartige Übernahmen lassen sich vielfach auf-zeigen, und sie sind zumeist begleitet von einer lebhaften Diskussion über ihre politisch-ökonomische Brauchbarkeit. Analytisch sind sie zu werten als eine durch die internationale. Konkurrenzsituation hervorgerufene Beschleunigung der Entwicklung bestimmter Staatsfunktionen in den nachhinkenden Ländern. Daß die strukturbestimmende Wirkung des Weltmarkts bereits in der Kon-stitutionsphase des bürgerlichen Staates sich entfaltet hat, gehört zu den in der Staatstheorie bislang vernachlässigten Aspekten. Soweit sich diese Feststellung auf den allgemeinen Basis-Überbau-Ansatz bezieht, ist festzuhalten, daß dieser fälschli-cherweise vielfach tradiert wurde als Ansatz zur Analyse nationaler Systeme unter Absehung von deren internationalen Bestimmungen. Die staatliche Souveränität nach außen wird aber als politisches und juristisches Problem erst gesetzt durch die Konkurrenzbeziehungen, in deren Rahmen sie zu bestimmen ist. Die Bedeutung der internationalen Konkurrenz für den konkreten national-staatlichen Konstitutionsprozeß läßt sich dokumentieren durch deskriptive Einzel-analysen. Systematisch ergibt sie sich im hier vorgetragenen Erklärungsansatz jedoch bereits aus dem konstitutiven Charakter der Außenfunktion. Denn diese kam zustande ja nur als die (macht-)staatliche Vertretung merkantiler Interessen, von Interessen also, welche sich entfalteten in einem ökonomischen Weltbild, das unter damaligen Produktionsbedingungen mit Recht davon ausging, daß des einen Gewinn unweigerlich des anderen Verlust bedeuten müsse. ”翻译为中文","output":"国家的财政问题不仅影响到税收和关税机构的运作，它们尤其带来了国家层面的计算问题。因此，国家军力的发展伴随着国王的私人金库与国家财库的分离，国家预算的计算，以及国民收入的初步估算（36）。有充分理由将商业系统理论称为“政治算术”（37）。 这种国家会计既是资产阶级国家形成过程中第二个财政政策组成部分——即作为国家经济发展手段的国家债务系统化政策的前提，也是其障碍（38）。过去诸侯家族是一些私人银行家的债务人，而现在所需的信贷量不仅超出了大多数私人可能性，为世界范围内的商业和军事企业筹集信贷必须主要摆脱那些偶然的、依赖于个别商业家权力政治的特性（39）。 因此，在18世纪的大多数欧洲国家（后来还包括美国）形成了一种金融体系，其中公共信贷、国家债务和债务重组的正确配比被认为是一门艺术。中央政府为资产阶级社会承担经济职能的接管可以从围绕建立国家银行的斗争中看出（40）。因为作为调节国家债务的工具，它成为围绕国家对国家财富增长意义的争论的中心（41）。虽然Dickson可能过分强调了这种联系，认为法国在大革命中君主制的倒台是因为自柯尔贝以来法国的公共财政体系没有进一步发展的结果，但如果他将英国殖民战争的成功也归因于英国最为先进的国家债务制度（其显著特征是长期与短期国家债务的平衡关系和系统性债务重组计划的发展（42）），那么他的观点是值得赞同的。公共债券市场的促成一方面是殖民贸易资本积累成功的前提，同时它也最终破坏了仍在持续的中世纪利息禁令观念——这一点作为资本主义发展的意识形态前提，不容低估。 最初，国家债务制度主要用于资助国家在商业利益中的企业，但在这个背景下产生的信贷系统对私人企业的融资也变得越来越重要。这一发展明显与国家的商业地位有关。因为早在16世纪，就可以观察到资本被转移到那些预期能获得最高利润的国家。通过这个提示，我们对信贷供应与外国贸易地位和早期转向资本主义生产方式之间的关系给出了说明。 形成中的世界市场不仅在国际资本转移中找到了表现形式。至少自16世纪起，可以观察到有意识地评估外国经验和获取外国专业知识的政策。因此，不仅将意大利专家召至荷兰和法国以发展那里的银行业和交易所以及丝织业（43），外国商人和银行家也进入了意大利的大型商业银行学习（44）。无论是在私人还是国家层面，我们日益观察到有意识地采用其他国家的财政和经济政策工具或机构（45）。在分析各国历史发展时，必须考虑到此类传播过程。 这一提示旨在防止对资产阶级国家形成的解释方法被误解为具体国家发展过程的历史顺序模型。尽管与历史上后来形成的民族国家相比，最初的资产阶级构成进程相对自主，但它们发生在依赖于世界市场的动态中。而且，各国的国家发展不仅依赖于其外贸政策地位，也依赖于商业领先国家的技术和科学进步。因此，将英国资本主义生产发展的分析解读为这一发展过程的一般历史模型并不正确，这一点通过对马克思的误解已经在很大程度上发生；将英国国家职能的发展以及我们在英国观察到的特别明显的主权对外代表作为这样的模式也同样是错误的。因为在英国，一些东西是基于国家经济力量的动态自然产生的，而在其他地方，则是非常有意识地模仿英国以提高国际竞争力。正如腓特烈大帝将法国的税收系统连同法国官员引入他的国家一样，以期赶上某些发展滞后的领域，其他统治者也追求了模仿外国成就的明确政策。这种模仿在很多情况下可以看出，并且往往伴随着对其政治经济适用性的热烈讨论。从分析角度来看，这些被视为国际竞争情况加速了落后国家某些国家职能发展的事实。 国际市场在资产阶级国家形成阶段就已经展现出其结构性影响力，这是至今在国家理论中被忽视的方面之一。就这种发现涉及的一般基础与上层建筑方法论而言，需要注意的是，该方法错误地被广泛传承为在忽视其国际决定因素的情况下分析国家系统的方法。但通过所处竞争关系框架来确定的对外国家主权问题才是被设置为政治和法律问题的。"},{"instruction":"edge-tts这个库，有没有办法，让chatgpt返回的文字，随时生成语音啊","output":"是的，可以使用\`edge-tts\`这个库使 ChatGPT 返回的文字转换成语音。\`edge-tts\`库是一个Python库，它通过微软的Text-to-Speech(TTS)服务，使文本转换成语音变得简单。要实现让ChatGPT返回的文字随时生成语音，你需要执行以下步骤： 1. **安装\`edge-tts\`:** 首先，你需要确保你的环境中安装了\`edge-tts\`。通过pip安装通常是最简单的方式： \`\`\`bash pip install edge-tts \`\`\` 2. **使用ChatGPT:** 你可以通过OpenAI提供的API或使用本地模型（如GPT-Neo等），获取到ChatGPT的回复。具体实现取决于你的应用场景和所拥有的资源。 3. **生成语音:** 当你获得了ChatGPT的回复之后，你可以使用\`edge-tts\`将这些回复转换成语音。以下是一个简单的示例 explaining 如何使用\`edge-tts\`: \`\`\`python from edge_tts import TTSClient text_from_chatgpt = \\"这是从ChatGPT返回的文本\\" # 假设这是从ChatGPT获取的文本回复 tts_client = TTSClient() # 创建TTS Client实例 # 将文本转换成语音并保存到文件 audio_data = tts_client.speak(text_from_chatgpt) with open(\\"output.mp3\\", \\"wb\\") as f: f.write(audio_data) # 接下来，你可以播放这个mp3文件，或根据需要进一步处理。 \`\`\` 请注意，使用微软的TTS服务时，你可能需要网络连接，并注意可能存在的API使用限制和费用。 **重要提示:** 示例代码仅用于教育目的，确保在实现时符合适用的法律法规，并尊重用户隐私和数据安全性。此外，\`edge-tts\`库和其API调用细节可能会随时间更新和变化，因此建议查看最新的文档和资源。"},{"instruction":"Simulate a city.
