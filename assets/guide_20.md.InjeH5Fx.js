The program aims to provide fresh food for long space missions.","output":"Astronauts Make History by Growing Lettuce in Space NASA has taken a significant step forward in ensuring the health and wellbeing of its astronauts during prolonged space missions. For the first time ever, lettuce has been successfully grown in space. The breakthrough was achieved through the Veggie program, NASA's effort to provide fresh, nutrient-rich food for astronauts during long-term space exploration. The lettuce was cultivated using hydroponics, a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions instead of soil. The team used LED lights to simulate sunlight, and a nutrient-rich water solution to mimic soil. The experiment was carried out on board the International Space Station (ISS) under controlled conditions. The Veggie program's objective is to provide a sustainable supply of fresh food for astronauts, thereby reducing the amount of packaged and processed food consumed in space. The program is also intended to improve the astronauts' nutritional intake, helping to safeguard their health during long missions. Proper nutrition is especially important for extended space missions that can take a toll on the body's immune system. The lettuce grown in space was not consumed but returned to Earth for testing. Scientists analyzed the samples for bacteria and compared them to lettuce grown on Earth. They found no significant differences in the levels of bacteria, indicating that the lettuce was safe to eat. Future missions could eventually see the lettuce grown in space to provide astronauts with fresh produce.

The successful cultivation of lettuce in space is a stepping stone towards a healthier and more sustainable future for space travel. It is yet another testament to the incredible work that NASA is doing in exploring new horizons and pushing the limits of human knowledge and understanding."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following highlights: The impact of social media on mental health. Negative effects such as increased anxiety and decreased selfesteem. Tips for using social media in a healthy way to avoid these negative effects. Discussion of online communities and support groups for mental health.","output":"Social media has undeniably transformed the way that people communicate and share information. While it can be a great tool for staying connected with friends and loved ones, it can also have negative effects on mental health. Increased anxiety and decreased self-esteem are among the most common negative effects associated with social media usage. However, it is possible to use social media in a healthy way, and there are online communities and support groups that can provide help and support. One of the biggest negative impacts of social media on mental health is the increase in anxiety it can cause. Constant comparisons to others, as well as the pressure to present an idealized version of oneself online, can cause feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Similarly, social media can contribute to a decreased sense of self-esteem, as users often compare themselves to others who seem to have more perfect lives. To avoid these negative effects, it is important to use social media in a healthy way. One of the best things you can do is limit your time spent on social media. Try setting a timer for how long you’ll spend scrolling each day, and make sure to take regular breaks. Additionally, it can be helpful to change your mindset when using social media. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on sharing and connecting with others in a positive way. Another healthy way to use social media is to participate in online communities and support groups. There are many groups online for people struggling with mental health issues, and these can be a great source of comfort and support. It’s important to remember that while social media can be helpful in connecting with others, it should not replace face-to-face interactions with friends and family. In conclusion, social media can have negative effects on mental health, but it is possible to use it in a healthy way. By limiting your time online, changing your mindset, and participating in supportive online communities, you can mitigate the negative effects of social media and maintain good mental health."},{"instruction":"a heartwarming story with brilliant performances from its cast, making it a mustwatch for all ages","output":"Must-watch heartwarming story with brilliant performances from the cast for all ages."},{"instruction":"w can you clean and organize your closet efficiently?","output":"To clean and organize your closet efficiently, follow these steps: 1.

In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll pigments and water is split into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons. This process releases energy that is stored in the form of ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent reactions, the ATP and NADPH generated in the previous stage are used to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose.

The practice has numerous health benefits for both the body and the mind. In terms of physical benefits, yoga can help improve strength, flexibility, balance, and endurance. One of the main physical benefits of yoga is increased strength. Unlike traditional weightlifting or resistance training, yoga uses body weight to strengthen muscles. This allows for a more balanced and functional approach to building strength. Yoga also targets all areas of the body, including the core, which can help improve overall physical performance. Another physical benefit of yoga is improved flexibility. Many yoga poses require the body to stretch and extend, which can help increase range of motion and reduce muscle stiffness. This increased flexibility can help prevent injury and improve posture. In addition to the physical benefits, yoga is also known for its mental benefits. One of the main mental benefits of yoga is stress reduction. Yoga encourages mindfulness and relaxation through breathing techniques and meditation. This can help reduce cortisol levels in the body, which is a hormone that is commonly associated with stress. Yoga can also help improve mental clarity and focus. The mindfulness aspect of yoga can help individuals become more aware of their thoughts and emotions, and can help them better cope with stressful situations. This can ultimately lead to an improved overall sense of well-being. In conclusion, yoga has numerous health benefits for both the body and the mind. The physical benefits include increased strength and flexibility, while the mental benefits include stress reduction and improved mental clarity. Whether practiced in a studio or at home, yoga offers a holistic approach to improving overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Find the value of x in the equation 2x 4 = 6x + 14.","output":"Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get: 2x = 6x + 18 Subtracting 6x from both sides, we get: -4x = 18 Dividing both sides by -4, we get: x = -4.5 Therefore, the value of x in the equation 2x - 4 = 6x + 14 is -4.5."},{"instruction":"What is the subject line for this email?

The temperature reached a staggering 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius). This record-breaking temperature was measured by a meteorologist named Charles B. Thornton using a standard thermometer at the time. The location where this record temperature was recorded is significant. Furnace Creek Ranch is located in Death Valley, which is a desert area known for its extreme heat. Death Valley is located east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California and is home to the lowest point in North America, which lies at 282 feet below sea level. The combination of the location's low elevation, lack of vegetation, and the sun’s direct exposure, make it a perfect setup for extreme temperature readings. Since the highest recorded temperature in 1913, many other places in the world have recorded temperatures approaching this level, although none have officially surpassed the 1913 record. For example, in 1931, Kebili, Tunisia, recorded a temperature of 131 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius), and in 2016, Mitribah, Kuwait, recorded a temperature of 129 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius). Despite this, the Furnace Creek Ranch record from 1913 remains the highest recorded temperature in history. Extreme temperatures can be dangerous and pose severe health risks to humans and animals, including heat stroke or heat exhaustion, dehydration, and even death. Understanding the dangers of extreme heat is important, and precautions should be taken to stay safe, especially during summer months. It's essential to stay hydrated, avoid extended exposure to direct sunlight, and limit outdoor activities in the hottest parts of the day to prevent heat-related illnesses. In conclusion, the highest recorded temperature in history stands at 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius), recorded on July 10, 1913, at Furnace Creek Ranch, California. Even though many other places have recorded temperatures approaching this level, none have surpassed this record.

Research the impact of rising temperatures and increasing weather extremes on plant and animal populations. Include data on efforts to mitigate these effects.","output":"Report on the Effects of Climate Change on Local Ecosystems Climate change is having a considerable impact on local ecosystems around the world. Rising temperatures and increasing weather extremes are causing significant changes in plant and animal populations, disturbing natural habitats, and altering the biodiversity of many regions. This report explores the effects of climate change on local ecosystems, including the impact on plant and animal populations, and summarizes efforts to mitigate these effects. Impact on Plants Rising temperatures are causing a shift in plant species by forcing them to migrate to more suitable habitats that have a suitable climate. As a result, plant populations are also moving towards higher elevations, taking advantage of space opened up by retreating glaciers. This shift is causing changes in plant communities, affecting food webs and altering natural vegetation patterns. Also, changes in precipitation patterns are impacting plant germination, growth, and distribution, causing a decline in crop yields and natural plant populations. Impact on Animals Climate change is also affecting animal populations by altering their behaviors, migration patterns, and habitats. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affecting food availability and affecting the timing of seasonal events such as pollination, migration, and hibernation. Also, rising temperatures are causing natural predators to change their hunting and feeding habits, which is causing ecosystem imbalances that could have catastrophic effects on local ecosystems. Mitigating the Effects of Climate Change Efforts to reduce the impact of climate change on local ecosystems include conservation programs, research, and education campaigns. A major focus is on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow the pace of global warming. Governments, private firms, and individuals are promoting green energy initiatives and investing in renewable energy resources like solar, wind, and hydropower. Growing food in controlled environments is also becoming popular, as these can provide a reliable source of food, despite weather extremes and other environmental pressures. Conclusion Climate change is threatening local ecosystems across the world, and there is an urgent need for mitigation efforts to prevent natural habitats from collapsing. While it is clear that much still needs to be done, there are many initiatives in existence to mitigating the effects of climate change. Through collective action and investment in the necessary resources, it is possible to reduce the impact of climate change and preserve local ecosystems."},{"instruction":"What are some ways to improve your public speaking skills?","output":"Practice regularly, prepare and organize your content, make eye contact, use confident body language, use visual aids, speak clearly and at a moderate pace, engage your audience, and seek feedback and constructive criticism."},{"instruction":"The burgers here are alright, but nothing special.

Since October, Brazil has reported over 4,100 cases of microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads. This has led to the country declaring a state of emergency. The virus is believed to have originated in Uganda and quickly spread to other parts of Africa and Asia before making its way to South America. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a global warning about the virus, urging governments to take action to prevent its spread. Symptoms of Zika virus infection include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, and in most cases, the illness is mild and clears up within a week. However, the virus can cause serious complications in pregnant women, leading to birth defects in their babies. There is currently no vaccine available for the virus, meaning that prevention is focused on controlling the mosquito population that spreads the virus. Brazil has taken a number of measures to combat the spread of the virus. Thousands of troops have been deployed to go door-to-door to help eliminate breeding sites for mosquitoes, and insecticides have been sprayed in public spaces. The government has also launched a campaign urging people to take measures to prevent mosquito bites, such as using insect repellent and covering up in long-sleeved clothing. The Zika virus outbreak is a growing threat, and the WHO has called on all countries to work together to prevent its spread. This includes implementing measures to control mosquito populations, increasing surveillance and reporting of cases, and developing a vaccine to protect against the virus. In conclusion, the Zika virus outbreak is a serious public health concern, and preventative measures must be taken to control its spread. Anyone who believes they may have been infected should seek medical attention immediately, and pregnant women should take extra precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. By working together, we can take steps to prevent the spread of this dangerous virus."},{"instruction":"Mark had been practicing guitar for months. He had a big gig coming up and was nervous.

Many countries are reintroducing mask mandates and social distancing rules to slow the spread of the virus. Vaccinations are still the best way to protect against the virus.","output":"Title: COVID-19 Cases Rise Again: Why Vaccinations Are Essential COVID-19 has continued to pose a threat around the globe since its outbreak early last year. With new highly contagious strains of the virus, such as the Delta variant now spreading, health officials are expressing concerns as the number of cases rise again. In many parts of the world, mask mandates and social distancing rules have been reintroduced in an attempt to curb the spread. The Delta variant is believed to be more infectious than previous strains, and it is thought to be responsible for a rise in cases in many countries, including the UK and the US. The CDC director has referred to this variant as a \\"pandemic within a pandemic,\\" and it is proving to be an unwelcome development in the fight against the virus. While masks and social distancing can help to slow the spread of the virus, the most effective method of protection against COVID-19 remains vaccination. The vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies have shown to be effective against the Delta variant, and studies suggest that fully vaccinated individuals are less likely to contract the virus or experience severe symptoms. However, reaching herd immunity is a challenge as vaccine hesitancy and misinformation continue to spread. To overcome this challenge, more education and outreach efforts should be made to help individuals understand the importance of vaccinations. Trusted sources of information, such as healthcare providers, community leaders, and public health officials, need to work together to encourage and facilitate vaccine uptake. In conclusion, as cases rise again due to the Delta variant, it is crucial to emphasize that the best way to protect oneself against COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated. Communities must work together to promote vaccination and curb the spread of the virus. While mask mandates and social distancing are temporary solutions, vaccination provides long-term protection and is the key to overcoming this ongoing pandemic."},{"instruction":"Share your favorite recipe for a vegetarian dish.","output":"My favorite vegetarian dish is roasted vegetable quinoa bowl.

The WHO warns that e-cigarettes contain harmful chemicals that can cause damage to the lungs and are linked to cancer.

Additionally, individuals can take steps to protect themselves by avoiding the use of e-cigarettes altogether, or limiting their use to help quit traditional smoking.

The companies argue that classifying drivers as employees would hurt their business model.","output":"California Passes Bill to Require Uber and Lyft to Classify Drivers as Employees In a move that could have significant consequences for the gig economy industry, California lawmakers recently passed a bill that would require companies like Uber and Lyft to classify their drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. The decision came after a lengthy debate over the nature of work in the modern economy and the rights and protections that workers are entitled to. The bill, known as AB5, seeks to provide more benefits and protections to California’s gig workers, including drivers for ride-hailing companies. The law would require these companies to offer their drivers minimum wage, overtime pay, workers’ compensation, and other employment benefits that are currently enjoyed by traditional employees. Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide greater workplace security and stability for workers who currently lack these protections. However, companies like Uber and Lyft have vehemently opposed the bill, arguing that it would hurt their business model and lead to decreased flexibility for drivers. They claim that most drivers prefer the freedom to set their own schedules and work when and where they choose, which would be threatened by being classified as employees. In addition, they argue that the cost of providing employee benefits to their drivers could lead to increased fares and decreased demand for their services. The passage of AB5 in California could have ripple effects throughout the gig economy industry, as other states and countries may adopt similar laws in the future. It may also prompt companies to rethink their business models and explore alternative ways of contracting with their workers.

Include expert quotes and statistics to support your argument.","output":"A plant-based diet has gained popularity in recent years due to its various benefits. This type of diet primarily focuses on consuming plant-based food items such as vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds while avoiding or limiting meat and animal products. Here are some notable benefits of a plant-based diet. Improved Heart Health: A plant-based diet significantly lowers the risk of heart disease by reducing bad cholesterol levels. According to Dr. Kim Williams, past president of the American College of Cardiology, “A plant-based diet will prevent and often reverse cardiovascular disease.” A study conducted by the American Heart Association revealed that those who eat a plant-based diet have a lower risk of developing heart disease by approximately 20% than those who consume meat. Reduced Cancer Risk: Several studies have shown that consuming a plant-based diet can lower the risk of certain types of cancer. According to the World Health Organization, eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can protect against cancer. The American Institute for Cancer Research recommends eating a plant-based diet to help reduce the risk of cancer. Weight Loss: Studies have found that people who follow a plant-based diet tend to weigh less than meat-eaters. A study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of South Carolina found that vegetarians have an average body mass index (BMI) of 23.6, while meat-eaters have an average BMI of 28.8. Improved Digestion: A plant-based diet helps with digestion and prevents digestive issues such as constipation, bloating, and indigestion. Plant-based foods have high fiber content, which helps in promoting a healthy digestive system. In conclusion, a plant-based diet is not only beneficial for improving heart health, reducing the risk of cancer and weight loss, but it also promotes healthy digestion. By consuming a plant-based diet, one can lead a healthy life. As Dr. Joel Fuhrman, a physician and plant-based nutrition expert, states, “A diet rich in plant-based nutrition is so powerful; it can prevent chronic diseases and help those with chronic conditions to heal.”"},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence that lacks proper punctuatio","output":"im sorry i cannot do that"},{"instruction":"Combine these three words to create a sentence: music, festival, crowd","output":"The music festival drew a large crowd."},{"instruction":"Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States, serving two terms from 20092017.

This process occurs in three stages: 1. Glycolysis: Glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and yields a small amount of ATP. 2. Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle): Pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria and is converted into a molecule called acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is then further broken down in a series of reactions that release energy and generate ATP. 3. Electron transport chain: During this stage, electrons from the Krebs cycle are passed through a series of protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As this occurs, energy is released and used to pump protons across the membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient is then used to generate ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, cellular respiration allows cells to convert the energy stored in glucose into a form that can be used to power cellular processes."},{"instruction":"Add the missing apostrophe in the following sentence: The girls basketball team won the championship.","output":"The girls' basketball team won the championship."},{"instruction":"for making homemade candle","output":"1.

The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill has gone through its second reading in the House of Commons, despite widespread opposition and protests. The proposed legislation seeks to grant police officers more powers to break up peaceful protests and impose stiffer penalties on demonstrators who cause disruptions or damage property. Those opposed to the bill claim that it could undermine civil liberties in the country, while supporters argue that it will help maintain public order and prevent violence. Critics have expressed concern that the bill's provisions could be used to target marginalized groups and further silence dissent.

The news of Bezos' departure has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, as many speculate about what it means for Amazon's future. Bezos has been the driving force behind Amazon's success, growing the company from an online bookstore to a technology giant that dominates the e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming industries.

Jassy has been with the company for more than 20 years and has been instrumental in growing AWS into a 40 billion business. Some analysts believe that Bezos' departure could signal a change in direction for Amazon, as Jassy is known for his expertise in cloud computing.

One of the best ways to achieve this is by creating a list of tasks to complete for the day, prioritizing them in order of importance, and tackling them one by one throughout the day. To start, take a few minutes in the morning to jot down all the tasks that need to be completed. This can be done on paper or through a digital app or platform, whichever works best for you. Be sure to include everything that needs to be done, both big and small. Next, prioritize the tasks based on their level of importance. Ask yourself which tasks are the most urgent or have the biggest impact on your goals. Aim to tackle those tasks first before moving on to others. Once you have your list in order, begin tackling each task one by one. Resist the urge to multitask or jump from task to task, as this can decrease productivity and increase stress levels. Instead, focus on completing one task at a time and move to the next item only once the previous task is completed. Throughout the day, be sure to take regular breaks and give yourself permission to step away from work for a few minutes. This can help you recharge and refocus, ultimately helping you get more done in the long run. By following these steps, you can create a productive and efficient routine for each day. Keep in mind that priorities and tasks may shift throughout the day, so be flexible and adjust your list as needed.

Invasion of Poland: On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, which led to the outbreak of the war.

The individual scutes as shown above have specific names and are generally consistent across the various species of turtles. Terrestrial tortoises do not shed their scutes. New scutes grow by the addition of keratin layers to the base of each scute. Aquatic chelonii shed individual scutes. The scute effectively forms the skin over the underlying bony structures; there is a very thin layer of subcutaneous tissue between the scute and the skeleton. The scutes can be brightly colored in some species, but the basal color is a grey to dark brown color dorsally; the plastral scutes are often white to yellow in base color. A turtle's shell consists of three rows of scutes, numbering 4, 9, and 25 from the inside out. These are the squares of the first three prime numbers, viz. 2, 3, and 5. Moustakas-Verho and Cherepanov's embryological study reveals that the patterning of the plastral scutes appear independent from the patterning of carapacial scutes, suggesting that the carapace and plastron evolved separately."},{"instruction":"hode island the smallest state in americ","output":"Rhode Island (/roʊd/ ( listen)), officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the United States.

It is shown in \`\`E-mail Surveillance'' that Dwight and Angela have begun a romantic relationship. Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him, she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight's passion for her. Their relationship is seemingly summarized in \`\`A.A.R.M.'': when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses \`\`how loudly I love you'', Angela meekly whispers \`\`It's too loud.'' In \`\`Traveling Salesman'' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate, so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them. After Dwight is told he would be fired if he didn't tell Michael why he went to New York, he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela. Angela later tells Michael what happened, but still doesn't reveal their relationship. In \`\`Fun Run'' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles, who is feeling sick, but Dwight kills it, which causes Angela to break up with him. After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4, she stops dating Dwight, but at the end of \`\`Goodbye Toby'' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight. Dwight ends their affair in \`\`The Duel'' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy.

The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together, but in \`\`Happy Hour'', Dwight hooks up with Pam's friend Isabel, and tells Angela he doesn't want her to have his baby. In \`\`The Chump'' the two call in a lawyer, and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times. She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton. After she gives birth (Jury Duty), Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he, not Robert, is the father. Angela and Dwight go through a paternity test and in \`\`New Guys'' it is revealed that Dwight is not Philip's father. In \`\`A.A.R.M.'' Dwight proposes to Angela, and she accepts. She then tells Dwight that she lied before and Dwight is Philip's father.

The tropical rain belt is an area of active rain that is positioned mostly around the tropics. According to the website Journey North, the reason the rain belt is situated near the tropics can be attributed to the fact that most of the sun's radiation is directed toward the equator, which is located in the middle of the tropics. This solar radiation generates large amounts of heat near the equator providing tropical regions with higher temperatures than most other regions on Earth."},{"instruction":"mountain standard time the same as pacific standard time","output":"In the United States and Canada, this time zone is generically called Mountain Time (MT).

Some define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral having only one pair of parallel sides (the exclusive definition), thereby excluding parallelograms. Others define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides (the inclusive definition), making the parallelogram a special type of trapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher mathematics such as calculus. The former definition would make such concepts as the trapezoidal approximation to a definite integral ill-defined. This article uses the inclusive definition and considers parallelograms as special cases of a trapezoid. This is also advocated in the taxonomy of quadrilaterals."},{"instruction":"has the us open ever been won over par","output":"U.S. Open play is characterized by tight scoring at or around par by the leaders, with the winner usually emerging at around even par. A U.S. Open course is seldom beaten severely, and there have been many over-par wins (in part because par is usually set at 70, except for the very longest courses). Normally, an Open course is quite long and will have a high cut of primary rough (termed \`\`Open rough'' by the American press and fans); undulating greens (such as at Pinehurst No. 2 in 2005, which was described by Johnny Miller of NBC as \`\`like trying to hit a ball on top of a VW Beetle''); pinched fairways (especially on what are expected to be less difficult holes); and two or three holes that are short par fives under regular play would be used as long par fours during the tournament (often to meet that frequently used par of 70, forcing players to have accurate long drives). Some courses that are attempting to get into the rotation for the U.S. Open will undergo renovations to develop these features. Rees Jones is the most notable of the \`\`Open Doctors'' who take on these projects; his father Robert Trent Jones had filled that role earlier. As with any professional golf tournament, the available space surrounding the course (for spectators, among other considerations) and local infrastructure also factor into deciding which courses will host the event."},{"instruction":"was there really a band called eddie and the cruiser","output":"Only two cast members, Michael \`\`Tunes'' Antunes, the tenor saxophone player for John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, and backup singer Helen Schneider were professional musicians in the fictional band."},{"instruction":"patrick's cathedral in new york catholic","output":"The Cathedral of St. Patrick (commonly called St. Patrick's Cathedral) is a decorated Neo-Gothic-style Roman Catholic cathedral church in the United States and a prominent landmark of New York City.

The 1717 quake appears to have involved a rupture along nearly 400 kilometres (250 mi) of the southern two thirds of the fault. Scientists say that a similar earthquake could happen at any time as the interval since 1717 is longer than between the earlier events. Newer research carried out by the University of Otago and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation revised the dates of the pre-1717 earthquakes to between 1535 and 1596 (instead of 1620), 1374 and 1405 (instead of 1430), and 1064 and 1120 (instead of 1100).

Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months.

The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of its titular character (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted, good-natured and athletically prodigious man from Alabama. Gump witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States, specifically the period between his birth in 1944 and 1982. The film differs substantially from Winston Groom's novel, including Gump's personality and several events that were depicted."},{"instruction":"an a franchise be considered a small busine","output":"Franchising is a way for small business owners to benefit from the economies of scale of the big corporation (franchiser). McDonald's and Subway are examples of a franchise. The small business owner can leverage a strong brand name and purchasing power of the larger company while keeping their own investment affordable. However, some franchisees conclude that they suffer the \`\`worst of both worlds'' feeling they are too restricted by corporate mandates and lack true independence. It is an assumption that small business are just franchisees, but the truth is many franchisers are also small businesses, Although considered to be a successful way of doing business, literature has proved that there is a high failure rate in franchising as well, especially in UK, where research indicates that out of 1658 franchising companies operating in 1984, only 601 remained in 1998, a mere 36%."},{"instruction":"he oceanic crust part of the lithosphere","output":"Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. This is because the chemically differentiated oceanic crust is lighter than asthenosphere, but thermal contraction of the mantle lithosphere makes it more dense than the asthenosphere. The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at subduction zones, oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. The oldest parts of continental lithosphere underlie cratons, and the mantle lithosphere there is thicker and less dense than typical; the relatively low density of such mantle \`\`roots of cratons'' helps to stabilize these regions."},{"instruction":"friday the 13th the game 2 player","output":"The game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game, pitting up to seven players controlling Camp Crystal Lake counselors against one player controlling Jason Voorhees.

Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. These irregularities act in the same manner as the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences."},{"instruction":"an you cross the atlantic in a helicopter","output":"Between 31 May and 1 June 1967, two HH-3Es of the United States Air Force made the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean by helicopter.

The BBC estimates that women--half of the global population--need to use feminine hygiene products for about a week each month for about 30 years.

Similar provisions were made for biological weapons. After this Act was passed by the Labour government of David Lange, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand.

The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers, while many leading American senators were quoted as expressing a deep sense of betrayal.

At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later after the events of the \`\`Red Wedding'', Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother's head, when Tyrion and Tywin are outraged. Tyrion threatens Joffrey once again, and later Joffrey turns on Tywin, who responds by commanding Joffrey to be sent to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin. During his wedding feast in the throne room, he presents an extremely offensive play of \`\`The War of the Five Kings, '' with each of the kings played by dwarves, to humiliate his uncle. He also repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, forcing the former to be his cupbearer. At the conclusion of the dinner, however, Joffrey's wine is poisoned, and he dies in an event known as \`\`The Purple Wedding,'' in which Tyrion is falsely accused and arrested by Cersei in A Storm of Swords (2000). It is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators, with assistance from royal fool Ser Dontos Hollard, who successfully smuggles Tyrion's wife Sansa out of King's Landing before either of them can be caught and tried for Joffrey's murder."},{"instruction":"a square foot the same as a foo","output":"The square foot (plural square feet; abbreviated sq ft, sf, ft) is an imperial unit and U.S. customary unit (non-SI, non-metric) of area, used mainly in the United States and partially in Bangladesh, Canada, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.

The limbic system is where the subcortical structures meet the cerebral cortex. The limbic system operates by influencing the endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system. It is highly interconnected with the nucleus accumbens, which plays a role in sexual arousal and the \`\`high'' derived from certain recreational drugs. These responses are heavily modulated by dopaminergic projections from the limbic system. In 1954, Olds and Milner found that rats with metal electrodes implanted into their nucleus accumbens, as well as their septal nuclei, repeatedly pressed a lever activating this region, and did so in preference to eating and drinking, eventually dying of exhaustion. The limbic system also includes the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical structures that direct intentional movements. The basal ganglia are located near the thalamus and hypothalamus. They receive input from the cerebral cortex, which sends outputs to the motor centers in the brain stem. A part of the basal ganglia called the striatum controls posture and movement. Recent studies indicate that, if there is an inadequate supply of dopamine, the striatum is affected, which can lead to visible behavioral symptoms of Parkinson's disease."},{"instruction":"la vie en rose a love song","output":"The lyrics and melody of the song were written by Édith Piaf herself, but the melody was said officially to have been composed and registered by Louiguy only, since at the time, due to the stringent registration requirements of SACEM, Piaf did not have the necessary qualifications to be able to copyright her work with SACEM.

Initially, Piaf's peers and songwriting team did not think the song would be successful, finding it weaker than the rest of her repertoire. Heeding their advice, the singer put the song aside, only to change her mind the next year. The song was performed live in concert for the first time in 1946.

Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed from office. Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of any other justice. However, the Chief Justice--when in the majority--decides who writes the court's opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. While a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously, decisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one single vote, thereby exposing the justices' ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories.

This is variously known as distilled spirit, \`\`virgin'' vinegar, or white vinegar, and is used in cooking, baking, meat preservation, and pickling, as well as for medicinal, laboratory, and cleaning purposes. The most common starting material in some regions, because of its low cost, is malt, or in the United States, corn. It is sometimes derived from petroleum. Distilled vinegar in the UK is produced by the distillation of malt to give a clear vinegar which maintains some of the malt flavour.

Small in stature and slow-growing, the Venus flytrap tolerates fire well, and depends on periodic burning to suppress its competition. Fire suppression threatens its future in the wild. It survives in wet sandy and peaty soils. Although it has been successfully transplanted and grown in many locales around the world, it is native only to the coastal bogs of North and South Carolina in the United States, specifically within a 100-kilometer (60 mi) radius of Wilmington, North Carolina. One such place is North Carolina's Green Swamp. There also appears to be a naturalized population of Venus flytraps in northern Florida as well as an introduced population in western Washington. The nutritional poverty of the soil is the reason that the plant relies on such elaborate traps: insect prey provide the nitrogen for protein formation that the soil cannot. The Venus flytrap is not a tropical plant and can tolerate mild winters. In fact, Venus flytraps that do not go through a period of winter dormancy will weaken and die after a period of time."},{"instruction":"fannie mae and freddie mac the same","output":"The federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was the placing into conservatorship of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) by the U.S. Treasury in September 2008.

It began moving north, at about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) per year, and is believed to have begun colliding with Asia as early as 55 million years ago, in the Eocene epoch of the Cenozoic. However, some authors suggest that the collision between India and Eurasia occurred much later, around 35 million years ago. If the collision occurred between 55 and 50 Mya, the Indian Plate would have covered a distance of 3,000 to 2,000 kilometres (1,900 to 1,200 mi), moving faster than any other known plate. In 2012, paleomagnetic data from the Greater Himalaya was used to propose two collisions to reconcile the discrepancy between the amount of crustal shortening in the Himalaya (~1300 km) and the amount of convergence between India and Asia (~3600 km). These authors propose a continental fragment of northern Gondwana rifted from India, traveled northward, and initiated the \`\`soft collision'' between the Greater Himalaya and Asia at ~50 Ma. This was followed by the \`\`hard collision'' between India and Asia occurred at ~25 Ma. Subduction of the resulting ocean basin that formed between the Greater Himalayan fragment and India explains the apparent discrepancy between the crustal shortening estimates in the Himalaya and paleomagnetic data from India and Asia."},{"instruction":"was 10 things i hate about you based on shakespeare","output":"10 Things I Hate About You is a 1999 American teen romantic comedy-drama film directed by Gil Junger and starring Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Larisa Oleynik.

However, many people still carry locking pocket knives especially when camping with no issues. He suggested carrying locking knives in checked luggage on airplanes, and on your person in trains and subways since they could be confiscated if found in a bag.

In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized). Egg white consists primarily of about 90% water into which is dissolved about 10% proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats), egg white contains almost no fat, and carbohydrate content is less than 1%. Egg whites contain about 56% of the protein in the egg.

In the common implementation, a gasoline engine is connected to a traditional transmission, which is in turn connected to an epicyclic gear system's planet carrier. An electric motor/generator is connected to the central \`\`sun'' gear, which is normally un-driven in typical epicyclic systems. Both sources of power can be fed into the transmission's output at the same time, splitting power between them. In common examples, between one-quarter and half of the engine's power can be fed into the sun gear. Depending on the implementation, the transmission in front of the epicyclic system may be greatly simplified, or eliminated completely. EVTs are capable of continuously modulating output/input speed ratios like mechanical CVTs, but offer the distinct benefit of being able to also apply power from two different sources to one output, as well as potentially reducing overall complexity dramatically."},{"instruction":"he new god of war related to the old one","output":"God of War is an action-adventure video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE).

Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental methodology has remained the same.

The act also restored the tea taxes within Britain that had been repealed in 1767, and left in place the three pence Townshend duty in the colonies. With this new tax burden driving up the price of British tea, sales plummeted. The company continued to import tea into Great Britain, however, amassing a huge surplus of product that no one would buy. For these and other reasons, by late 1772 the East India Company, one of Britain's most important commercial institutions, was in a serious financial crisis.

Fats are triglycerides, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when atrophy takes place, or during periods of starvation."},{"instruction":"he esophagus part of the digestive trac","output":"Chewing, in which food is mixed with saliva begins the process of digestion.

Cameron had planned to spend about six hours near the ocean floor exploring but decided to start the ascent to the surface after only 2 hours and 34 minutes.

The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner. Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is.

While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia, permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations,but the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South."},{"instruction":"e there any mervyn's stores still ope","output":"In 2006, Mervyn's had 189 stores in 10 states.

The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball."},{"instruction":"he postal code the same as the zip code","output":"A postal code (also known locally in various English-speaking countries throughout the world as a postcode, post code, Eircode, PIN code or ZIP code) is a series of letters or digits or both, sometimes including spaces or punctuation, included in a postal address for the purpose of sorting mail."},{"instruction":"an you wear colored visors in college football","output":"A more recent addition to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that the first player to use a protective visor Mark Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, and Under Armour, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon (who needed the visor because of a childhood eye injury). While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes in the case of a serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty."},{"instruction":"e there different types of red blood cell","output":"Red blood cells may be given as part of a blood transfusion.

Even when it is without its engine or without petrol, if it is moved down on an incline, even unintentionally, it can cause considerable damage and human injury.

As sometimes the driver of the vehicle is often a person of small means and injured person goes without adequate compensation, insurance of motor vehicle covering the third party risk is made compulsory in India and the Motor Vehicles Act provides that, vehicle should not be used in public place without having insurance policy covering third party risks. Third party risk means risk covered for bodily injury, death and damage of property of third party. Third party means any person except owner or passenger in the private vehicle.

Physicists have found that even passive observation of quantum phenomena (by changing the test apparatus and passively 'ruling out' all but one possibility), can actually change the measured result. A particularly famous example is the 1998 Weizmann experiment. The \`\`observer'' in this experiment -- a sophisticated electronic detector -- wasn't human. And yet, possibly because the word \`\`observer'' implies a person, such findings have led to a popular belief that a conscious mind can directly affect reality. The need for the \`\`observer'' to be conscious has been rejected by mainstream science as a misconception rooted in a poor understanding of the quantum wave function ψ and the quantum measurement process."},{"instruction":"does indiana have a stand your ground law","output":"The states that have legislatively adopted stand-your-ground laws are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming."},{"instruction":"he length always longer than the width","output":"In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object.
