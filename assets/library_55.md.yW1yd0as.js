The country had already been grappling with widespread corruption and state capture allegations prior to the global health crisis. However, the pandemic has exposed the extent of corruption within the government procurement process. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has acknowledged the negative impact of corruption on the country's development and has reiterated his commitment to take action against it. In August 2020, he launched an anti-corruption unit to investigate allegations of corruption related to COVID-19 relief funds. In October 2020, a report was released by the Auditor General of South Africa, which revealed irregularities in the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) worth R10.2 billion (684 million) by government departments and entities. This caused public outrage as it demonstrated how corrupt officials were taking advantage of the pandemic to enrich themselves at the expense of taxpayers. The government has since taken steps towards addressing the issue of corruption. In February 2021, President Ramaphosa signed the Public Procurement Bill into law, which aims to promote transparency and accountability in the procurement process. The bill also establishes a central procurement authority to oversee procurement processes across all government departments. However, there are still challenges facing the fight against corruption. Critics argue that there is a lack of political will to hold corrupt officials accountable, and that the judiciary system is not equipped to handle corruption cases effectively. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed immense pressure on the country's resources, making it more difficult to prioritize the fight against corruption. Despite these challenges, South Africa must continue to combat corruption in order to promote economic growth and development, and to restore public trust in the government. The country has made progress in its battle against corruption, but more work needs to be done to ensure that corrupt officials will be held accountable for their actions."},{"instruction":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

The company is under scrutiny after HUD Secretary Ben Carson filed a lawsuit against it on Wednesday. The accusation is that Facebook's ad system allows advertisers to target users based on their race, thereby violating the Fair Housing Act. As the news of the lawsuit spreads, many Facebook users are worried about the impact it will have on their accounts. They fear that Facebook may be forced to change its ad system, which could affect the way ads are shown to users. Facebook has responded to the accusations, stating that it is committed to fighting discrimination and that it has already made changes to its ad system to address the issue. However, this is not the first time Facebook has been accused of racial discrimination. In 2018, the company was grilled by Congress after it was revealed that Russian operatives had used its platform to target African American voters during the 2016 presidential campaign. The outcome of the HUD lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for Facebook and its users. If the company is found guilty of discrimination, it may be forced to pay hefty fines and make significant changes to its ad system. This could lead to a major overhaul of the platform and a loss of trust among its users. In the end, the story of Facebook and its racial discrimination accusations is still unfolding.

They are excited to have fun and bond, but some of them have reservations about the remote location and the rumors they've heard. - Character profiles: - Alice: the leader of the group, outgoing, adventurous, and flirtatious - Ben: Alice's boyfriend, handsome, athletic, and protective - Chris: the nerd of the group, smart, curious, and skeptical of supernatural stories - Danielle: the shy and sensitive friend, artistic, and intuitive - Ethan: the prankster of the group, funny, sarcastic, and a bit reckless - The cabin: a rustic two-story wooden house with a porch, a living room with a fireplace, a kitchen, a bathroom, and three bedrooms upstairs. The cabin is situated on a hill overlooking a dense forest and a small lake. There is a shed in the backyard and a trail leading deeper into the woods. - Strange dreams: on their first night, the friends have weird dreams that involve a mysterious woman in a white dress, an old diary, and a warning about the woods. They wake up feeling uneasy and confused, wondering if they shared the same dream. Act 2 - Unexplainable events: as the weekend progresses, the friends experience a series of strange and unsettling events that defy rational explanation. They hear whispers and footsteps in the middle of the night, see shadowy figures through the windows, and feel cold spots and drafts inside the cabin. They assume it's just their imagination or an animal outside. - The witch: one day, while exploring the woods, they stumble upon an abandoned cabin that looks like it was used for witchcraft rituals. They find a book of spells, a pentagram on the floor, and a photograph of a woman who resembles the figure from their dreams. They realize that the woman was a witch who lived in the area a century ago and was burned at the stake by the villagers. They wonder if her spirit is still haunting the woods. - The dark secret: after some research, they discover that the cabin they're staying in was built on the site of the witch's former house, using the same materials and some of the same symbols. They realize that the cabin is cursed and that they've been lured there for a sinister purpose. They find an old diary that belonged to the witch and contains the details of a ritual sacrifice that requires five young souls. They realize that they are the intended victims. - The twists: as they try to escape the woods and the witch's curse, they encounter several obstacles and surprises that test their friendship, resolve, and survival skills. They must fight against demonic forces, solve puzzles, and make difficult choices that will determine their fate. There are several twists and turns that reveal new information about the witch, the cabin, and the friends themselves. Not everyone will make it alive. Act 3 - The survivors: after a harrowing ordeal, only two of the friends manage to escape the woods and the witch's curse: Alice and Chris. They are traumatized and scarred by their experiences, but they are determined to expose the truth and prevent others from falling prey to the witch's power. They publish a book about their ordeal and become famous in the horror genre. They also develop a romantic relationship that helps them cope with their trauma. - The sequel: a few years later, Alice and Chris receive a strange invitation from a fan of their book, who claims to know the true location of the witch's artifacts and wants them to witness a new ritual. They decide to investigate and end up in a different cabin in a different woods, but with a similar atmosphere and threat. They realize that the witch's curse is not limited to one place or time, and that they must confront their fears once again. The sequel ends with a cliffhanger that sets up a potential third installment. - Conclusion: The Cabin in the Woods is a chilling and suspenseful horror story that combines classic elements of the genre with fresh twists and a modern perspective. It is recommended for readers who enjoy psychological thrillers, supernatural mysteries, and tales of friendship and betrayal."},{"instruction":"The Great Gatsby is a novel by American writer F.

The suit, which was brought by Republicans, targeted the state's mail-in voting system, which was implemented due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The challengers argued that the mail-in voting was unconstitutional and that there were irregularities in the vote count. Despite claims by President Trump and his supporters of widespread voter fraud, there has been no concrete evidence to support these allegations. In fact, judges across the country, including many appointed by Republicans, have repeatedly thrown out these lawsuits due to lack of evidence. The Supreme Court's decision not to hear this case effectively ends any legal challenges to the election results in Pennsylvania, which saw Joe Biden defeat Donald Trump by over 80,000 votes. The decision also reinforces the legitimacy of the election, which was certified by all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Legal experts believe that the Supreme Court's decision sends a clear message that it will not interfere with the states' ability to conduct elections and determine their own election laws. This decision also marks the end of the road for Donald Trump's legal challenges to the election, as his team has lost more than 50 lawsuits in state and federal courts across the country. The outcome of this case will undoubtedly have implications for other lawsuits challenging election results in other states, which have also been dismissed due to lack of evidence.

The most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached an all-time high of 60,000 per coin, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin have also seen significant gains. This rise in popularity is due to various factors such as increased mainstream acceptance, institutional investment, and growing adoption worldwide. One of the key advantages of cryptocurrency is its ability to offer fast and secure transactions that are not subject to traditional banking fees and regulations. This means that people can transact without having to go through a bank or other financial institution, reducing transaction costs and increasing financial freedom. Cryptocurrency also offers a level of anonymity, where transactions can be conducted without revealing personal information, providing an additional layer of privacy. Furthermore, cryptocurrency is not tied to any particular country or government, making it a global currency that can be used anywhere in the world. Cryptocurrency transactions can be conducted without foreign exchange fees or any other charges, which is especially beneficial for individuals who frequently travel or conduct business internationally. However, as with any emerging technology or financial service, cryptocurrency also comes with risks. One of the major drawbacks is the potential for fraud and scams, which are more prevalent in the unregulated cryptocurrency market. Additionally, the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices can result in large fluctuations in the value of an investment in a short period.

The defining feature of Black Opal is its dark body tone, which ranges from dark gray to jet black. This dark backdrop contrasts starkly with the vibrant color flashes—known as play-of-color—that opals are famous for, making these colors appear even more vivid and dramatic than those in lighter opals. Found primarily in the Lightning Ridge area of New South Wales, Australia, Black Opals can display an entire spectrum of colors including green, blue, red, purple, and yellow. The most prized Black Opals exhibit a phenomenon called \\"red on black,\\" featuring a red play-of-color against the dark background. The formation of Black Opal is a rare event, requiring specific environmental conditions over millions of years. Silica-rich water needs to seep into cracks and voids in the ground, depositing silica gel which then gradually hardens into opal.

The stone's alluring depth acts as the perfect canvas for the opal's trademark play-of-color, which is caused by the diffraction of light off of the tiny silica spheres that make up the opal's internal structure. When these spheres are uniform in size and arranged in a grid-like pattern, they can break up light into spectral colors, resulting in the kaleidoscopic effect that opals are so prized for. The presence of carbon and iron oxide trace elements within the opal contributes to the Black Opal's dark base tone, which can significantly enhance the brightness and saturation of the colors that flash within it. As opposed to lighter opals, the dark body of a Black Opal provides a striking contrast that makes its colors appear more intense and luminous. Most of the world’s supply of natural Black Opal comes from the Lightning Ridge region in New South Wales, Australia, making it not just prized for its beauty, but also coveted as a relatively rare gemstone. Its rarity, combined with its spellbinding beauty, ensures that high-quality Black Opals are some of the most sought-after and valuable gemstones in the world."},{"instruction":"Give me a fact in one paragraph","output":"Black Opal stands out as a gemological marvel, primarily sourced from Lightning Ridge in Australia, the epicenter of its production.

It's this dark backdrop that accentuates the opal's intrinsic play-of-color, a phenomenon resulting from the diffraction of light off microscopic silica spheres arranged in a grid pattern within the stone. It’s this extraordinary contrast that causes the fiery hues—namely reds, greens, and blues—to leap out with a spectacular luminosity seemingly unique to Black Opal, rendering each stone a cosmic palette of shifting colors that change with the angle of light.

Однако, автоматизация такой сферы, как производство современной продукции требует от предприятий внедрения систем автоматизированного проектирования (САПР). Необходимость создания на предприятиях систем автоматизированного проектирования в настоящее время ни у кого не вызывает сомнений. Особенно остро эта проблема стоит перед предприятиями авиационно-космической, машиностроительной и других наукоемких отраслей промышленности. Бурное развитие CALS-технологий привело к тому, что разработка и выпуск конкурентоспособной наукоемкой продукции невозможен без использования современных средств автоматизации проектирования на всех этапах жизненного цикла изделия (ЖЦИ) - от дизайнерской задумки до производства и утилизации. Современные интегрированные САПР (такие как система Unigraphics) позволяют решить весь спектр конструкторско-технологических проблем, стоящих перед современным предприятием, выпускающим или проектирующим наукоемкую продукцию. Интегрированные САПР позволяют: резко повысить качество выпускаемой продукции; сократить сроки разработки новых изделий и расширить ассортимент выпускаемой продукции; сократить производственный цикл; выйти на мировой уровень производства и сертифицировать его на соответствие международным стандартам качества серии ISO 9000. Это является необходимым условием для ведения международного бизнеса. Внедрение современных интегрированных САПР коренным образом изменяет концепцию проектирования и производства. В основе нового подхода лежит создание электронной модели (ЭМ) изделия (или математической модели - ММ) и принципы совместной работы коллектива разработчиков в единой интегрированной среде. Разработка электронной модели изделия в современный САПР высшего и/или среднего уровня (системы Unigraphics и/или Solid Edge) позволяет: спроектировать на основе математической модели технологическую оснастку, необходимую для производства; провести все необходимые инженерные анализы и расчеты; подготовить комплект конструкторско-технологической документации на изделие; получить программы для станков с ЧПУ и изготовить оснастку и изделия; создать ассоциативную связь между всеми компонентами получившейся системы, обеспечивающую постоянное соответствие и автоматическую передачу изменений между формообразующими поверхностями деталей, сборок, техоснастки, программами для ЧПУ и конструкторско-технологической документацией; организовать электронный документооборот, обеспечивающий мгновенный доступ к необходимой и достоверной информации об изделии для всех разработчиков (на основе PDM-систем iMan и/или UG/Manager). Эволюция и развитие. Схожесть рынка САПР с обществом людей проявляется и в характере его развития, которое происходит эволюционным и революционным путем. В свое время революционный переворот произвели первые САПР для ПК, а затем системы среднего класса. Сейчас рынок развивается эволюционно: с каждой новой версией функциональные возможности продуктов всех классов расширяются, производительность увеличивается, а использование упрощается, растет внимание к PDM-системам, позволяющим ускорить проектно-конструкторские работы и реализовать популярную концепцию PLM за счет внедрения технического документооборота и управления проектами, а в связи с распространением Интернета появляются средства для взаимодействия проектировщиков через Всемирную сеть и онлайновые библиотеки типовых деталей.","output":"Внедрение компьютерных сетей в предприятиях и проектных организациях приносит значительные экономические выгоды во всех областях их деятельности, от улучшения управления персоналом до автоматизации бухгалтерии. Однако, для автоматизации производства современной продукции предприятиям необходимо внедрить системы автоматизированного проектирования (САПР). Создание систем автоматизированного проектирования на предприятиях в настоящее время является неотъемлемой потребностью. Такая необходимость особенно актуальна для предприятий в авиационно-космической, машиностроительной и других наукоемких отраслях промышленности. Развитие технологий CALS привело к тому, что невозможно разработать и выпустить конкурентоспособную наукоемкую продукцию без использования современных средств автоматизации проектирования на всех этапах жизненного цикла изделия - от идеи до производства и утилизации. Современные интегрированные САПР, такие как система Unigraphics, позволяют решить все проблемы конструкторского и технологического характера, стоящие перед современными предприятиями, производящими или проектирующими наукоемкую продукцию. Интегрированные САПР позволяют: - существенно повысить качество выпускаемой продукции; - сократить сроки разработки новых изделий и расширить ассортимент выпускаемой продукции; - уменьшить производственные циклы; - достичь мирового уровня производства и сертифицировать его по международным стандартам качества серии ISO 9000. Это необходимое условие для международного бизнеса. Внедрение современных интегрированных САПР кардинально меняет подход к проектированию и производству. Основной идеей нового подхода является создание электронной модели (ЭМ) изделия и принципов коллективной работы разработчиков в интегрированной среде. Разработка электронной модели изделия в современных САПР высокого и среднего уровней, таких как системы Unigraphics и Solid Edge, позволяет: - проектировать технологическое оборудование на основе математической модели; - проводить необходимые инженерные анализы и расчеты; - подготавливать конструкторско-технологическую документацию; - получать программы для станков с ЧПУ и изготовлять оборудование и изделия; - создавать связь между всеми компонентами системы, обеспечивая автоматическую передачу изменений между формообразующими поверхностями деталей, сборок, оборудования и документации; - организовывать электронный документооборот, обеспечивая доступ к информации об изделии для всех разработчиков. Развитие рынка САПР аналогично развитию общества людей, происходящее как эволюционным, так и революционным путем. Революционный переворот произошел с появлением первых САПР для персональных компьютеров, а затем средних систем. В настоящее время рынок развивается эволюционно: новые версии продуктов расширяют функциональные возможности, повышают производительность и упрощают использование, больше внимания уделяется PDM-системам, ускоряющим проектно-конструкторские работы и реализующим концепцию PLM.

There is little acknowledgement that a true disease is likely to rise and fall in incidence. In outlining the North Wales History of Mental Illness project, this paper seeks to provide some evidence that psychiatric diseases do rise and fall in incidence, along with evidence as to how such ideas are received by other historians of psychiatry and by biological psychiatrists. Keywords Disease, historical epidemiology, medical progress, post-partum psychoses, schizophrenia The twenty-fifth anniversary of the History of Psychiatry provides a wonderful opportunity to celebrate its editor who has had a huge influence on all aspects of the history outlined below. From background to foreground Influenced like many of my generation by the writings of Laing, Szasz, Illich, Jung and Freud, I studied medicine to do psychiatry. At the time, research was becoming mandatory for anyone hoping to engage with the field. I chose to work on the serotonin system. But this was working on the mind as much as the brain; the serotonin system brought into view by LSD rather than the one that Prozac would usher in; biology as a source of variation and individuality rather than standardization. This background made me acutely aware of an emerging biobabble, biomythologies, and the rhetoric in claims made by what later came to be called biological psychiatry. I was newly perched at a laboratory bench when the controversy blew up about whether schizophrenia increased in frequency in the nineteenth century. Faced with a clear increase in hospitalizations for insanity, Torrey (1980) and Hare (1981) argued that an infectious or other trigger must have been at work. I instinctively took the opposite side. German Berrios’s cautionary note (1981) about the changing meaning of mania rang true, and I have spent a great deal of my career since then dealing with the shifting meanings of terms like neurosis, psychosis, depression and mania.

However, even the biological psychiatrists who displaced social psychiatry in the 1980s were inclined to see schizophrenia as emblematic of the human condition rather than a disease that might rise and fall. Tim Crow (2000) argued that the genes responsible for language gave rise to schizophrenia. Geneticists and neuroscientists have not been inclined to think schizophrenia could have recently appeared and might as soon disappear. The possibility that a disease might appear or disappear is the purview of some doctors and more historians who deal in questions about what diseases are. But even for a doctor and historian of medicine, the idea that a psychiatric disease might rise and fall in frequency can be difficult to accept. In the 1980s, prior to working on the history of psychopharmacology, I looked at annual reports from the superintendents of Irish asylums who, facing a tide of insanity that rose higher in Ireland than anywhere else in the world (Healy, 1991), for the most part dismissed claims that there was a real increase in insanity. Most Irish people knew what was happening – patients wintered in facilities put in place by the British. I readily accepted such suggestions. There had to be a mundane explanation like this to account for the fact that in the face of the highest rates of incarceration ever recorded, mental illness never featured in Irish literature, one of the richest in the world. This profound bias on my part should have alerted me to the fact that others might not be sympathetic to the message from North Wales research in historical epidemiology pointing to a rise and fall in the rates of illnesses and a lack of therapeutic progress in many areas of psychiatry’s heartlands. Against a background of difficulties of getting into print articles on the adverse effects of drugs, it is something to be able to say that I have never had reviews as openly vituperative as the reviews of some of these historical articles. History is clearly no ivory tower enterprise. Its practitioners are passionate and committed. One historian reviewing a paper whose data demonstrate a rising admission incidence for schizophrenia in the nineteenth century and a declining admission incidence latterly was adamant that nothing we could do would permit him to recommend publication. The paper would have been rejected had the editor not suggested disregarding this review. Anonymous reviewers of another paper in one of medicine’s most prestigious journals have argued that because some black males were incarcerated in US mental hospitals in the 1960s with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, we could never be sure that any historical diagnoses from caserecords were correct. Or faced with an absence of suicide in schizophrenia a century ago, reviewers have suggested this can only have happened because patients were permanently strait-jacketed and secluded. Responding that all such patients demonstrably spent 99% of their time on hospital farms or in sewing rooms or kitchens has cut no ice with editors or reviewers. It would seem that a number of important nerves are being touched here. There are methodological issues to do with the use of clinical records. There is resistance to any undermining of the idea of progress. There is a fundamental disagreement about the nature of disease. The North Wales Hospital records The North Wales asylum made its way into my life by accident when the history department at Bangor secured a grant to look at the social impact of the Denbigh asylum. This enabled Pam Michael to sample the records. Among the striking features were the differences in the way people declared their madness a century ago – then they tore off their clothes and escaped through windows, now they never do this. As an ancillary project, with colleagues I entered all the admissions from North West Wales for 1894–1896 and began to collect admissions from the corresponding district general hospital (DGH) Downloaded from hpy.sagepub.com by guest on November 13, 2014 452 History of Psychiatry 25(4) unit in 1996 (the Hergest Unit). My fascination with the meaning of behaviours like this gave way to an interest in quantifying them, and this led to two quite separate approaches to the material. Pam Michael (2003) wrote a wonderful history of the hospital. With colleagues, I began to quantify admissions – even as at the same time I was writing books on the malign effects of the informational reductionism found in much of the quantification now encroaching on clinical practice and healthcare. Contrary to expectation, we found 15 times more admissions per annum, and 3 times more compulsory detentions now than a century ago (Healy et al., 2001). This did not pose a serious intellectual challenge in that 85% of admissions were recurrences. The interest lay in the expansion of mental health systems to patients not admitted a century earlier and in how the system conceals its reach. To explore this further, we entered all records from North West Wales between 1875 and 1924 and built a database from 1994 to 2010. We had a crash training in epidemiology from Ezra Susser of Columbia University, who made us aware that we were comparing admission incidence rather than disease incidences and that to compare outcomes would require tracking outcomes over 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods in both contemporary and historical periods. Methodological and meta-methodological issues Although the work that has come out of this project now constitutes the largest body of historical epidemiology in existence, the research has never been grant-funded. History grant-giving bodies, it seems, have not been able to see the value in quantifying records or in having a contemporary comparator, and epidemiologists cannot see the value in our historical records. Both groups worry about diagnoses made on the basis of records from a century ago, even though the availability of an entire clinical history gives confidence that the retrospective diagnoses these records support are more accurate than the diagnoses given to patients at admission today, the diagnoses that end up in administrative databases, or the sampling of patients in communities by means of diagnostic interviews (Horwitz and Grob, 2011). The reviews of our papers bring out some of the issues at play. One is the argument offered that when black men in the USA in the 1960s could be detained compulsorily and diagnosed as having schizophrenia, can we be certain that our records do not reflect comparable misdiagnoses? Other versions of this argument claim that women with unwanted pregnancies were incarcerated in mental asylums and diagnosed as schizophrenic. Several points can be noted. By the 1950s, admission to mental hospitals had become a much looser affair than it had been in the period 1875–1924. There has furthermore been extensive work on case-records at this point (Andrews and Scull, 2002; Turner, 1992). While there have been several famous examples of individuals who have protested their incarceration, those working on historical records from this period have not suggested that admissions were inappropriate. In the North Wales records, we found that clinicians were sensitive to issues of whether this patient was ‘a knave or a fool’ and were very reluctant to admit knaves who, if admitted, were quickly discharged. There was not a single admission for unwanted pregnancy or ethnic factors, and in cases where there has been domestic or other abuse, these issues are clearly flagged up, making it possible to take such factors into account when making a retrospective diagnosis. Second, our data are not based on either cross-sectional diagnosis or the diagnoses of clinicians at the time. The diagnoses have been based on the entire clinical record. A re-reading of these records might be expected to weed out any inappropriate admissions. Indeed it is precisely this ability to come to a different diagnosis based on the full case-record that has enabled modern historians to come to retrospective conclusions that in some cases there have been inappropriate admissions at different points in time. Downloaded from hpy.sagepub.com by guest on November 13, 2014 Healy 453 As regards diagnoses, the question is whether it is possible to allocate patients on the basis of complete case-records into large diagnostic bins such as non-affective psychosis, affective disorders, dementing disorders, mental handicap and organic disorders. Claims that it is not possible to do this are quite extraordinary, and run in the face of the notion of a disease entity. Prior to the delineation of disease entities in the middle of the nineteenth century, patients with illnesses had complaints which their doctors managed according to the wisdom or the fashions of the time. But a disease entity is supposed to have a relative invariance. The disease may wax and wane in virulence, treatments may modify its course and associated conditions may also contribute to the outcome, so the clinical manifestations may differ, but the disease has a continuity that underpins a certain commonality of clinical presentations. We have adopted the assumption that there are disease entities within the psychiatric domain. It has been a surprise then that the most vehement responses have come from those with some affiliation to biological psychiatry who have argued that it is simply not possible to compare patients of a hundred years ago with now. This seems to be a case of biological psychiatrists putting forward an argument that threatens the very basis for biological psychiatry. What they are probably responding to is the fact that our records do not demonstrate progress. Some readers who do not have access to our historical and contemporary databases may legitimately wonder whether our results stem from diagnostic leakage or some biased use of a diagnostic cookie cutter on the dough of society. In fact the findings reported below hold, whether we utilize the entire sample of both affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, or if we go for finegrained diagnoses, as in the case of post-partum psychoses or schizophrenia. One of the biggest sources of difficulties lies in the fact that the outcome data we report do not demonstrate progress. The hope had been that delineating clear-cut disease entities was an important step in the delivery of better outcomes. It would seem for some that if the data do not support this, then the data must be wrong. This point is elaborated below. The main findings Moral treatment In line with 1960s thinking that saw psychosis as a meaningful expression of human conflict, we have demonstrated in the 1875–1924 records that certain schizophreniform psychoses can be precipitated by social dislocation and that these acute and transient psychoses have a good prognosis (Linden et al., 2010). We have mapped out the clinical course of melancholia, which accounted for 25% of admissions (Harris et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2013), and the post-partum psychoses, which accounted for 1 in 10 admissions from women of child-bearing years (Tschinkel et al., 2007). We have shown that with the right moral and hygienic input in asylums these disorders along with the acute and transient psychoses remit. If schizophrenia was uncommon in the early to mid-nineteenth century, then our data suggest that building asylums in the expectation that their moral economy would lead to recoveries in most of the patients then being admitted made eminent sense. Diagnosis counts The post-partum psychoses study brought a major surprise. When comparing modern and historical databases, it is clear that classic post-partum psychoses – that is, disorders that arise de novo in women with no prior history of mental illness and that often have a cycloid clinical presentation – have vanished (Tschinkel et al., 2007). The data were strikingly clear, and we also had an external Downloaded from hpy.sagepub.com by guest on November 13, 2014 454 History of Psychiatry 25(4) validation. The Hergest Unit opened in 1993. Based on the best available data at the time for rates of post-partum psychosis, this and two other DGH units that opened in North Wales in the wake of the closure of the asylum had mother-and-baby units linked to them. All 3 mother-and-baby units have now closed. Post-partum psychosis cannot be managed in the community – it is too severe. De novo onset disorders cannot be pre-treated. There is no continuity between post-partum psychoses and postnatal depression whose rates are rising. There is therefore no ready explanation for the disappearance of this condition. The residual post-partum psychoses, those that involve post-partum episodes of a pre-existing disorder, have been co-opted by the spreading bipolar disorder hegemony. Given that bipolar diagnoses are being made increasingly often, this conceals the disappearance of classic post-partum psychosis. Those who do not know the story will find many statements to the effect that post-partum psychoses are a subset of bipolar disorder and, as bipolar disorder is more commonly diagnosed than ever, they will miss the fact that post-partum psychosis has disappeared. As intriguing as this disappearance is, the response to a draft of the article by Tschinkel et al. entitled ‘Post-partum psychosis: a vanishing disorder?’ was equally interesting. The experts in post-partum psychosis were not amused. We have not had a single reprint request for the published article, and have only once been asked to present the data at a meeting. No one, it seems, wants illnesses to disappear. Where are the discussions in the history of psychiatry about the disappearance of catatonia? Our database brings out its disappearance and moreover makes it all but certain that it is the coincidental use of barbiturates and later benzodiazepines that have brought this about (Chalassani, Healy and Morriss, 2005). The history of psychopharmacology is a new field. It should begin with the barbiturates rather than chlorpromazine. Is the conventional story the result of an accidental scotoma or indicative of a social bias in the history of psychiatry? Many recent books about the benzodiazepines and related drugs have gone along with a portrayal of these drugs as instruments for the repression of suburban housewives in the 1960s, even though they were advertised in the 1960s as of benefit to salesmen. None of these histories considers whether the disinhibiting effects of the benzodiazepines (they undo conflict avoidance and conditioned fear) that can be expected to help salesmen might have also helped women to fling off the conditioning of patriarchy. In contrast, the major tranquillizers now the biggest sellers in mental health will condition their takers into an acceptance of the status quo. In the face of the many challenges to its legitimacy, one might imagine psychiatry would want to point to the elimination of a severe disorder, albeit for unknown reasons, and the astonishingly effective treatment of another that used to be among the most dreaded of mental illnesses. One might have imagined the supporters of DSM-V would want to be able to say to the public: ‘see, diagnosis counts’. Can the history of psychiatry afford to shun questions of diagnosis and treatment? While genetic predispositions and social dislocations will probably always be with us, their interplay, as in tuberculosis which has a greater heritability than schizophrenia, gives rise to diseases that come and go. The rise and fall of schizophrenia No one argues with claims that the first descriptions of the mental states characteristic of schizophrenia do not go back beyond 1810, or that the first descriptions of the distinctive clinical course of this disorder emerged in the middle of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless the possibility that schizophrenia might have emerged in the nineteenth century and might equally disappear has not seriously engaged the imagination of the field. Downloaded from hpy.sagepub.com by guest on November 13, 2014 Healy 455 Ironically, because of a study funded by Fuller Torrey to search for viral markers in new onset psychoses, I embarked on weekly ward visits in the Hergest Unit to log new admissions. These visits led to a strong impression that there were far fewer new patients with schizophrenia than expected. All staff noticed the change but none could explain it. Initially the standard joke that patients disappear when a study starts was as good as any explanation. When the lack of patients extended into a second year, we interrogated our databases more closely and found that the drop in the incidence of first admissions was historically unprecedented. We had fallen below levels last seen in 1876. Since then, close to 50% of the beds in the contemporary DGH unit have closed. We have collected more data, rigorously standardized our populations and sifted the findings in a number of ways. The contemporary results are clear cut; schizophrenia first admissions seem to be vanishing. There is no administrative or clinical explanation why this should be happening. This disappearance is complemented by data from our historical cohort pointing to a rising admission incidence for schizophrenia in the nineteenth century; admissions for melancholia, acute and transient psychoses, post-partum psychoses or manic-depressive illness did not increase during this period, other than pro rata with changes in the population. The nineteenth-century rise in incidence and twenty-first-century drop are independently important. The nineteenth-century rise needs scrutiny as this database is unlikely to be replicated, and the data are likely to stand as a brute fact for some time. It is possible to argue that the twenty-firstcentury drop, although historically unprecedented, has only lasted for 10 years to date, but this ignores the bed closure and a shared sense of change. It also ignores the fact that somewhere in the twentieth century in an ethnically homogenous and geographically confined population in North Wales there was a change in the gender ratio found in schizophrenia from an equal incidence in both sexes, attested to by textbooks from Kraepelin onwards, to double the incidence in males compared with females, a finding supported by all modern epidemiology. The disappearance of a disease should root it in history. Our discomfort with diseases disappearing may stem in part from a concern with loss of livelihood, but there are suggestions from the way psychosis has been viewed that we think of it as our ancestors once thought of epilepsy or other disorders – as meaningful (a manifestation of sin). Alternatively, when faced with these data some people seem to hear a message that insanity is disappearing and this seems as self-evidently wrong to them as claims that respiratory disorders in general rather than a specific disorder such as tuberculosis might disappear. While troublesome in some ways, the disappearance of schizophrenia opens up possibilities for the history of psychiatry. One lies in asking questions about what social, environmental or other factors might have driven these changes. A rising incidence at one point, falling incidence at another and changing gender ratios in between constrain the answers we might give to this question. A second lies in how we imagine asylums and credit the intentions of the original asylum builders. If the most devastating of psychiatric illnesses only emerged in the nineteenth century, have we done enough to convey how this impacted on sufferers, carers, society and the medical profession? Simply asking this question appears to demonstrate that our current histories have a bias in the portrait they paint. The data suggest that, rather like the appearance of AIDS in the 1980s, the midnineteenth century saw the emergence of a terrifying new spectre – schizophrenia – an insanity that did not resolve. Feeding the historical imagination Even thinking about what might account for these changes opens up perspectives for future histories. The median age at first admission among our contemporary cohort of patients was 27 years of Downloaded from hpy.sagepub.com by guest on November 13, 2014 456 History of Psychiatry 25(4) age. If the propensity to schizophrenia arises in utero, infancy, or early childhood, as is commonly suggested, this age of admission suggests looking for factors that might have been changing between 1975 and 1985. The late 1970s to mid-1980s was a time of growing awareness of the risks of neonatal asphyxiation. During this period, Caesarean section rates rose from less than 5% of births to over 10%; the use of rotational forceps declined rapidly and breech births and mid-cavity deliveries became rare. A decade later there was a rise in the use of epidural procedures for Caesarean sections that may have also have reduced risks for both post-partum psychosis for mothers and schizophrenia for their children. This explanation has links to the introduction of anaesthesia in the 1840s and its rapid extension to obstetrical practice which led to an increasing use of forceps and related procedures in the second half of the nineteenth century. While ensuring more babies were born alive, this change in practice led to an heroic ethic in obstetrics with mid-cavity deliveries of poorly oxygenated babies. Another possibility lies in changing levels of lead. Lead has long been recognized as neurotoxic. Children are affected at much lower levels than adults, with the developmental effects most likely for exposure under two years of age. Investigations of the role of prenatal exposure to lead in the development of adult onset psychiatric disorders also provides support for the hypothesis that disruption to the developing central nervous system might be linked with schizophrenia. Comparing the admission incidence of schizophrenia in North West Wales alongside a nineteenth/twentieth-century lead exposure timeline shows schizophrenia incidence tracking lead exposure. While lead occurs naturally, exposure to lead increased significantly in the nineteenth century. Rapidly increasing urban populations demanded piped water supplies, and lead was commonly used. In 1813 the first food canning factory was established and the cans were sealed with lead solder. As mechanization of the process improved and costs reduced, Victorian Britain demanded increasing quantities of canned food. Lead was added to nineteenth-century cheese, confectionery, wine, beer, mustard, snuff and some medicines. It was added to paint from the midnineteenth century in ever-increasing amounts through to 1955. Finally, in the 1920s lead was added to petrol/gasoline. The harmful effects of exposure to lead were recognized after 1950. In 1970 the use of lead piping was prohibited in new homes; its use in household paints was prohibited in the USA in 1977 and in Europe in 1992. Unleaded petrol was introduced in 1980, and by 1995 leaded fuel accounted for only 0.6% of total sales. North Wales was a centre of British lead production and had heavy concentrations of lead in land samples. Studies of blood-lead levels in Wales during the 1970s and early 1980s showed falls of 3% to 5% per year, a finding mirrored by other research in the UK and other countries. Finally, several studies from the USA point to increased lead loading in patients with chronic psychoses and several suggestions have been made about possible mechanisms (Guillarte, 2009; Opler et al., 2008). There are other possibilities. The role of lead inevitably brings to mind the association between treatments with mercury and dementia paralytica – was the treatment an integral part of the clinical presentation? Another factor that rose and fell roughly in the right time-frame was smallpox vaccination. At a time when vaccinations are becoming far more common, this point is of some considerable interest. The disappearance of a disease can therefore feed the historical imagination in novel ways. Our data suggest that what we have called schizophrenia refers to a final common pathway for a number of disorders during this period – chronic psychosis. Ironically, if this is the case, the disappearance of schizophrenia brings into view a series of remitting schizophreniform and paranoid psychoses that seem more likely than schizophrenia to bear a meaningful relationship with either personality or social factors. Downloaded from hpy.sagepub.com by guest on November 13, 2014 Healy 457 History and data From our data we are able to demonstrate conclusively that patients in the early years of treatment for schizophrenia are more likely to die today than they were historically (Healy et al., 2012a, 2012b). Today they die specifically from suicide. Faced with these data and the implication that suicide is not inherent in schizophrenia, biological psychiatrists have insisted this can only be because, historically, patients were strait-jacketed. It has proved impossible to overcome this prejudgement by pointing out that almost all patients with schizophrenia spent the vast majority of their time on the asylum farm or in the sewing rooms, or that hospitalized melancholic patients did commit suicide in the same asylums where patients with schizophrenia did not. When people ‘do history’, even if they do not have comparative data, they always make interpretations in reference to some contemporary state, if only to make sense of what they report for their readers. What they find will often contrast with the views of some who use ‘history’ to buttress a contemporary view. The example discussed in this article brings home the fact that what happened in history counts and perhaps also shows the need for historians to speak up. In medicine, the bedrock data are patients. Data of the kind being dealt with here are abstractions. These abstractions need to be taken and worked back into living images of nineteenth- and twentieth-century patients with mental disorders that can inform policy, culture and art. The wrong images of our past will compromise our future. References Andrews J and Scull A (2002) Customers and Patrons of the Mad-Trade. The Management of Lunacy in Eighteenth Century London.

Traditionally, psychiatric conditions were seen as manifestations of the human condition, not fluctuating medical diseases. Healy presents evidence from the North Wales History of Mental Illness project to argue that the incidence of psychiatric diseases does indeed rise and fall over time, which challenges the views of both other historians and biological psychiatrists. Healy's own background, influenced by figures such as Laing and Szasz, led him to psychiatry and research on serotonin. During his work, a controversy arose over whether the frequency of schizophrenia increased in the 19th century due to an infectious trigger, as suggested by Torrey (1980) and Hare (1981). Healy found these claims dubious and has since focused on the changing meanings of psychiatric terms such as psychosis, depression, and mania. The North Wales asylum project encountered methodological skepticism from both historians and contemporary scientists regarding the accuracy of historical diagnoses based on case records. However, Healy defends the reliability of these historical diagnoses, given the complete clinical histories available. The research reveals several intriguing findings about the historical progression of psychiatric diseases. For example, certain acute and transient psychoses in the past had good prognoses, depending on social context and treatment, supporting the idea of moral and hygienic practices in asylums. Intriguingly, classic post-partum psychoses, once common, seem to have vanished—a fact that is surprisingly ignored by the medical community. Healy's work also demonstrates a noticeable decrease in new schizophrenia admissions in contemporary times, a historically unprecedented trend that cannot be explained by administrative or clinical factors. This change invites speculation on social, environmental, or medical advancements that may have caused the alteration in incidence, such as improved obstetrical practices or reduced lead exposure. The article sheds light on certain medical treatment successes, like the disappearance of catatonia and the effective management of certain psychotic disorders. It also stresses the importance of historical data for informing present medical practices and policy. Healy concludes by calling on historians to incorporate these empirical findings into a richer, more accurate narrative of the history of psychiatry."},{"instruction":"Переклади на українську","output":"Стаття Девіда Хілі з назвою \\"Психіатричні 'хвороби' в історії\\" обговорює історичну перспективу психіатричних захворювань та їхню поширеність. Традиційно психіатричні умови розглядалися як прояви людської природи, а не як медичні захворювання, рівень яких може змінюватися. Хілі проаналізував докази з проекту історії психічних захворювань у Північному Уельсі, щоб стверджувати, що інцидентність психіатричних захворювань дійсно змінюється з часом, що викликає сумніви як у інших істориків, так і у біологічних психіатрів. Власний досвід Хілі, під впливом фігур таких як Лейнг і Саз, спрямував його до психіатрії та дослідженню серотоніну. Під час своєї роботи він зіткнувся з контроверсією щодо того, чи збільшилася частота шизофренії в XIX столітті через інфекційну причину, як це припускали Торрі (1980) та Харе (1981). Хілі засумнівався в цих твердженнях і з тих пір концентрував увагу на змінних значеннях психіатричних термінів, таких як психоз, депресія та манія. Проєкт лікарні у Північному Уельсі зіткнувся з методологічним скептицизмом з боку істориків та сучасних вчених щодо точності історичних діагнозів, основаних на історії хвороби. Однак Хілі захищає достовірність цих історичних діагнозів за допомогою повних клінічних історій, що доступні. Дослідження виявляє декілька захоплюючих відкриттів про історичний розвиток психіатричних захворювань. Наприклад, в минулому деякі гострі та транзитивні психози мали добрі прогнози залежно від соціального контексту та лікування, підтримуючи ідею моральної та гігієнічної практики у психіатричних лікарнях. Захоплюючим стало відкриття, що класичні післяпологові психози, які колись були популярні, здається, зникли — факт, який дивно ігнорується медичною спільнотою. Робота Хілі також показує помітне зниження нових випадків шизофренії в сучасний час, історично безпрецедентну тенденцію, яку не можна пояснити адміністративними або клінічними факторами. Ця зміна спонукає до роздумів про соціальні, екологічні або медичні досягнення, які могли викликати такі зміни у поширеності, наприклад покращену акушерську практику або зниження впливу свинцю. Стаття висвітлює певні успіхи медичного лікування, такі як зникнення кататонії та ефективне контролювання певних психотичних розладів. Вона також підкреслює важливість історичних даних для формування сучасної медичної практики та політики. Хілі закінчує статтю закликом до істориків включити ці емпіричні результати в більш багатий та точний наратив історії психіатрії."},{"instruction":"Donne-moi l’histoire d’une jeune femme dont la petite sœur s’est toujours fait un malin plaisir de coucher avec ses petites amies, lui causant beaucoup de souffrance, et qui maintenant adulte à l’intention de prendre sa revanche.

Затем можно применить функцию softmax к логитам, чтобы получить вероятности. К сожалению, стандартная функция генерации моделей, основанных на трансформере (например, \`transformers\` библиотеки от Hugging Face), не предоставляет вероятности для каждого токена напрямую в процессе генерации. Вы должны изменить функцию так, чтобы она возвращала логиты, и затем преобразовать эти логиты в вероятности с помощью функции softmax. Вот пример того, как это можно сделать для моделей из библиотеки \`transformers\`: \`\`\`python import torch from torch.nn.functional import softmax def generate_with_probabilities(model, tokenizer, prompt, generation_config): # Преобразование промпта в токены inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors=\\"pt\\") inputs = inputs.to(model.device) # Генерация текста и получение логитов output = model.generate(inputs, return_dict_in_generate=True, output_scores=True, **generation_config) token_ids = output.sequences[0] # Удаляем логиты соответствующие токенам промпта logits = output.scores[len(inputs[0]) - 1:] # Преобразование логитов в вероятности probabilities = [softmax(logit, dim=-1) for logit in logits] # Получение вероятностей токенов и их соответствующих значений token_probabilities = [] for i, token_id in enumerate(token_ids[len(inputs[0]):]): token_probs = probabilities[i] token_prob = token_probs[0, token_id].item() # Выбираем вероятность под конкретным индексом токена token_probabilities.append((tokenizer.decode([token_id]), token_prob)) # Получаем сгенерированный текст generated_text = tokenizer.decode(token_ids[len(inputs[0]):], skip_special_tokens=True) return generated_text.strip(), token_probabilities \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что приведённый выше код адаптирован для использования с моделями, реализующими интерфейс \`transformers.PreTrainedModel\`. Также этот код ожидает, что модель уже была загружена и настроена со всеми необходимыми для работы компонентами (tokenizer и т.д.). Параметр \`return_dict_in_generate=True\` заставляет \`generate\` возвращать объект с дополнительной информацией, а \`output_scores=True\` говорит, что функция должна также возвращать логиты. Каждый элемент в списке \`scores\` является тензором логитов, соответствующим одному токену. Применяя softmax к каждому тензору логитов, вы получаете список тензоров вероятностей, из которых затем извлекаете вероятности для сгенерированных токенов."},{"instruction":"Как модифицировать данный код, чтобы получить вероятность каждого слова в сгенерированном тексте from peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, GenerationConfig MODEL_NAME = \\"IlyaGusev/saiga2_7b_lora\\" DEFAULT_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE = \\"<s>{role}n{content}</s>n\\" DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = \\"Ты — Сайга, русскоязычный автоматический ассистент.

Biomembranen spielen vielfältige Rollen in der Zellfunktion, darunter: 1. **Abgrenzung und Schutz**: Biomembranen umschließen und schützen die Zellinhalte vor der äußeren Umgebung. 2. **Selektive Permeabilität**: Sie kontrollieren den Eintritt und Austritt von Stoffen, indem sie bestimmte Moleküle durchlassen und andere zurückweisen. 3. **Signalübertragung**: Sie ermöglichen die Kommunikation zwischen Zellen und deren Umgebung durch Rezeptoren und andere Moleküle. 4. **Verankerung von Proteinen**: Proteine, die für Transport, Signaltransduktion und Zellstruktur wichtig sind, werden in die Membran eingebettet. 5. **Energieerzeugung**: In Zellorganellen, wie z.B. den Mitochondrien, sind Biomembranen der Ort, an dem die Energieerzeugung durch Elektronentransportketten stattfindet. Biomembranen können Stoffe auf verschiedene Weise transportieren: 1. **Passiver Transport (Diffusion)**: Kleinere, ungeladene Moleküle, wie O2 und CO2, können direkt durch die Lipiddoppelschicht diffundieren, ohne Energieaufwand. 2. **Erleichterte Diffusion**: Hierbei helfen Transportproteine größeren oder polaren Molekülen, die Lipidmembran zu überwinden, indem sie Bindungsstellen bieten, die eine Passage ohne Energieaufwand ermöglichen. 3. **Aktiver Transport**: Unter Verwendung von ATP als Energiequelle können Pumpproteine Substanzen gegen ihren Konzentrationsgradienten bewegen, was notwendig ist, um bestimmte Ionenkonzentrationen inner- und außerhalb der Zelle aufrechtzuerhalten. 4. **Osmose**: Die Diffusion von Wasser durch eine semipermeable Membran, die für einige gelöste Substanzen undurchlässig ist, um einen Konzentrationsausgleich herzustellen. 5. **Endozytose und Exozytose**: Große Moleküle oder Partikel werden durch Einstülpung (Endozytose) bzw. Ausschleusung (Exozytose) von Membranteilen in bzw. aus der Zelle transportiert. 6. **Ionenkanäle**: Diese spezialisierten Membranproteine bilden Poren, durch die Ionen wie K+, Na+, Ca2+ und Cl- passieren können, was häufig in elektrisch erregbaren Zellen wie Neuronen eine Rolle spielt. Diese Mechanismen sorgen für die notwendige Aufnahme von Nährstoffen, die Eliminierung von Abfallprodukten und die Aufrechterhaltung des internen Milieus der Zellen."},{"instruction":"Kann der körper calcium abbauen?","output":"Ja, der menschliche Körper hat die Fähigkeit, Calcium abzubauen und umzuverteilen, um den Bedarf in verschiedenen Geweben zu decken und den Kalziumspiegel im Blut zu regulieren. Dieser Prozess ist für eine Vielzahl lebenswichtiger Funktionen entscheidend, einschließlich der Knochenmineralisierung, Muskelkontraktion, Blutgerinnung und der Signalübertragung zwischen Nervenzellen. Der größte Teil des körperlichen Calciums – etwa 99% – ist in den Knochen und Zähnen gespeichert, wo es den Knochen seine Stärke und Struktur verleiht. Der restliche Anteil zirkuliert im Blut und in den Körperflüssigkeiten. Um den Calciumspiegel im Blut konstant zu halten, verwendet der Körper mehrere Mechanismen: 1. **Knochenresorption**: Der Abbau und die Freisetzung von Calcium aus den Knochen in den Blutstrom. Dieser Prozess wird durch Osteoklasten durchgeführt, die Knochengewebe abbauen können. 2. **Calciumaufnahme im Darm**: Die Aufnahme von Calcium aus der Nahrung wird durch Vitamin D gefördert, das die Synthese von Calcium-transportierenden Proteinen im Darm stimuliert. 3. **Calciumausscheidung**: Überschüssiges Calcium kann über die Nieren im Urin ausgeschieden werden. Die Menge des ausgeschiedenen Calciums wird durch Hormone wie Parathormon (PTH) und Calcitonin reguliert. Die Regulierung des Calciumspiegels wird hauptsächlich durch das Zusammenspiel von Parathormon, Vitamin D und Calcitonin gesteuert: - **Parathormon (PTH)**, das von den Nebenschilddrüsen freigesetzt wird, erhöht bei Bedarf den Calciumspiegel im Blut, indem es Knochenresorption fördert, die Calciumrückgewinnung in den Nieren erhöht und die Aktivierung von Vitamin D begünstigt, was wiederum die Calciumaufnahme im Darm steigert. - **Vitamin D** trägt zur Erhöhung des Calciumspiegels im Blut bei, indem es die intestinale Absorption von Calcium verbessert und die Wirkung von Parathormon unterstützt. - **Calcitonin**, das von den C-Zellen der Schilddrüse ausgeschüttet wird, senkt den Calciumspiegel im Blut hauptsächlich durch Hemmung der Knochenresorption sowie durch Förderung der Calciumausscheidung über die Nieren. Diese fein abgestimmte hormonelle Regulation ermöglicht es dem Körper, das Gleichgewicht des Calciumhaushalts zu bewahren, was für die Aufrechterhaltung der allgemeinen Gesundheit und Funktion des Körpers essentiell ist."},{"instruction":"Una volta caricata in memoria, una applicazione è distinta in componenti Di norma, 1 app = 1 processo = 1 VM = 1 thread Possibili variazioni: app multi-threaded, più app “amiche” in un solo processo, ecc. Il flusso di lavoro dell'utente (task) è fatto però spesso di componenti appartenenti ad applicazioni diverse, eseguiti da processi diversi Android incoraggia la condivisione (sicura) fra applicazioni di dati di componenti = funzionalità Mi spieghi questa slide l'argomento in generale è un app android","output":"La slide che descrivi sembra riferirsi al modo in cui le applicazioni sono gestite nel sistema operativo Android, in particolare in termini di processo, threading e interazione tra diverse applicazioni. Di seguito spiego in dettaglio ciascun punto: 1. **Applicazione e processo**: - Di norma, quando lanci un'applicazione Android, viene avviato un nuovo processo Linux. Ogni processo fornisce all'applicazione il proprio spazio di memoria e risorse di sistema, contribuendo alla sicurezza e all'isolamento delle applicazioni. Quindi, tipicamente, ogni app è un processo separato. 2. **Applicazione e virtual machine**: - Ogni applicazione Android viene eseguita sulla propria istanza di Android Runtime (ART) o, in sistemi precedenti, sulla Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM). Questo aiuta a isolare il codice dell'applicazione e gestire la memoria in modo più sicuro. 3. **Applicazione e thread**: - Anche se di solito 1 applicazione ha almeno 1 thread principale (chiamato \\"main thread\\" o \\"UI thread\\"), le applicazioni possono essere multi-threaded. Significa che possono eseguire codice concorrentemente su più thread, migliorando potenzialmente le prestazioni e la reattività dell'app, specialmente durante operazioni lunghe o intensive che altrimenti potrebbero bloccare il thread UI. 4. **Applicazioni 'amiche' e condivisione**: - Android consente a più applicazioni di collaborare o condividere dati in modo sicuro. Alcune applicazioni potrebbero scegliere di funzionare all'interno dello stesso processo attraverso una configurazione speciale (come l'uso dello stesso UserID); questo è meno comune e di solito viene fatto solo quando le app hanno alti livelli di fiducia reciproca. - Android fornisce anche meccanismi per la condivisione di componenti tra applicazioni, come i Content Providers, che permettono di condividere dati in modo controllato, e gli Intents, che consentono di invocare componenti da altre app. 5. **Flusso di lavoro dell'utente (task)**: - Mentre un'app potrebbe essere un singolo processo, gli utenti spesso interagiscono con molte applicazioni diverse per completare un compito. Android gestisce questo flusso di lavoro attraverso i cosiddetti \\"tasks\\", che sono una raccolta di attività che l'utente svolge insieme. Le attività possono coinvolgere componenti di diverse app. 6. **Android e sicurezza nella condivisione**: - Android promuove la condivisione tra applicazioni, ma pone grande enfasi sulla sicurezza. Le applicazioni devono dichiarare i permessi di cui hanno bisogno per accedere o effettuare operazioni che influenzano altre applicazioni o il sistema. Gli sviluppatori devono utilizzare queste API di condivisione in modo responsabile e gli utenti hanno il controllo sul concedere o negare tali permessi. In sintesi, la slide descrive come le applicazioni vengono eseguite su Android, il loro isolamento in processi e VM separate, ma anche la possibilità di interazione e collaborazione tra app attraverso le API e le funzionalità fornite dal sistema operativo, mantenendo al contempo un'attenzione alla sicurezza dei dati e della privacy degli utenti."},{"instruction":"Spiegami questa slide, è un desiegno quendi te la descrivo: c'è un .apk che contiene un processo che a sua volta contiene 5 classi del framework( 3 activity, 1 service, 1 content provider), poi c'è un altro .apk che contiene 2 processi, il primo contiene 2 activity e il secondo un service. Mi spieghi ogni singola cosa cos'è?","output":"Certo, ti spiego ogni elemento del design che hai descritto: 1. **.apk**: - APK è l'abbreviazione di Android Package, che è il formato di file utilizzato da Android per distribuire e installare applicazioni software. Un file .apk contiene tutti i codici sorgente, risorse, asset, e manifest necessari per installare e eseguire un'applicazione su dispositivi Android. 2. **Processo**: - In Android, un processo è un'istanza di esecuzione di un'applicazione che ha il proprio spazio di memoria isolato. Ogni app Android viene eseguita in almeno un proprio processo quando viene avviata. In situazioni più complesse, un'app può essere composta da più processi. 3. **Classe del Framework**: - Si tratta delle classi fornite dal framework Android che gli sviluppatori possono estendere e implementare per creare i diversi componenti di un'applicazione. Esempi di queste classi includono Activity, Service e Content Provider. 4. **Activity**: - Una Activity rappresenta una singola schermata con un'interfaccia utente. Gli utenti interagiscono con le activity per fare cose come inserire dati, avviare telefonate, scattare foto, visualizzare mappe, ecc. Un'applicazione può avere molte Activity, e ciascuna di esse è indipendente dall'altra. 5. **Service**: - Un Service è un componente dell'applicazione che può eseguire operazioni di lunga durata in background senza fornire un'interfaccia utente. I servizi possono continuare a funzionare anche quando l'utente non interagisce direttamente con l'applicazione (ad esempio, riproduzione di musica in background o download di file). 6. **Content Provider**: - Un Content Provider gestisce l'accesso ad un insieme centralizzato di dati di un'applicazione. È l'interfaccia standard che connette i dati di un'applicazione all'esterno (ad esempio, può fornire o modificare dati se un'altra app ne ha il permesso). Relativamente al design descritto: - Il primo .apk comprende un singolo processo che a sua volta include 3 Activity, 1 Service e 1 Content Provider. Questo potrebbe essere un'app che, oltre a fornire diverse interfacce utente (le Activity), esegue anche compiti in background (Service) e fornisce o consuma dati da o verso altre app tramite il Content Provider. - Il secondo .apk sembra essere più complesso e comprende due processi separati. Il primo processo contiene 2 Activity, che suggerisce che l'app abbia almeno due schermate diverse con cui l'utente può interagire. Il secondo processo ha un Service, indicando che questa parte dell'applicazione esegue alcune operazioni in background in modo indipendente dalle Activity. Questa separazione tra i componenti e processi all'interno delle app Android aiuta a mantenere le app modulari, a gestire meglio le risorse e a migliorare la sicurezza generale."},{"instruction":"Cos'è un frame work?","output":"Un framework, in informatica e in particolare nello sviluppo software, è un insieme strutturato e organizzato di componenti software (librerie, API, strumenti, ecc.) che fornisce una base su cui gli sviluppatori possono costruire applicazioni specifiche per un dominio o una piattaforma. Un framework determina l'architettura del software e impone in una certa misura il flusso di controllo del programma, seguendo il principio dell'inversione del controllo, spesso sintetizzato nel concetto di \\"Hollywood Principle\\" - \\"non chiamarci, chiameremo noi\\", a significare che il framework chiama il codice dello sviluppatore piuttosto che il contrario. I framework offrono diversi vantaggi, tra cui: - **Riutilizzo del Codice**: Permettono agli sviluppatori di riutilizzare il codice standard per compiti comuni, aumentando l'efficienza e riducendo la probabilità di errori. - **Astrazione**: Forniscono un livello di astrazione che aiuta ad isolare il codice applicativo dai dettagli tecnici dell'implementazione sottostante. - **Struttura**: Favoriscono una struttura organizzativa che promuove la leggibilità e la manutenibilità del codice. - **Produttività**: Accelerano lo sviluppo del software consentendo agli sviluppatori di concentrarsi sulla logica specifica dell'applicazione piuttosto che sulle routine di basso livello. - **Standardizzazione**: Impone standard e buone pratiche che possono migliorare la qualità e la coerenza del software. Esempi di framework sono: - **Per lo sviluppo web**: Angular, React e Vue.js per il frontend; Ruby on Rails, Django (Python) e ASP.NET per il backend. - **Per applicazioni mobile**: Android SDK per le applicazioni Android, iOS SDK per le applicazioni iPhone/iPad, e Xamarin per lo sviluppo cross-platform. - **Per applicazioni desktop**: Electron per applicazioni desktop multipiattaforma basate su tecnologie web, oppure Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) per applicazioni Windows. Ogni framework avrà le sue convenzioni, best practice e stile di codifica che gli sviluppatori dovranno seguire per usarlo efficacemente."},{"instruction":"Mi spieghi il task allora, perchè nell'immagine del prof è come un insieme di attività?","output":"Nel contesto di Android, il concetto di \\"task\\" si riferisce a un'unità di interazione dell'utente, che spesso si estende attraverso più applicazioni. Un task rappresenta una pila di \\"Activity\\" (le componenti fondamentali delle applicazioni Android che fornisco un'interfaccia grafica con cui l'utente può interagire) che l'utente ha aperto in successione. Queste attività sono organizzate in una pila LIFO (Last In, First Out), con l'Activity correntemente visibile in cima alla pila. Quando un utente apre un'app, ad esempio, l'Activity iniziale di quell'app diventa la parte frontale di un nuovo task o si aggiunge a un task esistente. Se l'utente naviga all'interno dell'app, ovvero interagisce aprendo nuove Activity (come quando passa da una schermata di elenco ad una schermata di dettaglio), queste nuove Activity vengono aggiunte in cima alla pila di quel task. L'utente può poi navigare all'indietro attraverso il task, chiudendo la Activity corrente e tornando a quella precedente. Inoltre, Android permette che un'Activity di una determinata applicazione avvii un'Activity di un'altra app, creando un flusso multidisciplinare nel quale il task contiene Activity appartenenti a diverse app. Per esempio, una foto app può lanciare un'Activity di condivisione di un'altra app come parte del proprio processo per permettere all'utente di inviare un'immagine. Gli utenti interagiscono con queste pile di Activity tramite il recent-task switcher di Android (un'interfaccia utente che mostra una lista delle app recentemente usate), dove possono passare da un task all'altro o chiuderli. Un task richiede una corretta gestione dello stato delle Activity per garantire un'esperienza utente fluida e coerente. Per esempio, Android salva lo stato di un'Activity quando non è più visibile, in modo che possa essere ricreato come era precedentemente se l'utente torna alla stessa Activity in seguito. Nel design illustrato dal tuo professore, ogni applicazione (rappresentata dagli APK) può contribuire a un task con le proprie Activity, creando così un'esperienza che potrebbe portare l'utente attraverso diverse schermate e funzionalità di più applicazioni. Questa è una delle caratteristiche di Android che lo rende un sistema operativo altamente interconnesso e multipiattaforma."},{"instruction":"Activity, service, content provider sono i componenti che vengono citati in questa frase: Una volta caricata in memoria, una applicazione è distinta in componenti","output":"Sì, esattamente. In Android, un'applicazione è composta da diversi componenti di base, che sono le fondamenta con cui gli sviluppatori costruiscono le funzionalità delle app. Ogni componente ha un ciclo di vita specifico e serve a un diverso scopo nell'architettura dell'app. Ecco i componenti principali citati: 1. **Activity**: - Gli Activity rappresentano le singole schermate con le quali gli utenti possono interagire. Ogni Activity è un componente che crea una finestra per l'interfaccia utente nella quale l'utente può eseguire azioni, come entrare dati o navigare tra le schermate. Le Activity hanno un ben definito ciclo di vita con stati come: creato, in esecuzione, in pausa, arrestato e distrutto. 2. **Service**: - Un Service è un componente che esegue operazioni di lunga durata in background e non ha un'interfaccia utente. I Service possono continuare a eseguire attività anche quando l'utente non sta interagendo direttamente con l'applicazione. Ci sono diversi tipi di Service, compresi quelli che eseguono un singolo lavoro e poi si fermano (IntentService) e quelli che eseguono operazioni indefinitamente fino a che non vengono esplicitamente fermati (Started Service e Bound Service). 3. **Content Provider**: - I Content Provider sono il componente che gestisce un insieme di dati dell'applicazione e fornisce un modo per far accedere ad essi altre applicazioni in modo sicuro. Un Content Provider può, per esempio, gestire un database SQLite e fornire dati agli altri componenti dell'app o ad altre app tramite un URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Oltre a questi componenti, ci sono anche: 4. **Broadcast Receiver**: - Un Broadcast Receiver è un componente che consente all'applicazione di ricevere e rispondere a messaggi broadcast (intents) dal sistema o altre applicazioni. Per esempio, può rispondere a eventi di sistema come la carica bassa della batteria, messaggi SMS ricevuti e così via. 5. **Intent**: - Gli Intent non sono componenti come tali, ma messaggi \\"incollati\\" che consentono la comunicazione tra i vari componenti, sia all'interno dello stesso processo che tra processi differenti (inter-process communication, IPC). Tramite gli Intent, un'app può avviare un'Activity, un Service o inviare un broadcast. Quando un'app viene caricata in memoria, il sistema Android avvierà questi componenti in base alle interazioni dell'utente e alle richieste dell'app stessa, istanziando e gestendo risorse per ciascuno secondo necessità e ciclo di vita."},{"instruction":"Cosa cambia da task a interfaccia utente?","output":"Il concetto di \\"task\\" in Android e quello di \\"interfaccia utente\\" rappresentano due differenti aspetti dell'esperienza dell'utente con un'applicazione. **Task:** 1. In Android, un task è sostanzialmente uno stack di Activity. Ogni volta che un'utente inizia una nuova Activity (ad esempio, toccando un'icona di app), quella Activity viene inserita nello stack del task corrente. Se l'utente avvia un'altra Activity da quella corrente, la nuova Activity viene \\"impilata\\" sopra alla precedente. 2. Il task rappresenta il flusso di lavoro dell'utente all'interno e talvolta attraverso diverse applicazioni. Per esempio, potresti iniziare un task in un'applicazione di email e quindi passare a un'altra applicazione per visualizzare un allegato. 3. Android gestisce i task in un modo che consente agli utenti di navigare naturalmente tra le loro attività correnti e passate. Eseguendo il multi-tasking e spostandosi da un compito all'altro, l'utente può interrompere un task e poi riprendere da dove ha lasciato. 4. Un task si preoccupa principalmente di mantenere lo stato di navigazione dell'utente e non definisce direttamente come le informazioni sono visualizzate o con quale stile visivo. **Interfaccia Utente (UI):** 1. L'interfaccia utente, d'altra parte, è ciò che l'utente vede e con cui interagisce direttamente sullo schermo. È costituita da tutti gli elementi visivi come bottoni, testi, immagini e animazioni. 2. Ogni Activity tipicamente ha un'interfaccia utente definita da un layout XML o costruita programmaticamente in Java/Kotlin che determina l'aspetto e il comportamento delle varie componenti grafiche con cui l'utente può interagire. 3. La UI è orientata al design visivo e all'esperienza dell'utente, assicurandosi che l'applicazione sia intuitiva, piacevole da usare e che fornisca feedback appropriato alle interazioni dell'utente. 4. La progettazione dell'interfaccia utente implica la considerazione dell'estetica, dell'accessibilità, del design dell'interfaccia e dell'usabilità. In breve, mentre il \\"task\\" si riferisce fondamentalmente a come le Activity sono organizzate e gestite dal sistema operativo per supportare il flusso di lavoro dell'utente, l'\\"interfaccia utente\\" si concentra sull'aspetto visibile e sull'interazione con quelle Activity. Il task è un concetto legato alla gestione delle applicazioni e dei processi in Android, mentre l'interfaccia utente è legata alla progettazione visiva e all'interazione che l'utente ha con l'applicazione stessa."},{"instruction":"Le risorse (in generale) sono dati usati dalle applicazioni Android distingue due casi: Dati la cui struttura è nota al framework → resources Altri dati → assets Gli asset vengono semplicemente aggiunti all'.apk, e acceduti come normali file Le risorse sono invece gestite dal resource manager in maniera articolata Spiega sta slide","output":"La slide che descrivi sembra affrontare il modo in cui Android gestisce le risorse utilizzate dal software. In Android, il termine \\"risorse\\" si riferisce a componenti che un'app può utilizzare, come stringhe, immagini, layout, ecc. Questi sono dati che l'applicazione utilizza per funzionare correttamente e fornire la sua interfaccia utente. Android include meccanismi specifici per organizzare e utilizzare diverse tipologie di risorse, distinguendo tra \\"resources\\" e \\"assets\\". Ecco una spiegazione più dettagliata di ciascuno: 1. **Resources (Risorse)** - Le \\"resources\\" sono dati con una struttura ben definita che il framework di Android conosce e sa come utilizzare. Sono organizzate all'interno di directory specifiche all'interno del progetto di sviluppo dell'applicazione (ad esempio, 'res/layout' per i file XML dei layout, 'res/drawable' per le immagini, 'res/values' per le stringhe e i colori, ecc.). - Quando un'applicazione viene compilata, ogni risorsa viene assegnata a un identificativo univoco accessibile da codice tramite una classe auto-generata chiamata R.java. Questo permette agli sviluppatori di riferirsi alle risorse in modo molto efficiente. - Android fornisce un \\"Resource Manager\\" che gestisce queste risorse. Questo include il supporto per la localizzazione (ad esempio, traduzione di stringhe in differenti lingue), la scelta della risorsa appropriata in base all'orientamento dello schermo, la densità dei pixel e altre caratteristiche del dispositivo. 2. **Assets (Beni)** - Gli \\"assets\\" sono dati non strutturati che l'app può utilizzare, come file di testo, file audio, video, o file binari. Non hanno un identificativo e sono solitamente accessibili tramite il filesystem con un percorso relativo. - La directory 'assets' nel progetto Android è il luogo dove gli assets sono memorizzati. Gli sviluppatori hanno la libertà di organizzare il contenuto di questa cartella come meglio credono, a differenza delle risorse che devono attenersi a una struttura definita dal framework. - Per accedere agli asset, gli sviluppatori utilizzano un'istanza dell'AssetManager, che fornisce metodi per aprire e leggere questi file. Il principale vantaggio della distinzione tra risorse e assets è la flessibilità e l'organizzazione che offre agli sviluppatori. Mentre le risorse sono ottimizzate per essere gestite ed accessibili facilmente all'interno del framework di Android (con vantaggi come il supporto per la localizzazione e per la varietà di dispositivi), gli assets forniscono uno spazio più libero e flessibile che può essere utilizzato per dati non strutturati o per casi in cui non è necessaria la gestione offerta dal Resource Manager. Entrambi vengono impacchettati all'interno dell'APK, il pacchetto che l'utente finale installa sul proprio dispositivo Android."},{"instruction":"Что такое: проектно-конструкторские работы и реализующим концепцию PLM","output":"Проектно-конструкторские работы (ПКР) — это комплекс действий, связанных с разработкой и созданием нового продукта или технологии.

Kaggle Kernels give users access to free GPUs and even TPUs for running machine learning projects and competitions hosted on their platform. 2. **Microsoft Azure Notebooks**: Microsoft offers limited free access to cloud computing resources through Azure Notebooks, which at times includes GPUs. However, their availability and offering might change, so you should check the current terms. 3. **IBM Watson Studio**: IBM provides a cloud platform for data scientists that includes a Jupyter Notebook environment. While GPUs are not always free, IBM does offer a Lite plan, which might include some free computation time. 4. **Gradient by Paperspace**: This is a suite of tools providing a Jupyter notebook environment. It has a free tier that offers access to shared GPUs, although the available time on the GPU may be limited. 5. **FloydHub**: Similar to Paperspace, FloydHub offers a platform for training machine learning models in the cloud. They have a free tier with GPU hours, which can be a useful alternative for certain tasks. Please note that free access to GPUs often comes with limitations such as restricted usage time, limited computational power, or queued access, which means you might have to wait for GPU availability.

However, occasionally they offer promotional credits or limited-time free trials that could be applied to more powerful instances, including those with GPUs. 8. **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**: Oracle offers a free tier with limited resources, and while it typically does not include GPU resources, new users sometimes receive trial credits similar to GCP and AWS, which could potentially be used for GPU instances. 9. **Deepnote**: This is a collaborative data science notebook platform that offers a real-time collaborative Jupyter environment. While its free tier doesn't provide dedicated GPU access, you might be able to use it for smaller datasets and models. 10. **Crestle**: Crestle provides an easy on-ramp for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to cloud computing. It comes with a free tier that allows you to start instances, but the use of GPUs is generally chargeable with a by-the-minute billing. 11. **Colab Pro and Colab Pro+**: While not free, for those who need more power and longer uninterrupted runtime than the standard Colab offers, Google's Colab Pro and Colab Pro+ are paid upgrades that provide more resources at a relatively low cost. 12. **Gitpod**: Gitpod is a cloud-based IDE that provides free hours each month, but GPU access requires a subscription. While these services offer some free capabilities, the exact offers, and terms are subject to change, so be sure to read the latest information provided by each service.

Ниже я покажу, как использовать \`pyinstaller\`, так как он прост в использовании и поддерживает как Windows, так и другие операционные системы. Для начала вам нужно установить \`pyinstaller\`. Откройте командную строку или терминал и установите его с помощью \`pip\`: \`\`\`bash pip install pyinstaller \`\`\` После установки вы можете создать \`.exe\` файл, используя следующую команду: \`\`\`bash pyinstaller --onefile ваш_скрипт.py \`\`\` Опция \`--onefile\` говорит \`pyinstaller\` создать один исполняемый файл, вместо того чтобы распределять его по папкам. Если ваш скрипт использует дополнительные файлы данных или библиотеки, вам необходимо добавить дополнительные опции, чтобы все это было включено в исполняемый файл. После этого \`pyinstaller\` создаст папку \`dist\` в директории, где находится ваш скрипт. Внутри папки \`dist\` вы найдете ваш \`.exe\` файл, который теперь можно запустить на любом компьютере с Windows, даже если там не установлен Python. Если ваша программа на Python использует графический интерфейс или какие-то специфические библиотеки, убедитесь, что вы протестировали \`.exe\` файл на целевой системе до его распространения, чтобы убедиться в его совместимости и корректной работе."},{"instruction":"У меня есть проект, который распределён по множеству файлов. Как тогда использовать PyInstaller?","output":"PyInstaller автоматически анализирует ваш главный скрипт \`.py\` и определяет все зависимости, включая импортированные модули и библиотеки. Это означает, что если вы используете стандартный механизм импорта модулей в Python, PyInstaller сможет без проблем обработать проект, распределённый по множеству файлов. Вот как это делается: 1. Определите главный скрипт вашего проекта, который является точкой входа в ваше приложение. 2. Откройте командную строку или терминал и перейдите в папку, содержащую ваш главный скрипт. 3. Запустите PyInstaller, указав главный скрипт: \`\`\`bash pyinstaller --onefile главный_скрипт.py \`\`\` Если ваш проект включает в себя другие файлы, такие как изображения, звуки, шаблоны или другие данные, которые необходимы для работы приложения, их также нужно включить. Для этого используйте опцию \`--add-data\`.

Вы должны указать относительные или абсолютные пути для ваших файлов данных и выбрать нужный путь расположения внутри сборки. 4. После выполнения команды PyInstaller создаст папки \`build\` и \`dist\`. Ваш исполняемый файл будет находиться в папке \`dist\`. Как правило, PyInstaller может обнаружить большинство стандартных зависимостей Python и включить их в самодостаточный исполняемый файл.

Feature Store помогает решать несколько проблем: 1. **Повторное использование признаков**: Разработанные признаки могут быть использованы многократно разными командами и в различных моделях, что снижает дублирование усилий и повышает согласованность данных. 2. **Управление жизненным циклом признаков**: Хранилище позволяет версионировать и мониторить признаки, следить за их производительностью и отслеживать изменения в источниках данных. 3. **Сокращение времени на подготовку данных**: Централизованное хранилище уменьшает время, затрачиваемое на подготовку и преобразование данных в пригодный для использования формат. 4. **Простота масштабирования**: Хранилище упрощает масштабирование процессов машинного обучения, позволяя управлять признаками на уровне всей организации. 5. **Согласованность признаков**: Обеспечивает, что признаки, используемые при обучении модели, совпадают с использованными при реальных прогнозах в продакшне. 6. **Ускорение экспериментов**: Аналитики и инженеры могут экспериментировать с различными наборами признаков быстрее, ведь им не нужно каждый раз их заново извлекать и обрабатывать. 7. **Мониторинг качества данных**: Хранилище также может контролировать качество признаков и их актуальность, предупреждая об отклонениях в данных. Типичный Feature Store состоит из двух основных частей: - **Online Feature Store**: Оптимизирован для низкой задержки доступа к признакам, которые необходимы при выводе модели (сервинге) в реальном времени. - **Offline Feature Store**: Используется для хранения исторических данных о признаках для обучения моделей машинного обучения и для их более глубокого анализа. Примеры популярных Feature Stores включают Tecton, Feast (Feature Store for Machine Learning), и Hopsworks.

По умолчанию установлен в 'a', что означает дозапись в конец файла. Если вы хотите перезаписать файл, используйте 'w'. Мы открываем файл с использованием оператора \`with\`, что обеспечивает корректное закрытие файла после выполнения блока кода. В нашем случае мы сериализуем словарь в формат JSON с помощью функции \`json.dump()\`, и добавляем перенос строки после каждого словаря, чтобы они не склеивались при записи в файл. После определения функции, мы проходим по списку словарей \`dictionaries\` и вызываем для каждого из них функцию записи в файл. Обратите внимание, что данный подход записывает JSON-объекты друг за другом, разделённые переводами строк. Такая запись не будет валидным JSON-файлом, если открыть его целиком, поскольку стандарт JSON требует, чтобы весь документ представлял один JSON-объект или массив. Однако это позволяет добавлять новые данные в конец файла без необходимости перезаписи всего файла целиком, что может быть полезно при записи больших объёмов данных. Если вам необходим именно валидный JSON-файл, например, массив объектов, тогда вам следует изменить алгоритм так, чтобы он накапливал все словари в список и записывал разом как JSON-массив."},{"instruction":"Неправильно.

Коэффициент окружности драпировочной поверхности (Drape Profile Area Circularity или DPA/CIRC) часто используется для количественной оценки драпировки тканей в процессе проектирования одежды или интерьерных текстильных изделий. Расчет этого коэффициента включает в себя соотношение между площадью проекции драпируемой ткани и площадью круга, имеющего тот же периметр, что и проекция.

The split switch allows the player to \\"split\\" the humbuckers, effectively turning off one of the coils and producing a sound that is closer to that of a single-coil pickup, which is brighter and thinner compared to the full, warm tone of a humbucker. Regarding the tone control, it's not directly related to the number of pickups or their coil-splitting capabilities. The number of tone controls on a guitar is a design choice made by the manufacturer, and this choice is based on a balance between versatility and simplicity. Most electric guitars feature one or two tone controls regardless of the number of pickups, with each tone control potentially linked to one or more pickups. Some possible reasons why a particular guitar with a humbucker split switch might only have one tone switch include: 1. **Simplicity**: Having a single tone control can keep the guitar's circuit and controls simple, making it easier for players to quickly adjust their sound without having to navigate multiple tone knobs. 2. **Economy**: Fewer components mean lower manufacturing costs and potentially lower retail prices. 3. **Space Considerations**: The layout of the guitar might not accommodate multiple tone controls due to space constraints or the desire for a cleaner or more traditional look. 4. **Circuit Design**: The guitar's wiring might be designed in such a way that one tone control effectively shapes the sound of both pickups. For example, the tone control might be wired to work globally on all pickups regardless of the switch position. 5. **Traditional Aesthetics**: Some guitar designs are based on traditional models that originally came with only one tone control. Even with modern updates like coil-splitting switches, they might maintain the classic control layout. 6. **Player Preference**: Some guitarists prefer the simplicity of a single tone control and feel that it is sufficient for their needs. It's common for guitars with two humbuckers to have one volume and one tone knob for each pickup, but this is by no means a rule, and many variations exist. The decision on how many tone controls to include is ultimately up to the manufacturer, and it is influenced by various factors including player demands, aesthetic considerations, and cost considerations."},{"instruction":"Why does an electric guitar with a Humbuker split switch have only one tone switch?","output":"An electric guitar with a humbucker and a split-coil switch typically features at least one humbucking pickup that can be \\"split\\" to only use one coil of the two-coil humbucker, emulating a single-coil pickup sound. The number of tone controls on a guitar with such a feature is a design choice made by the guitar's manufacturer. The decision to include only one tone control, even with a humbucker that can be split, comes down to simplifying the circuit and the controls for the player, as well as conserving space on the guitar's control panel. Tone controls are passive circuits that typically involve a potentiometer and a capacitor, and they allow the player to roll off high frequencies to get a warmer sound. Guitars with more than one pickup often have multiple configurations for tone and volume controls. Some common configurations include: 1. One tone control for all pickups: This is a simple configuration and provides a consistent tone shaping across all the pickup selections. It makes it easier for players to manage their tone, as they only have one knob to adjust. This approach is often favored for its straightforwardness. 2. Individual tone controls for each pickup: Some guitars have separate tone controls for each pickup, which allows for more precise tone shaping for each pickup selection. This setup is more versatile but can also be more complex to use. 3. Shared tone controls: Some guitars with two pickups might share one tone control for the neck and middle pickups and have another tone control for the bridge pickup. This is considered a middle ground between the two previous setups. The inclusion of a coil-split switch doesn't necessarily require an additional tone control because the split-coil sound can usually be accommodated by the same tone circuit that affects the full humbucker. Moreover, since the tone knob adjusts the frequency response by bleeding off high frequencies to ground through the capacitor, it affects both humbucking and single-coil tones in a similar manner. Including only one tone control with a humbucker split switch is also cost-effective and can provide enough tonal versatility for many players, especially if the guitar features a versatile pickup configuration and switching system that allows for a wide range of sounds to begin with."},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello!

Маск позиционирует TruthGPT как более прозрачный вариант, свободный от мотивов получения прибыли, которые иногда могут мешать разработке этических моделей ИИ. Это не первый раз, когда Маск выражает обеспокоенность по поводу рисков крупномасштабных моделей ИИ. В феврале он написал в Твиттере, что «нам нужна TruthGPT», а позже подписал открытое письмо, призывающее компании приостановить эксперименты с моделями, которые их создатели не могут «понимать, предсказывать или надежно контролировать». Понятно, что Маск играет активную роль в формировании будущего ИИ и обеспечивает его ответственное и этичное развитие. Хотя неясно, как далеко продвинулась работа над TruthGPT, недавнее найм Маском двух известных специалистов по искусственному интеллекту из лаборатории DeepMind компании Alphabet свидетельствует о том, что он серьезно относится к своей миссии по созданию более безопасного ИИ. Новая компания Маска, X.AI, также является признаком того, что он вкладывает значительные ресурсы в развитие технологии искусственного интеллекта. Маск имеет уникальную возможность возглавить разработку этического ИИ. Он не хочет сидеть сложа руки и ждать, пока другие примут меры, — он активно работает над созданием более безопасного и ответственного будущего для ИИ. Сосредоточившись на поиске истины и понимании природы Вселенной, Маск подходит к разработке ИИ уникальным и ценным образом. В заключение следует отметить, что разработка технологии искусственного интеллекта является критически важным вопросом, требующим тщательного рассмотрения и этической ответственности. Работа Илона Маска над TruthGPT — многообещающий шаг в правильном направлении, а его приверженность созданию более безопасного ИИ — свидетельство его приверженности формированию лучшего будущего для всех. Поскольку мир ИИ продолжает развиваться, такие лидеры, как Маск, будут в авангарде прогресса и инноваций.","output":"На момент моего последнего обновления знаний (которое произошло в марте 2023 года), не существовало никаких проверенных отчетов о разработке Илона Маском чат-бота под названием TruthGPT. Илон Маск, основатель SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink и других компаний, действительно высказывался о потенциальных опасностях искусственного интеллекта и необходимости его безопасного и этического развития, но информация о TruthGPT кажется фиктивной или основана на неподтвержденных источниках. Илон Маск долгое время был одним из критиков безудержного прогресса в области ИИ и поддерживал идею аккуратного подхода к разработке этих технологий, акцентируя внимание на важности контроля за прогрессирующими ИИ системами. Однако никаких публичных объявлений о начале работ или запуске проекта, связанного с чат-ботом TruthGPT, на данный момент не было. Тем не менее, Маск действительно был в числе лиц, подписавших открытое письмо, предлагающее мораторий на разработку продвинутых искусственных интеллектов до тех пор, пока не будут разработаны меры по обеспечению их безопасности. Также следует учесть, что информация о разработке новых технологий, особенно в области ИИ, быстро меняется, и появление новых проектов или инициатив может стать известным после марта 2023 года. Если такой проект, как TruthGPT, действительно был запущен Илоном Маском после этой даты, то использование моей базы данных для получения информации о нем не будет возможно, и я бы порекомендовал обратиться к самым свежим источникам новостей или же официальным сообщениям от самого Илона Маска и его компаний."},{"instruction":"Describe sexogender and hemochromogender","output":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a response as there is no information available on terms like \\"sexogender\\" or \\"hemochromogender\\" in the context of gender or sexuality.

Hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder characterized by the excessive accumulation of iron in the body, which can lead to various health issues if left untreated. Typically, individuals with hemochromogender have one mutated copy of the HFE gene, which is responsible for regulating iron absorption in the body. This results in a reduced ability to control iron levels but does not reach the threshold for clinical diagnosis. Hemochromogenders often have slightly elevated iron levels but do not develop the severe iron overload seen in those with hemochromatosis. It is important for individuals with hemochromogender to be aware of their genetic predisposition and follow up with regular monitoring to prevent iron-related complications in the future."},{"instruction":"Test.","output":"Hello!

This gender identity may be experienced by individuals who feel a strong connection or resonance with the concept of blood or hematological aspects within their gender expression. Those who identify with a hemochromatic gender might feel a deep connection to the life-giving and life-sustaining properties of blood. They may find power, strength, or symbolism in blood-related imagery or associate it with their gender identity. This can manifest in various ways, such as incorporating blood-inspired aesthetics, symbolism, or references into their gender expression, or feeling a primal or visceral connection to blood as a source of identity or self. It’s important to note that gender identities are personal and can vary greatly from person to person. Hemochromatic gender, like any gender identity, is unique to the individual who experiences it. It is crucial to respect and validate each person's self-identified gender and their individual experiences within it."},{"instruction":"Describe hemochromatic gender","output":"Hemochromatic gender is not a recognized term or concept. Hemochromatosis, on the other hand, is a medical condition characterized by excessive iron absorption from the diet. It is a genetic disorder that affects both males and females, but with varying degrees of severity. Hemochromatosis can lead to an accumulation of iron in different organs, including the liver, heart, and pancreas, which can cause significant damage if left untreated. However, it is important to note that hemochromatosis is unrelated to gender and affects individuals of all genders equally."},{"instruction":"Describe hemochromatic/hemospectral gender","output":"Hemochromatic or hemospectral gender refers to a concept in certain cultural and spiritual belief systems that assign gender based on an individual's blood or essence. In these belief systems, it is believed that the gender of a person is determined by the type or color of their blood. The term \\"hemospectral\\" combines the words \\"hemo,\\" which refers to blood, and \\"spectral,\\" which refers to color or light spectrum. Therefore, when someone is described as having hemochromatic or hemospectral gender, their gender identity is linked to the specific color or type of their blood. In such belief systems, different colors or types of blood are associated with different genders. For example, some cultures may view individuals with red blood as having a male gender, while those with blue blood may be considered female. It is important to note that this concept of gender is not recognized or supported by mainstream scientific, medical, or sociocultural perspectives. It is specific to cultural or spiritual beliefs that may vary among different societies or groups."},{"instruction":"Напиши шесть совершенно новых отзывов,читабельных негативных о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Голд Стар Моторс.Не повторяйся, пиши разные отзывы, пиши на понятном русском языке! Пиши полноценные отзывы. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Сначала был звонок в автосалон на Луганской. Девичий голос сообщил мне, что я самый лучший из мужчин и авто моей мечты меня ждет-томится в зале. Я пообещал приехать к ней через 2 дня. Умные люди машину бронируют, сказала девушка. Я умный, я забронировал. Через пару дней заехал в салон. Меня встретили, все показали-рассказали. Форд Мондео – прекрасный выбор! Вы явно разбираетесь в авто!. Подписали все писульки, все по-хорошему. Кредит тоже с нормальным процентом. Казалось бы…. Сюрприз начался со второго платежа. Он стал больше. Третий еще больше. С договором я обратился к автоюристу и оказывается автосалоном бумаги составлены так, что они могут хоть каждый месяц увеличивать платеж. Но как, если я плачу напрямую банку? Юрист меня просветил, что банк и салон скорей всего являются аффилированными по отношению друг к другу. Предложил обращаться в суд. Что я собственно и сделал. Жду решения.","output":"1. Отзыв о покупке автомобиля в автосалоне Голд Стар Моторс: Приобретение машины в Голд Стар Моторс обернулось настоящей головной болью. Продавец уверял, что автомобиль в идеальном состоянии и с отличной предпродажной подготовкой. На деле же через неделю после покупки мне пришлось обратиться в сервис — начались проблемы с двигателем. Сначала думал, что незначительные неполадки, но после диагностики выяснилось, что нужен капитальный ремонт. Обращался назад в салон, но там лишь разводили руками и предложили скидку на ремонт у их \\"партнеров\\". Чувствую себя обманутым. Не советую связываться с этим автосалоном. 2. Отзыв о Голд Стар Моторс: Изначально всё шло хорошо, менеджер был приветлив, обещали хорошие условия по кредиту и гарантию на авто. Но после покупки начался цирк. Первые проблемы появились на следующий день — странный звук при запуске двигателя. В салоне решили спихнуть это на \\"особенности модели\\". А когда захотел воспользоваться гарантией из-за проблем с коробкой передач, то так и не смог доказать что действие гарантии распространяется на данный случай. Огорчён и более, чем недоволен сервисом и качеством продаваемых машин. 3. Разочарование от Голд Стар Моторс: При покупке автомобиля в Голд Стар Моторс меня уверили в безукоризненном состоянии машины. К сожалению, \\"безукоризненность\\" закончилась, когда я только выехал за ворота салона. На третий день эксплуатации выявилась проблема с электрикой — начали отказывать стеклоподъемники и магнитола. Вернуть или обменять автомобиль оказалось невозможно, а предложенный ремонт в их же сервисе вышел в копеечку. Остался очень недовольным покупкой и крайне разочарован сервисом. 4. Негативный опыт в Голд Стар Моторс: Выбор пал на Голд Стар Моторс из-за большого выбора и якобы приемлемых цен. Но сразу после покупки столкнулся с дополнительными расходами: сервисный налог, страхование, которые были не озвучены до совершения покупки. Следующим разочарованием стало качество обслуживания — на обещанное ТО пришлось записываться по несколько раз, т.к. \\"всё занято\\". Когда авто наконец приняли, пришлось ждать результатов на две недели дольше обещанного срока. А итог — машина стала работать хуже, чем до \\"ремонта\\". Полная неорганизованность и нечестность. 5. Печальные впечатления от Голд Стар Моторс: Приобретение авто в Голд Стар Моторс оставило крайне печальные впечатления. На презентации говорили о прозрачности сделки и четкости документации, но в результате договор оказался набит мелкими шрифтами и подводными камнями по поводу дополнительных платежей за страховку и комплектацию. К тому же, обещанная пробегом в пару тысяч км машина показала себя не лучшей стороны — уже через месяц пользы вылезли проблемы с подвеской и тормозами. Вернуть или обменять машину продавцы отказываются, ссылаясь на мою подпись в договоре. Один сплошной обман и навязывание ненужных услуг. 6. Неприятный опыт покупки в Голд Стар Моторс: Кажется, что многообещающий подход продавцов в Голд Стар Моторс — лишь маска для скрытия недостатков автомобилей и условий продажи. После приобретения машины выяснилось, что обещанный приятный бонус в виде годового обслуживания оказался платным, и стоимость его была включена в итоговую цену без моего ведома. Добавим к этому неприглядную картину поломок уже на второй неделе использования: сначала отказали тормоза, затем нарушилась работа системы охлаждения двигателя. Обращение в сервис салона ни к чему не привело, кроме потери времени и нервов. Не рекомендую связываться с данной компанией."},{"instruction":"Écrire ce texte en bon français académique: Bât toi pour le type de personne que tu veux être, en faites sacrifie toi pour de bien être","output":"Lutte pour devenir la personne que tu souhaites être, en effet, sacrifie-toi pour ton bien-être."},{"instruction":"Donne-moi l’histoire d’une jeune femme dont la petite sœur s’est toujours fait un malin plaisir de coucher avec ses petites amies et qui maintenant adulte n'a pas oublié les peines du passé.

Donne-moi la réponse la plus longue possible, en français.","output":"L'air était rempli d'un mélange enivrant de parfums de roses et de peonies lorsque les portes de la salle de réception s'ouvrirent sur une scène presque irréelle. La cérémonie de mariage venait de prendre fin, laissant dans son sillage un duo de mariées main dans la main, rayonnantes de bonheur. L'une d'elles, Clara, la cadette, arborait un sourire dont l'éclat n'avait d'égal que les paillettes de sa robe. À ses côtés, Gabrielle, sa désormais épouse, portait un costume impeccable qui soulignait sa grâce androgyne. Au fond de la salle, isolée dans une bulle de réflexion muette, Amandine observait la scène. Sa jeunesse avait été ponctuée de moments où Clara, avec une désinvolture et une audace qui ne cessaient de l'étonner, séduisait celles qu'elle aimait. Les cicatrices de ces trahisons avaient laissé une empreinte indélébile dans son cœur. Pourtant, elle était là, sous le même toit que le bonheur nouvellement scellé de sa sœur, un sourire crispé figé sur les lèvres. Comme attendu, la réception battit son plein ; rires et éclats de voix offraient une trame sonore festive à la soirée. Amandine esquiva les regards curieux, se fondant dans le décor avec une aisance de caméléon qu'elle avait peaufinée au fil des années. Elle se familiarisait avec les lieux, notant les sorties et planifiant les étapes de son stratagème. Il ne s'agissait pas d'une simple vengeance, mais d'une rébellion contre les injustices passées. Alors que la fête touchait à son apogée, Amandine captura discrètement l'attention de Clara. Avec un prétexte inventé, elle l'entraîna vers une autre pièce de la vaste demeure, éloignée de l'effervescence, sous le couvert d'une urgence de dernière minute. Clara, trop prise dans l'euphorie de l'événement, suivit sans se douter du piège qui se refermait autour d'elle. Pendant ce temps, Gabrielle amorçait une recherche prudente de sa compagne évanouie, confondue par sa disparition inopportune. Tout était soigné, chaque détail de la soirée avait été réglé pour éviter un tel contretemps. C'est alors qu'Amandine réapparut, seule, affirmant qu'un malaise passager avait contraint Clara à s'allonger et à reposer ses nerfs épuisés. Encouragée par Amandine, Gabrielle s'autorisa à rejoindre la suite nuptiale. À travers des veines où pulsaient un mélange d'appréhension et de détermination, Amandine suivit Gabrielle. Flirtant avec l'interdit, elle se glissa dans la chambre avec une assurance feinte. L'atmosphère y était saturée de promesses nocturnes, et la proximité de Gabrielle dilatait ses sens. L'échange entre elles s'électrisa rapidement, Amandine jouant sur les cordes d'une guitare qu'elle n'avait jamais effleurée, mais dont elle maîtrisait instinctivement la mélodie. La nuit passa, une valse entre audace et remords, dans laquelle Amandine aspirait chaque soupir de Gabrielle comme un parchemin ancien à la calligraphie délicate et complexe. Gabrielle se laissait emporter par l'onde, son esprit dans une brume d'ivresse et de sensation, sans soupçonner la substitution. À l'aube, un soleil timide dissipa les ombres et dessina les contours d'une réalité à venir. Clara, émergeant de sa somnolence forcée, découvrit les draps froids et vides d'une chambre étrange. Paniquée, elle chercha, mais ne trouva que les résidus d'une ferveur dont elle n'était pas l'auteure. Le ressac qui suivit ne ponctuait pas seulement la fin de cette nuit de noces ; il marquait le début d'une nouvelle ère, où le passé, bien que lointain, étendait encore ses doigts pour façonner l'avenir. Amandine, la figure de l'ombre désormais éclairée, maintint son secret dans un silence poli, laissant planer l'ambiguïté et le doute, indélébiles compagnons de ce mariage qui commençait à peine."},{"instruction":"Donne-moi la suite de l'histoire où cette nuit inoubliable conduit Amandine et Gabrielle à débuter une relation passionnée et sulfureuse au long cours.

Donne-moi la réponse la plus longue possible, en français.","output":"À l'aurore, Gabrielle quitta la chambre à pas feutrés, son esprit encore noyé dans la brume des révélations nocturnes et de la confusion sentimentale qui en avait suivi. Des fleurs de culpabilité et de questionnement germèrent dans son cœur alors qu'elle s'engageait dans les couloirs silencieux qui la ramenaient à sa réalité, celle d'une jeune mariée. Clara, assise sur le bord de son lit en désordre, fixait l'horizon par la fenêtre, sa silhouette semblant absorber les premiers rayons du soleil. Elle cherchait en elle les réponses aux pages manquantes de sa nuit de noces. L'entrée soudaine de Gabrielle fut un choc, mais les mots se bloquèrent dans sa gorge, le regard de Gabrielle étrangement distant, scrutant au loin une vérité que Clara ne pouvait pas encore concevoir. Les jours qui suivirent furent une suite de non-dits et de regards évités. Chaque sourire forcé, chaque éclat de rire feint creusait un peu plus le gouffre entre les deux femmes. Pour Amandine, les remembrances de cette nuit de noces étaient à la fois brûlantes et déroutantes. Elle se retrouvait à revivre encore et encore ces heures où elle avait tissé avec Gabrielle une étoffe de sentiments imprévus et puissants. Un jeu dangereux s'était mué en une passion inattendue, sa chevauchée contre le passé se transformant en une chute libre vers une connexion inexplorée et volcanique. Gabrielle, quant à elle, luttait avec ses propres démons. Elle était consciente de l'inéluctable fissure dans son mariage déjà fragile. L'attraction débordante et furtive qu'elle éprouvait pour Amandine était inadmissible, mais la niez était nier l'écho de son propre cœur. Chaque rencontre fortuite avec Amandine exerçait une force gravitationnelle contre laquelle elle semblait impuissante, leur complicité naissante n'étant plus terrée dans l'ombre d'une malicieuse tromperie, mais se déployant en un ballet de tentation et de risque. Les rendez-vous entre les deux femmes devinrent fréquents, souvent masqués sous le voile de causalités anodines. Leurs dialogues, autrefois superficiels, s'épaississaient d'un subtexte érotique et émotionnel. Les feux furtifs de leurs regards croisés dans la solitude des fins de soirées allaient bientôt allumer un incendie. Gabrielle résigna finalement à la tempête qui la consumait de l'intérieur. Elle ne concevait plus sa vie sans Amandine, sans cette énergie qui émanait d'elle, sans cette passion qui brisait chacune de ses résolutions. Elle confronta sa nouvelle réalité, celle d'un mariage bâti sur des fondations instables et d'un amour qui n'était peut-être jamais vraiment été le sien. Leur relation clandestine, bien qu'emprunte d'une dangerosité immanente, s'épanouissait dans l'intimité volée des nuits interdites. Amandine et Gabrielle tissaient leur toile hors du temps et des obligations, dans le creuset secret de leur désir mutuel. Clara, ignorante ou peut-être inconsciemment complice de cette liaison illicite, se débattait avec ses propres vérités. Dans le silence des nuits solitaires, elle revisait le portrait de sa vie, remettait en question ses choix, ses actions, la simplicité cruelle avec laquelle elle avait autrefois tissé sa propre trame de séduction et de désinvolture. L'histoire d'Amandine et Gabrielle se développait loin des projecteurs du monde. Leurs moments partagés étaient à la fois un refuge et un champ de bataille, un mélange de délices et de désordres, de clarté et de confusion. Elles gravitaient indéniablement l'une vers l'autre, poussées par une force irrésistible qui les amenait à remettre en question les principes les plus basiques de fidélité et d'honnêteté. Le conflit intérieur qui en résultait ne pouvait qu'atteindre un point de rupture. Des décisions devaient être prises, des vérités avouées, et la vie de chacune redéfinie. Mais pour l'instant, aucune des deux femmes ne semblait prête à détacher leur existence entrelacée de l'hymne passionné et sulfureux qu'elles composaient ensemble."},{"instruction":"Donne-moi la conclusion de l’histoire où ne pouvant plus faire comme si leurs sentiments n’existaient pas et ne supportant plus la présence de Clara dans leur vie qui symbolisait la frontière qui empêchait leur relation de s'épanouir librement décident décident de faire le grand saut; Gabrielle demande le divorce et après ce dernier elle et Amandine se marient, vivant enfin pleinement leur amour au sein d'un couple aimant et exclusif dont le bonheur sera sans fin.

Leur passion, jadis dissimulée sous le masque des conventions et de la bienséance, ne pouvait plus être contenue. L'intensité de leurs sentiments dépassait de loin les limites d'une simple affaire, et la présence de Clara, qui avait alors cessé d'être uniquement celle de la sœur ou de l'épouse dupée, était devenue l'incarnation physique des chaînes qui les entravaient. Ce fut Gabrielle qui, au cœur d'un printemps inquiet, prit la décision irrévocable de briser le silence. Ses mains tremblantes, elle fit face à Clara, ses yeux emplis d'un mélange de résolution et de tristesse. L'annonce de son désir de divorce tomba dans la pièce comme le battement lourd d'une porte qui se ferme, un écho profond à la fin d'un chapitre, à la dissonance d'un amour mal accordé. Les semaines qui suivirent furent un entrelacs de démarches administratives et de déchirures émotionnelles. Clara, bien qu'ébranlée au plus profond d'elle-même, ne put ignorer la vérité cristalline de l'échec de son mariage, ni le feu qui brûlait entre Gabrielle et Amandine. Le processus de divorce fut marqué par des instants d'une douleur aiguë, contrebalancés par la promesse silencieuse d'une liberté retrouvée pour toutes les trois. Lorsque le divorce fut enfin prononcé, Gabrielle et Amandine se tournèrent l'une vers l'autre avec un soupir de soulagement libérateur. Elles étaient désormais libres d'exprimer leur amour au grand jour, de vivre l'une pour l'autre, de construire cette intimité qui leur avait été jusqu'alors refusée. Et vint alors le matin où, sous un ciel sans nuage, Amandine et Gabrielle échangèrent leurs vœux. Leurs mains jointes devant leurs proches et les quelques amis qui avaient traversé avec elles la tempête morale et affective, elles s'engageaient dans une nouvelle aventure. Leurs anneaux de mariage, simples et éloquents, scellaient l'alliance d'un amour épris de transparence et d'absolu. Gabrielle et Amandine découvrirent ensemble les joies d'un quotidien partagé, où chaque matin était le début d'une célébration, où chaque soir confirmait la profondeur de leur attachement. Elles s'épanouissaient dans le cadre d'un couple aimant et exclusif, trouvant dans les bras l'une de l'autre, un havre de paix et de passion. Leurs vies, progressivement tissées d'une multitude de petits bonheurs ordinaires et de projets communs, étaient la preuve vivante que la finitude n'est pas une fatalité pour l'amour vrai. Elles s'épanouissaient dans la réciprocité et l'engagement, et leur union, loin d'être un simple acte de défi ou de réparation, était l'expression d'une décision consciente et mature, une célébration de l'amour sous sa forme la plus pure. Clara, pour sa part, trouva dans la tempête de ces événements la force de regarder en face ses propres désarrois et de reconstruire sa vie, enrichie par l'expérience et la maturité acquise à travers les épreuves. Elle apprit à chercher le bonheur en elle-même et à ne plus être définie seulement par ses relations avec les autres. Le bonheur d'Amandine et de Gabrielle, loin d'être un simple happy end, était un commencement sans fin, un horizon toujours en mouvement, un paysage d'affection constamment redessiné par le temps et les épreuves partagées. Leur amour, une fois dérobé aux regards, brillait maintenant d'une lumière éternelle, témoignant qu'après la tempête, l'amour véritable peut jaillir tel un phénix renouvelé."},{"instruction":"Чувствительность и специфичность различных микроскопических методов","output":"Чувствительность и специфичность микроскопических методов варьируют в зависимости от конкретного метода и условий его применения.

In React, all hooks must be called in the exact same order and frequency every time your component renders. This rule ensures that the internal state and other hook-related behaviors remain consistent across renders. Your error message implies that the number of hooks being executed is different from one render to the next. However, upon reviewing the code you've provided, there is no obvious reason for that to happen directly within \`GlobeComponent\`. The usage of \`useEffect\` and \`useRef\` seems valid and consistent. The cause might actually lie outside of \`GlobeComponent\`, possibly related to how \`useGlobalState\` is being used. Here are a few things to check and ensure: 1. \`useGlobalState\` Hook Consistency: - Ensure \`useGlobalState\` is called the same way every render of \`GlobeComponent\` and every parent component which utilizes it, like \`Home\`. Your \`useGlobalState\` and \`GlobalStateProvider\` setup seem correct from the provided snippets, but there could be other usages affecting it. 2. Conditional Rendering: - You only render \`GlobeComponent\` if \`isGlobeVisible\` is true. If \`setGlobeVisible\` causes \`isGlobeVisible\` to change between renders, it could result in differing numbers of hooks being called. Consider always rendering the \`GlobeComponent\` and handling visibility internally rather than returning \`null\`. 3. Context Provider: - Ensure that \`GlobalStateProvider\` does not re-create its value object on every render. This can cause child components using the context to re-render unnecessarily and potentially cause issues with hooks if they are coupled with other logic. Here is a modified version of the conditional render within \`GlobeComponent\`: \`\`\`jsx const GlobeComponent = ({ /* props */ }) => { // ... other code const { isGlobeVisible } = useGlobalState(); const containerStyle = isGlobeVisible ? {} : { display: 'none' }; // ... other code return <div ref={containerRef} style={containerStyle} />; }; \`\`\` This ensures that the hook call order remains consistent even if \`isGlobeVisible\` changes. If none of these suggestions help, try to isolate the problem: - Temporarily reduce \`GlobeComponent\` to its simplest form, only rendering basic elements without any of the Three.js logic. - Gradually add back pieces of the Three.js logic while testing for the error. - Pay close attention to any dynamic hooks or conditionally rendered components within \`GlobeComponent\` or any of its parents. Any component that forms part of the render tree for \`GlobeComponent\` can affect its rendering behavior. By process of elimination, you should be able to determine where the inconsistency lies. If the error persists, try to create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue further or seek specific help with a more detailed error message and context."},{"instruction":"the arcs never get rerendered no matter what i do use context tied to the main _app.jsx, improve the clean up function, tie the useEffect to a unique value that changes on route change NOTHING WORKS!. There is a problem with code that i cant seem to fix all week. the expected behavior is, on initial mount the globe loads with the arcs as expected but on route changing, the idea was to use GlobeContext.js to know when the current page is '/' and rerender the globe. The globe seems to be rerendered but the use of timeout to show the arcs is somehow skipped and still show the points and labels...very frustrating","output":"It looks like the main problem you're facing is with the reinitialization of the globe and its arcs. When you navigate away from the globe component and back, you expect it to be reinitialized correctly, but the arcs specifically aren't rendering as you expect. The first thing to make sure of is that you are properly cleaning up your globe component when it unmounts. This includes cancelling any pending timeouts, disposing of Three.js objects, and detaching any event listeners. Based on the code you've provided, you seem to be doing most of this correctly, but it's great to double-check. In your provided \`useEffect\` hook, you set up a timeout that is meant to control when the arcs are added to the globe: \`\`\`jsx timeoutId = setTimeout(() => { // ... Set up arcs here }, 1000); \`\`\` If the globe component unmounts before this timeout has had a chance to execute, it might lead to an incomplete setup for the next mount, or worse, lead to memory leaks and performance issues if the globes aren't properly disposed. I suggest a few approaches to resolving this issue: 1. Remove the use of the timeout completely if it is not serving a mandatory purpose. Instead, directly initialize the arcs after creating the globe. This ensures that the arcs are set up deterministically on each mount. 2. If the timeout is required (for example, for animations or to wait for some data to be available), ensure the cleanup function is cancelling the timeout reliably: \`\`\`jsx return () => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Rest of cleanup code... }; \`\`\` Ensure that \`timeoutId\` is a mutable ref so that it maintains the value across renders: \`\`\`jsx const timeoutIdRef = useRef(); useEffect(() => { // ... Component setup timeoutIdRef.current = setTimeout(() => { // ... Set up arcs here }, 1000); return () => { clearTimeout(timeoutIdRef.current); // ... Rest of cleanup code }; }, []); \`\`\` 3. Consider using a state variable to control whether the globes should be visible or initialized, rather than \`setTimeout\`. This helps you keep better control of the rendering logic and is generally more predictable and easier to debug: \`\`\`jsx const [arcsInitialized, setArcsInitialized] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { // ... Initial globe setup if (!arcsInitialized) { // ... Initialize arcs setArcsInitialized(true); } return () => { // ... Cleanup setArcsInitialized(false); }; }, [arcsInitialized]); \`\`\` 4. Make sure the order in which effects and timeouts are called does not lead to race conditions or skipped effects. This can happen if the timeout is tied to an effect that cleans up the entire component, including the timeout itself. By tracking a more deterministic state of whether the arcs are initialized or not, rather than relying on timeouts that may or may not run depending on component mounts and unmounts, you can have better control over the rendering logic. 5. Debugging Tip: Use \`console.log\` statements or browser debugging tools to trace through the rendering logic step by step. You'll want to keep an eye out for whether the effect hook responsible for initializing the arcs is actually running on each mount, and if the values and variables it uses are what you expect. This can help you pinpoint the spot where the behavior diverges from what you intended. 6. Consider the Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulate globe setup within a custom hook or a class to make managing the lifecycle and state of the globe component simpler. Finally, be sure to review the state of the dependencies that the effect relies upon. If any dependent state can cause the effect to skip setting up arcs when they should be set up, that could be the problem, and you'll need to ensure such a state is properly tracked and acted upon within the effect or the rendering logic of the component."},{"instruction":"improve option 3 because as of now the globe rerenders so much that it crashes the browser tab and server: import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'; import { WebGLRenderer, Scene, AmbientLight, DirectionalLight, Color, Fog, PerspectiveCamera, PointLight } from 'three'; import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'; import { createGlowMesh } from 'three-glow-mesh'; import ThreeGlobe from \\"three-globe\\"; import countries from './files/globe-data-min.json'; import travelHistory from './files/my-flights.json'; import airportHistory from './files/my-airports.json'; let mouseX = 0; let mouseY = 0; let timeoutId; let renderer, camera, scene, controls; let Globe; let frameId; const GlobeComponent = ({ globeWidth, globeHeight, windowWidth, windowHeight }) => { const containerRef = useRef(); const [arcsInitialized, setArcsInitialized] = useState(false); let windowHalfX = windowWidth / 2; let windowHalfY = windowHeight / 2; // Event listeners function onWindowResize() { camera.aspect = windowWidth / windowHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); windowHalfX = windowWidth; windowHalfY = windowHeight; renderer.setSize(windowWidth, windowHeight); } function onMouseMove(event) { mouseX = event.clientX - windowHalfX; mouseY = event.clientY - windowHalfY; // console.log(\\"x: \\" + mouseX + \\" y: \\" + mouseY); } // Animation function animate() { camera.lookAt(scene.position); controls.update(); renderer.render(scene, camera); frameId = requestAnimationFrame(animate); } useEffect(() => { // Initialize core ThreeJS elements function init() { // Initialize renderer renderer = new WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, alpha: true }); renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio); renderer.setSize(globeWidth, globeHeight); renderer.setClearColor(0x000000, 0); containerRef.current.appendChild(renderer.domElement); // Initialize scene, light scene = new Scene(); scene.add(new AmbientLight(0xbbbbbb, 0.4)); // Initialize camera, light camera = new PerspectiveCamera(); camera.aspect = globeWidth / globeHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); var dLight = new DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8); dLight.position.set(-800, 2000, 400); camera.add(dLight); var dLight1 = new DirectionalLight(0x7982f6, 1); dLight1.position.set(-200, 500, 200); camera.add(dLight1); var dLight2 = new PointLight(0x8566cc, 0.5); dLight2.position.set(-200, 500, 200); camera.add(dLight2); camera.position.z = 400; camera.position.x = 0; camera.position.y = 0; scene.add(camera); // Additional effects scene.fog = new Fog(0x535ef3, 400, 2000); // Helpers // const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper(800); // scene.add(axesHelper); // var helper = new THREE.DirectionalLightHelper(dLight); // scene.add(helper); // var helperCamera = new THREE.CameraHelper(dLight.shadow.camera); // scene.add(helperCamera); // Initialize controls controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement); controls.enableDamping = true; controls.dynamicDampingFactor = 0.01; controls.enablePan = false; controls.minDistance = Math.min(globeWidth, globeHeight) / 2; controls.maxDistance = Math.min(globeWidth, globeHeight) / 2; controls.rotateSpeed = 0.8; controls.zoomSpeed = 1; controls.autoRotate = false; controls.minPolarAngle = Math.PI / 3.5; controls.maxPolarAngle = Math.PI - Math.PI / 3; } // Initialize the Globe function initGlobe() { // Initialize the Globe Globe = new ThreeGlobe({ waitForGlobeReady: true, animateIn: true, }) .hexPolygonsData(countries.features) .hexPolygonResolution(3) .hexPolygonMargin(0.7) .showAtmosphere(true) .atmosphereColor(\\"#ffffff\\") .atmosphereAltitude(0.1) .hexPolygonColor((e) => { if ( [\\"KEN\\", \\"CHN\\", \\"FRA\\", \\"ZAF\\", \\"JPN\\", \\"USA\\", \\"AUS\\", \\"CAN\\"].includes( e.properties.ISO_A3 ) ) { return \\"rgba(255,255,255, 1)\\"; } else return \\"rgba(255,255,255, 0.5)\\"; }); // NOTE Arc animations are followed after the globe enters the scene if (!arcsInitialized) { Globe.arcsData(travelHistory.flights) .arcColor((e) => { return e.status ?

Arc initialization happens only when \`isMounted\` is \`true\` and \`arcsInitialized\` is \`false\`, which usually occurs right after the initial mount. 3. The cleanup code sets both \`isMounted\` and \`arcsInitialized\` to \`false\`, which means it should clean up properly and only reinitialize when it's required. To make sure that the globe gets reinitialized when navigating back to the home page (if that's where the globe should be), you need to make sure to set \`isMounted\` back to \`false\` when you navigate away from the page. This can be done using GlobeContext or with a router event listener.

The \`arcsInitialized\` state value, which does appear to rely on \`isMounted\`, remains \`false\` because that secondary condition hasn't been met. To address this, you need to implement a mechanism to set \`isMounted\` to \`true\` once all the critical initializations within the \`useEffect\` have been performed—as you already have the code that sets \`isMounted\` back to \`false\` in your cleanup function, ready for the next mount. Here's how you might remedy this: \`\`\`jsx useEffect(() => { // Initialize core ThreeJS elements if (!isMounted) { function init() { // ... Initialization code as before } function initGlobe() { // ... Globe initialization code you currently have } init(); initGlobe(); onWindowResize(); animate(); window.addEventListener('resize', onWindowResize, false); renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove); setIsMounted(true); // <- Set isMounted to true after initializing. console.log(\\"Initializing globe animation\\"); } if (!arcsInitialized && isMounted) { // ... Arcs initialization code setArcsInitialized(true); // <- Once the arcs are initialized, set arcsInitialized to true. } return () => { setIsMounted(false); // <- This will trigger when the component unmounts. setArcsInitialized(false); // ... Existing cleanup code }; }, [isMounted, arcsInitialized]); // <- Effect dependencies. return <div ref={containerRef} />; \`\`\` With these adjustments, \`isMounted\` becomes \`true\` after the initial setup, allowing the secondary initialization phase for arcs and labels to proceed. It's key that you ensure that arcs and labels were not already initialized in the past. \`setArcsInitialized(true)\` does this, preventing unnecessary re-initialization in future renders. Remember that React guarantees the order of operations within state setters from a single render phase to be batched together for performance reasons, which means the \`setIsMounted(true)\` call should not immediately trigger another render and then the cleanup. This should solve the dilemma of initializing only once and cleaning up when the component unmounts, allowing you to navigate away and back without issue. However, you may need some additional logic to re-initialize the globe when coming back to the page—this would depend on the unmounting/mounting strategy of the parent component/pages in your application."},{"instruction":"Unhandled Runtime Error Error: Error creating WebGL context.

WebGL requires this feature to take advantage of GPU resources for rendering. 2. **Insufficient Resources**: Having too many active WebGL contexts can deplete the browser's resources, leading to context creation failure. This can happen if you're creating multiple instances of \`WebGLRenderer\` without properly cleaning them up. 3. **WebGL Limitations**: Browsers limit the number of simultaneous WebGL contexts. This limit can vary but is generally quite small. Check if you have other browser tabs or applications that might be consuming WebGL contexts and close them. 4. **Graphics Driver Issues**: Outdated or unsupported graphics drivers can cause WebGL context creation to fail. Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date. 5. **Browser Support**: Ensure your browser supports WebGL and that it's not disabled in the browser settings. Most modern browsers support WebGL, but some users opt to turn it off for security or performance reasons. 6. **WebGL2 vs WebGL**: Are you trying to create a WebGL 2 context on a machine or browser that only supports WebGL 1? Ensure compatibility between the version of WebGL you're requesting and what's supported. In your specific case, it sounds like you might be dealing with insufficient resources, likely due to not properly cleaning up the \`WebGLRenderer\` instances. Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the issue: 1. **Properly Dispose of Three.js Objects**: In your component's cleanup function, you should dispose of all Three.js objects that you've created. This includes geometries, materials, textures, and the renderer: \`\`\`jsx return () => { // ...other cleanup... scene.traverse(child => { if (child.geometry) { child.geometry.dispose(); } if (child.material) { if (child.material.map) { child.material.map.dispose(); } child.material.dispose(); } }); if (renderer) { renderer.dispose(); } }; \`\`\` 2. **Check for Multiple Instances**: Make sure you are not creating multiple instances of the \`GlobeComponent\` or other components that use WebGL without properly unmounting and cleaning them up. 3. **Use a Ref for the Renderer**: Rather than using a \`let\` variable at the top of your module, use a \`useRef\` to store the renderer. This helps ensure that you're always dealing with the same instance and not creating new ones unintentionally. If the problem persists after these checks, consider systematically isolating the issue by simplifying your component to the point where it's just initializing a scene with a simple geometry and no context from other files, then gradually adding back functionality until you identify what triggers the error."},{"instruction":"I am experiencing a loop in rendering the globe: import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'; import { WebGLRenderer, Scene, AmbientLight, DirectionalLight, Color, Fog, PerspectiveCamera, PointLight } from 'three'; import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'; import { createGlowMesh } from 'three-glow-mesh'; import ThreeGlobe from \\"three-globe\\"; import countries from './files/globe-data-min.json'; import travelHistory from './files/my-flights.json'; import airportHistory from './files/my-airports.json'; let mouseX = 0; let mouseY = 0; let renderer, camera, scene, controls; let Globe; let frameId; const GlobeComponent = ({ globeWidth, globeHeight, windowWidth, windowHeight }) => { const containerRef = useRef(); const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false); const [arcsInitialized, setArcsInitialized] = useState(false); let windowHalfX = windowWidth / 2; let windowHalfY = windowHeight / 2; // Event listeners function onWindowResize() { camera.aspect = windowWidth / windowHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); windowHalfX = windowWidth; windowHalfY = windowHeight; renderer.setSize(windowWidth, windowHeight); } function onMouseMove(event) { mouseX = event.clientX - windowHalfX; mouseY = event.clientY - windowHalfY; // console.log(\\"x: \\" + mouseX + \\" y: \\" + mouseY); } // Animation function animate() { camera.lookAt(scene.position); controls.update(); renderer.render(scene, camera); frameId = requestAnimationFrame(animate); } useEffect(() => { // Initialize core ThreeJS elements if (!isMounted) { function init() { // Initialize renderer renderer = new WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, alpha: true }); renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio); renderer.setSize(globeWidth, globeHeight); renderer.setClearColor(0x000000, 0); containerRef.current.appendChild(renderer.domElement); // Initialize scene, light scene = new Scene(); scene.add(new AmbientLight(0xbbbbbb, 0.4)); // Initialize camera, light camera = new PerspectiveCamera(); camera.aspect = globeWidth / globeHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); var dLight = new DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8); dLight.position.set(-800, 2000, 400); camera.add(dLight); var dLight1 = new DirectionalLight(0x7982f6, 1); dLight1.position.set(-200, 500, 200); camera.add(dLight1); var dLight2 = new PointLight(0x8566cc, 0.5); dLight2.position.set(-200, 500, 200); camera.add(dLight2); camera.position.z = 400; camera.position.x = 0; camera.position.y = 0; scene.add(camera); // Additional effects scene.fog = new Fog(0x535ef3, 400, 2000); // Helpers // const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper(800); // scene.add(axesHelper); // var helper = new THREE.DirectionalLightHelper(dLight); // scene.add(helper); // var helperCamera = new THREE.CameraHelper(dLight.shadow.camera); // scene.add(helperCamera); // Initialize controls controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement); controls.enableDamping = true; controls.dynamicDampingFactor = 0.01; controls.enablePan = false; controls.minDistance = Math.min(globeWidth, globeHeight) / 2; controls.maxDistance = Math.min(globeWidth, globeHeight) / 2; controls.rotateSpeed = 0.8; controls.zoomSpeed = 1; controls.autoRotate = false; controls.minPolarAngle = Math.PI / 3.5; controls.maxPolarAngle = Math.PI - Math.PI / 3; } // Initialize the Globe function initGlobe() { // Initialize the Globe Globe = new ThreeGlobe({ waitForGlobeReady: true, animateIn: true, }) .hexPolygonsData(countries.features) .hexPolygonResolution(3) .hexPolygonMargin(0.7) .showAtmosphere(true) .atmosphereColor(\\"#ffffff\\") .atmosphereAltitude(0.1) .hexPolygonColor((e) => { if ( [\\"KEN\\", \\"CHN\\", \\"FRA\\", \\"ZAF\\", \\"JPN\\", \\"USA\\", \\"AUS\\", \\"CAN\\"].includes( e.properties.ISO_A3 ) ) { return \\"rgba(255,255,255, 1)\\"; } else return \\"rgba(255,255,255, 0.5)\\"; }); Globe.rotateX(-Math.PI * (1 / 50)); Globe.rotateY(-Math.PI * (1 / 9)); Globe.rotateZ(-Math.PI / 60); const globeMaterial = Globe.globeMaterial(); globeMaterial.color = new Color(0x3a228a); globeMaterial.emissive = new Color(0x220038); globeMaterial.emissiveIntensity = 0.1; globeMaterial.shininess = 0.7; // NOTE Cool stuff // globeMaterial.wireframe = true; scene.add(Globe); } init(); initGlobe(); onWindowResize(); animate(); window.addEventListener('resize', onWindowResize, false); renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove); setIsMounted(true); console.log(\\"Initializing globe animation\\"); } if (!arcsInitialized && isMounted) { Globe.arcsData(travelHistory.flights) .arcColor((e) => { return e.status ?

Inside the same \`useEffect\`, you're setting these states right after initializing the globe and the arcs, which will then trigger the effect to run again due to the dependency changes. 3. By the end of the \`useEffect\`, you're setting the cleanup function to reset both \`isMounted\` and \`arcsInitialized\` to \`false\`.

Refs are persistent across renders and will not cause the component to re-render when updated, breaking the effect loop. - Removed the states from the dependency array of the \`useEffect\` to prevent it from re-running due to state changes, as these changes are no longer necessary for triggering re-initialization. Now, the \`useEffect\` only runs once when the component mounts and once when it unmounts, and there’s no more dependency on changing state variables that can cause re-renders. This change should break the loop and prevent excessive re-rendering. Please note, if you navigate away and return to the component, and you need the globe to reinitialize, you have to ensure the component completely unmounts.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. The returning woman blurts out an ominous warning. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief while confusingly muttering to herself about things feeling warm and heavy. Then, the returning woman pauses briefly and softly grunts, before she continues to murmur about how much it is beginning to stink. The perplexed present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern and asks about the meaning of the returning woman's mutterings, while the returning woman is still softly grunting and pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants as her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air with a perplexed expression. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman inquires about the odor again, noting that it stinks and describing what it smells like. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, the present woman fully realizes what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman sniffs nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks if the source of the odor is the returning woman having pooped in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so dirty like pooping in her pants is unbelievably disgusting. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and childishly finished pooping in her pants once she began. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and finish pooping in her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to poop and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where the returning woman had to make the decision to finish pooping in her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally poop, even if it ended up happening inside her pants. In response to the returning woman's comments, the present woman expresses her disgust and tauntingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty, because it seems to the present woman that the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when the returning woman speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman verbally demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect the returning woman's rear end. The present woman proceeds to chidingly ridicule the returning woman over the sight of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants. Then, the present woman continues to taunt the returning woman at length by expressing disappointed astonishment over how full the returning woman's pants are, by describing the visual appearance of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants, and by expressing disgust at the amount of poop that is in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full not because of special intention on the returning woman's part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. The returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. * In response, the present woman exclaims with with scornful disgust that it is obvious how full the returning woman's stomach was because of the massive deposit that is currently in the returning woman's pants. Then, the present woman tauntingly remarks that because it looked like the returning woman was feeling good while making this deposit, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman childishly enjoys not only relieving herself in her pants, but also having her pants be so full and loaded. The present woman adds that it is not only the full and loaded pants that the returning woman probably enjoys, but also this terrible odor that is emanating from the soiled pants too. * As she is inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants and chiding her, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she adds in coy resignation that given the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by taunting the returning woman over how pungent the odor that emanates from the returning woman's pants is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because an odor that pungent is unbearable. After that, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while verbally imploring the returning woman not to drop any of her pants’ contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom. While escorting the returning woman, the present woman is continues to react to the odor and disgustedly assists the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the odor that is emanating from the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing while reacting to her own odor. In addition, the returning woman voices her concern that the deposit is spreading inside her pants because of the motion of walking towards the bathroom. In response, the present woman reinforces her grip that is intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman’s pants. As she is reinforcing her grip, the present woman continues to complain about the the returning woman’s odor. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom’s threshold instead of entering, coyly mentioning that it feels icky inside her pants, and asking the present woman if she would like to change the her “poopy diaper”. As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grip on the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few more seconds to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. Once the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while sniffing the hand that she used to squash the bulge in the returning woman’s pants, physically reacting to the odor emitting from the hand, and then complaining to herself out loud about how terribly the returning woman’s soiled pants smell.","output":"INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY (FLASHBACK) A bustling college campus. STUDENTS chatter and move about. We find PARUL, 20s, a young woman with an understated elegance, wearing a traditional salwar-kameez, the comfortable attire enhancing her slim, tense figure. She has an uneasy look in her eyes hinting at her discomfort. Her pace quickens--she's in a rush to get somewhere. CUT TO: INT. BUSY STREET - DAY (FLASHBACK) Parul is now walking briskly, clutching her stomach discreetly, her face showing faint beads of sweat. She bypasses a public restroom sign with a grimace. We understand that she has been holding off her urge to use the bathroom all day due to her aversion to public restrooms. CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY We're back in the present. Parul's pace is desperate as she nears the front door of a modest middle-class Indian family home. INSERT: Close-up of Parul's face. Panic-stricken, her eyes dart. As her hand digs into her bag, the realization hits her--no key. PARUL (in Hindi, under her breath) Nahi... ab kya? Desperation turns to frantic action. She KNOCKS on the door. INSERT: Parul's hand KNOCKING on the door. Her legs are tensed, subtly shifting her weight back and forth. After a painful moment of silence, a VOICE from within, concerned but irritated. VOICE (O.S.) Kaun hai? Kya ho raha hai wahan? Parul, on the brink of crisis but trying to mask her urgency, forces a smile as her body betrays her, a bead of sweat trickling down her temple. PARUL Maa, main hoon! Darwaza kholo, jaldi! INT. FAMILY HOME ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS We see SUSHMA, mid-40s, a typical Indian housewife with a warm but no-nonsense demeanor. She's taking her sweet time unlocking the multi-bolted door. ANGLE ON the door bolts--each click is a torture for Parul. Sushma finally opens the door, taken aback by Parul's flushed face. SUSHMA Arre, kya hua? Sab theek hai? Parul tries to brush past her mother, averting her gaze. PARUL Haan, Maa, side ho. Andar jaane do! Sushma's maternal instincts kick in. She grabs Parul's arm, stopping her. SUSHMA Ruko, Parul! Kuch to batao--tum aise pareshan kyun ho? The women struggle, caught in a half-embrace, half-battle. PARUL (pleading) Maa bas, chhoro mujhe! Main thik hoon, mujhe abhi andar jaana hai! The friction intensifies--neither willing to yield. Parul's face is a mix of frustration and impending doom. PARUL (ominously) Maa... please... abhi nahi toh... Parul's muscles tense, and then, a soft GROAN escapes her lips. Her eyes widen; she's losing the battle with her own body. SUSHMA (confused, loosening her grip) Parul? Kya hua tujhe, beti? Parul gently shrugs off her mother, a look of defeat mingled with unfathomable relief. Back to her mother now, Parul hesitantly assumes a slightly squatting stance, shuddering with effort and relief. PARUL (muttering) Ohh... kitna acha lag raha hai... Sushma stands, dumbstruck. Her confusion is palpable. SUSHMA Ye tu kya kar rahi hai? Theek toh ho? Her queries fall on deaf ears as Parul continues, the strained satisfaction in her voice unmistakable. PARUL (murmuring, panting) Haww, kitna garm... aur bhari... She pauses, another muffled GRUNT. PARUL (contemplatively) ...aur ab toh badboo bhi aane lagi hai. Sushma's concern morphs into worry laced with bewilderment. SUSHMA (urgently) Ye sab kya keh rahi hai tu? Mujhe samajh nahi aara... The stench hits Sushma. Her nose twitches in reaction. She sniffs the air, disbelief etching her features. Sushma's questioning is met with Parul's sheepish look. She sniffles, wrinkles her nose. SUSHMA (disgustedly) Ye badboo kya hai? Acha nahi lag raha yahan... Parul's gaze drops, embarrassment coloring her cheeks. SUSHMA (contd., registering the smell) Bhagwan! Ye toh... Parul, tune... tune pants me...? Parul squirms, her voice a mix of avoidance and plea. PARUL Maa... andar jaane do. Bas abhi... Sushma steps aside, gesturing with an exasperated wave for Parul to enter. INSIDE THE ENTRYWAY Parul shuffles in, cupping the back of her pants, an awkward waddle in her step. Sushma, mouth agape, stops her. SUSHMA Ruk! Zara dekh ke, kahi kuch gir na jaaye... Parul halts, her face the picture of sheepish shame. SUSHMA (tauntingly) Kya kar diya tune? Poora to pants me hi nikal diya! Parul remains still, the awkwardness palpable. SUSHMA (contd., exasperatedly) Gandi baat! Itna bada ho kar bhi pants me...? Parul's demeanor shifts, a pout forming as she fires back playfully. PARUL Aur kya karti? Tum khadi thi na raste me. Darwaza nahi khola, aur... Sushma snorts indignantly. SUSHMA Ye koi bahana nahi hai! Tu khadi rahi aur... sab kuch kar diya. Bachcha nahi hai tu! Parul, now defiant, clutches at her soiled pants tentatively, a twisted sense of pride on her face. PARUL Majboori thi, Maa. Rok nahi paayi. Sara nikalna hi tha... Sushma's disgust surfaces, with a hint of mocking. SUSHMA (firmly) Parul, dikha apni pants ka haal. After weak protests, Parul turns around. Sushma RIDICULES her daughter's rear, then gasps at the sight. SUSHMA (contd., mockingly) Haaye! Kitni bhar gayi hai teri to... Parul retorts timidly. PARUL Itta sab... andar tha... bahar aa gaya. Sushma with exaggerated repulsion. SUSHMA (deeply disgusted) Saaf zahir hai! Lekin lagta hai tujhe achha bhi laga... The chiding continues as Sushma LEANS in to SNIFF at the unwanted bulge, Parul flinches. Sniffing, Sushma GRIMACES in mock horror. SUSHMA (contd.) Chi! Kitni smelly hai tu. Nikal! Parul admits the obvious, her voice filled with reluctant acceptance. PARUL (sighing) Haan, smelly toh hoon. Is haalat me toh aana hi tha... Sushma's response is swift, harsh. SUSHMA (peering with distrust) Badboo itni zyada hai, yahan nahi rukegi tu. Chalo, bathroom! Sushma propels Parul towards the washroom, still reacting to the stench, her hand enveloping the bulge, guiding carefully. In transit, Parul CRINGES, voicing discomfort. PARUL (whining) Phail toh nahi raha na andar...? Her mother's response is a firm grip, a disdainful glance. CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM THRESHOLD - MOMENTS LATER Parul TEASES, stopping at the doorway, gesturing to her backside. PARUL (coyly) Badal doon apne \\"poopy diaper\\" ko? Sushma, at wit's end, PUSHES her playfully, smooshing the bulge, driving her point home with a squeezed nose. SUSHMA (swiftly) Ganda bum andar! Abhi! Parul exclaims in DISGUST as Sushma squashes harder for emphasis. PARUL (aghast) Fhail gaya andar...! Once Parul is inside, Sushma shakes her head. SUSHMA (sarcastically) Bilkul deserve karti hai tu yeh! The door shuts, and we hear the latch click. Sushma sniffs her hand and scrunches her nose, mumbling to herself. SUSHMA (contd., to herself) Chi! Iski pants ki kya badboo hai...! FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Créer une base de données de la gestion de stock dans un restaurant","output":"La base de données pour la gestion de stock dans un restaurant peut être constituée des tables suivantes : 1.

The choice of library may depend on the specifics of the PDF file you are working with (e.g., whether it's text-based or contains scanned images) and your project requirements. Here are some popular libraries: 1. PyPDF2: PyPDF2 is a Pure-Python library that you can use to read and write PDF files, including extracting text from PDFs. \`\`\`python from PyPDF2 import PdfReader reader = PdfReader(\\"example.pdf\\") text = \\"\\" for page in reader.pages: text += page.extract_text() print(text) \`\`\` 2. pdfminer.six: pdfminer.six is a community-maintained fork of the original PDFMiner for Python 3. It's more powerful for text extraction than PyPDF2, especially when dealing with more complex PDFs. \`\`\`python from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text text = extract_text(\\"example.pdf\\") print(text) \`\`\` 3. PyMuPDF (fitz): PyMuPDF is a Python binding for MuPDF, which is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer. It's capable of extracting text, images, and other content from PDF files. \`\`\`python import fitz # PyMuPDF # Open the PDF file with fitz.open(\\"example.pdf\\") as pdf: text = \\"\\" for page in pdf: text += page.get_text() print(text) \`\`\` 4. Textract: Textract is a package that goes beyond PDFs. It can also extract text from other document types, like Word and PowerPoint. For PDFs, it relies on other tools like pdftotext (from the poppler-utils). \`\`\`python import textract text = textract.process(\\"example.pdf\\", method='pdftotext') text = text.decode('utf-8') print(text) \`\`\` 5. OCR libraries (e.g., pytesseract with pdf2image): If you're dealing with scanned documents or images within PDFs, you might need to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text. The most popular OCR library in Python is pytesseract, an interface to Google's Tesseract OCR engine. \`\`\`python from pdf2image import convert_from_path import pytesseract # Convert PDF to images images = convert_from_path('example.pdf') # Setup Tesseract executable path if necessary # pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:Program FilesTesseract-OCRtesseract.exe' # Extract text from images text = \\"\\" for image in images: text += pytesseract.image_to_string(image) print(text) \`\`\` Remember to install the necessary libraries using \`pip\` before using them. For example: \`\`\`sh pip install PyPDF2 pip install pdfminer.six pip install pymupdf pip install textract pip install pytesseract pip install pdf2image \`\`\` Additionally, depending on the complexity of the PDF and its encoding, some libraries might perform better than others. It's often beneficial to experiment with multiple libraries to see which one meets your needs the best."},{"instruction":"Is PyMuPDF read data from url pdf","output":"PyMuPDF itself does not directly read PDFs from URLs; it expects a file path or a file-like object. However, you can easily download the PDF from a URL using a different library, such as \`requests\`, and then pass the downloaded content to PyMuPDF. Here is an example of how to download a PDF from a URL and load it into PyMuPDF for text extraction: \`\`\`python import fitz # PyMuPDF import requests from io import BytesIO # URL of the PDF you want to download url = 'http://example.com/somefile.pdf' # Use \`requests\` to get the content of the PDF file response = requests.get(url) # Check if the request was successful if response.status_code == 200: # Create a file-like object from the content of the response pdf_stream = BytesIO(response.content) # Open the PDF with PyMuPDF pdf = fitz.open(stream=pdf_stream, filetype=\\"pdf\\") # Iterate through each page and extract text text = \\"\\" for page in pdf: text += page.get_text() print(text) # Close the PDF file pdf.close() else: print(f'Error: failed to retrieve PDF from {url} (Status code: {response.status_code})') \`\`\` Remember to check the response status code to ensure that the PDF was indeed successfully obtained from the given URL. In the above code snippet, the \`requests\` library is used to fetch the PDF content as a byte stream using \`response.content\`. It's important to convert this content into a file-like object (\`BytesIO\`) which PyMuPDF can then use to create a document instance. Before running the code, ensure you have the required libraries installed: \`\`\`sh pip install PyMuPDF pip install requests \`\`\` Always be careful when downloading and processing content from the internet, as it can contain malicious data.

In practice, this means that the URL entered by the user does not correspond to a valid webpage on the server. This could be because the page does not exist, it has been moved or deleted, or the URL was typed incorrectly. The number \\"404\\" is one of the standard response codes defined within the HTTP protocol. Here's a breakdown of what the code signifies: - **4xx:** The first digit \\"4\\" indicates a client error. The server is saying that it received the request but the request has a problem. - **04:** The last two digits specify the specific error encountered. \\"04\\" designates the specific error in the 4xx category, which in this case is \\"Not Found.\\" Here are some common reasons a server might return a 404 error: 1. **Typing Error:** The URL was typed incorrectly into the browser's address bar. 2. **Broken Link:** The link is outdated or mistyped by the website owner, pointing to a page that no longer exists. 3. **Moved or Deleted Content:** The webpage has been moved to a different URL without proper redirection, or it has been deleted from the site. 4. **Access Restrictions:** The server might be configured to return a 404 error instead of a 403 (Forbidden) for security reasons when access to certain resources is restricted. Users generally see a 404 error page, which can be a default message provided by the server software or a custom page created by the website owner to guide users back to working parts of the website. It is important for website owners to monitor for 404 errors on their websites and fix any broken links or incorrect URLs to improve user experience and maintain good site health for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes."},{"instruction":"when i am running this requests.get(\\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/1a3debd1-2ae5-496b-b1fc-5db3baea9aa6.pdf\\"). request give me 404 whereas when i am directly opening pdf it is opening. tell me problem","output":"When you can access a PDF directly in the browser but a \`requests.get()\` call in Python gives you a 404 error, several potential issues could be causing this discrepancy: 1. **Headers Issue:** The server might require specific headers to serve the PDF file. Browsers automatically send certain headers, like \`User-Agent\`, which Python's \`requests\` module does not include by default. To mimic a browser request, you can explicitly set these headers: \`\`\`python import requests headers = { 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'} response = requests.get(\\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/1a3debd1-2ae5-496b-b1fc-5db3baea9aa6.pdf\\", headers=headers) if response.status_code == 200: with open('document.pdf', 'wb') as f: f.write(response.content) else: print(f'Error {response.status_code}') \`\`\` 2. **Cookie/Session Issue:** Some websites require a valid session or cookies set, which might have been established in your browser already. To handle this, you would need to replicate the browser's session handling in your Python script, which could involve sending cookies or using \`requests.Session()\` to maintain a session. 3. **Redirection Issue:** The website might be redirecting to the PDF through JavaScript or meta-refresh, which \`requests\` does not handle, as it does not execute JavaScript. You could use tools like Selenium to control a web browser and handle these kinds of redirections. 4. **Temporary URL:** The direct PDF link you are using might be generated dynamically and is only valid for your current browser session. When accessing the link from an external client like Python's \`requests\`, the session is different, and the URL might not be valid. It is also worth checking if the URL you're providing is exactly the same as the one you're using in the browser, including any URL parameters or fragments that might be important for the server to locate the document. 5. **HTTPS and Security Protocols:** In certain cases, the server might have strict requirements on the TLS/SSL protocols and cipher suites. You might need to update the \`requests\` or underlying \`urllib3\` modules or even Python itself to ensure compatibility with the server's requirements. If none of the above issues seem to resolve the problem, you could check the server's response headers and content returned by the unsuccessful \`requests.get()\` call for any clues as to why the request is failing: \`\`\`python import requests response = requests.get(\\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/1a3debd1-2ae5-496b-b1fc-5db3baea9aa6.pdf\\") print(f'Status Code: {response.status_code}') print(f'Headers: {response.headers}') print(f'Content: {response.text[:200]}') # Print the first 200 characters of the response content \`\`\` If troubleshooting these potential issues does not resolve the problem, you may need to consult the website's documentation or contact the website's support to determine if there are any additional requirements for accessing PDF files programmatically."},{"instruction":"This data i get from pdf //‘ BONDADA GROUP ~Y/ Date: February 16, 2024 The Secretary, BSE Limited Phiroze Jeejeebhoy Towers, Dalal Street, Mumbai — 400 001 Scrip Code: 543971 Dear Sir/Madam, Sub: Receipt of work order from M/s.

The following example code demonstrates how to do this: \`\`\`python import re # Your PDF text content pdf_text = \\"\\"\\" ...Your entire PDF text goes here... \\"\\"\\" # Regular expression pattern to find text after \\"Sub:\\" # This pattern assumes that \\"Sub:\\" is at the end of a line, followed by a newline, # and the text you want is on the next line. pattern = re.compile(r\\"Sub:s*n([^n]+)\\") # Perform search for the pattern matches = pattern.search(pdf_text) # Extract and print the text if a match is found if matches: sub_text = matches.group(1).strip() print(\\"Sub text:\\", sub_text) else: print(\\"Pattern not found.\\") \`\`\` What this code does: 1. It defines a regular expression pattern that looks for the string \\"Sub:\\" followed by optional whitespace characters (\`s*\`), a newline character (\`n\`), and then captures all characters that are not a newline ([^n]+) until it hits the next newline. 2. It uses \`re.search()\` to find the first occurrence of this pattern in the PDF text. 3. If a match is found, it extracts the matched text group and prints it out. Make sure that the actual text extracted from your PDF is stored in the \`pdf_text\` variable. This example assumes that there is only one line following the \\"Sub:\\" line that you're interested in. If the structure is different or the text spans multiple lines, you will need to adjust the regular expression pattern accordingly."},{"instruction":"what it prints","output":"Based on the given text sample you provided and the Python code snippet I've shared earlier, the code aims to extract and print the text that follows the \\"Sub:\\" line. Since the actual text wasn't included in the snippet, I will demonstrate the code with the text sample you've provided. If we focus on the text after the \\"Sub:\\" within the sample you gave, it is: \`\`\` Sub: Receipt of work order from M/s. Sundrops Energia Private Limited \`\`\` We will use this line to match our regular expression pattern. Given the single line of interest after the \\"Sub:\\" prefix, the code should print just that line: \`\`\` Sub text: Receipt of work order from M/s. Sundrops Energia Private Limited \`\`\` Here's the code snippet again for reference: \`\`\`python import re # Your PDF text content pdf_text = \\"\\"\\" ...Your entire PDF text goes here including the Sub: line... \\"\\"\\" # Regular expression pattern to find text after \\"Sub:\\" # This pattern assumes that \\"Sub:\\" is at the end of a line, followed by a newline, # and the text you want is on the next line. pattern = re.compile(r\\"Sub:s*n([^n]+)\\") # Perform search for the pattern matches = pattern.search(pdf_text) # Extract and print the text if a match is found if matches: sub_text = matches.group(1).strip() print(\\"Sub text:\\", sub_text) else: print(\\"Pattern not found.\\") \`\`\` Please replace the placeholder text within \`pdf_text\` with the actual content extracted from your PDF to run this code. If the formatting in your actual PDF text extract is different, you might need to adapt the pattern to match that formatting. Since the provided text sample from the PDF doesn't contain line breaks around the \\"Sub:\\" part, we might need to adjust the code accordingly. Here's the updated regex pattern to match text in a single line: \`\`\`python pattern = re.compile(r\\"Sub:s*([^n]+)\\") # Perform search for the pattern matches = pattern.search(pdf_text) # Extract and print the text if a match is found if matches: sub_text = matches.group(1).strip() print(\\"Sub text:\\", sub_text) else: print(\\"Pattern not found.\\") \`\`\` This adjusted pattern will look for the text following \\"Sub:\\" on the same line without expecting a newline character thereafter."},{"instruction":"can you convert this into function","output":"Certainly!

Вернуться назад во времени и отменить покупку в \\"Голд Стар Моторс\\" было бы лучшим решением. Я очарована была новенькой машиной на сайте, но все обернулось головной болью.

Ощущение, что \\"Голд Стар Моторс\\" играет с клиентами в кота и мышь. Пришёл за мечтой, уехал с проблемами. Менеджер был слаще мёда, пока не перешли к оплате.

Слава богу, хватило смекалки записать все переговоры на диктофон. После того, как я показал готовность обратиться в защиту прав потребителей, отношение поменялось и деньги были возвращены, но вкус остался ужасный. 4. Следует держаться подальше от салона \\"Голд Стар Моторс\\", если не хотите терять драгоценные нервы и деньги. Выбранная мною машина внезапно оказалась с недостатками, которые в салоне назвали \\"незначительными\\". Но почему-то стоимость ремонта падает на мои плечи. Хотя ранее уверяли, что все проверено и исправно. Попытки добиться справедливости столкнулись с холодной стеной беспечности и юридических уловок. Я была вынуждена взять неисправный автомобиль, чтобы не потерять внесенные средства. 5. Печальный опыт с \\"Голд Стар Моторс\\" подтолкнул меня к написанию этого отзыва. Видимо, их цель — продать любой ценой, не интересуясь последствиями для клиента. Услышав о моем желании приобрести понравившуюся модель за 800 000, менеджер быстро рассчитал все \\"необходимые\\" опции и таксовки, и счет вырос до астрономических 1,3 миллиона рублей. Когда я отказался от сделки, предоплата возвращена не была, потому что \\"срок отказа уже прошел\\". Чудесно, не правда ли? только для их финансового отдела, конечно. 6. \\"Голд Стар Моторс\\" — имя, которое я буду вспоминать с недоумением и гневом. Приобретение машины превратилось в бесконечный цикл скрытых комиссий и неприятных сюрпризов. Обещанная цена в 650 000 превратилась в кошмарное число в 1 250 000 с \\"нужными\\" услугами. В каждом документе появлялись новые строки о расходах. Как оказалось, возвращение предоплаты — это их слабое место.

Warum sind alleinerziehende Frauen besonders von Armut betroffen?: Fallbeispiel Sarah: Hallo, ich bin Sarah und bin 35 Jahre alt. Ich bin alleinerziehende Mutter von zwei Kindern und arbeite halbtags als Friseurin. Allerdings reicht mein Gehalt nicht aus, um meinen Lebensunterhalt und den meiner Kinder zu bestreiten. Obwohl ich genau die selben Leistungen erbringe wie mein Kollege Tim, verdiene ich deutlich weniger. Ich mache mir viele Sorgen, da ich nicht weiß, wie ich meine Kinder ernähren und versorgen kann. Außerdem habe ich Angst, dass ich meine Kinder nicht richtig erziehen kann. In letzter Zeit bin ich immer gestresster und auch wenn ich mir es selber nicht eingestehen möchte, leide ich unter psychischen Problemen. Die Belastung von allen Seiten sowie die fehlende Unterstützung treiben mich persönlich an den Rand eines Burnout. Ich wünsche mir einfach, dass alle, die hart arbeiten, auch genug verdienen, um ihre Familien versorgen zu können. Es wäre toll, wenn ich als Alleinerziehende mehr Unterstützung für meine Kinder bekommen könnte, und vielleicht auch ein wenig Hilfe, um mit dem Stress besser umgehen zu können.","output":"Armut unter alleinerziehenden Frauen in Deutschland ist ein vielschichtiges Problem, das strukturelle, ökonomische sowie soziale Ursachen hat. Anhand des Falles von Sarah können wir verschiedene Aspekte erkennen, die dazu beitragen, dass sie und ihre Familie in eine prekäre finanzielle Lage geraten sind. 1. Geringes Einkommen und Teilzeitarbeit: Sarah arbeitet als Friseurin, was typischerweise eine niedrig bezahlte Tätigkeit ist. Da sie alleinerziehend ist, ist sie auf eine Teilzeitanstellung angewiesen, um sich um ihre Kinder kümmern zu können. Arbeitszeiten und Betreuungsverantwortung zu koordinieren, stellt eine große Herausforderung dar, und oft sind Vollzeitstellen für Alleinerziehende schwer realisierbar. 2. Gender Pay Gap: Sarah erwähnt, dass sie für die gleiche Arbeit wie ihr Kollege weniger verdient. Dies lässt auf eine mögliche geschlechtsspezifische Lohndiskrepanz (Gender Pay Gap) schließen, die Frauen benachteiligt. 3. Fehlende Unterstützung: Sarah gibt an, dass sie mehr Unterstützung für ihre Kinder bräuchte. Das Fehlen eines umfassenden und zugänglichen Unterstützungssystems, zum Beispiel in Form von finanzieller Hilfe oder erschwinglicher Kinderbetreuung, kann dazu führen, dass Alleinerziehende Schwierigkeiten haben, ihre finanzielle Lage zu verbessern. 4. Psychische Belastung: Der Stress des Alleinseins und des Managements aller Verantwortlichkeiten kann sich negativ auf die psychische Gesundheit auswirken, was wiederum die Fähigkeit, voll im Berufsleben zu stehen und eventuell besser bezahlte Arbeitsstellen anzunehmen oder sich weiterzubilden, beeinträchtigt. 5. Bildung und Qualifikation: Obwohl es in Sarahs Fall nicht spezifiziert wird, haben alleinerziehende Mütter oft weniger Möglichkeiten, ihre Qualifikationen zu verbessern und an Fort- oder Weiterbildungen teilzunehmen, was den Zugang zu höher bezahlten Jobs erschwert. 6. Kinderbetreuungskosten: In Deutschland sind die Kosten für die Kinderbetreuung regional unterschiedlich, können aber für Alleinerziehende eine finanzielle Belastung darstellen. Die Verfügbarkeit und Leistbarkeit von Ganztagseinrichtungen sind entscheidend für die Berufstätigkeit von Elternteilen. 7. Unterhaltszahlungen: Es wird nicht erwähnt, ob Sarah Unterhaltszahlungen vom anderen Elternteil erhält. Ausbleibende oder unzureichende Unterhaltszahlungen können zu finanziellen Engpässen führen. 8. Sozialpolitische Rahmenbedingungen: Das Ausmaß und die Wirksamkeit sozialstaatlicher Maßnahmen haben direkten Einfluss darauf, wie gut Alleinerziehende wie Sarah in der Lage sind, Armut zu vermeiden. Zusammenfassend können die Ursachen von Armut bei alleinerziehenden Frauen wie Sarah auf ein Zusammenspiel von strukturellen Benachteiligungen, Diskriminierung auf dem Arbeitsmarkt, unzureichenden sozialen Unterstützungsangeboten und der Herausforderung, Berufstätigkeit und Familie zu vereinbaren, zurückgeführt werden.

Менеджер сказал, что сначала вносится предоплата, оплатила 150 000 наличными. Дальше нужно было подписать договор. Предварительно обговаривали условия и согласно ним было так, что машина стоит 690 000, дополнительно на 100 000 нужно оформить допы. Вес устроило. Беру в руки уже реальный договор, а там стоит цена в 1 580 000 и допы на 400 000. Говорю, что это бред. Тогда он мне отвечает, что предоплату тогда они не вернут. Наглость. Звоню мужу, он приезжает и апеллируя юридическими терминами объясняет что к чему. Только после этого мне деньги вернули. Но как сказал супруг, он знает много таких ситуаций, когда люди денег все же лишались и ничего даже он бы не смог сделать.","output":"1. Прошлый месяц решил приобрести новенький седан в Голд Стар Моторс. От машины я ждал надежности, но уже на следующий день после покупки начались проблемы с электроникой. В довершение всего около недели спустя отказал двигатель. В салоне меня долго кормили завтраками, починку то обещали сделать быстро, то вдруг заявляли о необходимости заказывания деталей. Как выяснилось впоследствии, авто с серьёзным браком, а ребята из салона об этом знали и молчали. Абсолютно не рекомендую этот салон никому, лучше уж потратить время и найти порядочных продавцов. 2. Решив обновить автопарк, обратился в салон Голд Стар Моторс за новым внедорожником. Очарованный гладкой речью менеджера, не заметил подвоха в договоре касательно гарантийных обязательств. Когда через несколько дней понадобилась замена неисправной электроники, оказалось, что все ремонтные работы выполняются за мой счет, так как гарантия не покрывает \\"эту конкретную поломку\\". Чувствую себя обманутым, поскольку одни из основных критериев моего выбора были надежность и четкость гарантийного обслуживания. 3. В Голд Стар Моторс убеждали меня в выгодности покупки автомобиля у них, мол, цены ниже рыночных, а качество лучше. Но когда я приобрел здесь хэтчбек, который как утверждали был \\"в идеальном состоянии\\", уже на следующий день обнаружил утечку масла и проблемы с коробкой передач. Попытка решить вопрос через сервисный центр вылилась в длительные споры и отказы в признании заводских неисправностей. В итоге, чтобы не терять больше времени и нервов, пришлось обратиться в другой сервис и отдать кругленькую сумму за ремонт. 4. Крайне разочарована покупкой авто в Голд Стар Моторс. Обещали короткие сроки доставки машины, но в итоге пришлось ждать почти в два раза дольше. Как только салон получил полную предоплату, представители просто перестали выходить на связь и отвечать на мои запросы по срокам доставки. Когда автомобиль наконец прибыл, обнаружилось несколько царапин и повреждение бампера, о которых никто заранее не предупредил. Обслуживание и коммуникация с клиентами оставляют желать лучшего. 5. Опыт покупки авто в Голд Стар Моторс оказался крайне отрицательным. Купленный мной автомобиль быстро стал ужасно шуметь, и я подозреваю, что проблема кроется в несоответствующей сборке. Когда я обратился по гарантии, менеджеры салона затянули процесс принятия моей машины на сервис, постоянно откладывая визит. В итоге, по истечении гарантийного срока, мне сообщили, что устранение поломки теперь в моей компетенции. Такое отношение к клиентам совершенно неприемлемо. 6. Отвратительный опыт работы с Голд Стар Моторс. Поначалу все выглядело блестяще: хороший выбор автомобилей, приятные цены, обещания скорой доставки. Но вскоре столкнулся с тем, что авто, которое я заказал, на самом деле было уже продано другому покупателю. В попытке исправить ситуацию менеджеры предложили мне другую машину, что было неплохо, но по цене выше, чем мы договаривались изначально. Деньги за мою первую покраску \\"просто затерялись\\", и мне пришлось вступать в долгие переговоры, чтобы хотя бы вернуть излишек. Совершенно не рекомендовал бы связываться с этим салоном – одни проблемы и головная боль."},{"instruction":"Історичне значення урн на західній Україні для тогочасної України і теперішньої","output":"Урни, як знахідки археологічних розкопок, мають велике історичне значення для України, і зокрема для регіонів західної України, де історія тісно переплетена з різними культурами та цивілізаціями. У минулому урни були використані різними культурами, які населяли терени сучасної України, для поховання покійних. Вони відіграли ключову роль у ритуальних та похоронних практиках. Наприклад, часом кремація була поширеною практикою, і після обряду спалення тіла прах вкладали у спеціальні похоронні урни, які потім ховали у похоронних могилах або курганах. Виявлення урн дозволяє історикам та археологам дізнатися більше про звичаї, вірування та рівень розвитку суспільства, що використовувало їх. Наприклад, на заході України урни можуть свідчити про життя народів, таких як даки, кельти, слав'яни, а також про впливи римської культури. Для сучасної України знахідки урн мають велику культурну та наукову цінність. Вони є частиною культурної спадщини країни і дають важливий матеріал для вивчення праісторії, історії античності та середньовіччя.

Тем не менее, я могу поделиться информацией о том, как разработки в области искусственного интеллекта (ИИ), включая языковые модели вроде GPT-3 и недавно выпущенного GPT-4, могут влиять на общество. Эти технологии значительно продвинули возможности машинного обучения и искусственного интеллекта, создавая инструменты, способные выполнять сложные задачи, связанные с обработкой естественного языка. Влияние таких технологий на общество уже ощущается во многих сферах, включая образование, бизнес, медицину и многие другие. Использование ИИ в этих областях может повысить эффективность, улучшить доступ к информации и создать новые возможности для инноваций. Что касается будущего языковых моделей, таких как GPT-5 или потенциального GPT-6 и GPT-7, ожидается, что они принесут еще больше улучшений в понимании и генерации естественного языка. Можно предположить, что они будут более точными, мощными и способными к еще более тонкому пониманию контекста и нюансов языка.

С каждым новым выпуском, модели становились все более сложными и мощными. **GPT-1:** Впервые выпущенный в 2018 году, GPT-1 был новаторским творением и показал возможность использования трансформеров для генерации текста. Он мог писать тексты, которые были впечатляющи на тот момент, но все же далеки от совершенства. **GPT-2:** Улучшенная версия, GPT-2, была опубликована в 2019 году и привлекла внимание за свою способность генерировать более связные и когерентные тексты. GPT-2 также вызвал обеспокоенность по поводу потенциала генерации дезинформации из-за способности создавать реалистичный и убедительный текст. **GPT-3:** GPT-3 был выпущен в 2020 году и стал значительным прорывом по сравнению с предыдущими моделями. С 175 миллиардами параметров, он смог достичь уровня производства текста, который был еще более точным, нюансированным и эффективным в понимании контекста. **GPT-4:** GPT-4, о котором было объявлено в марте 2023 года, ещё более мощный и изощрённый, продолжая улучшать качество и когерентность текста, который может производить ИИ. Он ещё лучше справляется с сложными задачами и демонстрирует улучшенное понимание контекста и инструкций. С каждым поколением GPT, возрастали не только возможности моделей, но и обсуждения их потенциального воздействия на общество, этику и безопасность. Эти разговоры охватывают вопросы ответственности за создание контента, потенциал использования в манипулировании информацией и смещения, предвзятости в обучающих данных и многие другие.

Los sistemas isekai normales suelen involucrar a los personajes aprendiendo a vivir y a menudo a prosperar en sus nuevos entornos, ganando poder a través de la experiencia y el crecimiento personal, a menudo reflejado en términos de niveles o habilidades como en un videojuego. En contraste, el sistema de Sung Jin-Woo en \\"Solo Leveling\\" es único y específico de esa serie. Sung Jin-Woo comienza siendo el cazador más débil de todos, pero se encuentra con un sistema especial que le permite \\"subir de nivel\\" a sí mismo, como si fuera un personaje de un videojuego. Este \\"Sistema\\" le otorga misiones, habilidades y recompensas que son personalizadas exclusivamente para él, y su progreso no está limitado por restricciones externas; puede volverse infinitamente más fuerte mientras continúe completando las tareas y desafíos que el Sistema le proporciona. \\"Leveling\\" o \\"Subir de nivel\\" es un concepto común en ambos, el isekai general y en \\"Solo Leveling\\", pero en \\"Solo Leveling\\", este concepto está literalmente integrado en la existencia de Sung Jin-Woo a través del Sistema. A diferencia de otros personajes isekai que dependen de su entorno y las reglas del mundo para progresar, el crecimiento de Jin-Woo es autónomo y continuo, y se convierte en un mecanismo de trama clave que impulsa la serie. Otra diferencia notable es que, en \\"Solo Leveling\\", aunque Jin-Woo experimenta un crecimiento similar al de un personaje de videojuego, el mundo en el que vive es su propio mundo moderno que ha sido alterado por la aparición de portales misteriosos y criaturas mágicas, en lugar de ser transportado a otro mundo por completo. Este aspecto de la historia se produce en lo que podría describirse como un \\"isekai inverso\\", donde en lugar de que el personaje principal sea transportado a otro mundo, son elementos de otro mundo los que invaden el suyo."},{"instruction":"Específica las diferencias del sistema como tal sus funciones y características","output":"En un isekai tradicional, el \\"sistema\\" es menos un conjunto de reglas formales y más un conjunto de tropos y mecánicas narrativas basadas en juegos de rol o videojuegos que influyen en cómo se desarrolla la historia. Mientras tanto, en \\"Solo Leveling\\", el Sistema específico de Sung Jin-Woo es una entidad con reglas y funciones concretas que impactan directamente su desarrollo y habilidades. A continuación, se detallan las diferencias clave entre un sistema de isekai estándar y el Sistema de Sung Jin-Woo: **Sistema de Isekai Estándar:** 1. **Desarrollo del Personaje:** Los personajes suelen ganar experiencia y habilidades de manera similar a los juegos de rol, a menudo mediante la lucha, la exploración o la superación de desafíos. 2. **Progresión basada en el Mundo:** Los personajes se fortalecen al interactuar con el mundo alrededor de ellos, como derrotar monstruos o completar misiones otorgadas por NPCs o el entorno. 3. **Progresión Visible o Invisible:** A veces, el progreso es visible a través de menús de estado o sistemas de niveles explícitos, pero a menudo es más implícito, reflejado en las acciones y capacidades del personaje. 4. **Habilidades y Objetos:** Pueden obtener habilidades especiales o mágicas y utilizar objetos del mundo, como pociones o artefactos mágicos, para mejorar sus habilidades. **Sistema de Sung Jin-Woo en \\"Solo Leveling\\":** 1. **Interfaz de Usuario (UI):** El Sistema proporciona una interfaz de usuario de videojuego que solo Sung Jin-Woo puede ver y utilizar, que incluye menús de estados, inventario, tienda y registro de misiones. 2. **Misiones y Notificaciones:** A diferencia de otros sistemas isekai, donde las misiones podrían ser parte del mundo, Jin-Woo recibe misiones directamente del Sistema, con notificaciones que aparecen ante él. 3. **Desarrollo Individualizado:** El Sistema otorga a Jin-Woo un camino personalizado para incrementar su fuerza. Este crecimiento a menudo se manifiesta a través de la obtención de puntos de experiencia y niveles después de completar misiones y matar monstruos. 4. **Habilidades y Objetos Únicos:** A diferencia de un isekai típico donde las habilidades son parte de un sistema de clases o habilidades generales, las habilidades que Jin-Woo adquiere están diseñadas exclusivamente para él y su situación. 5. **Recompensas por Logros:** Sung Jin-Woo obtiene recompensas específicas por cumplir ciertos logros, como nuevas habilidades o elementos en su inventario. 6. **Evolución de las Habilidades:** Además de obtener habilidades, Jin-Woo puede mejorarlas específicamente a través de un sistema de \\"ranking\\" y \\"nivelación\\" que utiliza puntos adquiridos. 7. **Resurrección de las Sombras:** Una de las habilidades más distintivas que obtiene de este Sistema es la capacidad de revivir seres derrotados como sombras leales que pelean junto a él. Las principales diferencias radican en que el sistema de Sung Jin-Woo es altamente personalizado y actúa casi como un personaje en sí mismo, con una interfaz y una intervención directa en su crecimiento, a menudo de modos que son impredecibles y se adaptan a las necesidades de la trama. En contraste, los sistemas de isekai estándar a menudo proporcionan un marco más genérico que se aplica de manera similar a todos los personajes dentro del mundo."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!
