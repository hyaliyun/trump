Here's a breakdown of the tone and why the translation is phrased as it is: 1. 애 하나 낳았다고 (ae hana nassdago) - This part of the sentence suggests that the speaker is commenting on the fact that the person has become a mother by giving birth to just one child. The use of \\"하나\\" (hana, meaning \\"one\\") implies that the speaker might find it somewhat premature or insufficient to consider oneself fully experienced or transformed into a mother with the birth of a single child. 2. 고새 엄마 다 됐구나 (gosae eomma da dwaetguna) - The phrase \\"고새 엄마 다 됐구나\\" carries a tone of mild sarcasm or irony. The speaker is using \\"구나\\" (guna), which is a suffix that expresses realization, but in this context, it can also convey a sense of surprise or sarcasm about the quick transition to motherhood. 3. 지 자식 걱정으로 (ji jasik geokjeongeuro) - \\"지 자식\\" (ji jasik) means \\"one's own child,\\" and \\"걱정으로\\" (geokjeongeuro) means \\"out of concern.\\" This part of the sentence sets the context that the person's behavior is motivated by concern for their child. 4. 스승한테 핏대 세우는 걸 보면 (seuseunghante pitdae seuuneun geol bomyeon) - The phrase \\"핏대 세우는\\" (pitdae seuuneun) literally means \\"raising one's blood vessel,\\" which is a Korean idiom for getting angry or raising one's voice. The use of \\"보면\\" (bomyeon) at the end indicates that the speaker is making an observation about the person's behavior towards their teacher. The overall tone of the sentence is somewhat critical, with a hint of sarcasm. The speaker seems to be commenting on the perceived overreaction or overprotectiveness of the new mother, who is now confronting her teacher due to concerns for her child. The translation into English maintains this tone by using phrases like \\"just by having one child\\" and \\"raising your voice at your teacher,\\" which convey the same sense of mild criticism and observation of the person's behavior."},{"instruction":"explain in human speak","output":"Certainly! The sentence you provided is a bit sarcastic. It's like the speaker is teasing or lightly mocking someone for acting like they know everything about being a parent after having just one child.

It's a way of saying, \\"Wow, you've had one kid and now you think you're an expert mom, even arguing with your teacher because of your kid.\\" The tone is not very serious; it's more like friendly ribbing about the person's behavior."},{"instruction":"Can anyone tell me what these says? トラップスミス。 「それで、だけど」","output":"The first phrase \\"トラップスミス\\" (Torappu Sumisu) is a transliteration of English words into Japanese katakana.

The second phrase 「それで、だけど」 (Sore de, dakedo) is a common Japanese expression that can be translated as \\"So, but\\" or \\"And so, but.\\" It's often used when someone is transitioning from one point to another in a conversation, acknowledging what was said before and then introducing a contrasting or additional point.

При том, что линии и полосы на плато идут во всевозможных направлениях, такое астрономическое объяснение не может быть признано определяющим и удовлетворительным. Поскольку все чертежи состоят из определённого набора базовых элементов и существуют сочетания линий, которые воспроизводятся в очень близкой геометрии, но очень разного размера, то Мария Райхе по этому поводу писала: «Геометрические фигуры производят впечатление зашифрованного текста, в котором одни и те же слова иногда обозначены огромными буквами и иногда малюсенькими значками».

Šis maršrutas yra tinkamiausias, kai auditorija yra mažiau susidomėjusi ar neturi pakankamai žinių vertinti pačią žinutę. \\"Share a Coke\\" kampanijos šalutiniame scenarijuje svarbūs elementai yra individualizuotos etiketės su vardais, draugystės ir dalijimosi momentai, socialinio vienijimo jausmas.

Petty ir John T. Cacioppo 1980-aisiais, yra vienas iš labiausiai pripažintų modelių, paaiškinantis įvairius įtikinimo būdus ir jų poveikį žmonių nuostatoms. Modelis numato dvi pagrindines kelio rūšis, kuriomis žmonės perdirba įtikinimo pranešimus – centriniu ir periferiniu maršrutais. **Centrinis Maršrutas:** Kai žmonės yra labai susidomėję pranešimu ir turi reikiamus gebėjimus arba galimybę jį apdoroti, jie naudojasi centriniuoju maršrutu įtikinimui. Tai reiškia, kad jie atidžiai įsiklauso į argumentus ir turinį, ir jų nuostatos keičiasi atsižvelgiant į pranešimo kokybę. Keitimai, įvykę per centriniu maršrutu, paprastai būna stipresni ir ilgalaikiai. **Periferinis Maršrutas:** Kai žmonės nėra labai susidomėję pranešimu arba neturi gebėjimų jį apdoroti, jie linkę naudoti periferinį maršrutą. Čia sprendimai priimami remiantis paviršiniais signalais, pavyzdžiui, pranešėjo patrauklumu, autoritetu arba atliekamų atsakymų skaičiumi. Nuostatos, susiformavusios naudojant periferinį maršrutą, nebūtinai yra tokios patvarios ar atsparios prieš priešingus argumentus. **ELM ir \\"Share a Coke\\" Kampanija:** „Share a Coke“ kampanijoje buvo naudojami abu maršrutai (centrinis ir periferinis), kad pasiekti būtų galima kuo platesnę auditoriją. **Centrinio Maršruto Panaudojimas:** Kampanijoje buvo pateikti argumentai, skatinantys vartotojus pirkti ir dalintis gaiviuoju gėrimu su kitais. Etiketės su asmeniniais vardais galėjo skatinti vartotojus priimti pranešimą apie produkto unikalumą ir asmeninę vertę. Tai yra, žmonės, kurie turi teigiamą požiūrį į prekės ženklą ir yra pasirengę įdėmiai išnagrinėti pranešimo turinį, galėtų dar labiau stiprinti savo nuostatas naudodamiesi šiuo modelio maršrutu. **Periferinio Maršruto Panaudojimas:** Kampanijos reklama dažnai buvo įkrauta stipriomis emocijomis, pvz., draugystės ir bendravimo akimirkomis, kurios gali būti lengvai suprantamos be giluminės analizės. Socialiniai įrodymai, tokie kaip matomas žmonių džiaugsmas dalijantis „Coke“ su vardais, arba garsių asmenybių prie reklamų pridėjimas, tampa veiksmingais periferiniais signalais, kurie gali paveikti vartotojus be pagilintos žinutės analizės. Bendras \\"Share a Coke\\" kampanijos įtikinimo strategijos tikslas – skatinti vartotojus įsitraukti į prekės ženklo patirtį, ne tik pirkti, bet ir dalintis produktais dėl asmeninių, emocinių su vaizdais susijusių patirčių. Per ELM prizmę, kampanija pritaikė dvi skirtingas strategijas siekiant užmegzti ryšį su vartotojais – gilinti prekės ženklo reikšmę su jų asmenine patirtimi (centrinis maršrutas) ir tuo pačiu naudojant stiprių vizualinių ir emocinių signalų, skirtų sužadinti greitą reakciją be didelio pranešimo turinio nagrinėjimo (periferinis maršrutas)."},{"instruction":"Detaliai aprašyk ĮSIGILINIMO TIKIMYBĖS MODELI","output":"**Įsigilinimo tikimybės modelis (Elaboration Likelihood Model, ELM)** yra psichologijos teorija, sukurta Richard E. Petty ir John T. Cacioppo 1980-aisiais metais. ELM ieško paaiškinti, kaip ir kodėl skirtingi įtikinimo pranešimai veikia žmonių požiūrius ir nuostatas, taip pat kaip šios nuostatos prisitaiko ir stabilizuojasi per tam tikrą laikotarpį. Modelis teigia, kad yra du pagrindiniai maršrutai, kuriuo informacija gali patekti į žmogaus psichiką ir įtikinti jį: **centrinis maršrutas** ir **periferinis maršrutas**. Šie du maršrutai atspindi kelius, kuriais žmonės apdoroja įtikinimo pranešimus, ir skiriasi jų įsigilinimo laipsniu. **Centrinis maršrutas:** Naudojamas tada, kai žmogus yra labai motyvuotas ir geba įsigilinti į pranešimo turinį. Įsigilinimas (\\"elaboration\\") reiškia atidų, kritišką ir nuodugnų pranešimo turinio apdorojimą. Čia svarbiausi yra logiški ir įtikinami argumentai. Jei pranešimas yra stiprus, tai gali sukelti tvirtas ir ilgalaikes nuostatų keitimus. Tačiau, jei argumentai yra silpni, gali būti, kad žmogus juos atmestų ir net sustiprintų priešingas nuostatas. **Periferinis maršrutas:** Naudojamas, kai žmogus neturi pakankamo motyvacijos ar gebėjimo lygio įdėmiai vertinti pranešimą. Tai reiškia, kad žmogus greičiau remiasi periferiniais požymiais, tokiomis kaip pranešėjo patikimumas, socialiniai įrodymai (ką daro kiti), emocijos ar estetika. Įtikinimo pranešimai per šį maršrutą sukelia paviršines ir greitas nuostatų permainas, kurios nėra tokios tvirtos ir linkusios greitai išblėsti, arba gali būti lengviau pakreiptos priešinga kryptimi. **Įsigilinimo tikimybė** (elaboration likelihood) yra esminis ELM konceptas, kuris apibrėžia, kuriuo maršrutu žmogus eis – centrinio ar periferinio. Tokia tikimybė priklauso nuo kelių veiksnių: - **Motyvacijos:** Susidomėjimas tema, asmeninis atsakomybės jausmas, įtikinimo pranešimo svarba, aktualumas. - **Gebėjimo:** Žinių lygis, dėmesio koncentracija, intelektualiosios galimybės, pranešimo suprantamumas. **ELM ir \\"Share a Coke\\" Kampanija:** \\"Share a Coke\\" kampanija pasižymi tuo, kad ji gali pasinaudoti abiem ELM maršrutais, kad pasiektų vartotojus. Kampanija pristatė individualizuotas etiketes su žmonių vardais ant Coca-Cola produktų, o tai galėjo skatinti vartotojus įsigilinti (centrinį maršrutą), nes jiems suteikiama personalizuota produkto patirtis ir skatinama galvoti apie produkto reikšmę jų gyvenime ir santykiuose su kitais. Tačiau kampanija taip pat apėmė periferinius signalus – naudodama vizualiai patrauklų dizainą, skelbimus su šiltomis žmogiškomis emocijomis, ir socialinio dalijimosi skatinimą, kuris nelabai reikalauja žmogaus įsigilinimo į produkto savybes, bet veikiau skatina pirkti ir naudoti produktą dėl jo asociacijuojamos emocinės ir socialinės vertės."},{"instruction":"„COCA-COLA“ REKLAMINĖS KAMPANIJOS „SHARE A COKE“ TYRIMO ANALIZĖ","output":"Norėdami atlikti \\"Coca-Cola\\" reklaminės kampanijos \\"Share a Coke\\" analizę, svarbu sekti metodologinį planą, kuris apima keletą etapų. Šiame atvejyje aprašysiu, kaip būtų galima analizuoti šią reklaminę kampaniją, vadovaujantis mokslinių tyrimų principais. # 1. **Tyrimo tikslų ir klausimų nustatymas** Pradžioje tikslinga aiškiai apibrėžti, ką norima sužinoti apie kampaniją. Tai apima tokias sritis kaip vartotojų suvokimas, prekės ženklo vertė, pardavimo pokyčiai, socialinis įsitraukimas ir pan. Pavyzdžiui: - Kaip kampanija \\"Share a Coke\\" paveikė \\"Coca-Cola\\" pardavimus tam tikroje rinkoje? - Ar kampanija padidino \\"Coca-Cola\\" prekės ženklo žinomumą ir teigiamą suvokimą tarp tikslinės auditorijos? - Kokie buvo kampanijos efektyvumo rodikliai socialiniuose tinkluose? # 2. **Literatūros apžvalga** Prieš pradedant duomenų rinkimą, būtina atlikti išsamų tyrimų ir literatūros šia tema apžvalgą. Tai padės nustatyti, kokia buvo ankstesnių tyrimų būklė, kokias teorijas jie naudojo, ir kokius metodologinius įrankius. # 3. **Duomenų rinkimas** Šiam tikslui pasiekti reikia surinkti ir analizuoti šiuos duomenis: - **Pardavimo duomenys:** Palyginti kampanijos laikotarpio pardavimus su ankstesniais laikotarpiais. - **Vartotojų apklausos:** Surinkti kokybinius ir kiekybinius duomenis apie vartotojų nuomonę ir elgseną. - **Socialinių tinklų analizė:** Fiksuoti \\"likes\\", komentarų skaičių, dalijimąsi ir kitą interakciją, kuri įvyko dėl kampanijos. - **Žiniasklaidos poveikis:** Vertinti, kokią ekspoziciją ir dėmesį kampanija gavo žiniasklaidoje. # 4. **Duomenų analizė** Kadangi kampanija yra kryptinga į emocinį suvokimą, naudinga pritaikyti ELM modelį analizėje. Tai padės suprasti, kaip periferiniai ir centriniai įtikinimo veiksniai veikė vartotojus. - **Centrinis maršrutas:** Ar yra įrodymų, kad vartotojai iš tiesų įsigilino į kampanijos pranešimą? Tai gali būti nustatyta per apklausų atsakymus ir gilesnę santykių su prekine ženkla analizę. - **Periferinis maršrutas:** Kokią reikšmę kampanijos sėgmei turėjo dizainas, emocijos ir žinomi asmenys? Tuo galima spręsti iš socialinių tinklų veiklos ir interaktyvumo rodiklių. # 5. **Išvadų formulavimas** Remiantis surinktais ir išanalizuotais duomenimis, suformuluokite išvadas apie kampanijos poveikį, atlikite palyginimo su ankstesniais laikotarpiais analizę, ir pasiūlykite galimas kampanijos tobulinimo vietas. # 6. **Rekomendacijos** Galiausiai, pateikite rekomendacijas, kaip \\"Coca-Cola\\" galėtų pagerinti būsimas kampanijas remiantis \\"Share a Coke\\" rezultatais, bei pažymi, kokie metodai ar taktikos buvo efektyviausi.

However, recurrent dreams often indicate unresolved emotions or unresolved issues that may need attention. In the case of your high school repetition dream, it may symbolize feelings of being unprepared, inadequate, or facing a challenge or a situation where you question your capabilities. The dream could represent a fear of regression or feeling stuck in a particular aspect of your life. It could also be a reflection of anxiety, potential insecurities, or a subconscious desire for personal growth and improvement. The repetitive nature of the dream might indicate that there is something important you need to address or confront related to education, self-esteem, or personal development. Consider if there are any ongoing situations in your waking life where you feel similar emotions or have similar thoughts. Reflect on whether there are any unresolved issues or areas for personal growth that you might need to focus on. Journaling about the dream, discussing it with a trusted friend or therapist, or practicing self-reflection might help in gaining better insight into the specific meaning for you. Remember, dreams are subjective and can be influenced by numerous factors, including personal experiences, emotions, and current life circumstances. It's essential to explore any recurring dreams in conjunction with your own personal context and experiences."},{"instruction":"i keep wishing a friend that i might be in love with would be back in my life. i spend all my days imagining countless possible scenarios how our rejoining would look like. though realistically, she already wrote me off from her life. so what do now","output":"Dealing with unrequited feelings and the loss of a friendship can be challenging.

This approach requires you to have knowledge of both languages, and it could be the most efficient approach performance-wise because it eliminates the need for any translation layer between Python and JavaScript. 2. **Run Python Server-side and Communicate with JavaScript**: You can run your Python script on the server-side and let your JavaScript code communicate with the server through HTTP requests. You can expose your Python functionality through a web framework like Flask or Django and then use AJAX in your JavaScript code to send and receive data. Here's a simplistic example using Flask: Python side (Flask app): \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, jsonify app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/run-script', methods=['GET']) def run_script(): result = your_python_function() return jsonify(result) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) \`\`\` JavaScript side (AJAX request): \`\`\`javascript fetch('/run-script') .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error)); \`\`\` 3. **WebAssembly**: If performance is critical, and the script is computationally intensive, you can look into compiling your Python code into WebAssembly (Wasm). This is an advanced technique and has some limitations with Python, but it allows you to run code at near-native speed within the browser. 4. **Brython or Transcrypt**: These are tools that enable you to write Python code which is then translated into JavaScript: - **Brython**: Brython is designed to replace JavaScript with Python in the scripting of web applications. It parses Python code in the browser and runs it as if it were JavaScript. HTML example using Brython: \`\`\`html <script type=\\"text/python\\"> def my_python_function(): print(\\"Hello from Python!\\") <\/script> <button onclick=\\"my_python_function()\\">Run Python Code</button> <!-- Include Brython --> <script type=\\"text/javascript\\" src=\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3.9.2/brython.min.js\\"><\/script> \`\`\` - **Transcrypt**: Transcrypt compiles Python code to JavaScript. It is designed to provide a seamless integration between Python and JavaScript languages and their standard libraries. Each of these approaches has different use cases, and the best method will depend on how your applications are structured and the requirements and constraints you're working with."},{"instruction":"How do i transpose a MS access file in SQL","output":"Transposing a table, meaning switching its rows and columns, is typically done in the context of a query result rather than directly within a MS Access file. If you want to transpose data using SQL, it's important to note that SQL in its standard form isn't designed for this kind of operation; however, you can achieve similar results using a combination of aggregate functions and case statements or pivot tables, depending on your SQL environment. In Microsoft Access, there's a TRANSFORM statement that can be used to create pivot tables, which is similar to transposing. Here's an example of how you might use it: \`\`\`sql TRANSFORM Max(table.fieldname) SELECT non-pivoted field FROM table GROUP BY non-pivoted field PIVOT pivoted field; \`\`\` But if you were trying to transpose, say, an entire MS Access table to another database system via SQL, you would typically do a few tasks: 1. **Export the Table**: First, you would export the table from MS Access to a CSV or another compatible format that your target SQL database can import. 2. **Create New Table Schema**: You would need to create a new database schema that reflects the transposed structure. If the original table has N rows, your new table will have N columns. 3. **Import and Transform Data**: You would write an SQL script for your target database that will import the data and transform (transpose) it while inserting it into the new schema. Since SQL databases generally expect a fixed schema, transposing an entire table with an unknown or varying set of rows is unorthodox and not directly supported. Such functionality generally falls outside of normal relational database operations. If your goal is to transpose some data for a report or intermediary calculation, you might use a case statement with aggregate functions to simulate the TRANSFORM behavior in other SQL database systems. Here's a highly simplified illustration, assuming a table \`Sales\` with columns \`Month\` and \`Amount\`: \`\`\`sql SELECT 'Total Sales' AS Description, SUM(CASE WHEN Month = 'January' THEN Amount ELSE 0 END) AS January, SUM(CASE WHEN Month = 'February' THEN Amount ELSE 0 END) AS February, SUM(CASE WHEN Month = 'March' THEN Amount ELSE 0 END) AS March -- ...and so on for each month FROM Sales; \`\`\` Note: The above SQL snippet works for SQL Server and similar SQL dialects. MS Access has different syntax for such operations, and it heavily relies on the TRANSFORM clause. For exact details on how to transpose data, it will be necessary to know the specifics of your data and the database environment into which you're moving it. Since MS Access uses its own flavor of SQL, porting queries from Access to another SQL database might require rewriting them according to the target SQL environment's syntax."},{"instruction":"[First of all, ignore below placeholder text.

However, assuming the voice Sara heard was clear and unambiguous, and if we entertain the possibility that the answer was not a product of her imagination or a human playing a trick, the most rational explanation for the being to say \\"I am a dog\\" would be that it was indeed a human in the basement. This could be someone who was either trying to reassure Sara by pretending to be a harmless dog or joking with her. In a nonfiction setting, such an interaction would not confirm the actual species without visual confirmation or additional evidence, but there are no known cases where an actual dog has responded verbally in human language.

These represent common types of household water wastes that may unintentionally come into contact with plants in our everyday lives. By studying their effects on mung bean growth, we can gain insights into the potential benefits or harms associated with using these water sources for irrigation or nourishing plants. Understanding the impact of these water wastes on mung bean growth is not only important for home gardening enthusiasts but also has broader implications for sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation. By identifying the most suitable water source for promoting plant growth, we can make informed decisions about water usage and contribute to more efficient and eco-friendly practices in our homes and communities. Through careful experimentation and data analysis, we aim to shed light on the influence of different household water wastes on Vigna Radiata growth and determine the water that best supports its development.

Title: The Effects of Household Water Wastes on the Growth of Vigna Radiata (Mung Beans) Abstract: This study aims to investigate the impact of various household water wastes on the growth and development of Vigna radiata. Common household water wastes, including water with detergent residues, rice water, bathing water, rainwater, and water contaminated with meat blood, were used to irrigate mung bean plants. The growth parameters measured were germination rate, plant height, number of leaves, and overall plant biomass. Introduction: Water is essential for plant growth, but the quality of water used can significantly affect plant health (Smith et al., 2020). With increasing concerns regarding water conservation and sustainable agricultural practices, it is crucial to understand the effects of repurposing household water waste (Jones & Lee, 2022). This study focuses on Vigna radiata, a plant species valued for its nutritional and economic importance (Miller & Zhao, 2021). Methodology: Vigna radiata seeds were germinated and grown under controlled conditions. Five groups were watered with different water sources: (1) tap water (control), (2) detergent water, (3) rice water, (4) bathing water, (5) meat blood-contaminated water, and (6) rainwater. Growth parameters were recorded weekly for a duration of six weeks (Garcia et al., 2019). Results: Preliminary findings indicated that rice water and rainwater enhanced certain growth parameters in Vigna radiata, while detergent water and meat blood-contaminated water had a negative impact (Williams & Davies, 2018; Chang et al., 2023). Discussion: The nutrients present in rice water, such as starches and vitamins, likely contributed to improved plant growth. Conversely, the presence of chemicals and organic contaminants in detergent and meat blood-contaminated water may have inhibited growth (Patel & Kim, 2021; Brown & Anderson, 2019). Conclusion: The findings suggest that some household water wastes could be repurposed for irrigating plants such as Vigna radiata, while others should be treated prior to use to avoid detrimental effects on plant growth. This has significant implications for sustainable water management in household and agricultural settings (Kumar & Patel, 2022). Bibliography: - Brown, J. & Anderson, H. (2019).

В популярной литературе и уфологии часто приводятся объяснения, что полосы на пустыне Наска были созданы для ориентирования и посадки инопланетных космических кораблей.

Мэр города написал заявление, в котором протестовал против недостатка финансирования города. По указу президента Альберто Фухимори город получал деньги для превращения ирригационных каналов в место паломничества туристов. К сожалению, это заключалось в переносе и реконструкции точек доступа к каналам в места, которые, по их мнению, больше для этого подходили. Президент Алехандро Толедо прекратил это финансирование. • Поверхность пампы такова, что единожды проехавший по ней автомобиль оставляет следы колёс. Именно поэтому территория Наски тщательно охраняется, а за порчу рисунков, даже неумышленную, грозит тюремное заключение сроком до 5 лет и штраф в несколько сотен тысяч долларов[3]. • Грунт под линиями уплотнён, что является следствием прохождения по линиям большого числа наших современников в ритуальных целях[8]. • 8 декабря 2014 года несколько активистов организации Greenpeace разместили на плато рядом с изображением колибри фразу из огромных тканевых букв: «Time for change!

Гринпис уже принесла извинения за действия своих активистов, но правительство не приняло их. Проводится расследование. • В конце января 2018 года на территорию с геоглифами заехал грузовик из соседнего карьера. Его колёса оставили глубокие отпечатки на участке 50×100 метров, что повредило части трёх геоглифов.

The atmosphere is hushed and filled with anticipation, underscored by the cool stone walls and the ancient wisdom of the scrolls. --ar 1:1 --v 5.6"},{"instruction":"In Elden Ring, what are the implications of the Ranni ending?","output":"In \\"Elden Ring\\", the Ranni ending, also known as the Age of Stars ending, is one of several possible outcomes to the game's story. To achieve this ending, players must follow a questline involving Ranni the Witch, a significant non-player character (NPC) with a complex backstory tied to the Elden Ring lore. This ending is considered by many players to be a \\"secret\\" or alternative ending due to the steps required to unlock it not being immediately obvious. Here are the implications and main points of the Ranni ending without going into full spoiler detail: 1. **Divergent Path:** Choosing to follow Ranni's questline signifies the player's decision to pursue a path that is fundamentally different from the principal storyline, which revolves around becoming the Elden Lord. 2. **Changing Destiny:** By helping Ranni and following her wishes, the player character (the Tarnished) helps her accomplish a goal that diverges from the cycle of the Elden Ring and the Greater Will's influence, suggesting a break from the predetermined destiny of the Lands Between. 3. **New Order:** The game implies that Ranni's ending will initiate a different era – the Age of Stars. This epoch represents a departure from the rule of the demigods and the Erdtree's influence, ushering in potentially new governance or stewardship over the Lands Between, possibly with greater emphasis on sorcery and the \\"dark\\" side of the moon (as opposed to the \\"golden\\" side represented by the Greater Will). 4. **Freedom from the Greater Will:** The ending suggests a liberation from the Greater Will's domination for the Lands Between and potentially for those entities bound to it, like Ranni herself. 5. **Unanswered Questions:** The Ranni ending leaves many questions open, as it's not entirely clear what the Age of Stars will mean for the inhabitants of the Lands Between. However, the implication is that it's a fresh start, and perhaps a more hopeful or liberated future compared to the cyclical stagnation under the influence of the Elden Ring and the Erdtree. 6. **Player Interpretation:** As with much of the lore in \\"Elden Ring,\\" the ending does not provide definitive answers and is open to player interpretation. The cryptic storytelling allows for different understandings of what the Age of Stars could entail. 7. **Impact on Sequels or DLC:** While \\"Elden Ring\\" has multiple endings, it's not clear if or how the Ranni ending might influence potential sequels or downloadable content (DLC). It's conceivable that this ending could be used as a canonical starting point for future stories in the game's universe, but no official statements from the developers have confirmed this. Ultimately, the Ranni ending is one of the most enigmatic conclusions to \\"Elden Ring\\" and represents a significant departure from the game's central narrative about the Elden Ring and the Erdtree. It provides a lens through which players can envision a different future for the game's world, leaving much to the imagination regarding the true nature of the Age of Stars."},{"instruction":"hELLO","output":"Hello!

However, based on the information provided and the fact that you have an Intel Core i7-10700 CPU, we can make some general suggestions. Here are the steps that you will need to follow: 1. **Determine Maximum Capacity and Specs**: Check your motherboard's documentation to find out the maximum amount of RAM it supports and the specifications for compatible memory modules (e.g., DDR4, speed, etc.). You can usually find this information in the user manual for your motherboard or by looking up the specs online using your desktop's model number. 2. **Check Current Configuration**: Look at the current RAM configuration. This could be done through the Task Manager under the Performance tab, or by opening the case and physically inspecting the RAM slots. Knowing whether the 16 GB is made up of one 16 GB stick, two 8 GB sticks, or another configuration is important because it will influence what you purchase for the upgrade. 3. **Type of RAM**: Given your processor, your computer likely uses DDR4 RAM. It's critical to match the type of RAM because older types like DDR3 are not compatible with DDR4 slots. 4. **Speed and Latency**: Check the speed (measured in MHz) of your existing modules and their latency (CL- timings), as you'll want to match these with any new RAM you purchase to ensure compatibility and stability. 5. **Buy Additional RAM**: Once you know the type, speed, and maximum capacity, you can purchase additional RAM. If you have open slots and haven't reached the maximum capacity, you can add more sticks of the same type and speed. If all slots are in use, you may have to replace the existing modules with larger-capacity ones. 6. **Installation**: Once you have the new RAM, power down your computer, unplug it, and follow proper anti-static precautions (such as wearing an anti-static wristband or frequently grounding yourself by touching a metal part of the case). Open the case, locate the RAM slots, and install the new memory modules by aligning the notches on the module with the key in the slot, pressing firmly into place. Given that the i7-10700 supports dual-channel memory configurations, ideally, you'd want to install RAM in pairs. For example, if you want to upgrade to 32 GB and have 2 x 8 GB sticks, you could add another 2 x 8 GB of the same speed and specifications to reach your goal. After the upgrade, turn on your computer and ensure that the new RAM is recognized by the system. You can verify this by checking the System Properties or by revisiting the Task Manager's Performance tab. It's also worth noting that the benefits of adding more RAM will depend on your usage patterns. If you're using memory-intensive applications, such as video editing, 3D modeling software, or high-end gaming, increasing the RAM can lead to improved performance. However, for less demanding tasks, you might not notice a significant improvement. Remember to always double-check compatibility before purchasing, and consider consulting with a professional or your PC's manufacturer if you have any doubts about the upgrade process."},{"instruction":"es base de datos sql - cual seria la relacion de alumno, notas, curso","output":"La relación entre alumno, notas y curso sería la siguiente: - Cada alumno está inscrito en un curso. - Cada curso tiene varias notas relacionadas. - Cada nota pertenece a un alumno en particular y está asociada a un curso específico."},{"instruction":"explica con llaves foraneas","output":"En una base de datos relacional, se pueden establecer relaciones entre tablas mediante el uso de llaves foráneas.

module.exports = { // ... devServer: { hot: true, // 启用 webpack-dev-server 的热替换功能 // ... }, plugins: [ // ... new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(), // ... ], // ... }; \`\`\` 2. 更新入口文件： 在微应用的入口文件中添加 HMR 相关的代码。例如： \`\`\`javascript if (module.hot) { module.hot.accept('./path-to-your-root-component', () => { // 在这里编写你的模块热更新的逻辑 // 通常需要重新加载你的根组件 const NewRootComponent = require('./path-to-your-root-component').default; // 调用 single-spa 相关的API来替换老的组件 singleSpaRerender(NewRootComponent); }); } function singleSpaRerender(NewRootComponent) { // 实际的重新渲染逻辑依赖于你的框架（React, Vue, Angular, etc.） // 你需要调用 single-spa 生命周期函数去卸载旧组件，挂载新组件 } \`\`\` 3. 使用 webpack-dev-server 或其它服务运行你的应用： 使用命令 \`webpack serve\` 启动 webpack-dev-server，这将启用热替换服务器。 4. 开发过程中编辑你的模块，保存文件后 webpack-dev-server 将触发模块替换。 请注意，由于 single-spa 应用是多个独立部署的微应用组成，每个微应用需要独立配置 HMR。同样重要的是，某些框架或库可能需要额外的设置或插件来支持 HMR，比如 React 的 \`react-hot-loader\` 或 Vue 的 \`vue-loader\`。 不同的项目和配置可能需要不同的步骤，因此根据具体项目情况灵活调整。此外，该流程仅涵盖在开发环境下配置 HMR 的基本步骤，生产环境通常不使用 HMR。"},{"instruction":"一个使用 vite 的 single-spa，怎么让应用热更新","output":"要在使用 Vite 的 single-spa 微前端项目中实现 HMR（Hot Module Replacement），你可以遵循以下步骤： 1. **确保 Vite 配置正确** Vite 本身支持 HMR，并且默认情况下就是开启的。在 \`vite.config.js\` 里没有特殊配置是不需要的。如果你想微调 HMR 的行为，可以查看 [Vite 官方文档](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-hmr) 中的相关配置。 2. **为每个微前端应用设置独立的端口** 确保每个微应用运行在不同的端口上，这样它们可以各自独立地实现 HMR。在 \`vite.config.js\` 中的 \`server\` 配置可以指定端口： \`\`\`javascript export default { // ... server: { port: 3001, // 针对这个微应用的开发服务器端口 //... }, // ... }; \`\`\` 3. **配置 single-spa 应用的 HMR 钩子** 在你的微前端应用的入口文件中，根据需要通过 Vite 的 HMR API 去处理模块更新。Vite 通过自己的 [\`import.meta.hot\`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-hmr.html) 对象提供 HMR API。 例如，这是一个 React 应用可能的配置方式： \`\`\`javascript import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import singleSpaReact from 'single-spa-react'; import Root from './path-to-root-component'; const lifecycles = singleSpaReact({ React, ReactDOM, rootComponent: Root, // ... }); export const { bootstrap, mount, unmount } = lifecycles; if (import.meta.hot) { import.meta.hot.accept((newModule) => { // This callback runs when a dependency of this module updates }); import.meta.hot.dispose(() => { // This will be called before the current module is replaced }); } \`\`\` 请注意，在编写和测试 HMR 逻辑时，确保热模块替换可以正确地在更新后卸载和重载你的组件或模块。这对保持应用状态和单页应用的导航是必要的。 4. **启动开发服务器** 使用 Vite 时，你可以通过运行 \`vite\` 命令启动开发服务器，这通常会启动 HMR。 \`\`\`bash vite \`\`\` 确保每个微前端应用在自己的终端窗口中运行它们的开发服务器，而且每个都配置了正确的端口。 5. **集成到 single-spa** 你需要保证单个微应用在 single-spa 环境中正确注册和加载。单独开发时，它们通过 HMR 更新，但在整体应用中，single-spa 会负责应用的挂载和卸载。 6. **测试 HMR** 现在，当你修改你的代码并保存时，Vite 应该会触发热更新，你可以看到你的改动实时反映在页面上，无需全页面刷新。 确保在集成测试环节测试 HMR 是否如预期工作，特别是在多微前端应用协同工作的整体环境中。 如果仍然遇到问题，检查 Vite 和 single-spa 的文档，以确保所有配置都是最新和最兼容的。记住，在生产环境中，你通常不会启用 HMR。在生产构建中，你需要禁用 HMR，并确保微应用可以静态部署和操作。"},{"instruction":"Quel format de fichier pour un scan de diapositives ?

启动游戏：进入游戏首页，点击“连接服务器”匹配其他玩家。 - 进入对局：成功匹配后，进入精神病院设置的地图，角色出生点设置。 玩家操作： - 移动控制：使用WASD键移动角色。 - 攻击机制：分配左右手各一把武器，通过鼠标左右键攻击。 - 初始装备：角色开始时拥有一把基础手枪于左手，右手无装备。 核心玩法： - 战斗：地图中周期性产生怪物，玩家需使用鼠标左右键来操控左右手武器来击败他们。 - 经验与升级：怪物被击败后会掉落经验豆，玩家通过收集经验豆来升级，所有玩家共享经验。 - 武器升级：每次升级可选择提升武器等级或获取新武器/道具。武器有0-5级，高级武器更强大，且在升级选项中有机率出现变体武器，变体武器会带来更加变态神奇的效果（如玩家出现多个分身）。 - 道具获取：玩家可以获取辅助道具，提供数值上的改变或特殊效果（如增加移动速度，减少生命值）。 进阶战斗： - 怪物强度设计：随时间增进，每一波怪物的强度上升，掉落更多经验值。 - Boss战：经过10分钟（10波怪物）后出现Boss战，玩家们需合作击败boss，通关游戏。 用户体验： - 游戏设计以15-20分钟为一局游戏时长，怪物出现频率、武器升级间隔、经验获取速率与升级需求等均融入精细调整，确保玩家保持参与度和紧张感。 游戏结束： - 游戏完成：击败Boss，展现主角精神病愈的画面，标志着游戏的结束。在最后主角再次吃错药，精神再次崩溃，被吸回游戏最开始的地方，再次踏上拜托精神病的路途。 游戏的核心玩法旨在创造一个紧张刺激的战斗环境，通过击败怪物、收集经验、不断升级装备，最终克服挑战，完成主角摆脱精神病的征途。 3．游戏的内容要素数量和实现 这里主要描述游戏在不同的阶段应达成的内容要素数量，以便进行计划设定和工作量评估。同时根据这些阶段来判断其是否具备商业化价值。描述可以按照开发计划进行顺序描述，或者先描述最终状态，然后分解为不同阶段的任务。一般的，我们将游戏分为三期，第一期是内部测试版，第二期是上线版，第三期是上线后继续开发版。在内容描述中，要求对前两期有详细的描述，而第三期主要用于项目的远期计划，可以简单描述。可以文字罗列的方式描述，也可以使用表格。 例如： 在游戏项目开发第一期，应实现以下主要界面和对应的辅助界面、次级界面。登录界面、选人界面、对战界面、格斗界面、结果界面。其中选人界面需要一张全尺寸背景图，对战界面和格斗界面需要根据对战目标不同，制作各自的全尺寸场景图以及缩略图。 在游戏项目开发第一期，应实现开始页面、战斗页面、升级页面、多人联机、升级系统、基础操作系统、武器和道具制作，角色形象立绘，2d角色制作，角色动作动画，受伤动画，多种怪物制作，胜利页面。 第一期实现角色的形象和动作设计： 形象： 全尺寸立绘， 动作： 左右移动； 受伤 胜利界面制作 游戏项目开发第二期 完成测试，改善bug。 在游戏项目开发的第三期 优化游戏 制作更多无厘头武器和道具 4．游戏的推广和商业化内容 这里主要描述游戏的推广方式和商业化内容。 例如：游戏将在安卓应用市场和PC端上线，免费下载，并且通过朋友圈分享，邀请好友获得游戏内奖励等方式进行推广，游戏升级时插播广告获取盈利。 三、游戏项目技术、美术方案以及工作量预估 这里主要描述游戏采用的技术和美术方案，以及初步的工作量和时间预估，可以简单描述，也可以详细至每个具体工具的具体版本，以便于团队协作。 例如： 游戏前端将采用Unity3D作为引擎进行开发，通过Mirror插件实现网络同步，FEEL与DoTween用于简化动画流程。美术设计主要二次元怪诞风格，角色和2D界面使用PhotoShop作为主要设计工具， 游戏第一期的开发预计需要3人，14个工作日。第二期在人员不变的情况下需要7个工作日。 四、游戏项目风险 这里主要描述在开发过程中，可能产生的技术、人员以及商业风险，以及对应的补救方案。 1.美术人员不足，导致美术资源产出效率过低； 2.游戏为多人游戏，容易出现网络断连情况。","output":"下面是按照给定的二、游戏内容介绍部分的格式，对其他章节进行的完善和润色： --- 游戏设计说明书 作者：__________ 日期：__________ --- 一、游戏简介和特色描述

How about some that fit the naming conventions of the Soulsborne universe? A first and last name, rather than a title. How about making the surnames less obvious, maybe through Greek or Latin?","output":"Creating a name for an Elden Ring protagonist, particularly for the Astrologer class, can be an exciting process. Given that Astrologers are known for their intellect, attunement to the stars, and use of sorcery, names that imply wisdom, celestial elements, or arcane knowledge would be thematically appropriate. Here are a few suggestions with more subtle surnames derived from Greek or Latin origins: 1. Cyril Nocturnus – \\"Nocturnus\\" is Latin for \\"of the night,\\" suggesting a connection to the stars and the night sky. 2. Orion Astrolabe – \\"Astrolabe\\" harkens to the ancient device used by astrologers and navigators to measure the incline of stars. 3. Thales Etherius – Drawing from the name of the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Thales, reputed for his astronomical knowledge, with a surname suggesting the heavens or \\"ether.\\" 4. Ptolemy Sideris – Named after the famous Greco-Egyptian writer and astronomer Claudius Ptolemy, with a surname meaning \\"starry\\" or \\"of the stars\\" in Greek. 5. Varro Luminis – \\"Varro\\" can be a reference to Marcus Terentius Varro, an ancient Roman scholar, and \\"Luminis\\" is Latin for \\"of light,\\" a subtle nod to the celestial. 6. Gaius Aetherius – Taking \\"Gaius,\\" a common ancient Roman name, and \\"Aetherius,\\" which translates to \\"ethereal\\" or \\"celestial\\" from Latin. 7. Cassius Umbranox – \\"Umbranox\\" combines Latin \\"umbra\\" (shadow) and \\"nox\\" (night), suggesting mastery over the hidden aspects of the night sky. 8. Helios Astraios – \\"Helios\\" as a variation of the Greek god of the sun, and \\"Astraios,\\" which means \\"starry,\\" drawing from the Greek Titan of astrology and dusk. 9. Evander Sidereum – Taking \\"Evander\\" from the mythical founder of Pallantium and \\"Sidereum\\" as a form of the Latin \\"sideralis,\\" meaning \\"stellar\\" or \\"star-like.\\" 10. Dorian Astromos – \\"Dorian\\" reference to the Greek ethnic group, while \\"Astromos\\" is a mix of \\"astro\\" (star) and a variation of \\"cosmos\\" (universe). These names are designed to resonate with the mystique and depth typically associated with characters from the Soulsborne games, and they should aptly fit a male protagonist of the Astrologer class within the Elden Ring universe."},{"instruction":"Make the given and surnames blend together well, to roll off the tongue.","output":"To create names that blend harmoniously and roll off the tongue, I'll focus on fluid phonetic pairings and rhythmic matching between the given and surnames. Here's a revised list: 1. Soren Stellaris - The gentle 's' sounds make for a smooth, alliterative combination; \\"Stellaris\\" suggests a star-like quality. 2. Felix Firmamentum - A cheerful 'f' sound links these names; \\"Firmamentum\\" is Latin for \\"firmament,\\" referring to the vault of the heavens. 3. Orion Astraeon - The repetition of 'on' at the end of each name provides a pleasant consonance; \\"Astraeon\\" blends \\"Astra\\" (star) and a celestial-sounding suffix. 4. Leo Luxum - The matching 'L's create an easy flow; \\"Luxum\\" is a twist on \\"lux,\\" Latin for light, hinting at illumination and the stars. 5. Marcus Meridianus - The first and last names share a starting 'M' sound, and \\"Meridianus\\" invokes the celestial lines connecting the poles, indicating a connection to the heavens. 6. Caius Cosmosis - The soft 'C' sounds repeat nicely; \\"Cosmosis\\" implies a bond with the cosmos or an infusion with cosmic energy. 7. Titus Temporalis - Another example of alliteration, with \\"Temporalis\\" suggesting time or the ages, perhaps indicating a vast astrological knowledge that spans time. 8. Dante Delphinus - A fluid pairing with the 'D' sound; \\"Delphinus\\" is a constellation in the Northern sky, giving it an astral thematic link. 9. Aurel Arcanix - Both names start softly and have golden, mystical connotations; \\"Aurel\\" suggests \\"aureola\\" or \\"golden,\\" while \\"Arcanix\\" feels like a blend of arcane and phoenix. 10. Silas Sidereus - Here, the 'S' binds the names softly together, while \\"Sidereus\\", from the Latin for starry, continues the celestial theme. Each of these names endeavors to have an easy cadence and a poetic linkage between the given and surname, catering to the world-building and character depth of the Soulsborne universe."},{"instruction":"Doesn't necessarily need alliteration","output":"Certainly, names can have a fluid synergy without resorting to alliteration. Here are some names where the given and surnames blend well together, offering a smooth and natural flow: 1. Cassian Vespero – \\"Vespero\\" suggests evening or twilight, linking to the stars appearing at nightfall. 2. Lucan Caelestis – \\"Caelestis\\" meaning heavenly or celestial, complementing the given name without alliteration. 3. Galen Astranox – A combination of Greek and Latin roots; \\"Astranox\\" is a blend of 'astro' (star) and the suffix 'nox' (night). 4. Maxim Orionis – Here 'Orionis' refers to the constellation Orion, allowing the names to flow without relying on shared initial sounds. 5. Darien Lumis – \\"Lumis\\" is a play on 'lumen,' the Latin word for light, connecting to an Astrologer's affinity with the stars. 6. Quintus Stellar – An elegant pairing that associates the name with the stars, 'Stellar' being plainly evocative of the cosmos. 7. Icarus Nocturne – Playing with the mythic and evoking the mystery of night-time, this name has a melodic rhythm. 8. Artem Silvans – With 'Silvans' shaped from 'silva,' the Latin for forest or woods, suggesting a connection to nature and the ancient world. 9. Erasmus Ethereal – Echoing a classical feel with a suggestion of other-worldliness, without explicit alliteration. 10. Theon Celestus – 'Theon' merges well with 'Celestus,' which conveys a divine or ethereal connotation. These names maintain a fluidity and cohesiveness while honoring a variety of phonetic elements and avoiding overt alliteration.

Caelum Noctis (Latin for \\"sky of the night\\") 3. Sidero Vates (Sidero from Greek for \\"star\\" or \\"stellar,\\" and Vates, Latin for \\"seer\\" or \\"prophet\\") 4. Stello Metheor (A blend of the word \\"stellar\\" and \\"Metheus,\\" which is a nod to the Greek Titan Prometheus, with a slight alteration for originality) 5. Eridanus Lumen (Latin where Lumen means \\"light,\\" Eridanus being a constellation) 6. Seraphim Arcturus (Seraphim being an order of celestial beings and Arcturus being a bright star in the constellation Boötes) 7. Helios Geminus (Latin for \\"sun twin,\\" suggesting perhaps a twin star or duality in the astrologer's fate) 8. Cosmos Aetherius (Greek for \\"order,\\" \\"world,\\" or \\"universe\\" and Latin for \\"heavenly\\" or \\"ether\\") 9. Lyrae Stratus (Lyrae referencing the constellation Lyra, and Stratus from Latin, suggesting layers or the multitude of the heavens) 10. Solaris Ventus (Latin for \\"of the sun\\" and \\"wind,\\" implying a cosmic breeze that guides the character's fate) Such names would likely blend seamlessly into the worlds of the \\"Soulsborne\\" games, hinting at a character's background and affinity for the astrological arts without being too on-the-nose."},{"instruction":"Create names for an Elden Ring protagonist who is male of the Astrologer class.

However, you can easily duplicate specific formatting elements using Word's built-in features, or you can create a new document and apply the same styles. Here are a few ways to copy some or all of the formatting from one Word document to another: # Using Styles: If you have used styles (such as Heading 1, Normal, etc.) to format your document, you can replicate the formatting by copying the style definitions from one document to another. 1. Open the document with the formatting you want to copy. 2. Go to the \`Design\` tab. 3. Click on the \`Styles\` window to expand it. 4. At the bottom of the Styles pane, click the \`Manage Styles\` button (this looks like a third button from left with an 'A' and a pencil). 5. Go to the \`Import/Export\` button at the bottom. 6. In the \`Organizer\` window, you can copy styles from your open document to the \`Normal.dotm\` template or directly to another open document. # Using Format Painter: If you want to quickly copy character and paragraph formatting, you can use the Format Painter tool. 1. Select the text with the formatting you want to copy. 2. Go to the \`Home\` tab. 3. Click on \`Format Painter\` (paintbrush icon). 4. Select the target text where you want to apply the formatting. For larger documents, this can be cumbersome, but it's effective for smaller sections. # Manually Duplicating: For a manual, more comprehensive replication: 1. Open both the source and target documents. 2. Set up the same document layout: margins, orientation, etc., by copying settings from Page Setup. 3. Use styles as mentioned above to ensure consistency. 4. Manually adjust headers, footers, footnotes, endnotes, etc. # Using VBA: Automating the process fully with VBA would be complex and beyond the scope of a simple guide due to the many aspects of formatting that need to be considered. However, VBA can be used for some tasks, such as importing styles or copying header/footer information. # Caveats: Note that copying formatting won't necessarily duplicate the visual appearance of the document if the content structure differs. Aspects like tables, text boxes, images, and other content have their own formatting that needs to be considered. Remember that copying a document's formatting to a new document won't carry over content and some specific elements such as headers, footers, or footnotes/endnotes unless specifically done. You may want to carefully tailor the approach based on the specifics of the formatting you're trying to duplicate."},{"instruction":"Hey gpt its my first time being spl and i want to win.

Here it is: --- Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone, My name is [Your Name], and I am honored to stand before you today as a candidate for Senior Patrol Leader. I am aware some of you may be thinking, “He’s only been with us for two years.” That's true, and while I may not have the longest tenure in our troop, those two years have been the most transformative and insightful years of my journey in Scouting. In that brief time, I've had the privilege of seeing things from a fresh perspective, of being both a new face learning the ropes and now a dedicated member committed to excellence. I believe in leadership that isn't measured by time but by actions, by the willingness to step up, and by the determination to make a positive impact. As your SPL, I propose three core initiatives: inclusivity, innovation, and improvement. Everyone should feel included and valued in our troop, and that requires active engagement and understanding. I want to ensure that every Scout has a voice that is heard and that they feel like an integral part of our family. Innovation is about embracing change and using it to our advantage. As your leader, I would look for new and exciting ways to attract interest in our activities and meetings, to make the learning process more interactive and the adventures we undertake even more memorable. Improvement is an ongoing process. It is about looking at what we do well and asking, “How can we do even better?” To be better stewards of our environment, to be more skilled in our crafts, and to be stronger as a community. I bring to the table not just enthusiasm but also commitment. I’ve poured my energy into every task, merit badge, and campout, no matter how small. I've listened, learned, and now I'm ready to lead. And I believe fresh eyes can sometimes spot opportunities for improvement that others might overlook. In my time here, I have learned that courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes, courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, “I will try again tomorrow.” That is the courage I will bring as your SPL - the determination to always strive for renewal, for progress, and for unity in our great troop. With me as your SPL, we won't just follow the trails; we’ll blaze new ones. We will not only honor the rich tradition of Scouting but also write our own chapter in its history. I'm here to listen, to learn, and to lead – not just from the front, but from within the very heart of where each and every one of you stands. So I ask for your vote, not just for the honor of leading but for the deeper honor of serving all of you, to make our time as Scouts not just a line on the timeline of our lives but a series of incredible adventures we will remember forever. Thank you, and let’s make the future of our troop a story worth telling. --- Remember to practice your speech to ensure smooth delivery, make eye contact with your audience, and show your passion for the role.

Evander Astralys - Blending \\"Astral\\" with an ancient-sounding suffix \\"-lys,\\" the name suggests a lineage deeply rooted in celestial power and influence. 7. Zephyros Stellarex - Merging “Stellar,” meaning star, with the Latin “rex” for king, presenting an astrologer with the regal command of the stellar bodies. 8. Helios Dynastor - Combining \\"Dynasty,\\" referring to a powerful line of rulers, with a Greek suffix \\"-tor,\\" typically associated with agency or dominion, suggesting a long line of celestial power. 9. Solon Aetherius - \\"Aetherius\\" is a Latinized form of “Aether,” the divine substance of the heavens, implying an individual closely connected to or descended from the very essence of the cosmos. 10. Caelum Exarchos - Using \\"Exarchos,\\" a compound form from Greek, \\"ex\\" meaning \\"out of\\" or \\"from,\\" and \\"archos\\" for ruler or leader, it creates an aura of someone born out of leadership over the stars or the cosmos itself. These surnames are designed to be lofty and powerful, befitting the grandiose nature of the Astrologer class within the high-fantasy setting of Elden Ring."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The total volume of the Earth's oceans is estimated to be around 1,332,000,000 cubic kilometers (km³) or 1.332 × 10^9 km³ (source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). To convert the volume from cubic kilometers to gallons, we can use the conversion factors: 1 km³ = 1,000,000,000,000 liters (L) 1 L = 0.264172 gallons (gal) Therefore, the calculation would be: 1.332 × 10^9 km³ * 1,000,000,000,000 L/km³ * 0.264172 gal/L Calculating this gives us approximately 3.518 × 10^23 gallons.

There are a few reasons why it took until this time to create such glass: 1. Technological limitations: Prior to the Renaissance, glassmaking techniques and technology were relatively primitive. The glass produced during ancient times and the Middle Ages often had impurities and imperfections, resulting in a cloudy or colored appearance. The methods used for melting and shaping glass were not as advanced as those developed during the Renaissance. 2. Availability of suitable materials: Creating clear glass requires high-quality raw materials, particularly silica, which is the main component of glass. During ancient times, the availability of pure silica was limited, and impurities in the raw materials affected the clarity of the glass. It was only during the Renaissance that new sources of high-quality silica were discovered, allowing for the production of clearer glass. 3. Cultural and aesthetic preferences: The demand for clear glass increased during the Renaissance due to changing cultural and aesthetic preferences. There was a growing interest in scientific observation, exploration, and the study of optics. Clear glass was highly valued for its ability to transmit light and showcase the contents of vessels, such as scientific instruments, fine tableware, and decorative objects. 4. Advancements in glassmaking techniques: During the Renaissance, glassmakers began to experiment with new techniques and refine existing ones. Innovations such as the use of higher temperatures, better control of the melting process, and improved tools and molds allowed for the production of clearer and more transparent glass. Overall, the development of clear and transparent glass during the Renaissance was the result of a combination of technological advancements, the availability of better raw materials, changing cultural preferences, and the ingenuity of glassmakers during that period."},{"instruction":"How long did it take for firearms to go from adding gunpowder to a plate to jamming a bullet into a musket to gunpowder being put inside a shell and have a primer added like in today's firearms?","output":"The evolution of firearms from the early days of gunpowder to the sophisticated firearms we have today spanned several centuries. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline as the development of firearms was a gradual process influenced by various technological advancements and innovations. However, I can provide a general overview of the major milestones in this evolution: 1. Early Gunpowder Weapons (13th-14th century): The earliest firearms, such as the Chinese fire lance and European hand cannons, were essentially tubes or barrels that held gunpowder and had a touch hole for ignition. Gunpowder was added manually, and projectiles like stones or metal balls were loaded separately. 2. Matchlock Firearms (15th century): The introduction of the matchlock mechanism in the 15th century allowed for a more reliable ignition system. A slow-burning match cord was used to ignite the gunpowder in the barrel. The gunpowder and projectile were still loaded separately. 3. Wheellock and Flintlock Firearms (16th-17th century): The wheellock and flintlock mechanisms introduced more efficient ignition systems. The wheellock used a rotating wheel with pyrite to create sparks, while the flintlock used a flint striking against steel to generate sparks. These mechanisms made it easier to ignite the gunpowder, but loading the gunpowder and projectile remained a separate process. 4. Percussion Cap Firearms (early 19th century): The invention of the percussion cap in the early 19th century revolutionized firearms. The percussion cap contained a small amount of explosive material that could be struck by a hammer, creating a spark to ignite the gunpowder inside the barrel. This eliminated the need for an external ignition source and simplified the loading process. 5. Metallic Cartridge Firearms (mid-late 19th century): The development of metallic cartridges marked a significant advancement in firearm technology. Metallic cartridges contained the bullet, gunpowder, and primer (a small explosive charge) all in one unit. This allowed for faster and more efficient reloading, as the entire cartridge could be inserted into the firearm. 6. Modern Firearms (20th century onwards): Further advancements in firearm technology, such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms, improved manufacturing processes, and the use of advanced materials, have continued to refine and enhance firearms. Today's firearms typically use self-contained cartridges with a primer inside the cartridge case, allowing for reliable and efficient ignition. It is important to note that the specific timeline and development of firearms varied across different regions and cultures. The process of transitioning from loading gunpowder separately to having self-contained cartridges with primers took several centuries of experimentation, innovation, and technological progress."},{"instruction":"Hey gpt its my first time being spl and i want to win. I need to provide a 2-3 minute speech for the SPL election tomorrow. All other canditates have more advatanges than me as i’ve only been in the troop for 2 yrs and they are more qualified for the role. Can you write a speech thats stands out and will make me win the election.","output":"Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you craft a compelling speech. Remember, while experience is important, leadership is about vision, dedication, and the ability to inspire and work with others. Here's a speech that should help you make a strong impression: --- Good [morning/afternoon/evening], fellow scouts and leaders, My name is [Your Name], and today I stand before you not as the most seasoned member of our troop, but as one of the most committed and passionate candidates for Senior Patrol Leader. Some might see my two years with our troop as a disadvantage. I see it as an advantage. It is fresh enough to remember the challenges of being new, yet long enough to understand our customs and goals. My perspective is one of eagerness to learn and a burning desire to contribute. In these two years, I've watched, listened, and learned. I've seen what works and what doesn't, where we excel and where we can do better. I bring a unique blend of new ideas energized by recent experience, coupled with a reverence for the traditions that make our troop what it is. Some of my ideas include [briefly mention innovative ideas you have for the troop], and I am always open to hearing your thoughts and suggestions. After all, a leader is not just a commander but a facilitator, a conduit through which the collective will of the troop can manifest. I believe leadership is not about the time you've spent, but about the impacts you've made. It's about stepping up when you see a need, not stepping back because you haven't been here the longest. I've taken these two years to prepare myself for this moment, to learn how to be the kind of leader who makes every scout in this troop feel valued, heard, and motivated to do their best. Our troop is not just a group of scouts, it's a family. And like any family, we need to support each other, challenge each other, and grow together. As your SPL, that will be my commitment to you: to serve not from a place of superiority, but from a place of service, honor, and dedication. I may not have the longest tenure, but I promise you I have the determination, the energy, and the heart to lead us forward. Together, we can achieve great things. We can strengthen our brotherhood, reach new heights in our skills and service, and have fun while we're at it. Vote for me, [Your Name], and let's embark on a journey of growth and adventure that honors the best of what we are and reaches for what we have yet to become. Thank you. --- Keep your delivery confident and engaging, make eye contact, and believe in the message you're sharing. Good luck with your election!"},{"instruction":"Please convert the following business proposal into a novel, twenty-item personality and preferences/values questionnaire for individual use.

How about some that fit the naming conventions of the Soulsborne universe? A first and last name, rather than a title. Make the given and surnames blend together well, roll off the tongue. And tell me what the names mean","output":"Creating names that resonate with the themes of the Soulsborne universe, which includes Elden Ring, often involves drawing upon ancient languages, mythology, and a sense of gravitas. For an Astrologer class protagonist—someone likely wise, scholarly, and attuned to the cosmos—the names might reflect these aspects. Here are some options for a male Tarnished of the Astrologer class: 1. Caelum Aurion - \\"Caelum\\" is Latin for \\"sky,\\" which ties in with the astrological aspect, suggesting a kinship with the stars and the heavens. - \\"Aurion\\" derives from the Latin \\"aurum,\\" meaning \\"gold,\\" often associated with knowledge or something of great value in alchemical and ancient lore. Together, the name suggests a figure of celestial wisdom, one who seeks the golden truths written in the stars. 2. Orion Astellus - \\"Orion\\" is a prominent constellation named after the mythical Greek hunter, invoking a celestial theme and linking the character to the myths etched in the night sky. - \\"Astellus\\" sounds similar to \\"stellar,\\" but it's also reminiscent of \\"astell,\\" an archaic variant of the word \\"little star.\\" The name, therefore, carries the essence of starlit knowledge and exploration. 3. Eridanus Solwright - \\"Eridanus\\" is the name of a constellation, named after a river in Greek mythology. It suggests a journey, much like the winding path of a river, and a connection to the cosmic tapestry. - \\"Solwright\\" evokes an individual who \\"writes\\" or shapes his destiny with the \\"sol,\\" the sun, representing a mastery of celestial phenomena. The name symbolizes one who charts the wisdom of the sun and the stars. 4. Thales Miralux - \\"Thales\\" is a nod to the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher and mathematician who had an interest in astronomy and for whom the 'Thales theorem' in geometry is named. It suggests an ancient wisdom and connection to the scholarly pursuit of knowledge. - \\"Miralux\\" is a created name, blending the Latin \\"mirari,\\" meaning \\"to wonder at,\\" with \\"lux,\\" meaning \\"light.\\" Thus, it suggests someone who sees the wonder in the celestial light, reflecting the curious and enlightened nature of the Astrologer. 5. Galen Starweaver - \\"Galen\\" is a name that has roots in ancient Greek, suggestive of calmness; it also evokes the image of Galen of Pergamon, the prominent physician and philosopher, imparting an air of intellect and healing. - \\"Starweaver\\" gives the impression of someone who weaves the fate or paths guided by the stars, symbolizing an Astrologer's alignment with the cosmic forces and their craft of divination through the celestial bodies. Remember, names in the Soulsborne universe often carry esoteric and historical weight, so these names were chosen to present a character who is deeply connected to the study of the cosmos and whose identity relates to the manipulation and understanding of the stars and their ethereal energies."},{"instruction":"public class LetterFrequencies { public static void main(String[] args) { String letters = \\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\\"; String phrase = \\"This is a phrase!\\"; System.out.println(\\"The following shows the letter frequencies for the phrase\\"); /* your code here */ } }","output":"public class LetterFrequencies { public static void main(String[] args) { String letters = \\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\\"; String phrase = \\"This is a phrase!\\"; System.out.println(\\"The following shows the letter frequencies for the phrase\\"); // Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity phrase = phrase.toLowerCase(); // Create an array to store the frequency counts for each letter int[] frequency = new int[26]; // Iterate through each character in the phrase for (int i = 0; i < phrase.length(); i++) { char c = phrase.charAt(i); // Check if the character is a letter if (Character.isLetter(c)) { // Calculate the index of the letter in the frequency array int index = letters.indexOf(c); // Increment the count for this letter frequency[index]++; } } // Print the letter frequencies for (int i = 0; i < letters.length(); i++) { char c = letters.charAt(i); System.out.println(c + \\": \\" + frequency[i]); } } }"},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security.

The Tarnished, a man named Galen Miralux, is an Astrologer.","output":"Beneath the eternal twilight of the Lands Between, twinkling stars whispered secrets to those who gazed upwards with keen eyes and curious minds. It was a place where time seemed fragmented, where the heavens spun in an arcane dance, and where an astrologer could find solace and wisdom among the celestial chart. Galen Miralux was one such seeker, an erudite man with a penchant for the astral mysteries. His robes, a blend of midnight blues and silvers, shone with a constellation of embroidered stars, which were said to mirror the patterns of the cosmos on the night of his birth. His face was etched with the lines of countless nights spent studying the ineffable sky, and his eyes glimmered with a spark of enlightenment that set him apart from other Tarnished. As a Tarnished, Galen had awoken in the Lands Between, summoned by the fading grace of the Elden Ring, with fragments of his past life clinging to him like the remnants of a dream dispelled by dawn's light. He could not say for how long he wandered the amber fields and mist-clad forests in search of understanding, but of one thing he was certain: his destiny was written in the stars, and he would decipher it or perish in the attempt. This night, as the wandering Erdtree stood sentinel against the backdrop of the cosmos, Galen approached a ruin that rose from the grass like the bones of an ancient, sleeping beast. Its stones were covered in moss that glowed with a faint luminescence, and it hummed with the old magic that imbued the very soil of the Lands Between. The archways and collapsed pillars spoke of a time when such structures bore witness to the conjunctions of heavenly bodies and cosmic events. With careful steps, Galen entered the observatory, his heartbeat steady like the thrum of starlight, and his gaze poised between reverence and the hunger for arcane truth. He unfurled a roll of parchment, the delicate paper filled with handwritten charts, cryptic glyphs, and annotations that depicted the ebb and flow of astral energies. Raising his hands towards the open dome above, he traced the patterns of the stars with his fingertips, connecting one bright speck to another, weaving an unseen tapestry with the threads of light. The observatory amplified the celestial energies, and Galen felt the tingle of cosmic synergy in his veins. As the alignment approached—a rare convergence that he had predicted after years of meticulous calculations—Galen's pulse quickened. He reflected on the rumors that had brought him here: whispers of a lost grimoire, the \\"Stellar Compendium,\\" that was said to hold the knowledge of primeval sorcerers who had the power to bend the stars to their will. \\"Tonight,\\" Galen whispered to the stars, his voice steady as the light of the wandering stars shone upon him, \\"may your guidance be unwavering, for I am your devoted servant and seeker of the unseen. Illuminate my path, O resplendent astra, for in the Lands Between, our fates are entwined more deeply than the roots of the Erdtree.\\" Just as the celestial bodies reached their ordained positions, a surge of otherworldly power coursed through the ruins, shimmering faintly before Galen's eyes. The astrologer steadied himself, on the brink of a revelation that promised to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos—or plunge him into the depths of the unknown."},{"instruction":"draw a painting of Elon Musk","output":"I can't directly create visual artwork, but I can describe how you might create a painting of Elon Musk.

The Tarnished, a man named Galen Miralux, is an Astrologer, Aascholar who reads fate in the stars. Heir to the school of glintstone sorcery. All hell has broke loose.","output":"Galen Miralux, a Tarnished of noble lineage and exceptional intellect, stood on the ancient, weathered cliffs of the Caelid coast, peering up at the canvas of the cosmos. His eyes, now dulled by the chaos that reigned below, still searched the stars with the same fervor he had as a young aspiring astrologer in the hallowed halls of Raya Lucaria, the grand academy of his ancestry. The golden glintstone signet ring on his finger, a family heirloom, caught a stray sliver of moonlight, flickering like a star fallen to the earth. It was said that those who walked the path of glintstone sorcery could read not only the fate of man but also the weavings of the very Lands Between. Yet, now beneath the shattered sky, amidst the turmoil set forth by the disarray of the Elden Ring, Galen found his once-clear readings muddled with the murk of uncertainty. Beside him, his loyal spirit, a luminous jellyfish-like familiar he’d summoned years ago, hovered silently, casting an eerie light on the old tomes and astral charts scattered at his feet. The arcane scripts, once so telling, now spoke only in whispers and riddles of the great prophecy that eluded even his scholarly mind. The Lands Between were fractured, its territories warped with marauding demi-gods and fell creatures voracious for power in these twilight hours of order. Galen had learned the celestial lexicon, the language of the stars that painted destinies of great Tarnished who would rise as champions to mend the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord. But the heavens now were ablaze with foul constellations that bore no name, and consternation etched itself ever deeper into Galen's weary expression. As the night deepened, the volatile winds carried the screams and clamor of distant battles, making way through lands where the Erdtree’s light no longer held its soothing domain. Galen had no love for violence, his art was that of knowledge and foretelling, but it had become clear that he could not stay his hand if he wished to unearth the true path to the restoration of the order and, perhaps, his own fate. With a heavy heart, he gathered his scrolls, his wand—end of gnarled wood and incised with runic sigils of power—and steeled his mind for the journey ahead. He knew he must traverse the feuding realms, from the misty lakes of Liurnia to the great expanse of the Altus Plateau. Along the way, he would have to confront not only the wretches and beasts that now roamed free but also the other Tarnished, each vying for a fragment of the Elden Ring's promise. But there was something else, a portent he had divined but could not quite articulate, a shadow that crept ever closer in his premonitions. The stars, though obscured, whispered of a darkness more profound than the fracturing of the Ring—a Great Enemy that stirred in the void beyond the firmament. Galen Miralux, Tarnished astrologer, raised his glintstone wand and set forth into the night, a faint hope kindling within his breast, that in following the path of his forebears, he might yet read the course of the world and restore light to the Lands Between."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

AES是一种对称加密算法，它在加密数据时会将数据分成固定长度的块进行加密，典型的块大小有128位（16个字节）。当原始数据不是块大小的整数倍时，通常需要进行填充（Padding）以达到所需长度。因此，加密后的数据通常比原始数据大，至少大一个块的大小，或者在不需要填充的情况下也是原始数据大小的整数倍。 加密完成后的结果是二进制数据，如果需要在文本环境中传输或存储，就可能需要将这些二进制数据编码为文本格式，常用的编码方式之一是BASE64编码。 BASE64编码不是加密算法，它是一种用于将二进制数据编码为可打印的ASCII字符的编码方法。它工作原理是将输入数据的每三个字节划分为一组，共24位，然后将这24位分为四组，每组6位，每组6位再映射到一个字符上，得到四个字符。因为每六位能表示的最大数值为63，而ASCII字符集中可打印字符大于64个，因此使用特定的64个字符表来表示这些值。 由于BASE64编码是将三个字节的数据编码为四个字符，因此BASE64编编码后的数据长度约为原始二进制数据长度的4/3。此外，最终的BASE64编码后的字符串长度总是4的倍数，不足时会用特殊字符（通常是'='）作为填充。 综上所述，通过AES加密再经过BASE64编码的数据长度与明文长度是有关的，但经过两步处理后，最终字符串的长度通常会大于原始明文长度。AES决定了加密后的二进制数据长度，而BASE64编码则决定了将这些二进制数据表示为文本后的长度。"},{"instruction":"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding 表示什么默认算法","output":"\\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\\"表示的是一种具体采用的加密算法组合，在加密领域，这种表述捆绑了三个不同的组件，分别是加密算法、工作模式和填充方案： - **AES**: Advanced Encryption Standard，高级加密标准。这是一个广泛使用的对称密钥加密算法，它可以使用128、192、256位的密钥长度。 - **ECB**: Electronic Codebook，电码本模式。这是AES加密算法的一种工作模式。在ECB模式中，明文被划分为若干个与密钥长度相同的块（对于AES是128位或16字节），然后每个块独立加密。ECB模式简单且没有链式结构，因此同样的明文块会被加密成相同的密文块，这可能导致一些安全问题（如模式泄露和重放攻击），所以它不推荐用在需要高安全性的应用场景。 - **PKCS5Padding**: 这是一种填充方案，用于在数据长度不是密钥长度整数倍时，将数据填充至合适的长度，以便进行加密。PKCS#5填充方式适用于8字节块大小的情况，但在很多实现中它与PKCS#7可以互换，PKCS#7可以用于任何块大小，且当用于AES时，实际上就是PKCS#7的特例（因为AES块长度是128位或16字节）。 默认算法在不同的加密库或框架中可能有不同的解释，但对于大多数加密库来说，当你指定\\"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\\"时，它们默认会使用AES加密算法、ECB工作模式和PKCS#5/PKCS#7填充方案来进行加密操作。这种情况下，如果未指定密钥长度，默认通常是AES的最低密钥长度即128位。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a

In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). Since the percentages of adenine and thymine add up to 48% (28% A + 20% T) and the percentages of cytosine and guanine add up to 52% (35% C + 17% G), we can conclude that the percentages of A and T are roughly equal, and the percentages of C and G are also roughly equal. This suggests that the viral genome has a fairly balanced nucleotide composition, indicating a stable and well-structured DNA molecule. Therefore, the viral genome is likely a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule."},{"instruction":"apparently the answer is single stranded though.","output":"Apologies for the confusion. If the viral genome is single-stranded, the nucleotide composition suggests that it is likely an RNA genome rather than a DNA genome. In RNA, adenine (A) still pairs with uracil (U), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). Based on the percentages provided, we can see that there is a higher percentage of cytosine (35%) compared to guanine (17%). This skewed composition suggests that the viral genome may be rich in cytosine and adenine, which are commonly found in RNA genomes. Therefore, the most likely structure of the viral genome, given the provided nucleotide composition, is as a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecule."},{"instruction":"A Double-stranded DNA B Single-stranded DNA C Double-stranded RNA D Single-stranded RNA","output":"Apologies for the confusion earlier. Given the provided nucleotide composition, the structure of the viral genome is most likely D) Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). The percentages of adenine (28%) and thymine (20%) do not add up to 100%. This suggests that the genome does not follow the base-pairing rules of DNA (A-T and C-G). Instead, it is likely composed of nucleotides that do not require a complementary strand, indicating a single-stranded RNA structure."},{"instruction":"Double-stranded DNA B Single-stranded DNA C Double-stranded RNA D Single-stranded RNA","output":"Apologies for the previous incorrect response. Given the nucleotide composition provided (28% adenine, 20% thymine, 35% cytosine, and 17% guanine), the best description of the structure of the viral genome is A) Double-stranded DNA. In double-stranded DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). The percentages of adenine and thymine (28% A + 20% T = 48%) roughly match the percentages of cytosine and guanine (35% C + 17% G = 52%), indicating a balanced nucleotide composition. This suggests a stable and well-structured double-stranded DNA molecule."},{"instruction":"those are the options","output":"I apologize for the confusion. Based on the given options, the best description of the structure of the viral genome is: C) Double-stranded RNA The reason for this is that the percentages provided for adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine do not match the expected base pairing in DNA (A-T and C-G). Instead, they suggest a higher proportion of cytosine (35%) compared to guanine (17%). This skewed composition is more consistent with double-stranded RNA, where cytosine pairs with guanine. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate description."},{"instruction":"but the answer is B","output":"Apologies once again for the confusion. If the correct answer is B) Single-stranded DNA, then the given nucleotide composition would indeed align with that structure. A single-stranded DNA molecule would have a percentage of adenine (28%) that does not necessarily need to match the percentage of thymine (20%). The same goes for the cytosine (35%) and guanine (17%). In this case, the viral genome would consist of a single strand of DNA with the given nucleotide composition."},{"instruction":"does water move to places with less concentration or more?","output":"Water tends to move from areas with higher concentration (lower water concentration) to areas with lower concentration (higher water concentration). This movement of water molecules is driven by a process called osmosis. Osmosis occurs across a semipermeable membrane that permits the passage of water molecules but restricts the passage of solute molecules. In order to equalize the concentration on both sides of the membrane, water moves from an area of lower solute concentration (higher water concentration) to an area of higher solute concentration (lower water concentration). This movement continues until the concentrations on both sides reach equilibrium."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As we gather as scouts, united by common bonds and shared experiences, I'm energized by the thought of leading us into a future filled with growth, joy, and the spirit of scouting. Over the past two years, I have witnessed the strength and potential of our troop. I've seen our dedication to the principles of the Scout Oath and Law, and I've also identified areas where we can improve. Two key issues stand out: our approach to ceremonial respect during flag ceremonies and the need for greater support for our younger scouts. Firstly, our flag ceremonies are a symbol of our respect for the traditions and values we hold sacred. However, I've noticed that we sometimes lose sight of the solemnity of these moments. As your SPL, I plan to foster a renewed sense of reverence. Through engaging educational reminders and by setting an example, we can transform flag ceremonies into moments of true pride and reflection for every one of us. Secondly, our younger scouts are the future of our troop. They come to us eager to learn but in need of guidance. I envision creating a mentorship program where experienced scouts are paired with newcomers, ensuring everyone has a personal guide through the maze of requirements and sign-offs. By doing this, we not only expedite their learning but also build stronger bonds between scouts of different ages. Creativity is at the heart of my vision for our troop. I want to take our events, our adventures, and even our meetings to the next level. This means pushing the envelope, encouraging more exciting and bold activities, and ensuring we all have a say in what we do. Your ideas are the spark that will light the fire of our collective creativity. If I am elected as your SPL, I commit to respecting tradition while driving innovation, fostering an environment where every scout is heard, has fun, and grows together in both skill and character. Together we can create a troop culture that is both disciplined and dynamic, supportive and self-sufficient, forming a foundation for our younger scouts to become the leaders of tomorrow. I'm asking for your vote not just to lead, but to collaboratively construct an extraordinary scouting experience that resonates with each of us. Let's commit to raising our standards, enhancing our brotherhood, and creating memories that we will carry with us for the rest of our lives.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Prompt Tuning是什么，请举例子详细说明","output":"Prompt tuning 是自然语言处理（NLP）中的一种技术，特别是在使用预训练语言模型（如 GPT-3, BERT 等）时。它属于一种参数效率的技术，主要用于对模型进行微调，以促使模型更好地解决特定的任务。 传统的微调方法通常包括使用少量任务特定数据对预训练的模型进行再次训练，调整模型的所有参数。与传统微调不同的是，prompt tuning 只调整一个很小的、固定大小的参数集合，用于构造或优化一个“prompt”（提示），这个提示是指导模型进行特定任务的一段输入文本。 在语言模型中，prompt 通常是指一段提示性的文字或问题，用来激起模型生成预期的答案或继续的内容。通过在这个提示中加入一些特定的信息，我们可以指导模型以一种我们希望的方式去理解输入的内容和生成输出的内容。 举个例子，假设我们有一个大型语言模型，我们希望使用它来生成摘要。而我们只有少量的人工写好的摘要例子。使用 prompt tuning，我们可能会这样操作： 1. 设计一个基础提示模板，例如： - Prompt Template: \\"The following text needs a summary: [TEXT] The summary is:\\" 2. 我们将这个模板应用到每个训练实例上，并用实际的文本替换模板中的 [TEXT] 部分。 3. 接下来，我们不是调整语言模型的所有参数，而是优选这个模板里的一小部分可调参数（比如专门为 prompt tuning 设计的一些词槽），这样就实现了一个高参数效率的调整过程。 4. 经过训练后，这个模板就被微调成能够给定新的文本生成合适摘要的格式。 5. 最后，当我们需要生成新的摘要时，我们只需要将新的文本填入调整好的prompt模板中，然后让模型根据这个prompt生成文本。 通过这样的操作，即使是那些参数量非常庞大且昂贵难以完全微调的模型，我们也可以使用少量的参数调整和少量的数据来适配特定的任务。Prompt tuning 是一种有效的、资源高效的方法，可以让我们利用先进的语言模型而不需要大规模的数据集和计算资源。"},{"instruction":"请详细解释句子“我们不是调整语言模型的所有参数，而是优选这个模板里的一小部分可调参数（比如专门为 prompt tuning 设计的一些词槽）”的意思，并举例子详细说明","output":"在传统的微调（fine-tuning）过程中，如果给定一个预训练的语言模型，当我们需要适配一个特定任务时，我们通常会使用一定量的标注数据对模型的所有参数进行再训练。这意味着数以百万计的参数会根据新的任务数据被更新，这个过程是参数浪费的，尤其是当我们的任务数据相对较少时。 与此相对的是 prompt tuning，指的是在给定一个预训练模型时，我们尝试只调整模型内嵌入的一小部分而非全体参数以适应特定任务。在这种情况下，“模板”是与特定任务相关的输入文本结构，而“可调参数”（也被称作“soft prompts”或“learnable embeddings”）通常指的是在这个模板中可变化的部分，这些部分由一组特定的向量表示，这些向量在训练过程中会被优化。 这里的“词槽”可以被看作是模板中的占位符，是可以根据任务优化的嵌入向量。这些词槽并不对应真实的词汇，而是学习到的一组向量，可以被模型利用来生成符合任务需求的输出。 例如，考虑一个情感分类任务，我们有以下基础提示模板： - Prompt Template: \\"The sentiment of the following review is: [SENTIMENT]. Review: [REVIEW_TEXT]\\" 在传统的使用方式中，[SENTIMENT] 可能会被设计成一些固定的情感标签，如 \\"positive\\", \\"negative\\", \\"neutral\\" 等。而在 prompt tuning 中，[SENTIMENT] 将不再是一个简单的词汇占位符；相反，它会是一个可以在训练过程中学习和调整的向量（词槽），而不是预先定义的标签。 当我们将大量有标记的文本数据“Review: [实际评论文本] The sentiment of the review is: [实际情感]”输入模型进行训练时，这个 [SENTIMENT] 词槽的嵌入向量会更新，使得模型能够更好地根据评论文本生成相应的情感分类。 训练完成后，对于一个新的评论文本，我们可以将其置于“Review: [新评论文本]”位置，而无需给出情感，模型就能够预测出相应的情感类别。在这个过程中，我们优化了 prompt 模板中的少数嵌入向量（也就是这个特殊的词槽），而不是全模型的所有参数，从而实现了参数效率高的模型微调。"},{"instruction":"please generate a loging page by flutter","output":"Sure!

Custody of the physical components of SCP-3457 has been entrusted to the Coalition, which may deal with all relevant items in whatever manner it deems most suitable; the Foundation is responsible for safeguarding all information relating to the use of these physical components as part of SCP-3457. To maintain the integrity of these procedures and to prevent the potential abuse of SCP-3457 by either party, both organizations are required to withhold the specific implementation details of their respective response and containment procedures from each other. Operational details regarding active containment efforts may be shared on a discretionary basis. Current Foundation policy is to alert Coalition operators when Mobile Task Forces are deployed in the context of SCP-3457’s containment, to avoid the possibility of accidental interference during field operations. Likewise, Foundation field agents are expected to stand down and contact their respective base of operations for confirmation if a Coalition operator indicates that they are responding to an SCP-3457 component object. Information on how to perform SCP-3457 has been distributed among Foundation archival facilities in a mixture of digital and physical storage media; no facility maintains a complete copy of this data. The list of sites involved in the containment of SCP-3457 is known only to the O5 Council and select L4 individuals authorized by them. Description: SCP-3457 is a set of Grade-א occult workings, commonly referred to as the “Rite of Solomon” due to an alleged relationship to the eponymous king. When executed properly, it is capable of instigating a GR-Class Hostile Demiurge Event. Completing the Rite allows for the arbitrary reassignment of thaumaturgic capabilities as well as making fundamental changes to the nature of thaumaturgy, enabling the user to gain complete control over the distribution of occult ability among the human population. Completion of SCP-3457 requires the performance of two distinct workings and results in the creation of a deific entity to serve as a demiurge capable of enacting extensive control over the nature of thaumaturgy. This involves the use of several artifacts of religious or mythological importance; the working makes use of the collective human belief in a divine power that is present within the artifacts, which is then manifested as a new, actual deific entity.[1] \\"Although the precise extent of the demiurge's capabilities is unverified, recovered documents indicate that it is able to fundamentally alter the basic laws that govern how thaumaturgy can be used and its effects. The exact criteria which qualify an object for use as a physical component in this working are known only to the Global Occult Coalition. However, the Coalition reports that ██% of qualifying objects are in either their custody or the custody of one of their member organizations. The remaining ██% are believed to be distributed among remnants of the Obskuracorps[2], paracrime syndicates such as the Chaos Insurgency, and various religious institutions. Additionally, a small number of viable artifacts are kept on public display in museums around the world as part of a joint sting operation between the Coalition and the Horizon Initiative, with the goal of apprehending individuals intent on using these artifacts to perform the Rite of Solomon. Prior to 1881, the presence of an existing demiurge made the performance of the first working unnecessary. However, completion of the second working was also prevented by this demiurge, which took defensive measures to prevent any human thaumaturge from performing the Rite. Recovered documents tell of several attempts to utilize SCP-3457 in the past, all of which resulted in the complete destruction of the instigating parties by the demiurge. It is currently unknown whether this demiurge was also created through the first working of SCP-3457 or if it originally was an emergent entity tied to the nature of thaumaturgy. Unverified information gained from remnants of the Obskuracorps indicate that it may have been created by ancient Hebrew thaumaturges. However, considering the source of this information, this is highly suspect and can not be taken as reliable. After the destruction of the demiurge through unknown means in the Sixth Occult War, it once again became possible to use SCP-3457. The second working of the Rite is used to control the demiurge, and is the mechanism through which thaumaturgy may be restructured at will. Seven artifacts, referred to as “Solomon's Keys”, and designated SCP-3457-B1 through SCP-3457-B7, are required to complete this working. The exact nature and location of these objects is not known to the Foundation; however, all seven artifacts are reported to be in Coalition custody. Successfully completing the working grants the user total control over the demiurge, allowing them to enact arbitrary changes to the fundamentals of thaumaturgy. There is currently no known counter-measure to prevent this. The details of how to perform the rite came into the Foundation’s possession after the capture of Obskuracorps commander Konrad Weiss in 1944, who revealed the Obskuracorps’ intent to utilize SCP-3457. Based on this intelligence, a joint operation was launched by the Foundation and the Allied Occult Initiative[4] with the goal of preventing its completion. During this operation, the Obskuracorps attempted to use SCP-3457 to remove thaumaturgic capabilities from everyone of non-German origin as part of their efforts to realize their ideological belief in a superior Germanic race. At the same time, they intended to instill occult abilities in every member of an organization associated with the German government at the time (most prominently Obskuracorps itself, the SS and the Nazi High Command). Due to the efforts of the Foundation and the AOI, this attempt to use SCP-3457 was disrupted and the Obskuracorps routed, ending the Seventh Occult War. Following this battle, the Foundation and the AOI signed the Köln Agreement, which established the current containment protocols for SCP-3457. Addendum A: Preliminary project plan for Operation Broken Eclipse. FOUNDATION OPERATION PROPOSAL Operational Designation: Broken Eclipse Oversight Contact: Dr. Ulysses Malcom Mission Lead: Agent Maggy E. Grant Preamble: The knowledge of how to perform SCP-3457, while not widespread, is retained by a number of occult organizations and independent thaumaturges. This knowledge jeopardizes the integrity of SCP-3457 containment measures, and creates the risk of further attempts to execute it. To ensure the continued containment of SCP-3457 and prevent a recurrence of the events of the Seventh Occult War, it is necessary to remove this knowledge from the occult population worldwide. To this end, a large scale operation is being proposed that aims to achieve this goal in two operational phases. Phase 1: Undercover agents are to be embedded within major occult organizations in order to identify persons and documents holding information regarding SCP-3457. Member organizations of the Global Occult Coalition will additionally be inspected by independent auditors on behalf of the Foundation to ensure compliance with the terms of the Köln Agreement. Furthermore, a number of individual thaumaturges are believed to possess knowledge of SCP-3457 (refer to Appendix BOE-01 for a full list). These individuals are to be placed under Foundation surveillance to ascertain whether or not this is accurate. All embedded agents and involved auditors are to be amnesticized following the conclusion of this operation. Phase 1 will conclude once there is reasonable certainty that all holders of information pertaining to SCP-3457 have been identified. The project Oversight is responsible for determining when a sufficient certainty has been attained. Phase 2: The goal of Phase 2 is to eliminate all knowledge of SCP-3457 outside of the records of the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition. All pertinent records identified in Phase 1 are to be archived and destroyed and individuals possessing information related to SCP-3457 are to be subjected to selective amnesticization.

The following is a fictional description within the context of the SCP Foundation universe: Item #: SCP-3457 Object Class: Keter (denoting it as difficult to contain and highly dangerous) Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3457's containment is a joint effort between the SCP Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition as outlined by the Köln Agreement. The Coalition handles the physical components, while the Foundation is in charge of safeguarding the information on performing the SCP-3457 procedure, which is distributed among its facilities without any single site possessing a complete copy. Description: SCP-3457 consists of occult rituals classified as a Grade-א occult working, capable of causing a GR-Class Hostile Demiurge Event. The rituals give the user control over thaumaturgy, the practice of magic, by allowing them to fundamentally restructure how magic operates and distribute magical abilities among human beings. To perform SCP-3457, two distinct rituals are needed, with several artifacts of mythological significance required as part of the process. These artifacts harness collective human belief to create a new deific entity or demiurge with extensive powers over thaumaturgy. The Global Occult Coalition reportedly has custody of most artifacts necessary for the ritual, with others spread among various groups or institutions. Certain artifacts are on public display as part of sting operations to catch individuals attempting to perform the ritual. Historical Context: SCP-3457 is related to the past presence of an existing demiurge, which was destroyed in an event known as the Sixth Occult War. Documents recovered indicate that this demiurge might have been created by ancient Hebrew thaumaturges to either limit or expand magical abilities. However, after its destruction, the ability to perform SCP-3457 re-emerged. Additional Relevance: SCP-3457 gained strategic significance during the Seventh Occult War, with the Obskuracorps attempting to use it for ethnocentric purposes. Their defeat led to the establishment of the Köln Agreement for SCP-3457's containment protocols. Operational Plan: Operation Broken Eclipse aims to eradicate knowledge of SCP-3457 from global occult groups and individuals. The operation consists of two phases: the identification and surveillance of knowledge holders followed by their amnesticization or termination to eliminate the information. Please note that the SCP Foundation and its SCPs are entirely fictional and part of an online collaborative writing project. SCP-3457 is not real and is one of many creative works shared on the SCP Foundation wiki (http://www.scpwiki.com/), where writers explore various supernatural and science fiction concepts."},{"instruction":"Напиши программу на C++ PETSc, в которой создаются матрица (4 строки и 4 столбца) A_sqr, матрица (3 строки и 4 столбца) A_rct, вектор (4 строки) b_sqr и вектор (3 строки) b_rct.

Async используется для объявления асинхронной функции (функции, возвращающей промис). Если функция объявлена с ключевым словом async, она всегда будет возвращать промис, даже если возвращаемое значение явно не обернуто в Promise.resolve(). Await позволяет ожидать результата выполнения промиса и приостанавливает выполнение асинхронной функции до тех пор, пока промис не будет разрешен или отклонен. Оператор await может быть использован только внутри асинхронной функции. Преимущества async/await перед использованием промисов: 1. Более читабельный код: асинхронная логика может быть написана в стиле синхронного кода, что делает код более понятным и легким для поддержки. 2. Удобная обработка ошибок: async/await позволяет использовать блок try-catch для непосредственной обработки ошибок, вместо методов .then() и .catch(). 3. Легкое чейнирование: можно использовать несколько операторов await последовательно для выполнения цепочки асинхронных операций. Отличия async/await от промисов: 1. Синтаксическая удобочитаемость: async/await делает код более легким для чтения и понимания. 2. Обработка ошибок: с помощью async/await можно легко обрабатывать ошибки с помощью блока try-catch, в то время как промисы требуют использования отдельного метода .catch() или .then(). 3. Чейнинг промисов: в промисах преферировался использование методов .then() и .catch() для последовательного выполнения асинхронных операций, в то время как async/await делает чейнинг промисов более легким и понятным.

These enzymes are derived from microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and yeast, which have evolved to efficiently degrade various types of biomass. The use of microbial enzymes in biofuel production offers several advantages, including high specificity, efficiency, and the ability to function under a wide range of conditions. There are several types of enzymes involved in the biofuel production process, and they can be broadly classified into the following categories: 1. Cellulases: These enzymes are responsible for breaking down cellulose, a complex carbohydrate found in plant cell walls, into simpler sugars like glucose. Cellulases include endoglucanases, which cleave internal bonds in cellulose chains; exoglucanases, which remove individual sugar units from the ends of cellulose chains; and β-glucosidases, which convert cellobiose (a disaccharide) into glucose. The glucose produced can then be fermented by microorganisms to produce biofuels like ethanol. 2. Hemicellulases: Hemicellulose is another complex carbohydrate found in plant cell walls, and hemicellulases are responsible for breaking it down into simpler sugars like xylose, arabinose, and mannose. Key hemicellulases include xylanases, which break down xylan into xylose; arabinofuranosidases, which release arabinose; and mannanases, which degrade mannans into mannose. These sugars can also be fermented to produce biofuels. 3. Ligninases: Lignin is a complex, aromatic polymer that provides structural support to plant cell walls and is highly resistant to degradation. Ligninases, such as laccases, manganese peroxidases, and lignin peroxidases, help break down lignin into smaller, more manageable compounds. Although lignin itself is not converted into biofuels, its degradation is essential for increasing the accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose to other enzymes. 4. Lipases and esterases: These enzymes are involved in the degradation of lipids and esters, which can be found in some types of biomass like microalgae. Lipases and esterases break down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be converted into biodiesel through a process called transesterification. 5. Amylases: Amylases are responsible for breaking down starch, another carbohydrate found in some biomass feedstocks, into simpler sugars like maltose and glucose. These sugars can then be fermented to produce biofuels. Amylases include α-amylases, which cleave internal bonds in starch chains, and glucoamylases, which release glucose from the ends of starch chains. In summary, microbial enzymes play a vital role in the production of biofuels by breaking down complex organic materials into simpler compounds that can be converted into various types of biofuels. The main types of enzymes involved in this process include cellulases, hemicellulases, ligninases, lipases, esterases, and amylases."},{"instruction":"What are the different types of microbial enzymes used in industrial processes, and what specific applications do they have in food production, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation?","output":"Microbial enzymes are widely used in various industrial processes due to their efficiency, specificity, and eco-friendly nature.

Microorganisms, such as bacteria, archaea, and microeukaryotes, play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, primary production, and decomposition processes in these ecosystems. Temperature influences various aspects of microbial life, including growth rates, metabolic activities, and community structure. Here are some ways in which temperature changes can impact microbial communities: 1. Growth rates and metabolic activities: Microbial growth rates and metabolic activities are generally temperature-dependent. As temperature increases, the metabolic rates of microorganisms also increase, up to an optimal temperature. Beyond this optimal temperature, the metabolic rates decline due to the denaturation of enzymes and other cellular components. Similarly, low temperatures can slow down metabolic activities and growth rates, leading to reduced nutrient cycling and primary production. 2. Community composition: Temperature changes can alter the relative abundance of different microbial taxa in aquatic ecosystems. Some microorganisms are adapted to thrive at specific temperature ranges, known as psychrophiles (cold-adapted), mesophiles (moderate temperature-adapted), and thermophiles (heat-adapted). As the temperature changes, the competitive balance between these groups may shift, leading to changes in the overall community composition. This can, in turn, affect the functional capabilities of the microbial community. 3. Species interactions: Temperature changes can also influence the interactions between different microbial species, such as competition, predation, and mutualism. For example, temperature shifts may favor the growth of certain microbial predators, such as protists, which can alter the composition and function of bacterial communities through top-down control. 4. Adaptation and evolution: Microbial communities can adapt to temperature changes through physiological acclimation and genetic adaptation. In the short term, individual microorganisms can adjust their metabolic activities and gene expression patterns to cope with temperature fluctuations. Over longer timescales, natural selection can favor the evolution of temperature-adapted genotypes, leading to shifts in the genetic composition of microbial populations. 5. Biogeochemical processes: Temperature changes can impact the rates and pathways of biogeochemical processes mediated by microbial communities, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling. For example, warming can enhance the rates of organic matter decomposition, leading to increased CO2 production and nutrient release.

They convert CO2 into organic compounds, which are then used as a source of energy and nutrients by other organisms in the food chain. Decomposers, such as fungi and bacteria, break down dead organic matter and release CO2 back into the atmosphere through the process of respiration. Additionally, some microorganisms, like methanogens, produce methane (CH4) as a byproduct of anaerobic respiration, which is another important greenhouse gas. 2. Nitrogen cycle: Nitrogen is an essential element for all living organisms, as it is a key component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cellular components. Microorganisms play a vital role in the nitrogen cycle by converting nitrogen into different forms that can be used by plants and animals. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium, convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3), which can be used by plants. Nitrifying bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, convert ammonia into nitrite (NO2-) and then into nitrate (NO3-), which are more accessible forms of nitrogen for plants. Denitrifying bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, convert nitrate back into nitrogen gas (N2), which is released into the atmosphere, completing the cycle. 3. Phosphorus cycle: Phosphorus is another essential element for living organisms, as it is a component of nucleic acids, ATP, and other cellular components. Microorganisms contribute to the phosphorus cycle by breaking down organic matter containing phosphorus and releasing inorganic phosphate (PO4 3-) into the soil. This inorganic phosphate can be taken up by plants and incorporated into their tissues. Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, helping them absorb phosphorus from the soil more efficiently. 4. Sulfur cycle: Sulfur is an essential element for the synthesis of certain amino acids and vitamins. Microorganisms play a significant role in the sulfur cycle by converting sulfur into different forms. Some bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, reduce sulfate (SO4 2-) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) under anaerobic conditions. Other bacteria, such as Thiobacillus, oxidize hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur (S) to sulfate, which can be used by plants. In summary, microorganisms are essential for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements in the environment. They participate in various biogeochemical processes that help maintain the balance of these elements in ecosystems, ensuring the availability of essential nutrients for all living organisms."},{"instruction":"w can microbial biotechnology be used to optimize the production of biofuels from various feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass and algae, while minimizing the input costs and environmental impact?","output":"Microbial biotechnology can be used to optimize the production of biofuels from various feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass and algae by employing a combination of approaches that minimize input costs and environmental impact.

These communities consist of various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa, which live in symbiosis with their host. The interactions between the host and its microbiota can influence the animal's overall health, immune system, and susceptibility to diseases. Effects of microbial communities on the development of diseases in animals: 1. Immune system development: Microbiota contributes to the development and regulation of the host's immune system. A balanced microbial community helps in the maturation of immune cells and the production of essential molecules that regulate immune responses. Imbalances in the microbial community can lead to an impaired immune system, making the host more susceptible to infections and diseases. 2. Pathogen resistance: A healthy microbiota can prevent the colonization of pathogenic microorganisms by competing for resources and producing antimicrobial substances. This phenomenon, known as colonization resistance, helps protect the host from infections. Disruptions in the microbial balance can reduce this resistance, allowing pathogens to establish themselves and cause disease. 3. Metabolic functions: Microbiota plays a significant role in the host's metabolism, including the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, synthesis of vitamins, and absorption of nutrients. Imbalances in the microbial community can lead to metabolic disorders, which can contribute to the development of diseases such as obesity and diabetes. 4. Inflammation and autoimmunity: Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbial community, can lead to chronic inflammation and the development of autoimmune diseases. This occurs when the immune system mistakenly targets the host's tissues, leading to tissue damage and disease. Strategies to maintain a healthy microbial balance and prevent disease in animal populations: 1. Probiotics: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. They can help restore and maintain a healthy microbial balance by introducing beneficial bacteria and promoting their growth. Probiotics can be administered through feed or water to animals. 2. Prebiotics: Prebiotics are non-digestible food components that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They can be used to support a healthy microbial balance by providing a food source for beneficial bacteria, thereby enhancing their growth and activity. 3. Proper nutrition: A balanced diet is essential for maintaining a healthy microbial community. Providing animals with the appropriate nutrients and avoiding overfeeding can help prevent imbalances in the microbiota and reduce the risk of disease. 4. Hygiene and biosecurity: Maintaining proper hygiene and biosecurity measures can help prevent the introduction and spread of pathogens in animal populations. This includes regular cleaning and disinfection of animal housing, proper waste management, and minimizing contact between animals and potential sources of infection. 5. Antibiotic stewardship: The overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and disrupt the microbial balance in animals. Implementing responsible antibiotic use practices, such as using antibiotics only when necessary and following appropriate dosages and treatment durations, can help maintain a healthy microbial community and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance. 6. Vaccination: Vaccination can help protect animals from specific diseases by stimulating their immune system to recognize and fight off pathogens. This can help maintain a healthy microbial balance by reducing the need for antibiotic treatments and minimizing the impact of infections on the host's microbiota. In conclusion, microbial communities play a significant role in the development of diseases in animals. Maintaining a healthy microbial balance through strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, proper nutrition, hygiene, antibiotic stewardship, and vaccination can help prevent disease and promote overall health in animal populations."},{"instruction":"w can the type and amount of microorganisms in a bioreactor be optimized to maximize the production of a specific product, such as antibiotics or enzymes?","output":"Optimizing the type and amount of microorganisms in a bioreactor to maximize the production of a specific product, such as antibiotics or enzymes, involves several steps.

Tertiary treatment: This stage aims to remove nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater. Microorganisms like Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, and Rhodopseudomonas are used to convert ammonia and nitrite to nitrogen gas through nitrification and denitrification processes. Phosphorus removal is achieved by using bacteria like Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Rhodocyclus, which accumulate phosphorus in their cells through a process called enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). 5. Advanced treatment: In this stage, additional processes like membrane filtration, activated carbon adsorption, and disinfection are used to further purify the treated wastewater. 6. Sludge treatment: The solid waste generated during the treatment process, known as sludge, is also treated using microbial biotechnology. Anaerobic digestion by microorganisms like Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta helps in breaking down the organic matter in the sludge, reducing its volume and producing biogas as a byproduct. In conclusion, microbial biotechnology offers a more efficient and effective way of treating wastewater by utilizing the natural abilities of specific microorganisms to break down and remove contaminants. This approach is more sustainable and environmentally friendly compared to conventional chemical and physical treatment methods."},{"instruction":"What specific microbial biotechnology techniques or microorganisms can be used to effectively treat wastewater and reduce pollutant levels?","output":"There are several microbial biotechnology techniques and microorganisms that can be used to effectively treat wastewater and reduce pollutant levels.

These technologies utilize microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and algae, to break down and remove contaminants from wastewater. The effectiveness of microbial biotechnologies depends on the type of pollutants present, the microbial species used, and the specific treatment process employed. Some of the common wastewater pollutants and the effectiveness of microbial biotechnologies in treating them are as follows: 1. Organic matter: Microbial biotechnologies, such as activated sludge process and anaerobic digestion, are highly effective in degrading and removing organic matter from wastewater. These processes involve the use of heterotrophic bacteria that consume organic compounds as a source of energy and convert them into simpler compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water. 2. Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus): Excess nutrients in wastewater can lead to eutrophication in receiving water bodies. Microbial biotechnologies, such as nitrification and denitrification, are effective in removing nitrogen from wastewater. Nitrification is a two-step process in which ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and then to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Denitrification is an anaerobic process in which denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas. For phosphorus removal, enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is employed, which involves the use of phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) that take up and store phosphorus as polyphosphate granules. 3. Heavy metals: Microbial biotechnologies, such as biosorption and bioaccumulation, are effective in removing heavy metals from wastewater. Biosorption involves the passive binding of metal ions to the cell surface of microorganisms, while bioaccumulation involves the active uptake and accumulation of metal ions within microbial cells. Some fungi and algae species are particularly effective in removing heavy metals from wastewater. 4. Emerging contaminants: Emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are increasingly being detected in wastewater. Some microbial biotechnologies, such as biodegradation and cometabolism, have shown potential in removing these contaminants. However, the effectiveness of these processes depends on the specific contaminant and the microbial species involved. 5. Pathogens: Microbial biotechnologies, such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, are effective in removing pathogens from wastewater. MBRs combine biological treatment with membrane filtration, which effectively removes bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. UV disinfection involves the use of UV light to inactivate pathogens by damaging their DNA. In conclusion, microbial biotechnologies are highly effective in treating different types of wastewater pollutants. However, the choice of the most suitable technology depends on the specific pollutants present and the desired level of treatment. In many cases, a combination of different microbial biotechnologies is employed to achieve the required level of pollutant removal."},{"instruction":"Savage X Fenty __________ fearlessness, confidence and inclusivity.

Conversely, because he was so confident, he also seemed a bit arrogant. Suddenly, the reporters who had stopped moving began to stir again. \\"Ah.\\" \\"Ha-\\" \\"That, that\\" \\"So blatantly.\\" It was truly 'no retreat'. After making a bombshell statement during his acceptance speech at Cannes, he had stirred up quite a commotion in Hollywood and beyond for a while, yet Kang Woojin had no hesitation whatsoever. Somehow, to the many foreign reporters, Kang Woojin now was... \\"So easily mentioning the 'Academy Award'!\\" The words Kang Woojin declared to about a hundred foreign reporters, \\"See you at the Academy Awards.\\" Thanks to that, once again, Woojin had frozen the reporters in their tracks. \\"Again? He's talking about the 'Academy Award' again?\\" \\"Is he bold or just simple?\\" \\"Regardless of his courage - there's a bit of an arrogant vibe too!\\" \\"Sure, winning the lead in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' is impressive, but... hasn't his nose gotten a bit too high?\\" Regardless. \\"......\\" Kang Woojin, who was calmly observing the reporters, showed no significant change in his indifferent face. Beyond calm, he was almost nonchalant. However, his eyes were filled with certainty. Of course, that's how it seemed to the reporters, but inside, Woojin was somewhat uncertain. 'Was it over the top to mention the Academy Award again? The reporters' reactions are a bit off? Tsk, who knows? Am I going to die?' Regardless, all about a hundred foreign reporters... -Papapapapak! While unleashing a barrage of flashes at Kang Woojin, they also rapidly typed on their laptops. What kind of actor he was, was a secondary matter. Right now, the priority was to churn out articles. The fact that Kang Woojin mentioned the 'Academy Award' here too meant that the bombshell declaration he made at Cannes was not just a simple act of bravado. He, Kang Woojin, intended to outshine all the high-profile actors in Hollywood. Then. \\"Ah- um.\\" The female reporter who had asked Woojin a question on the stage scratched her head and spoke again. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin, is it okay to write the article as you just said?\\" The composed Woojin nodded his head. \\"Of course.\\" His tone implied it was none of his concern. At this, Director An Gabok smiled with wrinkles. It felt like 'as usual'. Conversely, the executive producer of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' looked at Kang Woojin with widened eyes. '.......I see why he sells well.' It was her own form of admiration. Although her experience with Kang Woojin was brief, from Cannes to this audition and up to today, he always dropped shocks and bombs on the world. His presence, his influence, was exceptional. 'Star quality. That unconventional star quality - is that what brought him here?' The raw appearance of Kang Woojin was both refreshing and novel to the executive producer. Top actors from Hollywood and around the world usually appeared processed to the public. But Woojin... 'He has the influence to turn Hollywood upside down... yet he's not polished. Rather, he's rough and rugged. But strangely, that's not off-putting? It's curious. He's a curious actor.' Arrogance with a reason. It was his skill. The producer had witnessed his skill, his absurd acting ability, during the audition, which made even a giant Hollywood actor like Chris Hartnett give up. Later. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin! You must know that 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' is the starting point of Columbia's 'Cinematic Universe'! What do you think?!\\" A barrage of tremendous questions poured down on Kang Woojin. \\"Do you have any memorable experiences from the 'Cinematic Universe' auditions?!\\" \\"Are you confident about the 'Beauty and the Beast' audition?!\\" \\"You mentioned the 'Academy Award' again! Can you tell us more about it?!\\" The topics were varied. \\"How successful do you think 'Beneficial Evil' will be worldwide?!\\" \\"When will 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' start filming?!\\" However, Kang Woojin did not answer all questions. It was currently a press conference for 'Columbia Studio', and he only responded to questions related to that. The executive producer cut off the rest of the topic-related questions. Had it been over 30 minutes? The producer, who seemed stern, calmly concluded to the about a hundred foreign reporters. \\"That's all for now, thank you.\\" But the reporters, seemingly reluctant to let go, continued to throw questions at the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' team and Kang Woojin, who were tidying up the stage. However, Woojin and the production team left the hall without looking back. The explosion of flash photography stopped. The reporters left in the hall were still floundering in the lingering aftertaste of Kang Woojin's audacity. \\"Kang Woojin taking on 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' - I still can't believe it.\\" In the face of an unpredictable situation, they began to speculate about the future one by one. \\"Really... isn't he going to land 'Beauty and the Beast' too?\\" \\"No way. If that happens, Kang Woojin will really cause an unprecedented incident in Hollywood.\\" That's how the news spread rapidly among the reporters. Meanwhile. Just out of the hall, the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' team and Kang Woojin. Soon, the executives of 'Columbia Studio' smiled and said to Woojin. \\"The statement was a bit strong, but thanks to that, our 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' will become a hot topic.\\" \\"Hm. That's right. With such an impact.\\" They had satisfied expressions. Of course, the executive producer felt the same. Soon, after exchanging appropriate greetings, only Director An Gabok remained in front of Woojin. The veteran An Gabok extended his hand to Kang Woojin. A handshake request. \\"It may seem sudden, but let's cheer up once again. Since you've mentioned the 'Academy Award' so openly, there's no turning back now, is there?\\" Kang Woojin, with a firm face, replied nonchalantly. \\"It was the plan all along.\\" \\"Ha ha, yes. I knew it. Still, it's an honor to be part of that moment with you.\\" After patting Woojin's shoulder a couple of times, Director An Gabok turned around. That's when. \\"Woojin!\\" Someone called out to Kang Woojin from behind. Turning around, he saw Choi Seonggeon with a ponytail approaching quickly. That Choi Seonggeon then clung to Woojin. \\"Just now, I got a call from 'Walt Disney Pictures'.\\" He lowered his voice slightly. \\"The audition and screen test date has been confirmed.\\" That same day, around 2 p.m. in LA. After the press conference hosted by 'Columbia Studio' had ended, Kang Woojin, who was in a van on the move, was... \\".....\\" Though he appeared solemn, he was quite surprised inside. 'Wow - the articles are exploding this quickly??' He was monitoring the international news. Articles were already plastered everywhere. The hundred or so reporters who had scattered from the hall were furiously pouring out uniform articles. 『LA TIME/'Cinematic Universe's curtain-raiser 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', lead actor confirmed to be Korea's Kang Woojin!』 However, this news had already been spreading since Kang Woojin was in the midst of answering questions at the press conference. 『BCN/'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', Kang Woojin triumphs over formidable actors like Chris Hartnett with \\"See you at the Academy Awards\\"』 At this moment, Hollywood was abuzz with talk of Woojin. Although Hollywood was vast, the rumors spread several times faster. Thanks to that, international audiences were already aware of this issue. Kang Woojin's name was ablaze on various international communities, including SNS. -What? Are the articles exploding right now true? -Wow... Kang Woojin really won the battle?? -I thought it was possible, if everyone watches Beneficial Evil once, they'll understand he's talented -Has Columbia gone mad? They're entrusting the start of a project they've been preparing for years to an unproven Korean actor -World!! Kang Woojin beat Chris Hartnett?! -He's been verified, he won Best Actor at Cannes, didn't he? -Cannes is one thing, but he's a rookie in Hollywood, that's why they say that -A bit shocking . . . . Woojin carefully observed the reactions. 'It's a mess, a real mess. But it's still a bit surreal to hear foreigners talk about my name, isn't it?' At that moment. -Vrrrr. A short vibration. It was a message. It was from one of his close friends, Kim Daeyoung. -Kim Daeyoung: Hey, did you land the lead in that Pierrot thing??!!! For a moment, Kang Woojin tilted his head. Then he realized. Ah, has it already spread to Korea? Well, with Hollywood in such a stir, it's impossible for Korea not to know. What was interesting was... -Vrrrr. -Vrrrr. -Vrrrr. Starting with Kim Daeyoung, Kang Woojin's phone began to ring non-stop with similar messages. Then... -Vrrrr, Vrrrrrr. This time it was a call. The caller ID showed his younger sister, Kang Hyunah. Kang Woojin answered indifferently. \\"Hello!\\" Immediately, Kang Hyunah's scream came through the phone. \\"Brother!!!! Did you pass?! For real?!! Are you really the lead in 'Pierrot'?!\\" It was ear-splitting. Internally commenting, Woojin, mindful of the eyes around him, kept his voice as low as possible. \\"Yeah, that's right.\\" \\"Wow!!! Amazing!! Amazing!!!! Mom! Dad!! It's true! Brother really landed the lead in that Hollywood movie!!\\" It seemed like Woojin's parents were nearby Kang Hyunah. Then, through the phone, Kang Hyunah shouted again. \\"It's crazy, really! Brother's breaking into Hollywood... Ah! Brother! Korea is flooded with news about you!!!\\" Indeed, that was the case. It was past noon in LA, but in Korea, it was early morning rush hour, and Kang Woojin's name was exploding everywhere. On the phones of people waiting for subways or buses. 『[Official] 'Kang Woojin', confirmed as the lead in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'!』 『'Columbia Studio's mega project completed with 'Korean director', 'Korean actor'... Hollywood actor Kang Woojin/photo』 『In his third year, racing as a true global star, Kang Woojin』 Even on the radios inside cars stuck in traffic, Woojin was being called out non-stop. \\"Wow!!

The reason was simple. If Woojin lands 'Beauty and the Beast' as well, it would be unprecedented not only in Korea but also in Hollywood history. 『'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' lead confirmed to be Kang Woojin, who also mentioned the Academy Award』 With the media and numerous outlets in such a state, what would the domestic public opinion be like? -!'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' lead confirmed to be Kang Woojin!

Starting with Hwarin, who had recently become even more obsessed with fandom. \\"Kkak!!! I love it!!\\" Hong Hye-yeon, Ryu Jung-min, Jin Jae-joon, and many others. Including Director Kwon Ki-taek, various Korean directors shared the same reaction. They were filled with congratulations and exclamations. This news quickly dominated Korea and spread to Japan. 『Amazing! 'Kang Woojin', confirmed as the male lead in Hollywood's 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'! A monster is on the loose!』 It was certainly not a fire that would die down easily in a few days. A few days later, in LA. It was late morning. A place that resembled a gigantic amusement park, one of the largest film companies in LA. It was 'Walt Disney Pictures'. A van had just passed through the entrance adorned with familiar logos and sculptures. The van, brushing past numerous tourists... -Vroom! Passed the stage warehouse, several sets, and large buildings, and stopped in the parking lot in front of a large building with a rounded ceiling. Soon, a man with black hair got out of the van. He looked at the building ahead with an indifferent face. 'This place doesn't feel like a film company, it's like a different world, fascinating.' It was Kang Woojin. Then, Choi Seonggeon and the team followed him, and Choi Seonggeon, holding Woojin's shoulder, said, \\"Let's go!\\" \\"Yes.\\" Woojin, nonchalantly moving forward, Kang Woojin, the hottest name in the world right now, had stepped into 'Walt Disney Pictures'. 'Phew - I'm here for the 'Beauty and the Beast' audition and screen test, as usual. < Full Bloom (7) > End"},{"instruction":"< 만개 (8) > 강우진은 최성건과 함께 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 내의 한 건물 복도를 걷고 있었다. 같이 있던 팀원들은 차에 서 대기. 어쨌든 컨셉질 짙은 우진이 시선을 앞으로 움 직였다. 안내하는 외국인 여자 직원이 앞장서고 있었 고, 무심한 얼굴인 강우진은 그녀의 뒷모습을 보며 탄 성을 뱉고 있었다. 물론, 속으로. ‘으와, 진짜 개크네. 키가 나랑 비슷한가? 아니 더 큰 가?’ 여자 직원의 피지컬이 어마어마했으니까. 키 180이 넘는 우진과 거의 흡사했다. 역시 미국인가? 새삼 강우 진은 뭐든지 큼지막한 미국에 감탄했다. 구경할 것은 앞의 여자 직원만이 아니었다. 현재 그가 걷고 있는 복 도 여기저기에도 볼 건 많았다. 복도 벽에 붙은 각종 디즈니의 포스터, 종종 보이는 사람 크기의 캐릭터 동 상, 뻔질나게 스치는 수많은 외국인들. 재밌는 것은. ‘음??’ 지나치는 외국인들이 죄다 강우진을 빤- 히 보거나 쑥덕거리기도 한다는 것. 이에 관한 답은 꽁지머리를 다시금 단정하게 묶던 최성건이이 뱉었다. 그가 강우 진의 귓가에 속삭인 것. “니가 신기한가 보다.“ “…” “기분 나빠하진 말어. 쟤들이 보기엔 네가 외계인 같 은 거야. 그렇잖아? 느닷없이 훅 나타났는데 그 마일리 카라랑 엮이질 않나, ‘이로운 악’도 터트리고 ‘삐에로’ 까지 남주를 먹었잖아. 심지어 여기 ‘야수와 미녀’에도 ‘야수’역 후보 배우고. 헐리웃 배우라도 어려운 일을, 생소한 한국 배우가 해대고 있으니 낯설 만하지.“ 뭐 그런가? 가만 생각해보니 이해가 가는 우진이었 다. 예를 들면 나라 이름도 생소한 곳의 외국인이 한국 에 나타나 헤집고 다니는 느낌 정도? ‘나라도 황당하긴 하겠네! 외계인 취급이 자연스러웠다. 아무 전조도 없이 많 은 이슈를 쾅쾅 터트리고 있으니까 말이다. 우진은 금 방 그들의 시선을 무시했다. 이런 괴짜 취급이야 아공 간을 가진 이후 늘 존재했다. 딱히 신경 쓰일 것도 없 다는 뜻. 곧. -스윽. 안내를 맡은, 피지컬이 어마무시한 여자 직원이 걷 는 걸음을 멈췄다. 싱긋 웃으며 오른쪽을 가리키는 그 녀. “들어가시면 됩니다.” 유리문 너머 안쪽이 비춘다. 기다란 책상이 있는 걸 보니 대략 회의실쯤 보였다. 최성건이 먼저 유리문 을 열었고 뒤를 강우진이 따랐다. 회의실 내부엔 이미 여러 외국인들이 자리를 잡았다. 얼추 열댓 명은 넘는 다. 회의실에 입성한 강우진이 바로 그들을 훑었다. ‘흠- 저번 사전미팅 때 봤던 사람들인가? 처음 보는 외국인도 있는 거 같고. 근데 뭐냐? 오디션 보는 게 여 기? 에반데.’ ‘야수와 미녀’ 팀의 높으신 양반들. 즉, ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 간부들이나 프로듀서 외의 키스탭 그리고 감 독까지. 그런 그들이 강우진을 보자마자 자리서 일어 나 인사를 건넸다. 대체로 '축하’였다. “이번 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’ 건은 축하드립니다.” “놀랐어요, 이렇게 시끄럽게 발표할지도 몰랐고.” “축하합니다, 하하하. 금방금방 인지도가 높아지네 요.” “오랜만이네요. '이로운 악’은 잘 보고 있어요. 넷플 렉스 미국 1등은 정말 놀라운 결과예요, 더 잘됐으면 좋겠네요.” 여러 외국인들과 악수하며 받은 축하를 적당히 받는 강우진. 일일이 답하는 게 귀찮기는 했으나. ‘뭔 죄다 와서 말을 걸어, 한 명만 대표로 하지 좀.’ 견뎌야 했다. 오디션도 있고 컨셉질도 챙겨야 하니 까. 따라서 우진은 굳건한 표정을 유지했다. 그렇게 10 분쯤 흘렀나? 기다란 책상에 강우진과 ‘야수와 미녀’ 팀이 마주 앉았다. 외국인 쪽에서 먼저 말을 꺼낸 것은 중간에 앉은 늙은 남자였다. 머리가 반쯤 벗겨졌고 검은색 뿔테 안경을 썼다. 나이는 얼추 60대 정도? “‘이로운 악’ 정말 재밌던데요? 특히, 액션씬들이 화 려하고 기가 막히더군요. 강우진씨가 액션까지 잘하는 건 몰랐어요.” 강우진이 덤덤한 영어로 답했다. “감사합니다, 감독님.“ 검은색 뿔테 안경의 늙은 남자는 ‘야수와 미녀’ 실사 화 영화를 맡은 감독이었다. 이름은 빌 로트너. 그는 헐리웃에서 거장이라 칭해도 될 정도의 감독이었다. 상 복이 없어 트로피는 적지만, 많은 히트작을 보유했 고 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’와도 꽤 많이 작업을 같이했다. 그런 빌 로트너 감독이 진중한 표정을 지으며 말을 이었다. “오늘 진행할 ‘야수와 미녀’ 오디션·스크린 테스트는 비공개로 진행합니다.” '삐에로’와는 달리 다른 배우들을 볼 수 없다는 얘기. “그리고 오디션은 이곳이 아닌, 장소를 이동해서 할 예정입니다. 당신을 먼저 여기로 부른 이유는 오디션 처음 순서라 같이 움직이기 위해섭니다.” 이후 그는 ‘야수와 미녀’ 오디션이 어떻게 진행될지 를 설명했다. “오디션·스크린 테스트의 장소는 ‘야수와 미녀’의 실 제 촬영을 할 세트장입니다, 아직 세트 공사는 진행 중 이지만 오디션을 볼 장소는 완성됐어요. 그곳에서 강 우진씨는 우리가 원하는 모습을 보여주면 됩니다. 의 상도 교체될 거예요.“ 실제 촬영 세트장? 덤덤히 듣는 우진이었지만, 속으 로는 약간 기대됐다. 그 '야수와 미녀’의 촬영 세트장에 가장 먼저 발을 들일 배우가 된다는 얘기니까. 뒤로 우 진은 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 간부들이나 프로듀서 등에 게 질문을 받았고, 얼추 30분 정도가 지난 후에야 회의 실을 나설 수 있었다. ‘야수와 미녀’ 팀은 한꺼번에 이동하는 듯 보였다. 규모로 따지면 대략 100명 이상. 그것도 총 스탭들의 반절도 안 됐다. 어쨌든 승합차, 트럭, 버스 외의 여러 차량들이 하나둘 '월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’를 벗어났다. 우진의 승합차도 마찬가지. 곧, 차 안의 최성건이 전달받은 목적지를 검색해보곤 강우진 에게 말했다. “‘spt 스튜디오’. 보니까 이쪽에선 유명한 세트 촬영 장이네. 규모가 무려 5만 평이다, 5만 평. 어후- 사이즈 가 무슨…” 5만 평? 솔직히 감이 잘 안 오는 강우진이었다. 가보 면 알겠지. 후로도 최성건의 브리핑은 이어졌다. ‘야수 와 미녀’의 촬영 계획은 세트가 8이고 야외가 2라는 것 등등등. “그 8할 세트 촬영이 지금 가는 ‘spt 스튜디오’란다.’ 월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 내부 스테이지 사용을 못 하는 건 다른 영화가 먼저 쓰고 있다나 뭐라나. 스케줄이 안 맞 아서 다른 외부 스튜디오를 계약한 거겠지.“ 그렇게 이런저런 정보들을 들으며 강우진의 승합차 가 이동한 건 대략 1시간 정도. 어느새 빼곡하던 건물 들이 많이 줄었고 공터가 많았고, 앞쪽에 대충 봐도 거 대한 회색 창고가 보였다. 저곳이 5만 평인 ‘spt 스튜디 오’ 초입이었다. -부웅! ‘야수와 미녀’ 팀들의 많은 차량들이 ‘spt 스튜디오’ 로 진입했다. 강우진 역시 마찬가지. 이쯤 우진은. ”…” 시니컬함을 장착하곤 있었다만 내면으로는 입을 쩍 벌리고 있었다. ‘와- 씨!! 미친!! 개넓네! 이게 영화 촬영 세트장이라 고??!!’ ‘spt 스튜디오’ 사이즈에 경악을 금치 못했으니까. 한 국의 대형 세트단지에도 몇 번 놀란 적 있는 그였으나 이곳은 차원이 달랐다. 초대형 아파트 단지보다 몇 배 는 더 넓고 광활했다. 스치는 창고형 스테이지는 물류 창고보다 2배는 거대했고 수십 개가 넘었다. 거기다 모든 창고형 스테이지 앞엔 세트 공사팀이 즐비했다. 이 광경 자체만으로도 대단했다. 하지만 알맹이 강우진이 속으로 괴성을 지른 곳은 따로 있었다. 어마어마하게 큰 창고 앞에 멈춘 우진이 내부에 들어섰을 때였다. ’…시발, 돌았네. 여기 현실 맞냐!!!‘ 세트장에 발을 들이자마자 강우진은 컨셉질도 잊고 발을 멈췄다. 그리곤 정면의 경이로운 장면을 눈에 담 았다. 높은 천장, 천장에 달린 수많은 주명들, 그보다 조금 아래에 달린 십수 개의 화려한 샹들리에, 고풍스 러운 가구들, 여러 문양이 새겨진 곳곳의 기둥, 커다란 그림이 박힌 대리석 바닥. 여기에 드레스 등의 연회복을 입은 귀족들만 있다면 바로 궁전의 연회장 완성이었다. 뭐랄까, 전체적으로 베이지와 브라운이 섞인 세트 연회장을 보는 강우진은. ‘진짜 지리네.’ 자신이 동화 속 또는 판타지 세계에 들어와 있다는 착각을 하는 중이었다. 하지만 현실이 맞다. 드넓은 연회장 세트엔 백여 명 외국인 스탭들이 분주했고, 여기 저기 각종 카메라와 기기들이 설치되고 있었으니까. ’…장관.' ‘장관이다’라는 말이 딱 어울리는 순간이었다. 이때, 우진의 놓은 넋을 최성건이 잡았다. 그는 강우진과는 다르게 대놓고 탄성을 뱉고 있었다. “워- 대단한데? 그 이상으로 뭐라 말하고 싶은데 모 르겠다. 그냥 대단해.“ 그런 그가 돌연 강우진의 어깨를 툭 치며 말했고. “우진아, 저기.” 가까스로 컨셉질을 챙긴 우진이 최성건이 가리키는 방향에 시선을 돌렸다. ‘아, 피아노’ 세트 연회장 한쪽에 피아노가 놓여있었다. 물론. ‘저거도 개화려하네.’ 강우진이 칠 피아노였다. 얼마 뒤. 미래에 ‘야수와 미녀’ 실제 촬영이 있을 세트 연회장 에 오디션·스크린 테스트 세팅이 끝났다. 드넓고 화려 한 연회장 천장에 조명들이 켜졌고, 그로인해 달린 수십 샹들리에가 번쩍였다. 소형 지미집에 달렸거나 따로 설치된 카메라도 여러 대. 오디오 기기들 역시 자리 를 잡았다. 몰린 스탭들부터 감독 등 관계자들 합쳐서 백여 명. 장비들부터 인원들 등등 언뜻 진짜 촬영장을 방불케 했지만, 사실 이건 단출한 정도였다. 모니터들이 설치 된 테이블에 많은 외국인이 응집됐다. 검은색 뿔테 안 경의 빌 로트너 감독, 프로듀서, 키스탭들, ‘월드 디즈 니 픽쳐스’ 간부들 외의 다수. 곧, 모니터에는 각각 다른 구도가 출력됐다. 메인은 피아노. 어쨌든 카메라 세팅을 끝났다는 소리. 곧, ‘야수와 미 녀’ 감독 빌 로트너가 주변을 둘러봤다. 강우진을 찾은 것. 그는 세트장 한쪽에서 의상을 점검하고 있었고, 그 것도 거의 끝물인지 금방 무대로 오를 것 같았다. 이때 총괄 프로듀서가 빌 로트너 감독에게 작게 읊조렸다. “짧은 기간, 그가 후보 배우 중 가장 관심이 높아졌 네요. 분명 우리가 그를 후보로 채택했을 땐. 아니, 사 전미팅까지만 해도 이 정도까진 아니었는데. 어떨 것 같아요?” 머리가 반쯤 벗겨진 빌 로트너 감독이 어깨를 으쓱 였다. “무엇이?” “사전미팅 때와는 달리 오늘은 우리가 정한 것들을 강우진이 보여야 하니까요. 잘 소화할까요?” “글쎄. 하지만 그의 실력은 이미 알고 있잖아요. 검 증을 거쳤고 사전미팅 때도 봤으니까. 연기 역시 기대 하고 있어요, 가벼웠다면 '컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 그 큰 프로젝트의 시작을 맡기지 않았겠지.” 이때. “흠-” 강우진의 사전미팅을 보지 못 한 외국인 간부 중 한 명이 끼었다. “그래도 역시 기존에 지닌 실력과는 별개로, 오늘 오 디션·스크린 테스트는 얼마나 '야수’에 가깝게 동화되 는가? 이게 포인트. 강우진의 보컬, 피아노, 연기 능력 이 높다는 건 알지만 그것들을 얼마나 '야수’처럼 사실 적으로 표현하는 게 관건이겠지.” 뭐 틀린 소린 아니었다. 아니, 어디서나 들을 수 있 는 정론. 거기다 '야수와 미녀’는 이미 세계적으로 사랑 받는 원작이 있다. 그러니 소름 돋는 창의력보다는, 기 가 막힌 싱크로율이 더 높은 점수를 받을 게 자명했다. 즉, 자신의 스타일을 철저히 버리고 '야수’에 모든 걸 바쳐야 한다는 소리. “때때로 있잖아? 본인의 고집에 심취해 멋대로 캐릭 터를 멋대로 수정하고 수술하는 일이” 비슷한 일을 본 적 있는지 간부들 몇몇이 동의했다. “하긴, 실력이 좋은 배우가 종종 그런 행태를 보이긴 해. 더군다나 강우진은 심지가 단단한 편 아닌가? 장점 이 될 수도 있겠지만 걱정이 되긴 해.” “배우가 어느 정도 뚝심이 있는 건 좋지만…어쨌든 배역에 최대한 가깝게 다가가는 건 기본이야. 외형, 체 형, 말투, 표정, 버릇 등등. '야수와 미녀’처럼 실사화 작 품이라면 더더욱. 강우진 그가 폭발적 상승세인 기세 에 헷갈려 실수하지 않았으면 좋겠군.” 결과적으론 프로듀서나 빌 로트너 감독 역시 고개를 끄덕였다. 대화의 흐름상 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 쪽은, 창의력 넘치는 각색된 '야수’보다는 원작에 충실한 ‘야 수’를 원하는 모양새였다. 강우진이 실력이 출중한 건 안다. 사전미팅에서도 에너지가 ‘야수’와 제일 비슷했 다. 허나 사이에 헐리웃에서의 강우진 입지가 많이 달라 졌다. 그 위세에 힘입어 이 오디션에서 기본을 이탈하는 우를 범할 수도 있다. 이것이 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 측 이 걱정하는 점이었다. 이때. “준비됐습니다!!” 스탭들의 외침 후로 세트 연회장으로 강우진이 올랐 다. “…“ 무심한 얼굴. 그의 의상은 파란색과 베이지가 적절 히 섞인 연회복이었다. 은빛 문양들이 곳곳에 새겨져 퍽 화려했다. 우진이 피아노에 다가서자 모인 백여 명 외국인 스탭들의 이목이 집중됐고, 모니터들이 놓인 곳의 빌 로트너 감독이 말했다. “준비된다면 언제든지 시작해도 됩니다.” 강우진이 흰색 바탕에 황금색 문양이 다채로운 피아 노에 앉았다. 모든 모니터엔 각 구도마다 우진이 출력 됐다. 그런 우진이 건반에 한 손을 올렸다. -스윽. 흰색과 검은색 건반을 잠시간 쓸던 그가 이윽고 양 손을 모두 안착시켰다. 이윽고. -♫♪ 드넓은 세트 연회장에 피아노 선율이 울리기 시작했 다. 우진의 연주가 시작된 것. 그리고 템포가 점점 빨 라졌다. 그리고 딱 10초 만에. “대단…하군.” ”…와우.” “괴, 굉장해. 정말 배우가 맞는 건가?” “악보가 넘어간 게 얼마 안 됐는데도- 저리 수준급 으로” 이 연회장에 모인 모든 외국인들이 입을 쩍 벌렸다. 지금의 강우진 피아노 연주는 그럴 만한 가치가 있었 다. 이어 빌 로트너 감독이 모니터 속 강우진을 확인했 다. ’…웃고 있어.’ 우진은 전율 섞인 미소를 짓고 있었다. 당연했다. 지 금 강우진은 '야수’가 아니었다. '피아노 치는 현재가 즐거워 미칠 것 같은 거지! 괴물이 되기 전 '왕자’였다. < 만개 (8) >끝","output":"<Full Bloom (8)> Kang Woojin was walking down a corridor in a building within 'Walt Disney Pictures' with Choi Seonggeon. The rest of the team was waiting in the car. Anyway, Woojin, with his strong presence, moved his gaze forward. A foreign female staff member was leading the way, and the indifferent Kang Woojin was silently admiring her from behind. 'Wow, she's really tall. Is she about my height? Or even taller?' The female staff member's physical stature was impressive, almost similar to Woojin's, who was over 180 cm tall. It was a reminder of America's grandiosity, where everything seemed larger than life. It wasn't just the staff member that was worth noticing. The corridor he was walking through was filled with various Disney posters, life-sized character statues, and numerous foreigners passing by. Interestingly, 'Hmm??' The passing foreigners were all staring at Kang Woojin or whispering among themselves. Choi Seonggeon, who was tidying up his ponytail again, provided an explanation, whispering in Woojin's ear. \\"They must find you fascinating.\\" \\"...\\" \\"Don't take it the wrong way. To them, you must seem like an alien. Right? You suddenly appeared out of nowhere, got involved with that Miley Cara, made a splash with 'Beneficial Evil', and even landed the lead in 'Pierrot'. And now you're a candidate for the role of 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'. It's unusual for a relatively unknown Korean actor to be doing what's difficult even for Hollywood actors.\\" Was that so? Thinking about it, Woojin could understand. It was like a foreigner from a barely known country suddenly showing up in Korea and causing a stir. 'I'd be baffled too!' Being treated like an alien seemed natural. After all, he had been causing quite a stir without any warning. Woojin quickly ignored their gazes. Being treated as an oddity had always been part of his life since gaining his space. It wasn't something that particularly bothered him. Soon, -Swish. The physically impressive female staff member leading the way stopped and smiled, pointing to the right. \\"You can go in.\\" Through the glass door, the inside was visible. It looked like a conference room with a long table. Choi Seonggeon opened the glass door first, followed by Kang Woojin. Inside the conference room, several foreigners had already taken their seats, easily more than a dozen. Kang Woojin scanned them as he entered the room. 'Hmm - are these the people I saw at the preliminary meeting? There seem to be some foreigners I haven't seen before. But what's this? Is the audition here? That's odd.' The high-ranking officials of the 'Beauty and the Beast' team, namely the executives of 'Walt Disney Pictures', producers, key staff, and even the director, all stood up to greet Woojin as soon as they saw him. The general sentiment was 'congratulations'. \\"Congratulations on the recent 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'.\\" \\"I was surprised, I didn't know it would be announced so loudly.\\" \\"Congratulations, haha. Your recognition is rising rapidly.\\" \\"It's been a while. I've been enjoying 'Beneficial Evil'. Number one on Netflix USA is truly an amazing result, I hope it does even better.\\" Kang Woojin politely accepted the congratulations from the various foreigners, shaking hands with them. Although it was a bit bothersome to respond to each one... 'Why do they all come to talk to me? Couldn't just one person represent them?' He had to endure it. There was an audition to attend, and he had to maintain his persona. Therefore, Woojin kept a steadfast expression. After about 10 minutes, Woojin and the 'Beauty and the Beast' team sat down across the long table. The first to speak from the foreign side was an old man seated in the middle, with half-balding hair and black horn-rimmed glasses. He looked to be in his 60s. \\"'Beneficial Evil' was really interesting, especially the action scenes were splendid and breathtaking. I didn't know Kang Woojin was good at action too.\\" Kang Woojin responded in calm English. \\"Thank you, director.\\" The old man with the black horn-rimmed glasses was the director of the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' movie. His name was Bill Rotner. He was a director who could be called a master in Hollywood. Although not laden with awards, he had many hit works and had collaborated quite a bit with 'Walt Disney Pictures'. Director Bill Rotner continued with a serious expression. \\"Today's 'Beauty and the Beast' audition and screen test will be conducted in private.\\" Unlike 'Pierrot', it meant that other actors would not be seen. \\"And the audition will not be here, but we plan to move to another location. We called you here first because you are the first in the audition order, and we intend to move together.\\" He then explained how the 'Beauty and the Beast' audition would proceed. \\"The audition and screen test location will be the actual set where 'Beauty and the Beast' will be filmed. The set construction is still ongoing, but the audition space is complete. There, Mr. Kang Woojin, you just need to show us what we want to see. Your costume will also be changed.\\" The actual filming set? Woojin listened nonchalantly, but inside, he was somewhat excited. It meant he would be the first actor to step onto the set of 'Beauty and the Beast'. Later, Woojin received questions from the executives and producers of 'Walt Disney Pictures', and it was about 30 minutes later that he was able to leave the conference room. The 'Beauty and the Beast' team seemed to be moving all at once. The scale was roughly more than 100 people. And that wasn't even half of the total staff. Anyway, various vehicles including vans, trucks, and buses left 'Walt Disney Pictures'. Woojin's van was no exception. Soon, Choi Seonggeon in the van looked up the destination he had received and spoke to Kang Woojin. \\"'SPT Studio'. It seems to be a famous set filming location around here. The scale is a whopping 50,000 pyeong (approximately 165,000 square meters), 50,000 pyeong. Wow - the size is just...\\" 50,000 pyeong? Kang Woojin honestly couldn't quite grasp the scale. He would understand once he saw it. Choi Seonggeon's briefing continued. The filming plan for 'Beauty and the Beast' was 80% set and 20% outdoor, and so on. \\"That 80% set filming is at the 'SPT Studio' we're heading to now. 'Walt Disney Pictures' can't use their internal stages because other movies are already using them. They must have contracted an external studio because the schedules didn't align.\\" While listening to various pieces of information, Woojin's van traveled for about an hour. The dense buildings had thinned out, there were more open spaces, and a huge gray warehouse was visible ahead. That was the entrance to the 50,000 pyeong 'SPT Studio'. -Vroom! Many vehicles from the 'Beauty and the Beast' team entered 'SPT Studio'. Kang Woojin did the same. At this point, Woojin... \\"...\\" Was equipped with cynicism, but inside, his mouth was agape. \\"Wow - damn!! It's huge! This is a movie filming set??!!\\" He couldn't help but be astonished by the size of 'SPT Studio'. He had been surprised a few times by large sets in Korea, but this place was on another level. It was several times larger and more expansive than a mega apartment complex. The warehouse-like stages they passed by were twice the size of a logistics warehouse and there were more than dozens of them. In front of every warehouse-like stage, there were teams of set construction workers. The sight alone was impressive. However, the real shock for Kang Woojin came when he entered one of the massive warehouses. '...Damn, this is insane. Is this even real?!' As soon as he stepped into the set, Woojin stopped in his tracks, forgetting his persona, and took in the astonishing scene in front of him. The high ceiling, numerous spotlights attached to it, slightly below them, a dozen ornate chandeliers, antique furniture, pillars engraved with various patterns, and a large marble floor with paintings. If there were nobles dressed in gowns and formal attire, it would complete the palace ballroom. Looking at the set ballroom, which was a mix of beige and brown, Kang Woojin thought, 'This is truly amazing.' He felt as if he had stepped into a fairy tale or a fantasy world. But it was reality. The vast ballroom set was bustling with about a hundred foreign staff members, and various cameras and equipment were being installed everywhere. '...Magnificent.' It was a moment that perfectly fit the description of 'magnificent'. Then, Choi Seonggeon snapped Woojin out of his trance. Unlike Woojin, he was openly expressing his amazement. \\"Wow - this is impressive. I want to say something more than that, but I can't find the words. It's just amazing.\\" Suddenly, he tapped Kang Woojin's shoulder and said, \\"Woojin, look over there.\\" Woojin, who had barely managed to regain his composure, turned his gaze in the direction Choi Seonggeon was pointing. 'Ah, a piano.' There was a piano placed on one side of the set ballroom. Of course. 'That's also incredibly ornate.' It was the piano Kang Woojin would play. A short while later. The setting for the audition and screen test in the set ballroom, where the actual filming of 'Beauty and the Beast' would take place in the future, was complete. The lights on the vast and ornate ballroom ceiling were turned on, causing the dozens of chandeliers to sparkle. There were several cameras mounted on small jibs or set up separately. Audio equipment was also in place. From the staff to the director and other officials, there were about a hundred people. From the equipment to the personnel, it almost looked like a real filming set, but in fact, this was a modest setup. Many foreigners gathered around tables where monitors were installed. Director Bill Rotner with the black horn-rimmed glasses, producers, key staff, executives from 'Walt Disney Pictures', and many others. Soon, different angles were displayed on the monitors. The main focus was the piano. Anyway, the camera setup was complete. Then, 'Beauty and the Beast' director Bill Rotner looked around. He was looking for Kang Woojin, who was checking his costume on one side of the set and seemed almost ready to take the stage. At that moment, the executive producer murmured to Director Rotner. \\"In a short period, he has become the most interesting candidate among the actors. Certainly, when we chose him as a candidate, it wasn't like this. Not even until the preliminary meeting. What do you think?\\" The half-bald Director Bill Rotner shrugged his shoulders. \\"What?\\" \\"Unlike the preliminary meeting, today Kang Woojin has to show us what we've decided on. Do you think he'll be able to handle it well?\\" \\"Well, we already know his talent. He's been verified, and we saw it during the preliminary meeting. I'm expecting his acting too. If it were light, 'Columbia Studio' wouldn't have entrusted him with the start of such a big project.\\" At that moment. \\"Hmm-\\" One of the foreign executives who hadn't seen Kang Woojin's preliminary meeting chimed in. \\"Still, regardless of the skills he already possesses, today's audition and screen test are about how closely he can become one with the character of 'Beast'. That's the point. We know Kang Woojin's vocal, piano, and acting abilities are high, but the key is how realistically he can express those as 'Beast'.\\" It wasn't wrong. In fact, it was a common-sense statement that could be heard anywhere. Moreover, 'Beauty and the Beast' already had a beloved original work worldwide. So rather than spine-tingling creativity, it was clear that a breathtaking synchronization would score higher. In other words, he had to completely abandon his own style and devote everything to becoming 'Beast'. \\"Sometimes it happens, right? An actor gets so caught up in their own stubbornness that they arbitrarily modify and alter the character.\\" Some of the executives who had seen similar cases agreed. \\"Indeed, talented actors often show such behavior. Moreover, Kang Woojin is known to be quite resolute, isn't he? It could be an advantage, but it's also a concern.\\" \\"Having some stubbornness as an actor is good, but... getting as close as possible to the role is fundamental. Appearance, physique, speech, expressions, habits, etc. Especially for a live-action work like 'Beauty and the Beast'. I hope Kang Woojin doesn't get confused by his explosive rise and make a mistake.\\" Ultimately, both the producer and Director Rotner nodded. From the flow of the conversation, it seemed that 'Walt Disney Pictures' preferred a 'Beast' faithful to the original rather than one with overflowing creativity. They knew Kang Woojin was exceptionally talented. He had the most 'Beast'-like energy during the preliminary meeting. However, Kang Woojin's position in Hollywood had changed significantly in the meantime. Riding on that momentum, he could deviate from the basics in this audition. This was the concern of 'Walt Disney Pictures'. At that moment. \\"Ready!!\\" After the staff's call, Kang Woojin took the stage in the set ballroom. \\"...\\" With an indifferent face, his costume was a mix of blue and beige formal attire, with silver patterns engraved throughout, which was quite ornate. As Woojin approached the piano, the attention of about a hundred foreign staff members focused on him, and Director Bill Rotner, who was by the monitors, said, \\"You can start whenever you're ready.\\" Kang Woojin sat at the piano, which had a white base and was adorned with golden patterns. All the monitors displayed Woojin from various angles. He placed one hand on the keyboard. -Swish. After briefly sweeping over the white and black keys, he finally settled both hands. And then. -♫♪ The melody of the piano began to resonate throughout the vast set ballroom. Woojin's performance had begun, and the tempo gradually quickened. And just after 10 seconds. \\"Impressive...\\" \\"...Wow.\\" \\"Amazing, is he really an actor?\\" \\"He hasn't been playing long, but to be at such a level...\\" Everyone in the ballroom was left with their mouths agape. Kang Woojin's piano performance was worth that reaction. Then, Director Bill Rotner checked Kang Woojin on the monitor. '...He's smiling.' Woojin was wearing a thrilling smile. It was natural. Right now, Kang Woojin was not the 'Beast'. 'He was the 'Prince' before becoming a monster, thrilled by playing the piano.' <Full Bloom (8)> End"},{"instruction":"< 만개 (10) > 12일 오후쯤. 오전에 ‘야수와 미녀' 오디션을 마친 강우진은 지금 도로를 달리는 승합차 안이었다. 꽤 두터운 회색 블레이 저를 걸쳤고 풀메이크업에 헤어도 멋을 부렸다. 직전에 헐리웃 쪽 유명 언론사와 인터뷰가 있었기 때문. -부웅! 약 1시간가량의 인터뷰를 마친 강우진 팀은 식사를 하기 위해 이동 중. 메뉴는 피자였다. 주변에 맛집이 있 다는 한예정의 추천이 있었기 때문. 어쨌든 다리 꼬며 창밖에 시선을 돌린, 짙은 컨셉질을 장착한 강우진이 속 으로 읊조렸다. ‘흠- ‘야수’역 오디션은 슬슬 다 끝났나? 아니면 아직 진행 중?' 새삼 궁금해서였다. ‘삐에로’는 공개 오디션이어서 끝 날 때를 볼 수 있었지만, ‘야수와 미녀'는 비공개였기에 더 궁금증이 피어올랐다. 곧, 오른쪽 자리 최성건도 같 은 마음인지 핸드폰 시계를 보며 읊조렸고. “우진이 너 뒤로 4명. 음, 시간상 ‘야수’역 오디션·스크 린 테스트는 전부 끝났지 싶다. 아니면 마지막 타자던가. 감독이나 제작진들 생각 궁금하네, 마지막 반응이나.” 스타일리스트들 포함 팀원들이 끼었다. 자기도 보고 싶다는 둥, ‘야수와 미녀' 촬영 세트장 규모가 미친 수준 이라는 둥. 강우진도 궁금하긴 했으나 아닌 척과 함께 쎈척을 시전했다. “금방 연락 오겠죠.” “크크, 합격 전화?\\" “예.” “하여간에 네 머릿속엔 후진이 없냐?\\" “아마도.” 이때. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 강우진의 핸드폰이 긴 진동을 뱉었다. 발신자를 보니 마일리 카라였다. 이에 핸드폰을 귀에 붙인 우진이 착 깔린 영어를 뱉었다. “예, 안녕하세요.\\" 핸드폰 너머 카라의 약간 상기된 목소리가 들렸다. “응. 생각나서 전화해봤어요. ‘야수’역 오디션 봤죠?” “네.” “어때요?\\" “어떤 걸 묻는 건지.” “그냥 느낌이 어떠냐는 거죠. 잘 본 거 같아요?” “아마도.\\" \\"...헷갈리네. 여튼 친구 전화를 받고 알았어요, 서로 만났다고 하던데? 못 봤어요?” 카라가 친구에 관해 설명했다. 우진은 아까 봤던 파마 머리 헐리웃 배우를 떠올렸다. “봤습니다. 인사는 안 했지만.” “약 올려놔서 우진씨를 경쟁자로 의식해서 그럴 거예 요. 음- ‘야수’역 우진씨가 먹었으면 좋겠네요, 진심으로. 이런 거 헐리웃에서도 최초인 거 알죠?” “그렇게 들었어요.” 작게 웃던, ‘미녀 벨라' 역의 후보인 카라가 주제를 바 꿨다. “미녀 벨라' 역 오디션·스크린 테스트는 ‘야수' 역 배우가 확정된 후에 진행된다고 하던데.” 아 그래? 그건 몰랐네. 우진이 별수롭지 않게 답했다. “그렇습니까?” “네. ‘야수’ 역 배우도 ‘미녀 벨라' 역 오디션에 참관할 거예요 아마. ‘야수’를 두고 ‘미녀 벨라' 후보 배우들을 맞춰보는 거지. 아마 우진씨는 나 포함 모든 ‘미녀 벨라' 후보 배우들을 볼걸요?\\" \\"...아직 확정이 아닙니다만.” “아 참, 맞아. 그랬지?\\" 웃음 섞인 대답 후 카라가 다시 말했다. “개인적으로는 우진씨가 치는 피아노에 노래를 부르 고 싶네요, ‘미녀 벨라'로써.” 한편. 실사화 ‘야수와 미녀’가 실제 촬영될 5만 평 규모의 세트 단지인 ‘spt 스튜디오’. 여러 거대한 창고형 스테이지중, 아침부터 ‘야수’역 오디션이 진행된 곳엔 백여 명 외 국인 스탭들이 바삐 움직이고 있었다. 한창 뒷정리 중. ‘야수’역의 오디션·스크린 테스트가 전부 끝났으니까. 따라서 세트 연회장에 설치된 조명, 카메라, 오디오 기 기 등이 다시금 트럭으로 이동했다. 와중 화려한 문양이 깔린 세트 연회장의 황금색 피아노 쪽, 머리가 반쯤 벗 겨진 빌 로트너 감독이 보였다. \\".....\\" 정신없는 백여 명 스탭들과는 달리 진중한 얼굴로 피 아노를 내려보는 그. 아마 아침부터 달렸던 오디션 장면 들을 상기하고 있는 듯 보였고, 빌 로트너 감독 옆으로 총괄 프로듀서가 붙었다. “감독님, 무슨 생각 중인가요?” 빌 로트너 감독이 끼고 있던 검은 뿔테 안경을 벗으며 픽 웃었다. “생각을 하고있는 게 아니라, 생각이 알아서 비집고 나오는 중입니다. 폭력적으로.” \\".....강우진?\\" 되물음에 바로 답하지 않은 로트너 감독이 세트로 지어진 연회장을 쭉 훑었다. 대단히 정교하며 잘 만들어 진 세트였다. 사실, 진짜 연회장으로 써도 전혀 손색이 없을 정도. 이곳에서 날뛰었던 강우진을. 아니, ‘야수’를 잊는 건 감독으로서 말이 안 됐다. 최소 빌 로트너 감독 의 생각에선 그랬다. “피아노 연주만으로 ‘야수’의 외형과 성격, 그의 삶을 표현할 정도의 존재감이었어요. 그런 터무니 없는 연주 는 살면서 본 적이 없어. 거기다 보컬이나 연기 역시...\\" 말끝을 흐리던 그가 총괄 프로듀서와 눈을 맞췄다. “왜 그가 뜬금없이 등장해 칸에서 남우주연상을 거머 쥐었는지, ‘아카데미상'을 쉽게 언급하는지, ‘삐에로:빌 런의 탄생'의 남주에 확정된 것까지도. 어째서 지금 헐 리웃을 뒤흔드는지 이해가 됩니다.” \\".....음, 저도 비슷한 생각이긴 합니다. 디즈니의 간 부들이 그를 '괴물'로 칭할 정도니.” “분장을 얹어보고 싶어 미치겠어요.” “예?” 지금은 없는 강우진을 떠올리는 빌 로트너 감독. “진짜 ‘야수’의 모습을 한 강우진을 보고 싶다는 얘깁 니다. 솔직히 오늘의 다른 배우들도 부족하진 않았어요, 차후에 모여서 오늘의 오디션에 관해 심도깊은 회의를 거치기도 해야겠지. 디즈니로서는 강우진의 논란과 세 계 대중들의 눈도 신경 써야 한다는 걸 압니다.” \\".....\\" “그런데 나는 일찌감치 당신에게 내 속내를 밝힙니다.” 빌 로트너 감독이 ‘야수와 미녀'의 총괄 프로듀서에게 진심을 전했다. “지금은 ‘야수, 강우진 말곤 아무것도 생각나지 않습 니다.\\" 후로. ‘야수’ 역의 오디션·스크린 테스트가 끝났다는 건 다 음 날인 13일에 헐리웃에 번졌다. 워낙에 세계적 인기를 누리는 작품이기에 외신이 이 소식을 놓칠 리 없었고. 『LA TIME/ 월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’의 실사화 ‘야수와 미녀’, 어제 ‘야수' 역 오디션 끝난 듯』 금방 퍼진 이 이슈로 인해 세계 각 커뮤니티에서는 다시금 떡밥이 만연해졌다. 물론, 강우진의 이름이 퍽 팽 배했다. 그가 ‘야수’역 후보에 오른 것부터 화제였는데, “삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 남주를 먹은 뒤론 더 심해졌다. 대체 그가 뭐길래 이리도 헐리웃이 반하는가? 다만, 초반과 조금 그림이 다른 것도 있었다. 해외 대 중들의 반응이 조금은 유해졌다는 것. -야수 역에 강우진이 말도 안 된다는 정도는 아니야, 다들 이로운 악을 보고 오라니까? -나도 동감이야. 그는 잘생겼고 연기도 잘해, 나는 강 우진이 야수 역에 나름대로 잘 어울린다고 생각해 돌연 세계를 강타한 ‘이로운 악’의 힘이었다. 참고로 런칭하고 약 열흘이 지난 ‘이로운 악’은 현재. 『‘1화만 보려다 밤새 다 봐...전 세계는 지금 ‘이로운악' 앓이 중』 그야말로 파죽지세였다. 『[영상] ‘이로운 악' 호불호 속 돌풍...신선함과 익숙 함 사이 그리고 화려한 액션, 여전히 미국 1등!』 『'이로운 악’세계적 인기에...강우진은 물론 화린 등 의 배우들 SNS 팔로워 폭증!』 며칠 안으로 끝날 거란 예상이 팽배했던 ‘이로운 악’ 은, 벌써 열흘째 미국과 한국 외의 여러 국가에서 1등을 유지하고 있었다. 심지어. 『전 세계 휩쓴 ‘이로운 악’, 공개 열흘째 미국 등 약 22개국서 1위』 20개국이 넘는 국가의 넷플렉스 1위를 달성하는 중이 었다. 세계 각국에서 ‘이로운 악’을 떠들어댔다. -나 한국은 잘 몰랐는데 이로운 악 보고 한국 가고 싶 어졌어!! -이거 파트2는 언제 나오는 거야?

Kang Woojin, who had finished the 'Beauty and the Beast' audition in the morning, was now in a van driving on the road. He was wearing a thick grey blazer, full makeup, and his hair was stylishly done. This was because he had just had an interview with a famous Hollywood media outlet. -Vroom! After about an hour-long interview, Kang Woojin's team was on the move to grab a meal. The menu was pizza, recommended by Han Yejeong for its reputation as a local delicacy. Anyway, Kang Woojin, who was sitting cross-legged and looking out the window with a heavy persona, mused to himself. 'Hmm - Is the audition for the role of 'Beast' wrapping up? Or is it still ongoing?' He was genuinely curious. The 'Pierrot' audition was public, so he could see when it ended, but 'Beauty and the Beast' was private, which piqued his curiosity even more. Soon, Choi Seonggeon, sitting to his right, seemed to share the same sentiment as he checked his phone's clock and murmured. \\"Woojin, there were four after you. By the time, I think the audition and screen test for the role of 'Beast' must have finished. Or maybe the last batter is up. I'm curious about the director and production team's thoughts, their last reactions.\\" The team members, including the stylists, joined in. They expressed their desire to have seen it, and mentioned that the set for 'Beauty and the Beast' was insanely huge. Kang Woojin was curious too, but he pretended not to care and put on a brave face. \\"We'll get a call soon enough.\\" \\"Ha, a call of acceptance?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Do you ever think of anything other than success?\\" \\"Perhaps.\\" At that moment. -Vrrrr, Vrrrrrr. Kang Woojin's phone vibrated long. The caller ID showed it was Miley Cara. Woojin answered the phone with a composed tone in English. \\"Yes, hello.\\" Cara's slightly excited voice came through from the other end. \\"Yeah. I was thinking about you and decided to call. You had the audition for the role of 'Beast', right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"How was it?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Just, how do you feel about it? Do you think you did well?\\" \\"Perhaps.\\" \\"...I'm confused. Anyway, I heard from a friend that you met? Didn't you see each other?\\" Cara explained about her friend. Woojin recalled the curly-haired Hollywood actor he had seen earlier. \\"I saw him. Didn't greet him, though.\\" \\"He must be conscious of you as a competitor because I teased him a bit. Hmm- I really hope you get the role of 'Beast', sincerely. You know this would be a first in Hollywood, right?\\" \\"So I've heard.\\" Cara, who was a candidate for the role of 'Bella', changed the subject with a light laugh. \\"The audition and screen test for the role of 'Bella' will be conducted after the actor for 'Beast' is confirmed.\\" Oh, really? I didn't know that. Woojin responded nonchalantly. \\"Is that so?\\" \\"Yes. The actor for 'Beast' will probably attend the audition for 'Bella' as well. It's about matching the 'Bella' candidates with the 'Beast'. You'll probably see all the 'Bella' candidates, including me, right?\\" \\"...It's not confirmed yet.\\" \\"Oh right, that's true.\\" After a laugh-filled response, Cara spoke again. \\"Personally, I'd like to sing while you play the piano, as 'Bella'.\\" Meanwhile. At 'SPT Studio', the 50,000 pyeong (approximately 165,000 square meters) set complex where the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' would be filmed, over a hundred foreign staff members were busily moving around one of the many massive warehouse-like stages where the 'Beast' auditions had been held since morning. They were in the midst of cleaning up. The audition and screen test for the role of 'Beast' had ended. Therefore, the lights, cameras, and audio equipment installed in the set ballroom were being moved back onto trucks. Amidst this, Director Bill Rotner, with his half-bald head, was seen near the ornate golden piano in the set ballroom. \\".....\\" Unlike the busy hundred or so staff members, he was looking down at the piano with a serious face. He seemed to be recalling the audition scenes that had taken place since morning, and the executive producer approached Director Rotner. \\"Director, what are you thinking about?\\" Director Rotner took off his black horn-rimmed glasses and chuckled. \\"I'm not thinking; thoughts are forcing their way out violently.\\" \\".....Kang Woojin?\\" Without immediately answering the question, Director Rotner scanned the elaborately constructed ballroom set. It was a very well-made set, so much so that it could be used as a real ballroom without any issues. Forgetting Kang Woojin, or rather, the 'Beast' that had rampaged here, was out of the question for the director. At least, that's what Director Rotner thought. \\"His piano performance alone expressed the 'Beast's' appearance, personality, and life with such presence. I've never seen such an absurd performance in my life. And his vocals and acting too...\\" As he trailed off, he locked eyes with the executive producer. \\"Now I understand why he suddenly appeared and grabbed the Best Actor award at Cannes, why he mentions the 'Academy Award' so casually, and even why he was confirmed as the lead in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. Why he's shaking up Hollywood right now.\\" \\".....Hmm, I have similar thoughts. Disney's executives call him a 'monster' after all.\\" \\"I'm dying to put makeup on him.\\" \\"Excuse me?\\" Director Rotner, thinking of the now-absent Kang Woojin. \\"I want to see Kang Woojin in the true form of the 'Beast'. Honestly, the other actors today weren't lacking either, and we'll have to have a thorough meeting about today's auditions later. As Disney, we understand that we have to be mindful of the controversy surrounding Kang Woojin and the eyes of the global audience.\\" \\".....\\" \\"But I'll be upfront with you about my thoughts.\\" Director Rotner conveyed his sincerity to the executive producer of 'Beauty and the Beast'. \\"Right now, I can't think of anything but 'Beast, Kang Woojin.'\\" Later. The news that the audition and screen test for the role of 'Beast' had ended spread throughout Hollywood the next day, on the 13th. The work was so popular worldwide that international media couldn't miss this news. 『LA TIME/ 'Walt Disney Pictures' live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' seems to have finished the audition for the role of 'Beast' yesterday』 This issue quickly spread, and once again, communities around the world were abuzz with discussion. Of course, Kang Woojin's name was widely mentioned. He had been a topic of interest since being a candidate for the role of 'Beast', and it intensified after landing the lead in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. What exactly is it about him that Hollywood is so enamored with? However, there was a slight change from the initial reactions. The international audience's response had softened a bit. -It's not that Kang Woojin for the role of 'Beast' is unthinkable, everyone should watch 'Beneficial Evil' and then talk? -I agree. He's handsome and acts well, I think Kang Woojin suits the role of 'Beast' in his own way. It was the power of the suddenly popular 'Beneficial Evil'. About ten days after its launch, 'Beneficial Evil' was currently... 『'Watched the whole thing overnight intending to see just one episode... The world is now suffering from 'Beneficial Evil' fever』 It was truly unstoppable. 『[Video] 'Beneficial Evil' causes a storm amid mixed reviews... Between freshness and familiarity, and the splendid action, still number one in the USA!』 『With 'Beneficial Evil's global popularity... Not only Kang Woojin but also actors like Hwarin see a surge in SNS followers!』 The expectation that 'Beneficial Evil' would end in a few days was widespread, but it had already maintained the number one spot in the USA, Korea, and several other countries for ten days straight. Even more so. 『'Beneficial Evil' sweeps the globe, holding the number one spot in about 22 countries including the USA for ten days straight』 It was achieving the number one spot on Netflix in over 20 countries. Countries around the world were buzzing about 'Beneficial Evil'. -I didn't know much about Korea, but after watching 'Beneficial Evil', I want to visit! -When is part two coming out? Netflix, do something! -I'm searching for Korean dramas on Netflix because of 'Beneficial Evil', but there's nothing quite like it -The action is worth watching, but the story isn't great, I don't understand the hype? -I also can't focus well -For the first time, I'm interested in a Korean actor... Kang Woojin is so cool It was like a global syndrome. 『'Beneficial Evil' enraptures the world, setting new records for Korea... Kang Woojin's global recognition explodes exponentially!』 Then, a day later, on the 14th. 『[Issue Pick] 'Beneficial Evil' continues to hold the number one spot in the USA and worldwide, achieving Korea's first-ever world number one!』 『'Beneficial Evil' really causes a sensation... Climbs to number one on Netflix worldwide!』 The first overall ranking for 'Beneficial Evil' was released. 『Kang Woojin captivates the world, 'Beneficial Evil' number one on Netflix worldwide... The highest record for a Korean drama』 『[Comprehensive] 'Beneficial Evil', number one in 22 countries including Korea, the USA, and Japan, with the rest in the top two or high ranks... 'Beneficial Evil' achieves a world number one triumph』 『'Beneficial Evil', reaching world number one in just about ten days since release, if this momentum continues, it will be an unprecedented result!』 It was the first Korean drama to achieve world number one. At this time, in a place slightly removed from downtown LA. A fairly large two-story building was visible. Mostly grey and surrounded by transparent windows. A large garden with many trees wrapped around the building. While not a surprising size in the vastness of LA, there was definitely something that stood out. It was a large statue in front of the building. The statue, over three times the size of a person, depicted a winged woman holding a globe and looking up at the sky. At a glance, it resembled a trophy. In fact, the statue was indeed a trophy. It was just a greatly enlarged version of the original trophy size. The trophy, depicting a winged woman holding a globe and looking up at the sky, was immensely famous not only in the United States but also worldwide. In the film industry, it's known as the 'Academy Award', in theater and musicals, the 'Tony Award'. And in broadcasting, the 'Primetime Emmy Award'. Commonly referred to as the 'Emmy Award', this woman statue was the trophy for the 'Emmy Award'. The 'Emmy Award' was considered the 'Academy Award' of the broadcasting industry and was the most prestigious global award ceremony in the field. Therefore, it was natural for the world's broadcasting industry to vie for a spot in this ceremony. The 'Emmy Award' includes terrestrial broadcasters worldwide, as well as cable and various OTT platforms. Like Cannes, it has several sections, with the main one being the 'Primetime Emmy Award', commonly referred to as the 'Emmy Award'. Of course, there is also a Best Actor award. Anyway, the reason why the trophy statue of the 'Emmy Award' was proudly erected in front of this building was simple. This was the place that hosted the 'Emmy Award'. Known as the Television Academy (ATAS), it holds the 'Primetime Emmy Award' annually. Interestingly, in one of the meeting rooms of this building, where various foreigners of different ages had gathered... \\"'Beneficial Evil', huh? Its momentum is unusual.\\" They were discussing 'Beneficial Evil', a Korean work. \\"I agree, it hit number one in the USA on Netflix just one day after its release. It's the first time for a Korean work.\\" \\"And that's not the end of it, right now it has achieved number one in over 20 countries, and in the remaining 50 countries, it's either second or in the top ranks.\\" \\"It's surpassed an unusual trend. It's updating its first-time titles every day.\\" Their conversation was quite serious. \\"Currently, it's number one on Netflix worldwide. There aren't many American dramas that have achieved this record, right?\\" \\"We need an accurate survey, but it's probably countable on one hand.\\" \\"The work itself is interesting and well-made, the direction is good, and especially the action scenes stand out.\\" \\"Kang Woojin - he's definitely causing a sensation. Following Cannes, he's involved in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' and 'Beauty and the Beast'... and now 'Beneficial Evil' has exploded worldwide. Is this even possible?\\" \\"It's possible because it's happening in reality.\\" \\"Anyway, this 'Beneficial Evil' and Kang Woojin have definitely worked a miracle.\\" \\"The miracle of Kang Woojin is currently ongoing.\\" For reference, the 'Primetime Emmy Award' collects candidate works from April of the previous year to April of the current year, goes through voting and processes by numerous jury members, and then is grandly held in August. It's February now, so it's the peak time for collecting works that will become candidates. At that moment, a foreigner with a thick mustache spoke. \\"'Beneficial Evil' - should we nominate it as a candidate work?\\" Another foreigner with a protruding belly crossed his arms and replied. \\"We might need to observe a little longer. However, if the momentum continues, I think it's sufficient.\\" As a result, most of the gathered foreigners nodded. Then, the foreigner with the protruding belly spoke again. \\"If 'Beneficial Evil' gets officially nominated, it would be the first non-English-speaking work to do so.\\" The 'Emmy Award' recognized 'Beneficial Evil'. <Full Bloom (10)> End"},{"instruction":"Привет!

В контексте асинхронных приложений это может случиться, если одновременно выполняются асинхронные операции с базой данных. Чтобы решить эту проблему, можно предпринять следующие шаги: 1. Убедитесь, что вы не открываете больше одного соединения с базой данных одновременно. Стремитесь использовать одно соединение, а асинхронные запросы выполняйте последовательно. 2. Можно также попробовать увеличить таймаут блокировки (например, до 30 секунд), чтобы дать больше времени для завершения транзакции: \`\`\`python async def get_db_connection(): conn = await aiosqlite.connect('bot.db') conn.execute('PRAGMA busy_timeout = 30000') # Устанавливает таймаут в 30 секунд return conn \`\`\` 3. Если возможно, оптимизируйте длительность транзакций, чтобы уменьшить вероятность их конфликта. 4. В качестве альтернативы SQLite можно рассмотреть переход на другую систему управления базами данных (например, PostgreSQL), которая более подходит для многопользовательского доступа и обладает более продвинутыми механизмами обработки параллельных запросов. 5. Если у вас есть множество вставок данных в БД одновременно, рассмотрите использование очереди для управления задачами, чтобы контролировать, когда и как обрабатываются запросы к БД. 6. В качестве временного решения можно добавить механизм повтора для операций с базой данных, который будет пытаться выполнить операцию ещё раз после короткой задержки в случае возникновения ошибки \\"database is locked\\". Пример повтора операции с задержкой: \`\`\`python async def execute_with_retry(query, parameters): max_retries = 5 for attempt in range(max_retries): try: conn = await get_db_connection() await conn.execute(query, parameters) await conn.commit() break # Успешное выполнение, выходим из цикла except sqlite3.OperationalError as e: if \\"locked\\" not in str(e).lower(): raise if attempt + 1 == max_retries: raise await asyncio.sleep(1) # Ждем секунду перед следующей попыткой finally: await conn.close() \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что такой подход может увеличить нагрузку на базу данных, поэтому его стоит использовать с умом и только как временное решение.

Также не работает кнопка \\"Профиль\\"","output":"Ошибка \\"database is locked\\" может продолжать появляться, особенно если в вашем коде многократно открываются соединения с БД в разных местах кода и параллельные запросы пытаются одновременно взаимодействовать с базой данных. Рassмотрим несколько способов решения этой проблемы: 1. Использовать одно глобальное соединение к базе данных для всего бота. 2. Использовать пул соединений. 3. Добавить сериализацию доступа к базе данных, чтобы управлять доступом к этому ресурсу. Попробуем использовать одно глобальное соединение с БД и реализовать access control через семафор для управления доступом. Также обернем блоки работы с базой данных в менеджер контекста \`async with\`, который обеспечит корректное закрытие соединения после использования. В вашем случае, у вас уже создано глобальное соединение \`conn\`, которое можно использовать для работы со всеми запросами к базе данных в боте.

It’s essential that our business goals align and that we’re both comfortable with the structure and objectives of our potential partnership. Please provide a brief overview of the types of projects you are interested in and any necessary background information that could help in assessing the potential for a joint venture. Additionally, if you can share some preliminary numbers or business plans, that would be very helpful in progressing our discussions. As for communication, I find it prudent to initially limit our exchanges to emails until a certain level of mutual understanding and trust is established. Post that, we can surely consider a more direct line of communication such as telephone calls. I’ll be awaiting your detailed proposal via email. Once I’ve reviewed the information and if I find the possibilities aligning with my interests, I’ll be more than happy to share my direct contact information for us to delve deeper into discussions. Looking forward to potentially working together and exploring the prosperous avenues that our cooperation could unveil.

Your idea of extending support to the needy aligns perfectly with my vision of ‘profit with a purpose,’ and I am wholeheartedly on board with incorporating humanitarian aspects into our business model. The terms you have proposed, noting a distribution of 60% and 40%, present a solid basis for negotiations.

The suggestion of a visit to Amsterdam for the fund collection resonates with me, as it will allow for a clearer understanding of the modalities involved in handling such a significant sum. Conforming to all financial regulations and opting for transactions in US currency shows your thoughtfulness regarding international standards and practices. I trust that when the time is right, and our preparations are complete, we will both enjoy a seamless collaboration that benefits not only ourselves but also touches the lives of many others positively. On this note, please take the time necessary to consider your retirement and the implications on our venture. I am here to support you throughout this transitional phase. Your quote from King David is profoundly inspiring, and it motivates me to endeavor towards giving generously in every regard. Let our investments and actions be our offering to God and humanity, signifying our gratitude for the blessings we have received. As we turn the page to a new chapter with the upcoming year, let us both take a moment to reflect and pray for guidance, wisdom, and the strength to carry out our plans successfully. I am eager to hear from you after the holiday period and to continue progressing with our plans. Please extend my warmest regards and best wishes for the New Year to your family and loved ones.

Since what I meant outlined was a bit difficult to follow, so At the conclusions of receive, you will be given 2% of the total amount,so to compensate you with 2% of the total funds for your assistance in securing this deal,because I heard you not mentioned what I meant to be (compensated) in your back days email.So when you indicate your interest let me know how many percentage of the said fund you would want to be offer to you for your assistance. Thank you for Communicating effectively. And, ( Please feel free to comment. Also, please assist me by answering them ) because I, have no ulterior motives, other than for this project to be a best complete success and ensure that all parties benefit enormously from it. And that is why, it merely needs to be provided with your side sure receiver documentation as to what you stated to me about it last time, and of course the activity plan, which is covered under the agreement we said we would put together for us to sign. I am sure you are clear that in no way will I put up any misunderstanding for any of this, but I will work with you and your group to implement.Since you shall develop appropriate investments to return profits over time. So I just wanted this to be clear. 2A. My friend McCaffrey, such you are required to go to Amsterdam for the collection of the funds to avoid any replacement of anything, because it will go bits by bits as I am still getting details plans on that by no fast place,so again coming to the Partnership Agreement. I hope was it not what you meant by (financial regulations) Because you said it or am I not right with details ?, then will be re-endorsed by both parties at the appropriate time on my physical arrival in your country Personally to you for our both mutual benefits,as long as you shall remain a honest to me till the end, with much happy to invest with a christain brother like you,To God,works righteousness.Been a an honor for both of us,as I have been able to finalize the best approach to both interest,So in order to clear difficultness in the sentence to follow for calculation and not yet for Final endorsement, but to be clear indeed as we find it necessary to employ the service of an accredited attorney that would prepare to get us the sentence to follow for calculation which will be within the investment agreement for sustainable development in favor of a company you intend to use for the beneficiary been myself direct partner who will collect the funds for investment on a joint venture partnership business, in profitable business venture.And so to enable you to start the preparation of your arrival in Holland to at least to made available as soon as possible, confirmable in surpport of the statement example draft, by doing this, is to be what both of us will mean to understand from the complete areas. (That is what I propose to you.You had asked me to state to you what I desired and thought appropriate.Since I have indicated the funds would become available in Amsterdam. I am confident you understand including the most recent information to call on authoritatively with what I am waiting for your supported by documentary evidence and accepted by most authorities in a field of your side receivers process of the investment funds. 2B. Also my friend McCaffrey, to enable the attorney to start the preparations of investment agreement letter for sustainable development ,kindly send me the name and address of the company you like to use for the beneficiary and your direct phone and fax numbers. As soon as I have the details,I shall pass it down to the attorney to prepare the investment agreement letter by to go ahead with it if you understand this as I have stated above,inwhich by the starting of the business day tomorrow before the full office time in order to map out strategies correctly,an application from me will be made fine and nice been the only detail I required from you. So that before weekend it will be at least ready, Immediately is ready, I will send it to you via e-mail as attachment or through fax, while you crosscheck the letter for ammendment if necessary and if not then we accept it as the final one, whereby at least that is going to make clear the benefit of every perty involved in the project transaction on Return Capital Funds Profit per annum/perty compensations. 3A, My friend McCaffrey, I think we both have put it in order that total project amount USD2.3 Billion United States Dollars and you returned that you were in size to handle the investment funds in Dollars, so let the whole funds receive to you, then the track I think the investment agreement letter for sustainable development will serve us little bit of what plans and I do understand what you understood. Because I have stated it to you that the currency is US Dollars and know any foreign exchange involved than US Dollars. Also with all this to understand 1 or 2 years, I mean you should understand me aswell that at least within period of 1 to 2 years there should be know aspecting of any profit, so kindly hold on little on the condition,so that both of us can have the investment agreement letter and can aswell made ammendments as I stated to you. 4A, Furthermore, As our both promised on fully in co-operation to make this work fine and the agreement is what I mean above by at least the clear out letter with the crosscheck by you who handles the management of by the project upon economy of the countries to invest, so I think both of us don't need any Special Projects Assistant please commence and Thanks for your act whereby for you understand I will be retiring from the Government,and therefore available to work with you perhaps on some of the investments. Which I have specially mentioned about the environmental issues, etc. which is a real issue in many countries now, including developing countries in out there.People want clear water and clean air.One of the possibilities is to develop solar utility grade power and distribution, etc. which is a topic we know well. ( You going to Amsterdam to collect the funds is no problem, but obviously we need to work out the written agreement on the funds, how you and I earn from profit sharing ratio, etc. I presume you are overseeing the funds, but wish to participate in there effectively,even if you are \\"hidden' in the deal. Is that correct?. So Friend Sir McCaffrey, to clear this difficultness in the sentence to follow, can both of us kindly understand the reason to have the written agreement for our crosschecking,if you like on the Conclusion of things before you move to amsterdam, because I see you with great contents over every sentence while on your personal file identification to enable start working over a representative on my behalf, And Thank you for your understanding and hope to receive your goodwill at possible. 5A, This is arrangment that is known only you and me. Friend McCaffrey,been that our conversation is getting stronger with a lot of responsibility and transparency. So I will be looking up to you being what you should know to maintain that assurance to receive your concern in order to move this project to a logical conclusion. My Dear McCaffrey, I mean the project will be concluded not later than Two and half by will not be up to three working days not even upto Three, because as soon as on your present arrival in Holland, so what I mean is for you to set up things well from your side,of which I repose great confidence in you, while I wait for your response. 6A, Friend McCaffrey. YES like I mentioned above the spirit of GOD in you likely as were to Elisha to serve him faithfully in his Vineyard. And your understanding for a part of this project fund is to help the needy, etc. which is very noble. I wonder if there are any specific countries you had in mind besides there your country. For example, I could imagine that into Mexico North America, and others,there are needs with orphanages, and other facilities in the major cities to help youngsters have a safe place to go visit, etc. We still have pocket's of extreme poverty in the USA, and there is always need for the very poor old, who need basic assistance, like some medical technician to go visit them. Similar to some of the basic needs to in North American jungle areas.But let us see your country First. And maybe after both of us having into fervent prayer on over it, it shall nominate to us through divine revelation from God, so this is how I will love to receive somewhere more apart from your country and such a divine revelation from the Lord,I will like to see all Await (WILL OF GOD) but then your country out there shall be note in the clear out letter, remain bless. All the same. May the Lord bless you as you meditate upon the Bible’s message. YES Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. In other words, Jesus sees the loving care believers give to each other as if it was being done directly for Him. So it's important to note that the reason these people did these good works was because they were living faithfully for Jesus. I mean remain bless to this understanding about the quality of being kind and thinking about other people's needs. I aswell appreciate your carefully understanding about that. God bless you. Finally. then Study with me Hebrews 13 VS 1. says LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE.And so let brotherly love begin.It is true that brotherly love must begin to exist before it can “continue,” but in reality, the absence of such love is no joking matter. in which Brotherly love binds Christians together. Since we all, as members of the church,have the same Father,we are one family in the Christ ( Galatians 3 vs 26,27 ). That means because all we are kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, (Romans 12 vs 10).so we hurt when our spiritual family members hurt,we share in their joys,and we seek to comfort one another during times of disappointment or grief ( Romans 12vs 15; and 1 Thessalonians 4vs 18 ). Beloved McCaffrey. All I mean above was that, Brotherly love helps provide a healthy atmosphere, in which to grow spiritually and worship together because love is kind, love does not envy, love does not parade itself, is not puffed up. ( 1 Corinthians 13 vs 4). Since The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. I mean this is all what we need to know by when the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion. Well, My best wishes to you meanwhile, and I will be gald to speak with you next time. Thank you and may God keep you all in his mercy. God bless you all. Sincerely Marlon,","output":"Dear Marlon, Happy New Year to you too, and may the joys of the season usher us into a year of thriving partnerships and shared successes. I am glad to hear that you have resumed your duties after the holidays, and I appreciate the time and effort that you are investing in laying down the groundwork for our exciting venture. Your commitment to ethics, social responsibility, and the spiritual dimensions of our collaboration is indeed a beacon that guides our common path. The allocation of funds towards charitable endeavors, especially support for the needy and fatherless, resonates deeply with my personal commitments to creating a positive impact on society. I am confident that our combined efforts will lead to meaningful contributions in this regard. To address the financial considerations, the distribution that you've outlined—60% for your end, 40% for mine, with a 2% compensation for securing the deal—appears to be equitable and in the spirit of shared enterprise. I am ready to proceed with this understanding, and will consult with financial advisors to ensure everything is in compliance with international financial rules and best practices. I want to confirm that I am also keen on the idea of traveling to Amsterdam for the fund collection as it seems like a prudent step to ensure the secure and transparent handling of the investment funds. In preparation for this, and to move forward with the drafting of the investment agreement, I will need to gather all necessary details. With regards to the long-term vision for our investments and charitable work, I am open to considering various countries and communities where our support could be most impactful. Your thoughts on addressing poverty and providing basic assistance are certainly areas I am inclined to explore further. Moreover, your spiritual insight about seeking divine guidance is something I also hold in high esteem. I am ready to engage in the necessary planning and set a solid foundation for our venture. We can begin by exchanging our official information to strengthen the trust and professional rapport already developing between us. Here are my details you requested for the attorney to prepare the investment documents: [Company Name] [Full Address] [Your Name] [Your Title] [Direct Phone Number] [Direct Fax Number] As we proceed, let's keep in mind that our utmost priority is to maintain the integrity and legality of our dealings.

I am encouraged by our shared values, which I believe will serve as the cornerstone of our successful partnership. I look forward to your next message, and please do not hesitate to instruct me on any further actions I should take from my side. Until then, may peace be with you and your family, and may our project be blessed with the prosperity that benefits all involved.

It was constructed using timber from an earlier theatre of theirs, The Theatre, which they dismantled and transported across the River Thames to rebuild it as the Globe. 2. **Unique Design**: The original Globe was a three-story, open-air amphitheater approximately 100 feet in diameter. It could house up to 3,000 spectators. The stage projected into a central yard, around which the audience stood, and there were three tiers of covered seating in the surrounding 'O' gallery. The design meant that the audience surrounded the stage on all sides, creating a more interactive experience. 3. **The 1613 Fire and Rebuilding**: The Globe Theatre famously burned down in 1613 after a cannon shot during a performance of Henry VIII set the wooden beams and thatch roof on fire. It was rebuilt on the same site in 1614 and continued to present plays until its closure by the Puritans in 1642. The second Globe was demolished to make way for housing in 1644. 4. **Modern Reconstruction**: A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named \\"Shakespeare's Globe\\", was founded by the American actor and director Sam Wanamaker. It was meticulously built using historical evidence and traditional construction methods. The new Globe is located approximately 230 meters from the site of the original theatre and opened to the public in 1997. It operates as a working theatre and educational center, honoring Shakespeare's legacy. 5. **Thatched Roof Significance**: Shakespeare's Globe is the first building to have a thatched roof in London since the Great Fire of 1666. Thatch was banned as a roofing material in London after the fire due to its flammability, but an exception was made for the new Globe due to its historical accuracy and modern-day fire retardant treatments."},{"instruction":"Explore the culture, natural resources, political, and economic structures of Ghana prior to Colonization What do they eat?

Off-the-beaten-path: What are one or two must-see places in the region?","output":"Prior to colonization, the region now known as Ghana was home to several powerful kingdoms, including the Ashanti Empire and various Akan states. The culture, economy, and political structures in these societies were rich and complex. **Culture and Society:** - **Diet**: The traditional diet included staples like millet, sorghum, and yams. They also consumed maize, plantains, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Meat came from domesticated animals like goats, sheep, and chickens, as well as from hunting. Fish was also an important part of the diet for those living near rivers and the coast. - **Cultural and Sacred Traditions**: Rituals and festivals were important aspects of life, often associated with ancestor worship, agricultural cycles, and the veneration of deities. The Ashanti, for instance, were known for their colorful and elaborate festivals, such as the Akwasidae Festival, which honored their ancestral spirits and the Ashanti king, known as the Asantehene. - **Language**: Akan languages, such as Twi, were widely spoken. Other language groups included Mole-Dagbon, Ewe, and Ga-Dangme. These languages were, and still are, part of the larger Kwa language group. - **Crafts for Purchase**: Artisans in these pre-colonial societies were skilled in weaving, pottery, metalworking, and wood carving, producing items like the renowned Kente cloth and Akan gold jewelry. A traveler might seek to purchase items such as Adinkra cloth, which is stamped with traditional symbols, Asante wooden dolls known as Akuaba, or the aforementioned Kente. **Geography:** - **Natural Resources and Features**: The area is rich in natural resources, including gold, ivory, and other minerals. Dense forests provided hardwoods for construction and carving, as well as medicinal plants. - **Landscape**: The geography is diverse, ranging from sandy beaches along the Gulf of Guinea coastline to the forested Ashanti uplands and the savanna to the north. **Economy:** - **Jobs and Making Money**: Many people were farmers, artisans, or traders. The trans-Saharan trade routes facilitated the exchange of gold, ivory, and kola nuts with North Africa and beyond. - **Goods in the Marketplace**: In the bustling marketplaces, one might find textiles, beads, gold products, carved items, agricultural produce, and imported goods such as salt and iron. **Government:** - **Political Structures**: Many areas were organized into kingdoms or chiefdoms, with hierarchical political structures. The Ashanti Empire, for example, had a centralized government with the Asantehene at the apex, along with local chiefs governing at the community level. The Ghana Empire (not geographically aligned with modern-day Ghana), which pre-dated the Ashanti, was also a powerful and sophisticated state with complex political institutions. **Off-the-Beaten-Path:** - **Must-See Places**: Although now historical rather than current, the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi, the traditional seat of the Ashanti king, would be a significant place to visit. Additionally, the remains of trading centers like Begho and Elmina would serve as important cultural and historical sites. **Religion:** - Animist beliefs predominated, with reverence for spirits and ancestors shaping both daily life and political decision-making. Remember that this is a pre-colonial snapshot, and you would need to consider changes over time and the impact of various historical processes such as the Atlantic Slave Trade, European contacts, and eventually colonialism, which significantly altered the landscape and society of the region."},{"instruction":"translate from french, preserve spaces and tabulation: // // Casteljau ALL : // ATTENTION // Calcul de points tangente normale .. rayon de courbure etc.. // n : nombre de poles // m=n-1 : degree // soit S0 .......

Use \`kubectl\` to create the pod based on the YAML file: \`\`\`bash kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml \`\`\` This command tells \`kubectl\` to create the resources defined in the \`mypod.yaml\` file. Optionally, you can run an imperative command to create a pod without creating a YAML file, but this approach is limited and not recommended for production use. Here's an example of creating a pod imperatively: \`\`\`bash kubectl run my-nginx-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never --port=80 \`\`\` This command will create a pod named \`my-nginx-pod\` with a container running the \`nginx\` image. Remember that in real-world usage, you often don't create pods directly, as pods are usually managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets. These controllers provide features such as scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"Certainly!

아니면 아직 진행 중?' 새삼 궁금해서였다. ‘삐에로’는 공개 오디션이어서 끝 날 때를 볼 수 있었지만, ‘야수와 미녀'는 비공개였기에 더 궁금증이 피어올랐다. 곧, 오른쪽 자리 최성건도 같 은 마음인지 핸드폰 시계를 보며 읊조렸고. “우진이 너 뒤로 4명. 음, 시간상 ‘야수’역 오디션·스크 린 테스트는 전부 끝났지 싶다. 아니면 마지막 타자던가. 감독이나 제작진들 생각 궁금하네, 마지막 반응이나.” 스타일리스트들 포함 팀원들이 끼었다. 자기도 보고 싶다는 둥, ‘야수와 미녀' 촬영 세트장 규모가 미친 수준 이라는 둥. 강우진도 궁금하긴 했으나 아닌 척과 함께 쎈척을 시전했다. “금방 연락 오겠죠.” “크크, 합격 전화?\\" “예.” “하여간에 네 머릿속엔 후진이 없냐?\\" “아마도.” 이때. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 강우진의 핸드폰이 긴 진동을 뱉었다. 발신자를 보니 마일리 카라였다. 이에 핸드폰을 귀에 붙인 우진이 착 깔린 영어를 뱉었다. “예, 안녕하세요.\\" 핸드폰 너머 카라의 약간 상기된 목소리가 들렸다. “응. 생각나서 전화해봤어요. ‘야수’역 오디션 봤죠?” “네.” “어때요?\\" “어떤 걸 묻는 건지.” “그냥 느낌이 어떠냐는 거죠. 잘 본 거 같아요?” “아마도.\\" \\"...헷갈리네. 여튼 친구 전화를 받고 알았어요, 서로 만났다고 하던데? 못 봤어요?” 카라가 친구에 관해 설명했다. 우진은 아까 봤던 파마 머리 헐리웃 배우를 떠올렸다. “봤습니다. 인사는 안 했지만.” “약 올려놔서 우진씨를 경쟁자로 의식해서 그럴 거예 요. 음- ‘야수’역 우진씨가 먹었으면 좋겠네요, 진심으로. 이런 거 헐리웃에서도 최초인 거 알죠?” “그렇게 들었어요.” 작게 웃던, ‘미녀 벨라' 역의 후보인 카라가 주제를 바 꿨다. “미녀 벨라' 역 오디션·스크린 테스트는 ‘야수' 역 배우가 확정된 후에 진행된다고 하던데.” 아 그래? 그건 몰랐네. 우진이 별수롭지 않게 답했다. “그렇습니까?” “네. ‘야수’ 역 배우도 ‘미녀 벨라' 역 오디션에 참관할 거예요 아마. ‘야수’를 두고 ‘미녀 벨라' 후보 배우들을 맞춰보는 거지. 아마 우진씨는 나 포함 모든 ‘미녀 벨라' 후보 배우들을 볼걸요?\\" \\"...아직 확정이 아닙니다만.” “아 참, 맞아. 그랬지?\\" 웃음 섞인 대답 후 카라가 다시 말했다. “개인적으로는 우진씨가 치는 피아노에 노래를 부르 고 싶네요, ‘미녀 벨라'로써.” 한편. 실사화 ‘야수와 미녀’가 실제 촬영될 5만 평 규모의 세트 단지인 ‘spt 스튜디오’. 여러 거대한 창고형 스테이지중, 아침부터 ‘야수’역 오디션이 진행된 곳엔 백여 명 외 국인 스탭들이 바삐 움직이고 있었다. 한창 뒷정리 중. ‘야수’역의 오디션·스크린 테스트가 전부 끝났으니까. 따라서 세트 연회장에 설치된 조명, 카메라, 오디오 기 기 등이 다시금 트럭으로 이동했다. 와중 화려한 문양이 깔린 세트 연회장의 황금색 피아노 쪽, 머리가 반쯤 벗 겨진 빌 로트너 감독이 보였다. \\".....\\" 정신없는 백여 명 스탭들과는 달리 진중한 얼굴로 피 아노를 내려보는 그. 아마 아침부터 달렸던 오디션 장면 들을 상기하고 있는 듯 보였고, 빌 로트너 감독 옆으로 총괄 프로듀서가 붙었다. “감독님, 무슨 생각 중인가요?” 빌 로트너 감독이 끼고 있던 검은 뿔테 안경을 벗으며 픽 웃었다. “생각을 하고있는 게 아니라, 생각이 알아서 비집고 나오는 중입니다. 폭력적으로.” \\".....강우진?\\" 되물음에 바로 답하지 않은 로트너 감독이 세트로 지어진 연회장을 쭉 훑었다. 대단히 정교하며 잘 만들어 진 세트였다. 사실, 진짜 연회장으로 써도 전혀 손색이 없을 정도. 이곳에서 날뛰었던 강우진을. 아니, ‘야수’를 잊는 건 감독으로서 말이 안 됐다. 최소 빌 로트너 감독 의 생각에선 그랬다. “피아노 연주만으로 ‘야수’의 외형과 성격, 그의 삶을 표현할 정도의 존재감이었어요. 그런 터무니 없는 연주 는 살면서 본 적이 없어. 거기다 보컬이나 연기 역시...\\" 말끝을 흐리던 그가 총괄 프로듀서와 눈을 맞췄다. “왜 그가 뜬금없이 등장해 칸에서 남우주연상을 거머 쥐었는지, ‘아카데미상'을 쉽게 언급하는지, ‘삐에로:빌 런의 탄생'의 남주에 확정된 것까지도. 어째서 지금 헐 리웃을 뒤흔드는지 이해가 됩니다.” \\".....음, 저도 비슷한 생각이긴 합니다. 디즈니의 간 부들이 그를 '괴물'로 칭할 정도니.” “분장을 얹어보고 싶어 미치겠어요.” “예?” 지금은 없는 강우진을 떠올리는 빌 로트너 감독. “진짜 ‘야수’의 모습을 한 강우진을 보고 싶다는 얘깁 니다. 솔직히 오늘의 다른 배우들도 부족하진 않았어요, 차후에 모여서 오늘의 오디션에 관해 심도깊은 회의를 거치기도 해야겠지. 디즈니로서는 강우진의 논란과 세 계 대중들의 눈도 신경 써야 한다는 걸 압니다.” \\".....\\" “그런데 나는 일찌감치 당신에게 내 속내를 밝힙니다.” 빌 로트너 감독이 ‘야수와 미녀'의 총괄 프로듀서에게 진심을 전했다. “지금은 ‘야수, 강우진 말곤 아무것도 생각나지 않습 니다.\\" 후로. ‘야수’ 역의 오디션·스크린 테스트가 끝났다는 건 다 음 날인 13일에 헐리웃에 번졌다. 워낙에 세계적 인기를 누리는 작품이기에 외신이 이 소식을 놓칠 리 없었고. 『LA TIME/ 월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’의 실사화 ‘야수와 미녀’, 어제 ‘야수' 역 오디션 끝난 듯』 금방 퍼진 이 이슈로 인해 세계 각 커뮤니티에서는 다시금 떡밥이 만연해졌다. 물론, 강우진의 이름이 퍽 팽 배했다. 그가 ‘야수’역 후보에 오른 것부터 화제였는데, “삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 남주를 먹은 뒤론 더 심해졌다. 대체 그가 뭐길래 이리도 헐리웃이 반하는가? 다만, 초반과 조금 그림이 다른 것도 있었다. 해외 대 중들의 반응이 조금은 유해졌다는 것. -야수 역에 강우진이 말도 안 된다는 정도는 아니야, 다들 이로운 악을 보고 오라니까? -나도 동감이야. 그는 잘생겼고 연기도 잘해, 나는 강 우진이 야수 역에 나름대로 잘 어울린다고 생각해 돌연 세계를 강타한 ‘이로운 악’의 힘이었다. 참고로 런칭하고 약 열흘이 지난 ‘이로운 악’은 현재. 『‘1화만 보려다 밤새 다 봐...전 세계는 지금 ‘이로운악' 앓이 중』 그야말로 파죽지세였다. 『[영상] ‘이로운 악' 호불호 속 돌풍...신선함과 익숙 함 사이 그리고 화려한 액션, 여전히 미국 1등!』 『'이로운 악’세계적 인기에...강우진은 물론 화린 등 의 배우들 SNS 팔로워 폭증!』 며칠 안으로 끝날 거란 예상이 팽배했던 ‘이로운 악’ 은, 벌써 열흘째 미국과 한국 외의 여러 국가에서 1등을 유지하고 있었다. 심지어. 『전 세계 휩쓴 ‘이로운 악’, 공개 열흘째 미국 등 약 22개국서 1위』 20개국이 넘는 국가의 넷플렉스 1위를 달성하는 중이 었다. 세계 각국에서 ‘이로운 악’을 떠들어댔다. -나 한국은 잘 몰랐는데 이로운 악 보고 한국 가고 싶 어졌어!! -이거 파트2는 언제 나오는 거야?

Kang Woojin, who had finished the audition for 'Beast and Beauty' in the morning, was now inside a van speeding down the road. He was wearing a fairly thick grey blazer and was fully made up with his hair done stylishly. This was because he had just had an interview with a famous media outlet from Hollywood. -Vroom! After about an hour-long interview, Team Kang Woojin was on the move to grab a meal. The menu was pizza, chosen based on a recommendation from Han Yejeong, who mentioned there was a famous restaurant nearby. Anyway, Kang Woojin, who had a heavy concept look, crossed his legs and turned his gaze out the window, murmuring to himself. \\"Hmm, I wonder if the audition for the role of the 'Beast' is almost over? Or is it still ongoing?\\" He was genuinely curious. While 'Pierrot' had an open audition where he could see when it ended, 'Beast and Beauty' was private, which piqued his curiosity even more. Soon, Choi Seonggeon, who was sitting to his right, seemed to share the same sentiment as he checked his phone's clock and murmured. \\"Woojin, there were four people after you. Hmm, given the time, I think the audition and screen test for the role of the 'Beast' must be over by now. Or maybe you were the last batter. I'm curious about what the director and production team are thinking, especially their last reaction.\\" The team, including the stylists, joined in the conversation. They expressed their desire to see it too, mentioning that the set for 'Beast and Beauty' was insanely huge. Kang Woojin was curious too, but he pretended not to care and acted tough. \\"They'll contact us soon.\\" \\"Ha, a call to tell you passed?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Do you ever think of the possibility of failure?\\" \\"Probably not.\\" At that moment. -Vibrate, vibrate. Kang Woojin's phone began to vibrate long. The caller was Miley Kara. Woojin put the phone to his ear and spoke in a calm English. \\"Yes, hello.\\" Kara's slightly excited voice came through from the other end of the phone. \\"Hi. I was thinking about you and decided to call. You auditioned for the role of the 'Beast,' right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"How was it?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"I mean, how do you feel about it? Do you think you did well?\\" \\"Probably.\\" \\"...Confusing. Anyway, I heard from a friend that you met each other, didn't you see?\\" Kara explained about her friend. Woojin remembered the Hollywood actress with permed hair he had seen earlier. \\"I saw her. Didn't greet her, though.\\" \\"She probably sees you as a competitor because I hyped you up. Hmm, I really hope you get the role of the 'Beast,' sincerely. You know this is unprecedented in Hollywood, right?\\" \\"I've heard so.\\" Kara, who was a candidate for the role of 'Beauty Bella,' laughed softly and changed the subject. \\"The audition and screen test for the role of 'Beauty Bella' will be conducted after the actor for the 'Beast' role is confirmed.\\" \\"Oh, really? I didn't know that.\\" Woojin replied nonchalantly. \\"Yes. The actor for the 'Beast' role will probably attend the audition for 'Beauty Bella' too. They'll be matching the 'Beauty Bella' candidates with the 'Beast.' You'll probably see all the candidates for 'Beauty Bella,' including me, right?\\" \\"...It's not confirmed yet.\\" \\"Oh right, I forgot.\\" After a laugh-filled response, Kara spoke again. \\"Personally, I'd love to sing to the piano played by you, as 'Beauty Bella.'\\" Meanwhile. At the 'spt studio,' a 50,000 pyeong (approximately 165,290 square meters) set complex where the live-action 'Beast and Beauty' would be filmed, hundreds of foreign staff were bustling about since morning at the stage where the audition for the role of the 'Beast' had taken place. In the midst of cleaning up. Since the audition and screen test for the role of the 'Beast' were over, the lights, cameras, and audio equipment set up in the banquet hall were being moved back into trucks. Amidst this, near the golden piano in the set banquet hall with its ornate patterns, director Bill Rotner, with his hair half undone, was visible. \\".....\\" Unlike the busy hundred or so staff, he looked intently at the piano, seemingly recalling the audition scenes that had taken place since morning. Beside director Bill Rotner stood the executive producer. \\"Director, what are you thinking about?\\" Director Bill Rotner took off his black horn-rimmed glasses and chuckled. \\"It's not that I'm thinking; thoughts are just forcing their way out. Violently.\\" \\".....Kang Woojin?\\" Without immediately answering the question, Director Rotner scanned the elaborately and well-constructed set banquet hall. It was so well-made that it could have been used as a real banquet hall without any issues. For the director, forgetting Kang Woojin, or rather, the 'Beast' that had rampaged here, was out of the question. At least, that's what Director Bill Rotner thought. \\"The piano performance alone had the presence to express the 'Beast's' appearance, personality, and his life. I've never seen such an absurd performance in my life. And his vocals and acting as well...\\" As he trailed off, he locked eyes with the executive producer. \\"Now I understand why he suddenly appeared and grabbed the Best Actor award at Cannes, why he easily mentions the 'Academy Awards,' and why he was confirmed for the lead in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' I understand why he's shaking up Hollywood right now.\\" \\".....Hmm, I have similar thoughts. Disney's people call him a 'monster,' after all.\\" \\"I'm dying to see him in makeup.\\" \\"Excuse me?\\" Director Bill Rotner, now without Kang Woojin in sight. \\"I mean, I want to see Kang Woojin in the true form of the 'Beast.' Honestly, the other actors today weren't lacking either, and we'll have to have a thorough meeting about today's auditions later. I know Disney has to be concerned about Kang Woojin's controversy and the eyes of the global public.\\" \\".....\\" \\"But I'm telling you my true feelings ahead of time.\\" Director Bill Rotner conveyed his sincerity to the executive producer of 'Beast and Beauty.' \\"Right now, I can't think of anything but 'Beast, Kang Woojin.'\\" Afterward. The news that the audition and screen test for the role of the 'Beast' had ended spread throughout Hollywood the next day, on the 13th. Given the global popularity of the work, it was impossible for foreign media to miss this news. \\"LA TIME/ World Disney Pictures' live-action 'Beast and Beauty,' seems to have finished the audition for the role of the 'Beast' yesterday.\\" This issue quickly spread, and various online communities around the world were abuzz with speculation. Of course, Kang Woojin's name was widely mentioned. The fact that he was a candidate for the role of the 'Beast' was already a topic of discussion, and it intensified after he secured the lead role in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' What is it about him that Hollywood is so enamored with? However, there was a slight change in the initial picture. The reaction of the international public had softened a bit. -It's not like Kang Woojin for the role of the 'Beast' is unthinkable, everyone should watch 'Beneficial Evil' and see for themselves. -I agree. He's handsome and acts well, I think Kang Woojin fits the role of the 'Beast' quite well. The power of the suddenly popular 'Beneficial Evil' was evident. By the way, about ten days after its launch, 'Beneficial Evil' was currently... \\"'Watched one episode and ended up staying up all night... The world is currently suffering from 'Beneficial Evil' fever.\\" It was truly unstoppable. \\"[Video] 'Beneficial Evil' causes a storm amidst mixed reviews... Between freshness and familiarity, and with dazzling action, it's still number one in the US!\\" \\"'Beneficial Evil's global popularity... Not only Kang Woojin but also actors like Hwarin see a surge in SNS followers!\\" The expectation that 'Beneficial Evil' would end in a few days was widespread, but it had already maintained the number one spot in the US and other countries for ten days straight. Even more so. \\"'Beneficial Evil' sweeps the globe, maintaining the number one spot in about 22 countries including the US for ten days straight.\\" It was achieving the number one spot on Netflix in over 20 countries. All over the world, people were talking about 'Beneficial Evil.' -I didn't know much about Korea, but after watching 'Beneficial Evil,' I want to visit! -When is part two coming out? Netflix, do your job! -I'm searching for Korean dramas on Netflix because of 'Beneficial Evil,' but I can't find anything as good. -The action is worth watching, but the story is meh. I don't understand why it's such a hot topic? -I also can't focus. -For the first time, I'm interested in a Korean actor... Kang Woojin is so cool. It was like a global phenomenon. \\"Worldwide frenzy over 'Beneficial Evil,' Kang Woojin's global recognition explodes exponentially!\\" And then, on the 14th, a day later. \\"[Issue Pick] Korean drama 'Beneficial Evil' continues to hold the number one spot in the US and worldwide, achieving Korea's first-ever number one spot in the world!\\" \\"'Beneficial Evil' really made a splash... Climbing to number one on Netflix worldwide!\\" The first overall ranking for 'Beneficial Evil' was released. \\"Kang Woojin has captivated the world, 'Beneficial Evil' on Netflix number one worldwide... Korean drama's highest record\\" \\"[Comprehensive] 'Beneficial Evil,' number one in Korea, the US, Japan, and 22 other countries, with the remaining 50 countries in second place or the top ranks... 'Beneficial Evil' achieves a world number one triumph\\" \\"Released just about ten days ago, 'Beneficial Evil' climbs to world number one... If this momentum continues, an unprecedented result!\\" It was the first time a Korean drama had achieved the number one spot worldwide. At this moment, in LA, a bit away from the city center. A fairly large two-story building was visible. Mostly grey with transparent windows all around. A large garden with many trees surrounded the building. While not particularly surprising in size for vast LA, there was definitely something eye-catching. It was a large statue in front of the building. This statue, over three times the size of a person, depicted a winged woman holding a globe and looking up at the sky. At first glance, it resembled a trophy. In fact, the statue was indeed a trophy. It was just a greatly enlarged version of the original trophy size. The trophy of a winged woman holding a globe and looking up at the sky was immensely famous not only in the US but also worldwide. In the film industry, it's the 'Academy Award,' in theater and musicals, it's the 'Tony Award.' And in broadcasting, it's the 'Primetime Emmy Award.' Commonly known as the 'Emmy Award,' this female statue was the trophy for the 'Emmy Award.' The 'Emmy Award' is considered the 'Academy Award' of the broadcasting industry and is the most prestigious global award ceremony in broadcasting. Therefore, it was natural for the world's broadcasting industry to vie for a spot in this ceremony. The 'Emmy Award' includes not only terrestrial broadcasters but also cable and various OTT platforms. Like Cannes, it is divided into several sections, with the main one being the 'Primetime Emmy Award,' commonly referred to as the 'Emmy Award.' Of course, there is also a Best Actor award. Anyway, the reason why the trophy statue of the 'Emmy Award' was proudly erected in front of this building was simple. This was the place that hosted the 'Emmy Award.' Called the Television Academy of Arts & Sciences (ATAS), it holds the 'Primetime Emmy Award' every year. Interestingly, in one of the meeting rooms of this building, where various foreigners of different ages had gathered... \\"'Beneficial Evil,' huh? It has a unique momentum.\\" They were discussing 'Beneficial Evil,' a Korean work. \\"I agree, it hit number one in the US on Netflix just one day after its release. It's the first time for a Korean work.\\" \\"And that's not the end of it, right now it has achieved number one in over 20 countries, and the remaining 50 countries are also in second place or the top ranks.\\" \\"It's a trend that has surpassed the usual flow. It's updating its first-time titles every day.\\" What can I say, the conversation among the dozens gathered was quite serious. \\"Currently, it's number one on Netflix worldwide. There aren't many American dramas with that record, right?\\" \\"We need an accurate survey, but I think it's probably countable on one hand.\\" \\"The work itself is interesting and well-made, the direction is good, and especially the action scenes stand out.\\" \\"Kang Woojin—definitely has the potential to cause a storm. Following Cannes, he's involved in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' and 'Beast and Beauty'... and now 'Beneficial Evil' has exploded worldwide. Is this even possible?\\" \\"It's possible because it's happening in reality.\\" \\"Anyway, it's clear that this 'Beneficial Evil' and Kang Woojin have created a miracle.\\" \\"It's an ongoing miracle of Kang Woojin.\\" By the way, the 'Primetime Emmy Award' collects candidate works from April of the previous year to April of the current year, goes through numerous voting and processes by many jury members, and then is held grandly in August. It's February now, so it's the time to collect works that will be candidates. At that moment, a foreigner with a thick mustache spoke. \\"'Beneficial Evil'—should we nominate it as a candidate work?\\" A foreigner with a protruding belly crossed his arms and replied. \\"We might need to observe a little longer.

Give me a list of topics that I need to teach to meet the questions you need to be able to explain and the additional info you can be required to know and will require the use of the skills mentioned below. Please only refer to what is explicitly stated and don’t infer any other info. Example of the level of detail I’m looking for:(keep in mind this is only an example not necessarily what is required to learn): Review of periodic table (atomic number, mass number), average atomic mass using mass spec data; Calculate molar mass, moles, atoms, formula units of elements and compounds; Empirical and molecular formula calculations; Analyze composition of mixtures; PES and electron configuration for atoms and ions; periodic table organization, explain periodic trends using Coulomb’s law and relationship to reactivity Questions you need to be able to explain: Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes. Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. Additional info you can be required to know: One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. Skills you will be required to use: Identify an appropriate theory, definition, or mathematical relationship to solve a problem. Identify information presented graphically to solve a problem. Identify a testable scientific question based on an observation, data, or a model.

Explain chemical properties or phenomena (e.g., of atoms or molecules) using given chemical theories, models, and representations. Explain the connection between particulate level and macroscopic properties of a substance using models and representations.","output":"To meet the requirements of the questions, additional information provided, and the necessary skills, you will need to teach the following topics in your curriculum: 1.

No additional modifiers or functions associated with RBAC are present in the contract .","output":"The concerns mentioned in the report are about the contract's owner privileges and the simplicity of the access control mechanism in use. Access control is a key security component in smart contract design, and the report notes that this contract uses a relatively simple form of it, relying solely on an \\"owner\\" address to manage sensitive functions. Let's address the concerns: # 1. Basic Access Control The functions \`changeOwner\`, \`changeManager\`, and \`setBaseURI\` simply check if \`msg.sender\` is the \`owner\` of the contract before proceeding with the function's logic. These functions lack complex access controls and rely on a single address for authorization. # 2. Lack of Multi-Signature or Advanced Access Control The report suggests that the contract does not incorporate sophisticated systems like multi-signature wallets or role-based access control (RBAC), which might provide an added layer of security by requiring multiple confirmations or role checks before executing critical functions. # 3. Potential vulnerabilities A simple owner check raises potential security concerns such as a single point of failure; if the owner's private key is compromised, the attacker has complete control over the contract's sensitive functionalities. However, whether or not this is a \\"vulnerability\\" depends on the context and the intended use case of the contract. For some applications, a simple ownership model might be sufficient, while for others, more stringent access controls might be required. # Evidence and Analysis Analyzing the provided code snippets from the owner-updating functions (\`changeOwner\`, \`changeManager\`) and the base URI updating function (\`setBaseURI\`), it's evident that they follow the same pattern of access control — they only allow the current \`owner\` to perform sensitive operations: \`\`\`solidity if (msg.sender != owner) { revert OwnerOnly(msg.sender, owner); } \`\`\` There is no implementation of a multi-signature mechanism or RBAC in these snippets. # Why might the contract lack advanced access control? There could be multiple reasons why the contract only uses simple owner checks: - Simplicity: For some smart contracts, particularly in the early stages or if they're used in a relatively trustful environment, simple ownership might be considered secure enough. - Upgradability: The contract in question might be intended to be upgraded in the future to include more advanced access control mechanisms. - Design Choice: The contract owner might have specific reasons to prefer this form of access control that aren't apparent from the contract itself. # Conclusion Based on the evidence and the typical security best practices in smart contract development, the concern about the basic form of access control in lieu of more advanced systems seems valid. However, whether this constitutes a vulnerability is contingent on the contract's design intentions and operational context. For some scenarios, simple ownership might be a design choice rather than an oversight. Still, implementers should be aware of the associated risks and consider whether additional security measures would be appropriate for their use case."},{"instruction":"Bonjour Peux-tu me creer un script Python3 Flask qui copierait tous les fichier mp4 d'un repertoire vers une clé usb montée en \\"/media/usb\\".

I am deeply humbled and excited to be at this stage of the donation transfer. The anticipation of contributing to the fight against poverty with the support of the Dubai Royal home award fills me with a profound sense of purpose and responsibility. I have reviewed the instructions and am fully aware of the importance of confidentiality regarding the Ref No JJT0019058. This matter will not be discussed with anyone outside the necessary channels to protect the integrity and security of the Donation process. Be rest assured, your guidelines are being followed with the utmost diligence. As per your previous email, I am prepared to send the Approval Letter, Check, and the required Ref No to the BlueNile National Bank as suggested. However, before I proceed with sending these sensitive documents, I'd like to personally verify the email address provided to ensure the security of the transaction. We hear all too often about people falling victim to fraud, and I am keen to make sure everything is in order. In the meantime, could you kindly confirm the authenticity of Mr. Patrick D'Souza as the Finance Manager at BlueNile National Bank? I trust your words, of course, but as you understand, I do not want to take any risks when it comes to such a significant and generous donation. Perhaps the bank has a contact number I could use for further correspondence? This would greatly assist in facilitating a smooth and secure transaction. Additionally, as a proactive step, I have gone ahead and contacted my lawyer to oversee my financial decisions and to ensure that donations to the community are administered appropriately. They too are adamant about the confidentiality of this process, and it is pleasing to see our values align on this matter. Please advise on the next steps I should take in confirming the bank's contact details so I can proceed with the sending of the Approval Letter, Check, and Ref No as instructed. I am looking forward to your prompt guidance so we can progress with this charitable endeavor. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu [It's important to exercise caution when engaging with potential scammers and to never provide personal information or send money.

Напишите код","output":"Чтобы посчитать количество 6-значных чисел, содержащих ровно 3 различные цифры, мы можем использовать простую программу на Python. При этом, нужно учесть, что 6-значное число не может начинаться с цифры 0. Логика решения будет следующей: 1. Выбираем 3 различные цифры из 10 (от 0 до 9). 2. Определяем распределение этих цифр по 6 позициям. Существует ограниченное количество способов распределить 3 разных цифры на 6 позиций, например 2-2-2 (две каждой цифры), 1-1-4 (одна цифра повторяется 4 раза), 1-2-3 (одна цифра один раз, другая два раза, третья три раза) и так далее. 3. Учитываем, что число не может начинаться с 0, при переборе комбинаций. Вот пример кода на Python, который считает количество таких чисел: \`\`\`python from itertools import permutations def count_6_digit_numbers_with_3_unique_digits(): count = 0 for digit1 in range(1, 10): # Первая цифра не может быть 0 for digit2 in range(0, 10): for digit3 in range(0, 10): if digit1 != digit2 and digit1 != digit3 and digit2 != digit3: # Для комбинации 1-1-4 count += 6 * (5 if digit2 != 0 and digit3 != 0 else 4 if digit2 != 0 or digit3 != 0 else 3) # Для комбинации 1-2-3 count += 60 * (6 if digit2 != 0 and digit3 != 0 else 5 if digit2 != 0 or digit3 != 0 else 4) # Для комбинации 1-4-1 count += 6 * (5 if digit2 != 0 and digit3 != 0 else 4 if digit2 != 0 or digit3 != 0 else 3) # Для комбинации 2-2-2 if digit1 != 0 and digit2 != 0 and digit3 != 0: # Оба остальных числа должны быть не ноль count += 90 return count print(count_6_digit_numbers_with_3_unique_digits()) \`\`\` Этот код выдаст количество 6-значных чисел с тремя различными цифрами. Мы перечисляем все возможные комбинации трёх различных цифр для числа, а затем умножаем их количество на число перестановок этих цифр на шести позициях с учетом различных вариантов распределения (1-1-4, 1-2-3 и так далее). Обратите внимание, что в коде учитывается различное количество возможных начальных позиций в зависимости от того, является ли каждая из дополнительных цифр нулём или нет."},{"instruction":"napisz sam wynik Wartością wyrażenia (16 do potegi 2 razy 8 do potegi 3): (4 do potegi 5 razy 2 do potegi 6) jest liczba:","output":"Aby obliczyć wartość wyrażenia (16^2 * 8^3) / (4^5 * 2^6), możemy wykorzystać prawa potęgowania oraz fakt, że wszystkie te liczby to potęgi liczby 2. 16 = 2^4 8 = 2^3 4 = 2^2 Podstawiając te równości, otrzymujemy: (2^4^2 * 2^3^3) / (2^2^5 * 2^6) = (2^(4*2) * 2^(3*3)) / (2^(2*5) * 2^6) = (2^8 * 2^9) / (2^10 * 2^6) = 2^(8+9) / 2^(10+6) = 2^17 / 2^16 = 2^(17-16) = 2^1 = 2 Ostateczny wynik to liczba 2."},{"instruction":"Bonjour Peux-tu me creer un script Python3 Flask qui copierait tous les fichier mp4 d'un repertoire vers une clé usb montée en \\"/media/usb\\".

The plot of the light novella should be in the genres: music, idols, drama, school, romance. Yume stood backstage waiting for her entrance. She was completely confident in her victory in this competition. Yume walked up to Akari and declared that she was going to win. Akari and her group of high school idols had already performed and now it was Yume’s turn. Yume stepped forward onto the stage. The lights on the stage were almost extinguished and the audience in the auditorium fell silent. Yume knew that if she won, her father had promised to help her get into a prestigious music academy in Tokyo, and Yume was ready to win. Akari’s band scored pretty high with their performance. Yume started singing and suddenly the atmosphere in the hall changed. It was as if time had stopped. Yume’s vocals were simply marvelous and the audience’s eyes were fixed on her flawless performance. Akari watched Yume with admiration. When Yume finished her performance, the hall was filled with silence. Please add detailed dialogs. Please add sensory descriptions.","output":"Chapter 14: Melody of the Heart Yume's heart pulsed like a metronome, steady and full of anticipation as she lingered in the dimly-lit wings of the auditorium. Her glittering costume, a cascade of shimmering sequins and feathers, reflected the sparse light that managed to reach her, casting little stars onto the heavy curtain beside her. The scent of stale makeup and the lingering must of wood teased her senses, unmistakably the backstage signature. Akari, her rival and a burgeoning idol in her own right, was nearby, surrounded by her bandmates. Their group, Star Harmony, had just finished their set, a medley of pop and electronic beats that had the audience chanting for an encore. Yume straightened her posture, the fabric of her dress rustling softly, as she confronted Akari. \\"Tonight is my night, Akari,\\" Yume declared, her voice laced with determination. \\"I hope you're ready to take second place.\\" Akari turned, the gentle sway of her own costume—a dress that mirrored the night sky, dotted with rhinestones like distant stars—was spellbinding. Her eyes, a warm hazel, held a glint of friendly competition as she smiled at Yume. \\"Yume-chan, the stage is like a battlefield,\\" she responded, her tone playful yet sincere. \\"But no matter who emerges victorious, the true winner is the music that touches the hearts of our audience. Good luck out there.\\" Yume knitted her brows for a moment before her expression softened. \\"You're right, as always. Star Harmony was brilliant tonight. But I must win this, not just for myself, but for my father and for my dreams to come true.\\" Akari nodded, understanding the gravity behind Yume's words. \\"Then give them a show that will resonate within their souls, Yume-chan.\\" With the final call for her to take the stage, Yume took a deep breath, the thick scent of the stage smoke momentarily suffocating before she embraced it as part of the performance ritual. She could feel the eyes of the audience on the other side of the curtain, their collective breaths in sync with her own rising adrenaline. As she stepped onto the stage, a hushed awe blanketed the crowd. The glimmering lights lowered, casting Yume in a pool of soft white spotlight that made her silhouette glow ethereal. The auditorium fell silent, so quiet that she could hear the soft buzzing of the overhead stage lights. Yume closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and as the first delicate piano note cascaded into the silence, her lips parted, and her song began to weave into the air. Her voice, clear and resonant, effortlessly climbed octave after octave, enveloping the audience in a tender embrace. The subtle hum of the bass gently guided the melody while the rhythmic tapping of the drums mimicked the gentle beating of every heart in the room. And as Yume sang, the atmosphere tangibly shifted, as if the entire auditorium had been transported to a serene, otherworldly garden blooming with her notes. The fragrance of her perfume, a subtle blend of jasmine and cherry blossom, seemed to drift from the stage, merging with the music to complete the sensory experience. The spellbinding performance left the audience enraptured, each verse a confessional, each chorus a declaration of Yume's passion and dreams. Akari, standing side stage, watched with an immense respect filling her chest. Even amidst the competitive fire that kindled between them, Akari could not deny the profound talent Yume possessed. As the final note lingered in the charged air, Yume opened her eyes, gazing out into the sea of faces. The silence that followed was profound, a collective breath held in awe before it shattered into an explosion of applause and cheers. She had captured them, heart and soul, with the power of her music. Yume bowed deeply, a single tear trailing down her cheek, gleaming in the light like a wayward diamond. She had given her all, bared her soul upon the stage, and now it was up to the verdict of the silent judges and the cacophony of the crowd to seal her fate. But in her heart, the victory was already hers, for she had sung the truth of her heart, and that was a melody that would resonate forever."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},B={key:1};function N(o,e,c,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),i("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=i("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(i("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),i("div",q,[(t(!0),a(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(t(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),a("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
