John liked to study insects that never eat, while  Mary decided to study insects that are very healthy eaters.  Which person studied less about moths?  Hint: A few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat. That’s because their lives are over in just a few hours or days. Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth. A locust eats its own weight in plants every day. Just imagine eating your own weight in food every day. You probably couldn't. You would most likely get very sick even if you tried. The answer is:","output":"To find out which person studied less about moths, we need to identify which category moths belong to: insects that never eat or insects that are very healthy eaters.  Step 1: Analyze the hint The hint mentions that a few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat. This suggests that there are certain moths which do not eat.  Step 2: Compare it with healthy eater insects The hint also gives us examples of insects that are very healthy eaters, such as silkworms and locusts. It does not mention moths in this category.  Step 3: Determine who studied less about moths Since some moths belong to the category of insects that never eat, and no moths are mentioned in the healthy eater category, it's likely that Mary studied less about moths, as her focus was on insects that are very healthy eaters.

Some of the men are put into a fashion show, and Johnny Upton (Allan Nicholls) has had it: he warns McGrath that he plans to flash the audience so they won't have to do such degrading things again. Joe blows him off to make a phone call to locate Reg and Ned, who should be at the show as well, but has to stop the call short when cries of shock and disgust greet Johnny when he takes the runway.Ned and Reg pass the mill, which Ned tells him is going to close and lay off 10,000 workers.

Grammar: The sentence uses appropriate parts of speech and adheres to grammatical rules. The subject \\"some gifts\\" is a plural noun phrase, and the use of the quantifier \\"some\\" is appropriate for countable nouns like \\"gifts.\\" The verb \\"get used\\" is a passive construction, which is often used to emphasize the action (usage of gifts) rather than the doer. The object \\"a dozen or so times a year\\" is an adverbial phrase that provides information about the frequency of using the gifts, making the sentence grammatically correct. 3. Semantics: The sentence conveys a clear meaning: there are certain gifts that people use around twelve times a year. The use of the phrase \\"a dozen or so times\\" gives the reader a general idea of the frequency without being too specific, which is acceptable as it reflects the intended meaning.

Write an article based on this summary: At least two people have been killed as Typhoon Conson battered China's southern island of Hainan.","output":"Title: Typhoon Conson Leaves Destruction In Its Wake: Two People Dead on China's Hainan Island Introduction Typhoon Conson, the recent natural disaster to hit China, brought heavy rainfall, strong winds, and significant damage to the southern island of Hainan. The destructive storm resulted in at least two casualties, putting locals in a state of shock and distress. As emergency response teams and volunteers attempt to address the devastation left by Typhoon Conson, the government and global community are contemplating strategies to support those affected. Background Typhoon Conson, known as the fifth typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, was first identified on September 7 in the western North Pacific. The typhoon intensified while moving northwest, and it subsequently made landfall on the southern province of Hainan on September 11. Typhoons are no strangers to this region, with the Philippines also experiencing a recent bout of heavy rains and flooding due to Conson just days before the storm reached China. Impact on Hainan Island As Typhoon Conson tore through Hainan Island, it brought torrential rain and powerful winds, reaching speeds of up to 130 kph (80 mph), which wreaked havoc on local communities. In addition to claiming two lives, the storm caused widespread flooding, damage to infrastructure, and widespread power outages. It also forced the evacuation of thousands of residents, who sought refuge in local shelters and nearby hotels. Rescue and recovery efforts have been hindered by the extreme weather conditions, with many roads left submerged or obstructed by debris from the storm. Communication lines have also been severely impacted, with reports of cell tower outages and damage to internet cables, making it difficult for rescuers to coordinate and reach those in need. The agricultural sector suffered significant losses, with numerous fields and plantations completely wiped out by the typhoon. This comes as a devastating blow to farmers, who were already grappling with financial hardships and a dwindling food supply due to previous natural disasters and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. International Support and Relief Efforts In an effort to support the affected communities in Hainan, the Chinese government has initiated various relief measures. These include deploying emergency response teams, providing food and essential supplies to displaced residents, and allocating funds for reconstruction and rehabilitation. Moreover, international organizations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations are lending their support. They are using their resources to ensure that medical supplies can reach impacted areas, and to contribute financial assistance for rebuilding efforts. The global community has sent condolences and messages of solidarity, underlining the importance of collaboration to tackle the challenges posed by natural disasters like Typhoon Conson. Looking Ahead As Hainan Island and the affected communities continue to recover from the devastation of Typhoon Conson, it is necessary to reflect on the long-term impact of this disaster and the subsequent implications on the region's environmental and economic sustainability. Addressing the root causes of typhoon vulnerability, such as climate change, coastal development, and disaster preparedness and management, will be essential in mitigating future risks and minimizing casualty rates. In light of Typhoon Conson, it is crucial that both the Chinese government and the global community continue their efforts to support the recovery process and enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities to natural disasters. By fostering a culture of preparedness, cooperation, and adaptation, we can minimize the negative outcomes of typhoons and other natural disasters and work towards a safer, more sustainable future for all."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hanry is deeply in love with Beatrix Emery, the daughter of Sir Charles Emery, who likes Henry, but is concerned over his radical ideas and open display of affection for Bea.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  I am facing a new situation today: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which team didn't observe higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the Canadian team did not observe higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. This is because they didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole, while the Russian research team was studying the loss of ozone in Antarctica, where the ozone hole is known to exist. The ozone hole over Antarctica is responsible for higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, leading to negative impacts on human health, the nitrogen cycle, and marine life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Some trees can survive a long time without water. Think of trees that grow in the desert. But other trees may need more moisture  than they can get from rainfall or from the air . Trees and other plants can look thirsty. Leaves can become weak and hang downward. They can also turn yellow. Yellowing can be a sign of too much water. But it can also be a warning sign of too little water. With a newly planted tree, the roots have not yet spread out from the root ball. The root ball can become dry faster than the dirt around it. So put water on the area of the root ball and the surrounding soil until the roots become established. Once a tree is well established, water deeply instead of watering often. The amount of water needed depends on the tree and the soil. Clay  soils hold water for longer periods while sandy soil holds less water. During the hottest season, a deep watering may satisfy a tree for anywhere from ten days to four weeks. Ted Swiecki is a plant scientist . He says people should not water established trees at the base of the trunk . This can harm the tree. Too much water in the soil at the base of a tree can lead to the growth of fungi . If the area is too wet, harmful organisms have a better chance to invade the tree and cause disease. Mr. Swiecki says this is true especially in Mediterranean and semi-dry climates. Many trees in these climates have adapted to having a dry area near their base during the hottest season. He said, \\"Water displaces (,)air in the soil. And roots are aerobic ; they require oxygen for the soil to function properly. So if you keep the soil completely wet and there's no air there, then the roots are starving for oxygen.\\" Question: As to a well-established tree,   _  . Options: A: watering deeply matters more than watering often B: we should water them as often as possible C: its roots have not spread out from the root ball yet D: a deep watering satisfies it for at most ten days in cold weather A:","output":"As to a well-established tree, watering deeply matters more than watering often. This approach allows the tree to get the necessary moisture without causing harm to the roots or increasing the risk of diseases. It's also essential to consider the type of soil and the specific needs of the tree, as different trees and soils require different amounts of water. So, the correct answer is option A: watering deeply matters more than watering often."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Man is the most intelligent animal created by God because God has given him language which other animals do not have. Communication makes life extremely convenient and easy. Language plays a very important role in life as any emotion can be easily and effectively conveyed   through language to anyone. But all this is applicable and beneficial only to human beings. What about animals? How do they communicate with each other? We all know that animals do not have the ability to use language as a medium for communication. But they do have other means of conveying messages to other animals, of which use of body language is the most important one. The messages can be of many types like conveying food location, danger alarms, appreciation of good deeds like helping other animals in dangerous situations, etc. There are two main types of communication in animals: verbal   communication and non-verbal communication. Sound is one of the most common types of verbal communication in animals, and majority of the species use it as the medium to convey messages. Bats have to rely on sound waves to communicate. They mostly rest in the morning and become active at night to search for food and do other tasks. All the birds communicate through their chirping. Mammals generally make use of sounds to give calls to other members of their community. Whales are the perfect examples, which use sound waves for communication. They have a whale song, which they repeat after regular intervals. Facial Expressions This kind of communication is mostly found in dogs. When they are angry, they show their teeth and raise their ears. On the other hand, when they are frightened, they pull their ears behind and open their mouth. Also, in birds, when the parent bird brings food for the offspring, the begging expression can be observed on the offspring's face. Gestures and Body Movements This type of communication is common not only in animals, but in human beings too. All human beings, although they use language for communication, tend to use... What's the most important way for animals to convey messages? A) Use of body language. B) Use of sounds. C) Use of facial expressions. D) Use of dancing.","output":"To determine the most important way for animals to convey messages, let's analyze the options provided: A) Use of body language: Body language is a crucial communication method for many animals. It helps them express emotions, intentions, and social status. Different animals use their body parts, such as tails, ears, and postures, to communicate various messages. B) Use of sounds: Many animals, such as birds and mammals, use sounds as a primary method of communication. These sounds can be used to call out for help, signal danger, or share information about food and resources. C) Use of facial expressions: Facial expressions are also essential in animal communication, especially for animals like dogs and apes. They use facial expressions to demonstrate emotions and provide information to other members of their species. D) Use of dancing: Some animals, like bees, use specific movement patterns to communicate information to their group members. For example, honey bees use the \\"waggle dance\\" to share the location of a food source with their fellow bees. While all of these communication methods are essential and play a significant role in the animal kingdom, it is difficult to pinpoint one as the most important. It largely depends on the species and their specific needs. However, if we were to choose a method that is commonly observed across a diverse range of species, the use of sounds (Option B) seems to be an essential way for animals to convey messages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He takes us from Louisiana to San Francisco to Alaska to Russia and back to Alaska in a relatively short book. In doing all this traveling with his character, Jean Labarge, we do not get the typical Louis L'Amour descriptions. We do not get a good description of Sitka, Alaska or its inhabitants. We do not even get a good adventure. When Labarge's warehouse with his very valuable wheat is set ablaze by the bad guys, he does not even go after them. Instead, he sends his ship to Alaska on schedule while he heads overland, on a miraculously fast journey, to Oregon where a sufficient quantity of wheat just happens to be available. In my opinion, the whole story is too far-fetched with too many scenes and not enough of the kind of action and adventure Mr. L'Amour has always delivered. Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given product review, it appears that the reviewer's opinion is not entirely positive. The title \\"Too broad\\" could indicate the reader's dissatisfaction with the scope of the book and the author's choice to include numerous locations in a relatively short story. The reviewer points out that \\"Sitka\\" by Louis L'Amour deviates from the author's usual style, particularly in terms of detailed descriptions and thrilling adventure.  The reviewer provides several specific examples of their concerns, such as the lack of vivid portrayal of Sitka, Alaska, and its inhabitants. Another example is related to the protagonist's choice of action when his valuable wheat warehouse is attacked, which might have left the reader wanting a more exciting and heroic response. Instead, the protagonist, Jean Labarge, opts for a less adventurous approach by sending his ship to Alaska and embarking on an overland journey to Oregon. The reviewer finds this plot point far-fetched and unconvincing, ultimately dampening their appreciation for the story as a whole. In light of these criticisms, the general notion of the review leans towards a negative standpoint. The reviewer's disappointment with the story's lack of immersive action and adventure, combined with the thinly developed settings and character motivations, detracts from what they look for in a typical Louis L'Amour novel.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To evaluate the possible truth of both sentences, let's first break them down to understand their meanings more clearly. Sentence 1: \\"Arrested Lawrence? I gasped.\\"  This sentence implies that the speaker was surprised upon learning of Lawrence's arrest, hence the reaction of gasping. Sentence 2: \\"I did not gasp upon hearing of Lawrence's arrest.\\" On the other hand, this sentence states the opposite; the speaker claims not to have gasped upon hearing the same information about Lawrence's arrest. Given that these two sentences convey contradictory reactions to the same event, it would appear that if one sentence is true, the other must be false. In other words, it is not possible for both of these sentences to be true simultaneously. If sentence 1 is true, as the question assumes, then the speaker did gasp when learning about Lawrence's arrest. Thus, the second sentence must be false, because it directly contradicts the reaction implied in the first sentence.

Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.  Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. A:","output":"Era B would see a lower rate of weathering than era A.

News article: Former Detroit mayor facing extortion, bribery charges \\"The defendants used the power and authority of Kwame Kilpatrick's public offices to unjustly enrich not only themselves, but also their families and their associates, at the expense of taxpayers and donors,\\" she said. The charges include conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Kilpatrick is serving a prison sentence of up to five years for violating probation in a 2008 case against him. That case involved two state felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer attempting to serve a subpoena on one of his friends in that case. He previously was facing 19 federal counts of felony fraud and tax charges and was accused of using the Kilpatrick Civic Fund -- a tax-exempt fund meant to pay for voter education and boosting community activities -- for his own benefit, as well as that of his friends and family. The superceding 38-count, 89-page indictment announced Wednesday adds charges against Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick's attorney, James Thomas, said Kilpatrick denies the claims in the indictment. \\"The indictment is just an allegation,\\" he said. \\"I have confidence in our case.\\" He said he and his client take the indictment seriously. The Detroit Free Press newspaper quoted Thomas on Thursday as saying that Kilpatrick is innocent and will be vindicated at trial.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the specific category of drilling fluid that includes includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene?  Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels.  This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

Carl Dean Switzer (August 8, 1927 - January 21, 1959) was an American singer, child actor, breeder and guide. Switzer began his career as a child actor in the mid-1930s appearing in the Our Gang short subjects series as Alfalfa, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters. After leaving the series in 1940, Switzer struggled to find substantial roles owing to typecasting. As an adult, he appeared mainly in bit parts and B-movies. Switzer's tenure on Our Gang ended in 1940, when he was twelve. His first role after leaving the series was as co-star in the 1941 comedy Reg'lar Fellers. The next year, he had a supporting role in Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. Switzer continued to appear in films in various supporting roles, including in Johnny Doughboy (1942), Going My Way (1944), and The Great Mike (1944). Switzer had an uncredited role as Auggie in the 1943 film The Human Comedy. Switzer's last starring roles were in a brief series of imitation Bowery Boys movies. He reprised his \\"Alfalfa\\" character, complete with comically sour vocals, in PRC's Gas House Kids comedies in 1946 and 1947. By this time Switzer was downplaying his earlier Our Gang work. In his 1946 resume, he referred to the films generically as \\"M-G-M short product.\\"  Switzer had small parts in both the 1946 Christmas film It's a Wonderful Life as Mary Hatch's (Donna Reed) date at a high school dance in the film's beginning and again in the 1948 film On Our Merry Way as the mayor's son, a trumpet player in a fixed musical talent contest. In the 1954 musical film White Christmas, his photo was used to depict \\"Freckle-Faced Haynes,\\" an army buddy of lead characters Wallace and Davis (played by Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) who was also the brother of the female leads the Haynes Sisters (played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen).  In the 1950s, Switzer turned to television. Between 1952 and 1955, he made six appearances on The Roy Rogers Show. He also guest-starred in an episode of the American science fiction anthology series Science Fiction Theatre and The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. In 1953 and 1954, Switzer co-starred in three William A. Wellman-directed films: Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty, both starring John Wayne, and Track of the Cat, starring Robert Mitchum. In 1956, he co-starred in The Bowery Boys film Dig That Uranium followed by a bit part as a Hebrew slave in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. Switzer's final film role was in the film drama The Defiant Ones.  Besides acting, Switzer bred and trained hunting dogs and guided hunting expeditions. Among his notable clients were Roy Rogers and Dale Evans (Switzer's son's godparents), James Stewart, and Henry Fonda.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.  After reading the above, is \\"Almost 43\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How old was Prince Manuel when he died?\\"? OPT: A). no B). yes","output":"A). no Prince Manuel died in exile in England in 1932 and he ascended to the throne at the age of 19 in 1910. This therefore means that he was 41 years old at the time of his death, not \\"almost 43\\". Thus, the correct answer to the question \\"How old was Prince Manuel when he died?\\" is 'no'.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Les Miles ends losing streak and keeps coach's job at LSU Les Miles rode across the Tiger Stadium field on the shoulders of his players while fans chanted his name. It would have been quite a send-off, except LSU’s administration doesn’t want him going anywhere after all. Minutes after LSU closed out the regular season with a 19-7 victory over Texas A&M, athletic director Joe Alleva said Miles will remain the Tigers’ coach. The announcement capped more than a week of speculation that Miles was on the verge of losing his job after his first three-game losing streak in his 11 years at LSU. “I’m looking forward to working with Coach Miles as he leads this team to a bowl game and another great recruiting class,” Alleva said as Miles’ wife, Kathy, and their four children looked on. “Les and I have talked. We have talked about this program and we are committed together to working to win and compete at the highest level.” LSU’s administration had allowed speculation about Miles’ status to fester by refusing to comment on the matter last week, but Alleva stressed that he was only following his policy of waiting until after the season to comment on a coach’s future. Indeed, Miles said he did not know for sure whether he’d just coached his last game on the home sideline of Death Valley until after the game. He said LSU president F King Alexander informed him first, followed by Alleva. “We’re a talented football team. We seemed to undershoot our mark this year,” Miles said. “I agree with Joe. Winning championships is something Joe wants to work toward fully and I’m right with him. It’s not enough to win occasionally. You have to win all the time. I get that.” LSU players didn’t find out until word began circulating about Alleva’s announcement. Tigers senior right tackle Vadal Alexander said he found out when he got a text from his parents and just smiled. Victory over Texas A&M (8-4, 4-4) did not come easily for the Tigers (8-3, 5-3), who trailed until Derrius Guice’s 50-yard scoring run in the third quarter. Leonard Fournette ran for 159 yards and a touchdown. He finished the game owning LSU’s single-season rushing record at 1,741 yards, surpassing the mark of 1,686 yards set by Charles Alexander in 1977. “It has been hard, not just with [speculation about] coach Miles, but with us having lost the last three games,” Fournette said. “These last three weeks will help this team grow and help us grow in life. I can say this has been one of the longest three weeks in my life. It was hard for everybody.” Kyle Allen passed for 161 yards and one touchdown for the Aggies, but had a pass intercepted by Donte Jackson inside the final two minutes, all but sealing LSU’s victory. Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin said his team’s turnovers and problems protecting Allen tipped the game in LSU’s favor. “It is kind of hard when the quarterback can’t set his feet and move the ball down field,” Sumlin said. “LSU played very well on defense.” As the game ended, fans chanted, “Keep Les Miles! Keep Les Miles!” They got their wish. Throughout game day, Miles’ biggest fans made sure they were seen and heard. During the “Tiger Walk,” from the team buses to the stadium, Miles was greeted like a hero as he waved to the crowd, at times pausing and turning around as if to soak it all in. Many fans held up signs expressing support for the embattled coach, some urging LSU to give him at least one more season. Inside Death Valley before kickoff, the crowd roared when Miles was introduce during Senior Day ceremonies. The coach tipped his trademark baseball cap to acknowledge the crowd, raising the volume a little more. Miles overall record improved to 111-32. LSU could have had a nine-win regular season if not for lightning canceling the season opener against heavy underdog McNeese State. Yet, some of the very aspects of LSU’s game that have bothered Miles’ critics showed up again. There were a handful of pre-snap penalties and the passing game was largely ineffective. Brandon Harris was seven of 21 for 83 yards, no touchdowns and an interception. A number of his passes sailed over intended receivers or skipped off the grass short of their mark. Most of his receptions came on check downs to running backs, including a critical third-down swing pass to Fournette for a 17-yard gain that sustained the Tigers’ final scoring drive. It didn’t help that kicker Trent Domingue, who’d missed only one field goal all season coming in, missed three against the Aggies. When the Tigers finally produced a big play to take a 13-7 lead, it came on Guice’s long run. The Aggies, who led 7-6 at halftime, scored their lone TD on Allen’s eight-yard, third-down pass over the middle to Ricky Seals-Jones. The Aggies squandered a chance to widen their lead when Allen was sacked and stripped by Kendell Beckwith on the LSU 13, with the Tigers’ Devon Godchaux recovering. Summary:","output":"A football coach named Les Miles was almost going to lose his job because his team, LSU, had lost three games in a row. However, after they won a game against Texas A&M, the athletic director, Joe Alleva, decided that Les Miles could keep being the team's coach. There was a lot of talk about whether he would stay or not, but in the end, everyone was happy that he was staying to help the team win more games and find more great players.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album? ?  Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\".

Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave.

Nearly everything else  he  threw was just about perfect.  Hornibrook  threw four touchdown passes  three to Danny Davis  and No. 6 Wisconsin capped off the winningest season in school history by topping No. 11 Miami 34-24 in the Orange Bowl on Saturday night. \\"We were pretty relaxed \\"  Hornibrook  said. \\"We knew we had what it takes to win this game.\\" The Badgers dominated time of possession  holding the ball for nearly 40 minutes.  Hornibrook  completed 23 of 34 passes for 258 yards  going 20 for 25 in the final three quarters. Travis Homer and Deejay Dallas had rushing scores for Miami (10-3)  which lost on  its  home field for the first time in 2017.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Physiological Processes of Echinoderms Echinoderms have a unique system for gas exchange, nutrient circulation, and locomotion called the water vascular system. The system consists of a central ring canal and radial canals extending along each arm. Water circulates through these structures allowing for gas, nutrient, and waste exchange. A structure on top of the body, called the madreporite, regulates the amount of water in the water vascular system. “Tube feet,” which protrude through openings in the endoskeleton, may be expanded or contracted using the hydrostatic pressure in the system. The system allows for slow movement, but a great deal of power, as witnessed when the tube feet latch on to opposite halves of a bivalve mollusk, like a clam, and slowly, but surely pull the shells apart, exposing the flesh within.

Article: The researchers, led by Hwang Woo-suk, insist they cloned an Afghan hound, only to help investigate   human disease, including the possibility of cloning stem cells   for treatment purposes.  But others immediately renewed calls for a global ban on human reproductive cloning before the technology moves any farther.  \\"Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any species of mammals, including humans,\\" said Ian Wilmut, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh who produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, from an adult cell nearly a decade ago.  Researchers have since cloned cats, goats, cows, mice, pigs, rabbits, horses, deer, mules and gaur, a large wild ox of Southeast Asia. So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed.  Uncertainties about the health and life span   of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis.  Wilmut and others  _ Hwang's achievement, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. But they said politicians and scientists must face the larger issue -- how to go on with the research without crossing the moral boundary of copying human life in the lab. \\"The ability to use the technology is hopeful,\\" said Robert Schenken, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \\"However, the paper also points out that in dogs as in most species, cloning for reproductive purposes is unsafe.\\"  The cloned puppy was the lone success from more than 100 dogs implanted  with more than 1,000 cloned embryos.  In a news conference in Seoul, the cloning team also condemned the reproductive cloning of humans as \\"unsafe and inefficient.\\" Human reproductive cloning already is banned in South Korea.

The original sentence only provides information about the woman's appearance, the fact that she is holding sunglasses, and that she has food in her possession. There is no mention of what type of food she is holding or where it has been sourced from. To better understand this, let's break down the details of both sentences: 1. \\"An unhappy looking woman is holding a pair of sunglasses and food.\\"     - We gather that the woman appears unhappy.     - The woman is holding two items: sunglasses and food.     - There is no specific description or identification of the type of food mentioned. 2. \\"The woman just ordered a Big Mac.\\"     - This statement suggests that the woman recently placed an order for a Big Mac.     - A Big Mac is a type of fast food burger from McDonald's.     - Placing an order for something implies that it is either in the process of being prepared or has been prepared and is awaiting collection or delivery.

Information:  - Mexican muralism was the promotion of mural painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post Mexican Revolution government. It was headed by the big three painters, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement.  - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991.  - Leon Trotsky (; born Lev Davidovich Bronstein;  21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army.  - Lázaro Cárdenas del Río (May 21, 1895  October 19, 1970) was a general in the Mexican Revolution and a statesman who served as President of Mexico between 1934 and 1940. He is best known for nationalization of the oil industry in 1938 and the creation of Pemex, the government oil company.  - The Mexican Communist Party (PCM) was a communist party in Mexico. It was founded in 1911 as the Socialist Workers' Party (PSO) by Manabendra Nath Roy, a left-wing Indian Bengali intellectual. The PSO changed its name to the Mexican Communist Party in November 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. It was outlawed in 1925 and remained illegal until 1935, during the presidency of the leftist Lázaro Cárdenas. The PCM later lost its registration in 1946 because it did not meet the new requirements of at least 30,000 registered members in at least 21 of Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District. It is not clear whether the party was unable to recruit enough members or whether, fearing repression, it refused to turn membership rolls over to the Secretary of the Interior, then in charge of elections.  - David Alfaro Siqueiros ( born José de Jesús Alfaro Siqueiros , December 29 , 1896 , in Chihuahua - January 6 , 1974 , in Cuernavaca , Morelos ) was a Mexican social realist painter , better known for his large murals in fresco . Along with Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco , he established \`\` Mexican Muralism . '' He was a Marxist - Leninist in support of Stalin and a member of the Mexican Communist Party who participated in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky in May 1940 . His surname would normally be Alfaro by Spanish naming customs ; like Picasso ( Pablo Ruiz y Picasso ) and Lorca ( Federico García Lorca ) , Siqueiros used his mother 's surname . It was long believed that he was born in Camargo in Chihuahua state , but in 2003 it was proven that he had actually been born in the city of Chihuahua , but grew up in Irapuato , Guanajuato , at least from the age of six . The discovery of his birth certificate in 2003 by a Mexican art curator was announced the following year by art critic Raquel Tibol , who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros . Siqueiros changed his given name to \`\` David '' after his first wife called him by it in allusion to Michelangelo 's David . Another factual confusion is the year of his birth : he was born in 1896 , but many sources state 1898 or 1899 .  - The Mexican Revolution was a major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a \\"genuinely national revolution.\\" Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency.

He continued singing gospel in church, performing solos as a child while his mother sang in the local choir. While at Huffman High School, he played football for which he received a scholarship to Alabama A&M University. Studdard's third album, The Return was released in October 2006; it goes back to his R&B roots, but is different from his previous efforts. Studdard collaborated with the artist Ne-Yo on this album, along with a variety of producers. The single \\"Change Me\\" was released ahead of the album. The Return sold 71,000 copies in its first week to open at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart, but sales declined rapidly after that, not approaching those of his earlier albums. However, Studdard did have good success on the Urban Contemporary chart with \\"Change Me\\" (which reached number one) and its successor \\"Make Ya Feel Beautiful\\". Studdard continued to tour, saying he would play a variety of music: \\"Coming out to my show is like coming to my house. I'll play the songs I love. It's like a party. For me, a party has all different types of music happening.\\"  Studdard appeared on the finale of American Idol season 6 in May 2007.

Have fun learning and realize that mastering a skill takes time. Don't give up. Approach your coach about the issue, or try breaking from the rut by attending an ice skating seminar, for example. Families will need to balance schedules and overcome obstacles together. Have discussions with your family and ask how supportive they will be if you choose this path. Whether you make it to the Olympics or not - and whether you earn a medal or not - you will benefit from learning great life lessons such as strength. If you enjoy skating and fall short of that ultimate goal, congratulate yourself on the benchmarks you did achieve! Figure skating at the highest levels requires a huge amount of dedication at a very young age. You will need support from family, friends, coaches, and possibly a professional counselor.

In order to determine the best option to end the sentence, we look for a plausible reason why Sarah could not do the same. Option 1 provides a reason, suggesting that Samantha's success is due to her being good at handling animals, which implies that Sarah does not share this same capability. Option 2 doesn't fit the context because it indicates that Sarah is also good at handling animals. In this case, there would be no apparent reason for her to lack a similar success as Samantha.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information:  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - Ligne claire (French for \\"clear line\\") is a style of drawing pioneered by Hergé, the Belgian creator of \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". It uses clear strong lines all of the same width and no hatching, while contrast is downplayed as well. Cast shadows are often illuminate. Additionally, the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background. All these elements together can result in giving strips drawn this way a flat aspect. The name was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977.  - The Adventures of Tintin is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Hergé's birth in 1907, \\"Tintin\\" had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Thorgal is a Belgian fantasy comic book series by the Belgian writer Jean Van Hamme and the Polish graphic artist Grzegorz Rosiski. It combines several themes and legends, ranging from Norse mythology and Atlantean fantasy to science fiction, and such genres as dark drama, horror and adventure stories.  - European comics are comics produced in Europe. The \\"comic album\\" is a very common printed medium. The typical \\"album\\" is printed in large format, generally with high quality paper and colouring, roughly A4-sized, approx. 21x30 centimetres (8.4x11.6 in), has around 4060 pages, but examples with more than 100 pages are common. While sometimes referred to as graphic novels, this term is rarely used in Europe, and is not always applicable as albums often consist of separate short stories, placing them somewhere halfway between a comic book and a graphic novel. The European comic genres vary from the humorous adventure vein, such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" and \\"Asterix\\", to more adult subjects like \\"Tex Willer\\" and \\"Thorgal\\".  - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life.  - Tex Willer is the main fictional character of the Italian comics series \\"Tex\\", created by writer Gian Luigi Bonelli and illustrator Aurelio Galleppini, and first published in Italy on 30 September 1948. It is among the most popular characters of Italian comics, with translations to numerous languages all around the world. The fan base in Brazil is especially large, but it is very popular also in Finland, Norway, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, France, Tamil Nadu, Serbia and Spain. The \\"Tex Willer\\" series is an Italian-made interpretation of the American Old West, inspired by the classical characters and stories of old American Western movies.  - Wallonia (, , Dutch: \\"Wallonië\\" ) is a region of Belgium. Wallonia is primarily French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of the territory of Belgium, and a third of its population. Unlike Flanders, the Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium which is the political entity that is responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education. The German-speaking minority in the east forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - Franco-Belgian comics are comics that are created for a Belgian and French audience. These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books, where they are known as \\"BD\\"s, an abbreviation of \\"bandes dessinées\\" (literally \\"drawn strips\\") in French and \\"stripverhalen\\" (literally \\"strip stories\\") or simply \\"strips\\" in Dutch. Flemish Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by Francophone comics, yet have a distinctly different style, both in art as well as in spirit.   - Edgard Félix Pierre Jacobs ( 30 March 1904 -- 20 February 1987 ) , better known under his pen name Edgar P. Jacobs , was a Belgian comic book creator ( writer and artist ) , born in Brussels , Belgium . He was one of the founding fathers of the European comics movement , through his collaborations with Hergé and the graphic novel series that made him famous , Blake and Mortimer .  - Georges Prosper Remi (22 May 1907  3 March 1983), known by the pen name Hergé, was a Belgian cartoonist. He is best known for creating \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\", the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, \\"Quick & Flupke\\" (193040) and \\"The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko\\" (193657). His works were executed in his distinct \\"ligne claire\\" drawing style.  - Belgian comics are a distinct subgroup in the comics history, and played a major role in the development of European comics, alongside France with whom they share a long common history. While the comics in the two major language groups and regions of Belgium (Flanders with the Dutch language and Wallonia with French) each have clearly distinct characteristics, they are constantly influencing one another, and meeting each other in Brussels and in the bilingual publication tradition of the major editors. As one of the few arts where Belgium has had an international and enduring impact in the 20th century, comics are known to be \\"an integral part of Belgian culture\\".  - A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging.  - Asterix or The Adventures of Asterix (or \\"Astérix le Gaulois\\") is a series of French comics. The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Pilote\\" on 29 October 1959. It was written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette. As of 2015, 36 volumes have been released.  - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium.  - A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \\"novel\\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \\"graphic novel\\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is used for comics periodicals.  - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - Blake and Mortimer is a Belgian comics series created by the Belgian writer and comics artist Edgar P. Jacobs. It was one of the first series to appear in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Tintin\\" in 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by Les Editions du Lombard.  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to Fuller's Brewery in 2014.  It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners. The Lamb and Flag in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper's Arms – the name changing to Lamb & Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname \\"Bucket of Blood\\".

Article: IMAGINE if, to collect your salary each month, you had to walk to the nearest town, perhaps tens of miles away, to gather in a school or a football court or a church. There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically. Therefore, most Congolese bankers hope that the new system will promote the... Question: How did government employees use to earn a living? Answer:","output":"Government employees used to earn a living by exploiting their positions for personal gain, as they were not paid salaries. They were expected to use their job roles to make a living, and positions like accountants, who were responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces for employee payment, were highly prized."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple yet popular game played worldwide and is often used as a decision-making tool or a fun pastime between friends. The game is played by two people who simultaneously choose one of the three available options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules: - Rock beats Scissors - Scissors beat Paper - Paper beats Rock To form a rock, follow these steps: 1. Position yourself in front of your opponent: Stand or sit facing your opponent so that both of you can clearly see each other's hand gestures. 2. Prepare for the countdown: The game usually begins with a verbal countdown, generally in the form of saying \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\\" out loud or counting to three. 3. Create a fist: As the countdown begins, clench your hand into a fist. Ensure that your fingers are curled towards the palm with your thumb resting across your first or second fingers. This gesture represents a rock. 4. Synchronize the gesture with the countdown: As you and your opponent say \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\\" or count to three, both of you should simultaneously make your hand gestures for rock, paper, or scissors at the same time. This is typically done by swinging your hand downward and then displaying your chosen gesture when the countdown reaches its end. 5. Determine the winner: After both you and your opponent have made your gestures, compare them to see which hand gesture prevails according to the game's rules. In this case, if your opponent has formed a scissors gesture, your rock gesture wins. If they formed a paper gesture, you lose. If both of you formed rock gestures, the round results in a tie, and you can play again. Remember that the key to a successful rock gesture in Rock, Paper, Scissors is to maintain a properly clenched fist and synchronize the gesture with the countdown to ensure fair play. As you become comfortable forming the rock gesture, you can further develop your game strategy by observing your opponent's patterns and tendencies in order to predict and counter their moves. This will enhance your chances of winning and allow you to enjoy the game even more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Since Jordan found and returned Jan's wallet, Jan has a good reason to feel grateful towards Jordan. c) angry at Jordan: Anger typically arises from feelings of being wronged or upset about a situation.

Please answer the following question: Here's a logic test: Mars has much weaker gravity than Jupiter because it (A) has more mass (B) has less mass  Choose the answer between \\"Mars\\" and \\"Jupiter\\". Answer:","output":"Jupiter To address the logic test provided in the question, it is crucial to understand the factors that contribute to the strength of a planet's gravitational pull. Primarily, the force of gravity is determined by two factors: the mass of the celestial body (planet) and the distance between the center of the body and the object experiencing the force. In this context, consider the planets Mars and Jupiter. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system and comparatively smaller in size. It has a mass of approximately 6.42 x 10^23 kg, which is only about 0.107 times that of Earth. The weaker gravity on Mars, roughly 62.5% less than that of Earth, can be attributed directly to its lesser mass. Jupiter, on the other hand, is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun. Its mass is around 1.898 x 10^27 kg, making it about 317.8 times the mass of Earth. As a result of this enormous mass, Jupiter has a much stronger gravitational pull than Mars. Comparing the two options given in the question (A) Mars has more mass and (B) Mars has less mass, option (B) is the correct answer since Mars has less mass than Jupiter. Therefore, the strength of the gravitational pull on Mars is much weaker compared to that of Jupiter.

Which person studied less about sediments lying on top of the subducting plate?  Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

It is important to agree on a length of time. If the distance depends on a circumstance with no certain end date, your reunion may keep getting pushed off. Make sure that you discuss the financial aspects of maintaining your relationship with your partner as well. Being in a long distance relationship can be expensive, especially if you travel often to see your partner.   If your partner is waiting for a controlling parent to \\"back off,\\" that means neither of you have any control over the date. Similarly, if you are waiting for a job to open up in your partner's city, you may be stuck waiting with no date in sight. To avoid this, agree on a date by which you will either move (with or without the job) or break up. For instance, you might say \\"I'll move to your city as soon as I find a job there. However, if I haven't found one in the next six months, I'll just move and take my chances.\\" However, make sure that you have a conversation about finances before doing something like this to make sure that one partner is able to support the other as they look for a job.

You should both feel comfortable with the amount of texting, calling, emailing, and visiting you do. Ask your partner if they feel you're at the right level, and ask yourself how you feel as well.  If you find that one of you is feeling neglected or inundated, agree on a different schedule together. If it feels like only one of you is willing to compromise, your relationship might not be working. You should still be able to hang out with friends, visit family, go to parties, and have time to yourself. If you feel like your long distance relationship is making it impossible for you to have a social life where you are, you need to draw some boundaries.  Tell your partner you can't visit them as frequently. Explain that you are feeling lonely from never making any friends where you are. Explain to your partner that you will schedule a certain amount of time to talk to them, but that you can't be on call constantly. If your partner freaks out or refuses, your relationship might not be working. Do you know the terms of your relationship? Does your partner? Ask yourself what you expect, then make this clear to your partner and ask what they expect as well.  For instance, if you believe that you and your partner are monogamous, in love, and heading toward living together in the next few years, tell your partner! Similarly, if you believe you and your partner are in an open relationship, you'll need to define those terms as well. Being distant means communicating more, not less, so make an effort to get on the same page. If your partner wants to \\"keep it loose,\\" that means they aren't willing to be open with you about their expectations. That's a bad sign. Summary:","output":"In a long-distance relationship, it is crucial for both partners to communicate openly and establish clear expectations. This includes agreeing on the duration of the long-distance phase, understanding the financial implications, and ensuring that both partners' social and emotional needs are met. Effective communication also entails discussing the terms of the relationship, such as commitments to monogamy or openness. To maintain a healthy long-distance relationship, both individuals need to be on the same page and willing to compromise and adjust to each other's needs. If one partner exhibits a reluctance to openly discuss expectations or make necessary adjustments, it may be a sign that the relationship is not functioning well."},{"instruction":"Possible answers: a.

Texas home builder Dan Phillips transforms trash into artful treasures, creating beautiful floors with wood pieces, kitchen counters from ivory -colored bones and roofs out of license plates  . The fantastic houses which spring from his imagination are made almost entirely of materials which would otherwise have ended up in a garbage area. \\" People have been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years; using whatever is available to build shelter, \\" Phillips said.\\"If you think about carefully what could be used, then building materials are everywhere. The thirteen homes he has built so far would fit better in an art museum than the residential streets of Huntsville, a conservative town of about 35 ,000 people. Living in these houses is a bit like living in a roadside attraction.\\"Almost every day, somebody knocks on the door and says ' Is there any way that we could see?' \\"said Edie Wells, an artist who rents a room in the Bone House.Her home features a stairway made of bones, floors covered in wine corks   and beer bottle caps.Wells said visitors are most impressed when they see a bathroom with its walls, floor and ceiling entirely covered with broken mirror pieces.

He complained to the supermarket chain and the council is investigating. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: \\"Man Knocked to the Ground after Frying Tesco Scampi in Bathgate\\" Introduction: A 37-year-old man, Mohammed Ali, experienced a shocking incident when he decided to deep-fry a £3 packet of Tesco scampi he bought in Bathgate, West Lothian. The case has sparked a complaint to the supermarket giant and prompted an investigation by the local council. Step 1: Gather relevant background information. In this step, I need to research the key information to include in the article. I will gather details about Tesco, the product involved, and the process of deep-frying scampi to provide context to the readers. I will also look up any past incidents or similar events to establish a pattern or trend, if any. Step 2: Contact relevant parties for statements. To provide a balanced perspective, I will reach out to Tesco, the Bathgate council, and Mohammed Ali himself for their views on the matter. Their input is vital to the article as it gives readers different perspectives and coping mechanisms after the incident.  Step 3: Investigate deep-frying safety guidelines. I will research deep-frying safety guidelines available on the internet and in printed material and include them in the article. This will provide readers with useful information on how to safely prepare and cook food, and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Step 4: Assess the credibility of the incident. In this step, I evaluate the credibility of Mohammed Ali's account by checking if there are any witnesses or any form of documentation, such as images or videos, that can verify his claim. Credibility is crucial to prevent any spread of false information and uphold the journalistic standards. Step 5: Analyze the situation and summarize findings. Using all the gathered information, I will write an analysis of the situation, detailing how the incident occurred, Mohammed Ali's reaction and his complaint to Tesco, and the council's current investigation. I will also add the statements from the parties involved and collate information on deep-frying safety guidelines. Conclusion: After a thorough investigation, the article will capture the shocking experience of Mohammed Ali and will serve as a reminder of the importance of food preparation and deep-frying safety. The article will shed light on the events that transpired and the steps taken in response by Tesco and the local council."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Weather has a strong effect  on people. It influences health, intelligence   and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease  it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure  makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness.

Former Labour Foreign Secretary and party donor David Owen has been exposed as having invested in a tax avoidance scheme – in a major embarrassment for Ed Miliband.

Investment advisers Downing claimed it offered ‘attractive taxation incentives’ under the Business Premises Renovation Allowance. One expert estimated that Lord Owen’s original sum would have ‘grossed up’ to around £130,000 – leaving him with an avoidance bill of ‘between £50k and £60k’.

SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions.

Article: On March 17 there will be an explosion of green colour across the world in celebration of St Patrick's Day. The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation  for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype   that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete,  occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world. However, one bit of the Irish stereotype is true, their love for drink. Drinking in Ireland is a job, but it's not necessarily something to criticize. It was the Irish after all who created one of the world's best-loved beers, Guinness. Question: Where did the negative Irish stereotype come from? Options: A: From their everyday behavior towards other people. B: From the behavior of Irish immigrants to the America in the 19thcentury. C: From the historical records of the 19thcentury Ireland.

Meristems are specialized tissues present in plants responsible for growth and regeneration. There are two types of meristems: primary and secondary.  Primary meristems enable roots to grow in length (apical meristem), while secondary meristems, such as the vascular cambium and cork cambium, allow for growth in width (lateral meristems).

But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear   unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip. Question: Which of the following should parents do to help their kids learn good table manners? Options: A: Try dining out in fast food restaurants once in a while. B: Point out what's wrong with the kids' behavior at dinner. C: Keep telling the kids how to behave themselves at dinner.

Gently push off the ground with your other foot and place it on the other pedal, then apply pressure to the pedals with the feet to continue forward motion. The second method is incorrect because it mentions holding the bicycle upright between your legs with both feet on the pedals, and then mysteriously introduces another foot, which is impossible since humans only have two feet. Infeasible instructions for riding a bicycle would be useless.  On the other hand, the first method is a generally accepted practice for starting to ride a bicycle: stabilizing the bike and oneself with one foot on the ground and the other on a pedal, pushing off, and then shifting the other foot to its pedal to continue riding.

Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. The Arthur Miller Foundation was founded to honor the legacy of Miller and his New York City Public School Education. The mission of the foundation is: \\"Promoting increased access and equity to theater arts education in our schools and increasing the number of students receiving theater arts education as an integral part of their academic curriculum.\\" Other initiatives include certification of new theater teachers and their placement in public schools; increasing the number of theater teachers in the system from the current estimate of 180 teachers in 1800 schools; supporting professional development of all certified theater teachers; providing teaching artists, cultural partners, physical spaces, and theater ticket allocations for students. The foundation's primary purpose is to provide arts education in the New York City school system. The current chancellor of the foundation is Carmen Farina, a large proponent of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Alec Baldwin, Ellen Barkin, Katori Hall, Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, Tony Kushner, Michael Mayer, Jim McElhinney, Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, Lynn Nottage, David O. Russell, Liev Schreiber all serve on the Master Arts Council. Son-in-law Daniel Day-Lewis serves on the current board of directors.  The foundation celebrated Miller's 100th birthday with a one-night-only performance of Miller's seminal works in November 2015.  The Arthur Miller Foundation currently supports a pilot program in theater and film at the public school Quest to Learn in partnership with the Institute of Play. The model is being used as an in-school elective theater class and lab. The objective is to create a sustainable theater education model to disseminate to teachers at professional development workshops.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is Foundation?","output":"The Arthur Miller Foundation is an organization dedicated to honoring the legacy of playwright Arthur Miller and his New York City Public School Education.

I have just managed to obtain my tier 2 UK work Visa. What would be the requirement for my partner (unmarried) to apply as a dependant? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"The questions you have asked are not exactly the same but are related because they both concern the tier 2 general dependent visa process. The first question targets the need for an English language certificate, while the second question asks for requirements for an unmarried partner to apply as a dependent. I will address both questions separately below. 1. English Language Certificate for Tier 2 General Dependent Visa: For a tier 2 general dependent visa applicant, providing an English language certificate is usually not required. The primary English language proficiency requirements apply to the main tier 2 visa applicant, who must prove their knowledge of the English language by passing a secure English language test (SELT) or showing they have a degree taught in English. However, if the dependent were to eventually apply for settlement or indefinite leave to remain in the UK, they may need to show evidence of their English language proficiency by meeting the requirements of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) at the A1 level for applications made on or after 1st October 2013 and the A2 level for applications made on or after 1st May 2017. 2. Requirements for an Unmarried Partner to Apply as a Dependent: To apply for the Tier 2 General Dependent Visa as an unmarried partner, you and your partner must meet the following requirements: a) Genuine relationship: You must show evidence that you are in a genuine and subsisting relationship with the main Tier 2 visa holder, comparable to a marriage or civil partnership. This usually entails showing proof that you have been living together in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at least two years. b) Maintenance funds: You will need to demonstrate that you have adequate funds to maintain yourselves (and any dependents) without needing public funds. The main Tier 2 visa holder must have a minimum income of £18,600 per year, with another £3,800 for the first dependent and £2,400 for each additional dependent. c) No recourse to public funds: As a dependent on the Tier 2 visa, you are not allowed to access public funds in the UK, and you must provide a declaration to confirm that you will not do so. d) Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS): All applicants, including dependents, are required to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge to cover healthcare provided by the National Health Service (NHS) during their stay in the UK. e) Valid application: The application must be submitted online and should contain the necessary supporting documents. Dependent applications can either be submitted at the same time as the principal Tier 2 applicant or at a later date. f) Visa application fee: There is a fee for the tier 2 general dependent visa application, which needs to be paid when submitting the application. Please note that unmarried partners must show sufficient evidence of the genuineness of their relationship when applying as a dependent. This may include joint financial accounts, shared rental or ownership of properties, shared responsibilities and commitments (e.g., children), and other documents that demonstrate the long-term nature of the relationship. In conclusion, while the English language certificate is not required when applying for the Tier 2 General Dependent visa, other requirements must be met, including proving the genuine and subsisting nature of the relationship. The questions you asked are related but focus on different aspects of the tier 2 general dependent visa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.  and the situation: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force.  Answer the following question: Which lever would produce greater increase in force, lever A or lever B? A:","output":"Lever A would produce a greater increase in force compared to lever B. This is because Lever A is designed with an ideal mechanical advantage, meaning it does not have to overcome any friction, whereas Lever B, as a real-world lever, has to deal with friction which decreases its actual mechanical advantage. In actual scenarios, no machine can achieve the ideal mechanical advantage due to the presence of friction; thus, Lever A, as a hypothetical lever with ideal mechanical advantage, will have a greater force increase as compared to Lever B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: What does the word iceberg make you think of ? Do you think of a large block of ice in a cold northern ocean? Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye. According to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water. Icebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year. Since they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1. While most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae   can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green! Icebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains. The large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic. But there's yet another side to icebergs. Many microscopic   animals live inside icebergs and in the water around them. These creatures feed on minerals that the icebergs store and release as they melt. Scientists are still studying all the ways icebergs affect sea life. Options: A Fresh water. B Salty ocean water. C Tiny bubbles of air. D The snow. Answer: C Tiny bubbles of air.

Please answer a question about the following article about Empiricism: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction. What did Mill misrepresent about math?","output":"Mill said that math is just like other types of knowledge that we learn through our experiences and making guesses based on those experiences. This is called inductive inference. But, Mill didn't really understand how math works. Math uses a special way of thinking called deductive reasoning, which is different from inductive inference. In math, we start with some basic rules, and then we use those rules to figure out new things step by step in a very organized way. This method does not rely on our experiences or guesses. So, Mill didn't correctly represent how we learn and understand math."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Build a movie plot around this: Johnny is planning one last what? Heist","output":"Title: \\"Johnny’s Last Strike\\" Plot: Ever-charismatic Johnny Morrow, a notorious, yet beloved, master thief, plans one final heist before he retires from his life of crime. He's been in the criminal world for the past 20 years, pulling off some of the most audacious heists that no one else dared to handle. But now, he seeks to settle down, longing for peace and a quiet family life with his estranged daughter, Emily, who detests his criminal lifestyle.  Johnny plans the theft of a lifetime - the Jewel of Destiny - an infamous diamond worth 200 million kept in Geneva's most highly secure and impenetrable vault, the Fortress of Solitaire. However, the owner of the diamond is no other than ruthless billionaire and criminal kingpin, Victor Maldonado, who was once betrayed by Johnny in a failed heist and now seeks deadly revenge. Simultaneously, an FBI agent, Richard Williams, is close on Johnny’s tail, making the heist even riskier. Despite the odds, Johnny and his old team, including expert hacker Lisa, the agile and resourceful Tim, and the master of disguises, Paul, decide to come together for this grand finale. Meanwhile, Johnny tries to mend the relationship with his daughter, who's on her way to becoming a proficient lawyer. Emily initially resists, but soon she stumbles upon the warm-hearted side of Johnny, seeing him not just as a thief, but also as the loving father he tries to be. As the heist day draws closer, the stakes ramp up. Unexpected betrayal, Victor's relentless revenge, Richard’s unprecedented dedication, and Emily's discovery of Johnny's last heist plan - all combine to make it an unforgettable climax. In an unexpected twist, Johnny pulls off the massive heist, not for wealth, but to expose Victor's numerous criminal activities subtly linked with the Jewel of Destiny. Johnny becomes a hero to the public eye and confidential informer to the law enforcement, helping them bring Victor to justice, finally retiring as a thief, morphing into a law aiding citizen. In the end, not only does he reconcile with his daughter, but he also helps her build her own case against Victor with evidence collected through all his years of theft. This last heist seals Johnny's legacy as the most celebrated thief to have lived while dramatically uniting him with his family and a peaceful life he always desired."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following passage  \\"Standing out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the bucket argument: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.\\",  answer the following question.

Process: - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   Question: suppose there is more rain happens, how will it affect animal is unprotected in environment.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is more rain after a forest fire, it can have both positive and negative effects on the unprotected animals in the environment. The supposed perturbation can influence the second effect mentioned, which is losing their homes. More Rain - Positive Effects: 1. Increased water supply: More rain would help replenish water sources, making it easier for the animals to find water for drinking and maintaining their daily needs. 2. Faster vegetation regrowth: Rain stimulates plant growth, helping the burned forest recover more quickly, providing shelter and food sources for animals sooner than if there were less rain. 3. Reduced risk of further wildfires: Rain can help saturate the soil, lessening the risk of another fire occurring shortly after the first one. More Rain - Negative Effects: 1. Flooding and erosion: Excess rainfall can cause floods and soil erosion, which can create hazards for the animals and exacerbate the already challenging living conditions. 2. Loss of temporary shelters: More rain might destroy the few remaining natural shelters or the makeshift shelters animals find after the fire; this would prolong their exposure to the elements. 3. Difficulty in finding food: If the rain is too heavy, it might wash away or spoil potential food sources that animals may rely on during this vulnerable period. Overall, more rain after a forest fire might lead to a mix of positive and negative effects. It could help by replenishing water sources and promoting vegetation regrowth, which would have a positive impact on the animals that lose their homes. However, it could also cause flooding, erosion, and difficulty in finding food, which might exacerbate the challenges faced by unprotected animals in the environment. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively determine whether more rain would have a more, less, or no effect on the second effect mentioned (losing their homes) without considering various factors like the intensity of the rain, the forest's initial conditions, and the specific species of animals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then I saw it. Now I know. For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back. And the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming; we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. But other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's no real feel of emergency. Don't get me started about the cast.

Depending on source and historical timeline, it means the cosmic man or Self, Consciousness, and Universal principle.  - Harihara is the fused representation of Vishnu ( Hari ) and Shiva ( Hara ) from the Hindu tradition . Also known as Shankaranarayana ( \`\` Shankara '' is Shiva , and \`\` Narayana '' is Vishnu ) , Harihara is thus revered by both Vaishnavites and Shaivites as a form of the Supreme God . Harihara is also sometimes used as a philosophical term to denote the unity of Vishnu and Shiva as different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman . This concept of equivalence of various gods as one principle and \`\` oneness of all existence '' is discussed as Harihara in the texts of Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy . Some of the earliest sculptures of Harihara , with one half of the image as Shiva and other half as Vishnu , are found in the surviving cave temples of India , such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th - century Badami cave temples .  - Nara-Narayana (nara-nryaa) is a Hindu deity pair. Nara-Narayana is the twin-brother avatar of the God Vishnu on earth, working for the preservation of dharma or righteousness. In the concept of Nara-Narayana, the human soul Nara is the eternal companion of the Divine Narayana.  - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.  - Hari (Devanagari: ), the one who forgives all sins, is a primary god in Hinduism who is an aspect of Vishnu. The terms \\"Hari\\" and \\"Vishnu\\" are almost used interchangeably. He is described as having the dark complexion of water-filled clouds and having four arms. He is depicted as a pale-blue being, as are his incarnations Rama and Krishna. He holds a padma (lotus flower) in his lower left hand, the Kaumodaki gada (mace) in his lower right hand, the Panchajanya shankha (conch) in his upper left hand and the discus weapon considered to be the most powerful weapon according to Hindu Religion Sudarshana Chakra in his upper right hand and also have a bow named as sharanga and due to which he is sometimes named as sharangapani (hari) in Bhagvad Gita. Om precedes all else as in Om Namah Shivaya, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Om Namo Narayanaya. But only Hari precedes Om in the form of Harih om or Harih om tat sat.  - Hindu texts are manuscripts and historic literature related to any of the diverse traditions within Hinduism. A few texts are shared resources across these traditions and broadly considered as Hindu scriptures. These include the Vedas and the Upanishads. Scholars hesitate in defining the term \\"Hindu scripture\\" given the diverse nature of Hinduism, many include Bhagavad Gita and Agamas as Hindu scriptures, while Dominic Goodall includes Bhagavata Purana and Yajnavalkya Smriti to the list of Hindu scriptures.  - The word Puranas (\\"\\") literally means \\"ancient, old\\", and it is a vast genre of Indian literature about a wide range of topics, particularly myths, legends and other traditional lore. Composed primarily in Sanskrit, but also in regional languages, several of these texts are named after major Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Shiva and Devi. The Puranas genre of literature is found in both Hinduism and Jainism.  - The Bhgavata Pura (Devanagari: ; also rmad Bhgavata Mah Pura, rmad Bhgavatam or Bhgavata) is one of Hinduism's eighteen great Puranas (\\"Mahapuranas\\", great histories). Composed in Sanskrit and available in almost all Indian languages, it promotes \\"bhakti\\" (devotion) to Krishna integrating themes from the Advaita (monism) philosophy of Adi Shankara.  - The Vedas (Sanskrit: \\"\\", \\"knowledge\\") are a large body of knowledge texts originating in the ancient Indian subcontinent. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. Hindus consider the Vedas to be \\"apaurueya\\", which means \\"not of a man, superhuman\\" and \\"impersonal, authorless\\".  - Madhva Acharya (AD 12381317), also known as Purna Prajña and Ananda Teertha, was a Hindu philosopher and the chief proponent of the Dvaita (dualism) school of Vedanta. Madhva called his philosophy as \\"Tattvavada\\" meaning \\"the realist viewpoint\\".  - Shiva ( Tamil Sanskrit: , lit. \\"the auspicious one\\") is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the supreme God within Shaivism, one of the three most influential denominations in contemporary Hinduism.  - An avatar (Sanskrit: , IAST: \\"\\") is a concept in Hinduism and it means \\"descent\\", and refers to the appearance or incarnation of a deity on earth. The term also generally refers to \\"alight, to make one's appearance\\" and sometimes used to refer to any revered guru or human being.  - Brahma is the creator god in the Trimurti of Hinduism. He has four faces. Brahma is also known as \\"Svayambhu\\" (self-born), \\"Vga\\" (Lord of Speech), and the creator of the four Vedas, one from each of his mouths. Brahma is identified with the Vedic god Prajapati, as well as linked to Kama and Hiranyagarbha (the cosmic egg), he is more prominently mentioned in the post-Vedic Hindu epics and the mythologies in the Puranas. In the epics, he is conflated with Purusha. Brahma, along with Vishnu and Shiva, is part of a Hindu Trinity; however, ancient Hindu texts mention other trinities of gods or goddesses which do not include Brahma.  - The Bhagavad Gita (\\"\\" in IAST, ; lit. \\"Song of the Lord\\"), often referred to as  simply the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic \\"Mahabharata\\" (chapters 25 - 42 of the 6th book of Mahabharata).  - The \\"Trimrti\\" (Sanskrit:  \\"\\", \\"three forms\\") is the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities, typically Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer/transformer, though individual denominations may vary from that particular line-up. When all three deities of the Trimurti incarnate into a single avatar, the avatar is known as Dattatreya.  - Narayana (Sanskrit: \\"Nryaa\\") or Narayanan is a Vedic deity associated with the waters of creation and sometimes with the sun. He is one of several Vedic figures associated with Vishnu and Vishnu sometimes assumes the name Narayana in certain scriptures. According to Madhvacharya Narayana is one of the five vyuhas of Ka, which are cosmic emanations of god in contrast to his incarnate avatars. He is frequently mentioned as part of the pair of Nara-Narayana. According to the Bhagavata Purana he is the supreme god (including his different avatars) in Hinduism, venerated as the Supreme Being in Vaishnavism. He is also known as Vishnu and Hari, is venerated as Purushottama or Supreme Purusha in Hindu sacred texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Puranas.  - Vishnu (IAST: \\"\\") is one of the principal deities of Hinduism, and the Supreme Being in its Vaishnavism tradition. Along with Brahma and Shiva, Vishnu forms a Hindu trinity (Trimurti); however, ancient Hindu texts do mention other trinities of gods or goddesses.  - Supreme Being is a term for God used by theologians and philosophers of many religious faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and deism.  - Hinduism is a religion, or a way of life, found most notably in India and Nepal. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \\"\\", \\"the eternal law,\\" or the \\"eternal way,\\" beyond human origins. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \\"Hindu synthesis\\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE).  - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia.  - Shaivism or aivism (\\"aiva Patha\\",  \\"Shiva's Path\\"), also known as Shivaism and Saivam, is one of the major branches of Sanathan Dharma (Hinduism), revering Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Followers of Shaivam are called \\"Shaivas\\", \\"Saivas\\", \\"Shaivites\\", or \\"Saivarkal\\". They believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. Shaivism, like some of the other forms of Hinduism, spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Java, Bali, and parts of the Southeast Asian continent, including Cambodia.

Given the question: Article: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics   have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress.

When he returned to Studio A on July 29, he was backed by the same musicians with Harvey Brooks on bass replacing Joe Macho and his producer had changed from Tom Wilson to Bob Johnston.  Their first session together was devoted to three songs. After recording several takes each of \\"Tombstone Blues\\", \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh\\" and \\"Positively 4th Street\\", masters were successfully recorded. \\"Tombstone Blues\\" and \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh\\" were included in the final album, but \\"Positively 4th Street\\" was issued as a single-only release. At the close of the July 29 session, Dylan attempted to record \\"Desolation Row\\", accompanied by Al Kooper on electric guitar and Harvey Brooks on bass. There was no drummer, as the drummer had gone home. This electric version was eventually released in 2005, on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7.On July 30, Dylan and his band returned to Studio A and recorded three songs. A master take of \\"From a Buick 6\\" was recorded and later included on the final album, but most of the session was devoted to \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\" Dylan was unsatisfied with the results and set the song aside for a later date; it was eventually re-recorded with the Hawks in October.After Dylan and Kooper spent the weekend in Woodstock writing chord charts for the songs, sessions resumed at Studio A on August 2. \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\", and \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" were recorded successfully and masters were selected for the album.One final session was held on August 4, again at Studio A.

Properly managing and saving your Neopoints can lead to a more enjoyable and streamlined experience in Neopia. In this article, we will cover key strategies and tips for optimizing your Neopoint management, including setting goals, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limit, and utilizing a Safety Deposit Box. 1. Save Your Neopoints: The first step in effective Neopoint management is saving your accumulated currency. As you participate in games, quests, and various activities within Neopia, you will earn Neopoints. Building a strong reserve of Neopoints will enable you to engage in new opportunities and acquire valuable in-game assets. To save effectively, avoid impulsive purchases and carefully consider each expenditure to ensure it aligns with your Neopets goals. 2. Set Goals: Setting clear, achievable goals for your Neopets experience will provide direction and purpose for your Neopoint savings. Goals can include acquiring specific items, such as unique paintbrushes or rare Petpets, or reaching milestones like attaining a certain level for your Neopet. By establishing goals and understanding what is required to achieve them, you can better allocate your Neopoints and prioritize your in-game activities. 3. Collect Interest: One often overlooked aspect of Neopoint management is utilizing the National Neopian Bank to collect interest on your savings. By depositing your Neopoints into a bank account, you'll receive a daily interest payment calculated on your total balance. This passive income stream can add up over time and contribute significantly to your overall savings. Be sure to deposit your Neopoints into the bank regularly, and select a high-interest account that suits your savings goals. 4. Hit the Withdrawal Limit: While it's essential to save your Neopoints, there will come a time when you need to make withdrawals from your bank account to fund purchases or activities. However, careless withdrawals can undermine your savings efforts and hinder your progress towards your goals. To maintain a strategic approach to spending, set a daily withdrawal limit and make a conscious effort to stay within that boundary. This practice will help preserve your savings while still allowing you to participate in rewarding Neopets experiences. 5. Get a Safety Deposit Box: Lastly, acquiring a Safety Deposit Box for your Neopets account is a must for effective Neopoint management. A Safety Deposit Box enables you to securely store your valuable in-game items, ensuring they are protected from theft or loss. By having a centralized and safe location for your items, you can track your assets and maintain an accurate understanding of your overall Neopets wealth. Conclusion: In conclusion, mastering the art of Neopoint management in Neopets is crucial for optimizing your gaming experience. By saving your Neopoints, setting goals, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limit, and utilizing a Safety Deposit Box, you can strategically invest in your in-game goals and maximize the enjoyment of your Neopia adventure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

The company is widely known for its subbrand of tuning parts GReddy and the turbochargers under this brand. Can we infer the following? The automotive aftermarket company GReddy is the owner of Trust Company Ltd., which produces tuning parts.","output":"No, the inference is incorrect based on the information provided. GReddy is not the owner of Trust Company Ltd. Instead, it's the other way round. Trust Company Ltd., a Japanese automotive aftermarket company, owns the subbrand GReddy. Trust Company Ltd. is known for specializing in performance tuning parts for cars, and GReddy is a distinct brand under Trust Company Ltd. known specifically for its turbochargers. In corporate terms, Trust Company Ltd. is the parent company and GReddy is its subsidiary. This means that decision-making power concerning GReddy's operations lies primarily with Trust Company Ltd. The business relationship between Trust Company Ltd. and GReddy demonstrates a typical parent-subsidiary relationship wherein the parent company owns a majority stake in the subsidiary. To navigate this relationship, it's crucial to understand that Trust Company Ltd., the parent company, has full control over its sub-brand GReddy, which functions as a subsidiary. The parent company may set broad strategic goals for its subsidiary, but the subsidiary typically operates independently on a day-to-day basis. However, crucial business decisions about investment, expansion, or changes to business models often require the approval of the parent company. In summary, Trust Company Ltd. controls and owns the GReddy brand, which is widely known for its turbochargers. This indicates that the Japanese company has a diversified portfolio, aiming not only to offer general automotive aftermarket products but also to specialize in certain parts through its subbrands. Thus, Trust Company Ltd. doesn't just produce tuning parts; it strategically extends its operations and brand influence into more specialized segments of the automotive aftermarket industry through subbrands like GReddy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What famous train ran between Paris and Istanbul?","output":"The famous train that ran between Paris and Istanbul is the Orient Express. The Orient Express was a long-distance luxury passenger train service created in 1883 by Georges Nagelmackers, a Belgian entrepreneur and founder of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (International Sleeping-car Company). This illustrious train was a symbol of luxury travel, adventure, and intrigue during its operation, and its name continues to evoke romantic and exotic images of long-distance cross-continent travel. The original route of the Orient Express started in Paris, France, at the Gare de l'Est (East Train Station) and concluded in Istanbul, Turkey, at the Sirkeci Station, covering a distance of approximately 1,700 miles (2,735 kilometers). The train traversed through numerous European countries, including France, Germany, Austria-Hungary (modern-day Austria and Hungary), Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The Orient Express was composed of luxurious sleeping cars, restaurant cars, and lounge cars, designed to provide the utmost comfort and elegance for its passengers. The train became synonymous with high-end travel, catering to the rich, famous, and royalty. The opulent train boasted extravagant interiors decorated with engraved glass, polished wood, fine fabrics, and brass fittings, offering a lavish setting for international travelers of the era. Over the years, the route changed several times, and multiple variations of the Orient Express were introduced. One such variation was the Simplon Orient Express, which was initiated in 1919, passing through Switzerland via the Simplon Tunnel, traversing Italy, and eventually reaching Istanbul. The train gained further notoriety after being linked to several literary works, particularly Agatha Christie's iconic 1934 novel, \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" and the James Bond novel \\"From Russia with Love\\" by Ian Fleming, both of which were later adapted into successful films. Additionally, the Orient Express, with its diverse and sophisticated passengers, played an essential role in the exchange of cultures, ideas, and diplomacy between Western and Eastern Europe during its years of operation. The original Orient Express ceased operations in May 1977, mainly due to increased competition from faster means of transportation, such as air travel, and the decline in interest for luxury rail travel. However, the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express was revived in 1982 by James B. Sherwood, an American entrepreneur, with restored vintage carriages offering luxurious rail travel experiences from London to Venice and other European destinations. Although this modern iteration doesn't exactly replicate the original Orient Express route, it still manages to capture the glamour, opulence, and essence of the legendary train's golden era. In summary, the Orient Express was a distinguished long-distance luxury passenger train that ran between Paris and Istanbul, earning its fame through multiple literary works and attracting elite and renowned passengers from various parts of the world. The train's legacy remains a symbol of timeless luxury and romance, evoking a bygone era of elegant overland travel."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This dissatisfaction may result from a comparison with similar food items from other establishments that are lower in price, better in quality, or both. Additionally, the term \\"overpriced\\" suggests that the reviewer feels they didn't receive an adequate value for their money and may feel cheated or disappointed. 2. The statement \\"bad food\\" is a direct and clear expression of the reviewer's negative opinion of the food quality. This suggests that the food may have had issues such as undesirable taste, lack of freshness, improper cooking, or presentation problems. The reviewer's dissatisfaction with the food could also be due to factors like unmet expectations, inconsistency with the menu's description, or not meeting their personal preferences. When a reviewer uses the term \\"bad\\" for describing the food, it indicates they didn't enjoy the experience and could even be warning others about it. In conclusion, this review is negative as it demonstrates the reviewer's disappointment with both the price and the quality of the food. Their dissatisfaction with the dining experience may influence potential customers to avoid this establishment in favor of other options with better perceived value and food quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: where do I find the Fornax consyellaiton","output":"In order to determine the best solution for finding the Fornax constellation, let us analyze two possible solutions: using star charts and maps or utilizing technology such as mobile apps or a computer program. Solution 1: Using star charts and maps Star charts and maps have been used for centuries to track celestial bodies in the night sky. To find the Fornax constellation using this method, follow these steps: 1. Determine your location and, if possible, the exact latitude and longitude. This will aid in accurately pinpointing the Fornax constellation based on your locality. 2. Acquire a star chart or map specific to your location. There are various types of star maps available, including planispheres, which can be adjusted according to the date and time to display the night sky accurately. 3. Identify the Fornax constellation on the star chart. Typically, it is located in the southern hemisphere, between the constellations of Cetus and Eridanus. If you are unsure about the constellation's appearance, conduct some background research or consult an astronomy guidebook to learn more. 4. Locate Fornax in the night sky. When referencing the star chart, ensure that the map's orientation corresponds with your view of the sky. The Fornax constellation can be seen more easily during the months of November and December when it is at its highest point in the sky, just before midnight. 5. Once Fornax is visible, use nearby stars or constellations as guides to find its exact location. Neighboring constellations such as Cetus, Sculptor, and Phoenix can help you in this process. Solution 2: Using technology (mobile apps or computer programs) In recent years, technology has played a significant role in simplifying the process of stargazing and locating celestial bodies.  1. Select a reliable astronomy app or computer program. Notable options include Stellarium, SkySafari, Star Walk, and Google Sky Map. 2. Configure the app or program according to your exact location, time, and date. 3. Search for the Fornax constellation within the app or program. Most applications will provide general information about the constellation, its location in the sky, and its associated stars. 4. Utilize the app or program's augmented reality (AR) feature, if available. This allows you to point your device towards the sky as the app overlays the constellations on your view. 5. Adjust the settings to pinpoint the location of Fornax in the night sky. The app or program will direct you towards the constellation by providing real-time guidance and visual cues. Conclusion Both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages. The traditional method of using star charts and maps promotes a deeper understanding of the night sky and fosters a sense of achievement when finally locating the constellation. However, it may require more effort, time, and knowledge compared to the technological approach. The use of mobile apps or computer programs offers a more accessible and user-friendly experience that can cater to beginners and experienced stargazers alike. The various tools, features, and real-time guidance make locating the Fornax constellation more efficient, effortless, and engaging. Ultimately, the better solution will depend on personal preferences and needs. For those who prefer a hands-on and traditional approach, using star charts and maps is a suitable option. On the other hand, those who require a more convenient and interactive experience may find that utilizing technology offers the ideal solution for finding the Fornax constellation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Charles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 - March 12, 1955), also known as Yardbird and Bird, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker's life was riddled with depression and heroin addiction. This addiction caused him to miss performances and be considered unemployable. He frequently resorted to busking, receiving loans from fellow musicians and admirers, and pawning his saxophones for drug money. Heroin use was rampant in the jazz scene, and users could acquire it with little difficulty.  Although he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, \\"Max Making Wax\\". When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, \\"Lover Man\\", producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On \\"Bebop\\" (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, \\"Blow!\\" at him. Charles Mingus considered this version of \\"Lover Man\\" to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws. Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve.  Parker's life took a turn for the worst when his 2 year old daughter tragically passed away from pneumonia. He attempted suicide twice in 1954, which landed him in a mental hospital.  When Parker received his discharge from the hospital, he was clean and healthy. Before leaving California, he recorded \\"Relaxin' at Camarillo\\" in reference to his hospital stay. He returned to New York, resumed his addiction to heroin and recorded dozens of sides for the Savoy and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his so-called \\"classic quintet\\" including Davis and Roach. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he have financial troubles","output":"Yes, Charles Parker Jr., also known as Charlie Parker, had financial troubles throughout his life.

Two songwriters, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven. They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \\"This Game We Play\\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from  Michael G.

Objective: What adhesive metal should you use when soldering glass? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"When soldering glass, you cannot use an adhesive metal directly. Instead, you typically use a combination of materials to bond the glass pieces together. To achieve this connection, you can use copper foil and solder. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. In terms of naive physics reasoning, you need to choose a metal that adheres to glass and can withstand heat from the soldering process. Copper is a good choice, as it has a relatively low melting point and adheres well to glass surfaces. In stained glass soldering, copper foil is commonly used. 2. Apply the copper foil to the edges of the pieces of glass you want to join. The copper foil needs to be wrapped around the edges of the glass pieces evenly and smoothly, leaving no gaps. Press it firmly onto the glass to ensure a strong bond. 3. Apply flux to the copper foil on the glass pieces. Flux is essential for the soldering process, as it improves the flow of solder and helps it adhere to the copper foil and glass. Brush a thin layer of flux along the copper foil where the glass pieces will connect. 4. Using a soldering iron, heat up the solder, which is usually made up of tin and lead or a lead-free alternative. The solder will melt and flow into a liquid state. 5. Carefully apply the molten solder to the flux-covered copper foil on the glass pieces. The solder will bond with the copper foil, creating a strong adhesive joint between the glass pieces. 6. Allow the solder to cool down and solidify. This will create a secure and long-lasting connection between the glass pieces. In summary, the more sound naive physics reasoning solution in this case would be to use a combination of materials, specifically copper foil and solder, to bond the glass pieces together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the best way to: how to change a lightbulb","output":"Changing a lightbulb may seem like a simple task, but it's essential to follow the correct steps and take safety precautions to ensure a seamless and safe process. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide on the best way to change a lightbulb. 1. Safety first: Before attempting to change the lightbulb, ensure your own safety. Switch off the light and unplug it if possible, or turn off the power supply for the room at the main circuit breaker or fuse box. 2. Gather necessary materials: You will need a new lightbulb compatible with the fixture (pay attention to wattage, size, and type), a stepladder or chair (if necessary), a non-conductive tool, such as a pair of rubber gloves, and a dry cloth or tissue for handling the lightbulb. 3. Prepare the area: Position the stepladder or chair under the fixture so you have easy access to the lightbulb. Ensure the surface is stable and even before climbing it. 4. Remove the old lightbulb: Put on your rubber gloves and make sure your hands are dry. Carefully climb the ladder or chair and gently grip the lightbulb, making sure to hold it steady with one hand while the other rests on a sturdy surface. Turn the lightbulb counterclockwise to unscrew it. If it's a tricky or old lightbulb, it may require a little force to loosen it. If the bulb is still warm, let it cool down before attempting to remove it. 5. Inspect the socket: Before inserting the new lightbulb, examine the socket for damage and residue. Clean the socket with a dry cloth if necessary to remove any dust or debris. If you notice any damage, you may need to consult with an electrician to replace the socket. 6. Install the new lightbulb: Hold the new lightbulb with a dry cloth or tissue to prevent leaving any oily residue from your fingers, which might affect the lightbulb's performance. Align the threads of the lightbulb with the socket, and screw the bulb in a clockwise direction. Be careful not to overtighten or force the lightbulb, as this might damage the components or cause it to break. 7. Test the new lightbulb: Once the lightbulb is secure, carefully descend the ladder or chair. Plug the light or turn the power back on at the circuit breaker or fuse box. Test the new lightbulb by turning on the light. If it doesn't light up, double-check the bulb is correctly installed and the power supply is operational. If issues persist, consult an electrician or seek professional advice. 8. Dispose of the old lightbulb: Finally, dispose of the old lightbulb properly. Some lightbulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs, require special disposal procedures due to their mercury content. Check your local recycling center or municipality guidelines for proper disposal options. By following these steps and taking necessary precautions, you can ensure a safe and efficient lightbulb changing experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The hit US spy drama, which has just completed its third season with the first two now out on box set, hits the gold standard of gripping plotting and complex characterisation. The terrorist threat level is on permanent red alert and the CIA is so suffused with terror-paranoia that it subjects a US war hero and its own agents alike to surveillance, harassment and even polygraph tests. \\"When was the last time you told the truth?\\" asks Carrie Mathison, played by Claire Danes. It's a line that haunts every episode. Season one, aired in 2011, hinges on the question: has Gulf war hero Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), held in an Afghan hole for eight years, been \\"turned\\" by al-Qaida? Lewis won an Emmy for his portrayal of the traumatised marine; Danes won two for her role – hunter to Brody's hunted. As a bipolar intelligence agent Carrie joins a clutch of intense, idiosyncratic female leads in current TV drama (Spiral, The Killing, The Bridge, The Fall). Her judgments are brilliantly unhinged: her CIA mentor, Saul Berenson, calls her \\"the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known\\". Thus Carrie's strategies for outing Brody include wiring his house for sound and vision, like a terrorist Big Brother. This includes the bedroom: surveillance sex-scenes are a regularly disconcerting Homeland trope. Carrie's next choice is to have sex with Brody herself. A truth or dare, double-bluff love affair ensues: will they kiss or kill each other next? When Carrie's question for Brody's polygraph test – \\"Have you ever been unfaithful to your wife?\\" – elicits Brody's unblinking \\"no\\", the paranoia ratchets up again: what else is Brody lying about? Danes' eyes get wider by the episode: Lewis's mouth gets tighter. By the end of season one Carrie's off her meds, off her head – and off the CIA payroll. By contrast, Mandy Patinkin as old agency hand Saul is a study in stillness. Despite another life as a musicals diva, Patinkin is the calm in the eye of the show's hurricane, a microcosm of how Homeland's characterisation anchors its less likely plot lurches. Season two sees computer hacks on a vice-president's pacemaker, al-Qaida kingpins lurking alone in dark tunnels like sci-fi aliens, and CIA bosses blithely listening to their agents having sex with terrorist suspects. Although less credible and, with Carrie on lithium, more conventional, season two is still a mesmerising affair. We watch Brody achieving political office as cohort of a hawkish vice-president (Homeland's neocons arguably come off almost as badly as Muslims). But is Congressman Brody, as Carrie accuses, a \\"terrorist and a traitor\\"? It's hardly a conventional terrorist suspect interrogation that begins: \\"You broke my heart, you know?\\" and ends with an invitation to cohabit. As Carrie and Saul battle to avert a planned attack on the US, knowledge turns out be illusory, victories pyrrhic, while the nature of terror-boss Abu Nazir's plot remains a mystery until the season's closing minutes. And the finish is literally explosive. What was this article about?","output":"This article is a review of the television show Homeland, which is a spy drama about the CIA and terrorist threats.

In this case, we'll subtract 5b from both sides of the equation: (5b - 35) - 5b = (16b - 134) - 5b This simplifies to: -35 = 11b - 134 Step 3: Now, let's isolate b further by adding the constant term on the left side of the equation (in this case, 35) to both sides: -35 + 35 = (11b - 134) + 35 This simplifies to: 0 = 11b - 99 Step 4: To solve for b, we need to eliminate the constant term -99 by adding 99 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 99 = 11b - 99 + 99 This simplifies to: 99 = 11b Step 5: Finally, we want to get b by itself, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of b (which is 11): 99 ÷ 11 = 11b ÷ 11 This simplifies to: 9 = b So, the solution to the equation 5b - 35 = 16b - 134 is b = 9."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Washington (CNN) -- Republicans call it a government cover-up similar to what forced Richard Nixon to resign. Democrats call it a right-wing conspiracy theory. The fallout from the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans continues more than 19 months later, with further details last week that raised questions about how the Obama administration responded to the violence less than two months before the President's re-election. Few issues reveal the hyper-partisan politics of Washington more than the ongoing debate over an issue now known simply as Benghazi. Last Friday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa announced that he had subpoenaed Secretary of State John Kerry to testify at a May 21 hearing, alleging that the State Department failed to comply with an earlier subpoena for documents. \\"This is all about an effort to convince the American people that the president of the United States had everything under control,\\" OPTIONS: - Americans Sen.

The quote is an opinion being expressed about the motivation behind the debate, and thus it needs to be attributed to an individual or a group.

The move signifies Pure Gym's commitment to expanding its presence in the fitness market, whilst also offering customers more choices in terms of gym locations and facilities. In this article, we will delve into the details of the acquisition and the potential implications for both gym operators and their members. 1. Background of Pure Gym and LA Fitness: Both Pure Gym and LA Fitness have carved a niche for themselves in the UK's fitness market. Pure Gym was established in 2009 and has since grown to become the UK's largest gym operator with over 230 gyms across the nation. Known for its budget-friendly pricing and 24-hour access, Pure Gym has attracted a loyal customer base that prioritizes flexibility and affordability. LA Fitness, on the other hand, is known for its more upscale offerings and was originally founded in California, United States, before expanding to the UK. However, in previous years, LA Fitness has faced some financial challenges and has been undergoing a restructuring process. This ultimately led to the opportunity for Pure Gym to acquire the rival workout chain. 2. Pure Gym's Acquisition Strategy: The acquisition of LA Fitness by Pure Gym has been a strategic move aimed at consolidating their position in the UK's fitness market. By adding LA Fitness's 43 gyms to Pure Gym's extensive existing network, Pure Gym will not only expand its geographical reach, but also cater to a wider audience, offering services to those looking for a higher-end fitness experience. This acquisition will enable Pure Gym to diversify its portfolio while displaying a robust commitment to growth. 3. Implications for Pure Gym and LA Fitness Members: The acquisition of LA Fitness by Pure Gym is expected to bring an array of benefits to members of both gym chains. For existing Pure Gym members, this acquisition will provide access to additional gym locations and more upscale facilities. For LA Fitness members, the transition to Pure Gym's ownership may lead to more competitive pricing, in line with Pure Gym's budget-friendly ethos, potentially making gym membership more affordable for existing members. 4. The Future of Pure Gym and LA Fitness: As Pure Gym integrates LA Fitness gyms into its existing network, customers can anticipate new opportunities for both companies to collaborate and potentially offer promotions or discounts to their members. Additionally, the acquisition will likely contribute to Pure Gym's continued growth in the UK market, solidifying their position as an industry leader. Conclusion: Pure Gym's acquisition of LA Fitness represents a major milestone for the UK's fitness industry and has the potential to significantly reshape the gym landscape. With the addition of LA Fitness locations into Pure Gym's network, members will have an even wider range of facilities to choose from, while still enjoying the affordable pricing that has made Pure Gym so popular. This acquisition further solidifies Pure Gym's presence in the industry, marking a promising future for the company as they continue to grow and evolve in the UK fitness market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.  Tibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attache, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted.  Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets.  In January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System. In 1964, Tibbets was named military attache in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966. He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966.

Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you?

No more after that!\\" and \\"That's three times he's made the same mistake.\\"?","output":"To determine whether the word \\"time\\" means the same thing in both sentences, I will examine the context and usage of the word in each sentence. Step 1: Analyze the meaning of the word \\"time\\" in the first sentence. The first sentence is \\"Okay, but this is the last time. No more after that!\\" In this context, \\"time\\" refers to an instance or occurrence of an event that has been happening and will happen one final instance. It is expressing a limit on the repetition of the event. Step 2: Analyze the meaning of the word \\"time\\" in the second sentence. The second sentence is \\"That's three times he's made the same mistake.\\" Here, \\"time\\" is used to quantify the number of occurrences of an event, in this case, making the same mistake. The word \\"times\\" indicates the repetition of the event. Step 3: Compare the meaning of the word \\"time\\" in both sentences. In both cases, \\"time\\" refers to an instance or occurrence of an event. In the first sentence, it is used to set a limit on the repetition of the event, while in the second sentence, it is used to quantify the number of occurrences of an event. While they represent slightly different aspects of instances or occurrences (limiting vs quantifying), both meanings pertain to the repetition of an event. Conclusion:  The word \\"time\\" does mean essentially the same thing in both sentences, as it relates to instances or occurrences of an event. However, the focus is slightly different, with the first sentence emphasizing the limit of occurrences and the second sentence quantifying them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It moved half its production to China to keep costs down, but eight years later one company is bringing production back to Britain. It's another example of the backshoring trend that has seen many European manufacturers relocate their business back home. Caldeira is a cushion-making business headquartered in Merseyside, Northern England. Since 2004 it has also had a factory operating in Zhejiang province, China. \\"At the time China was about to be admitted to the WTO and our Chinese competitors were actually selling products cheaper than we could make them\\", said CEO Tony Caldeira. Read more: Chanel's exclusivity keeps it a cut above. According to Caldeira it was an obvious decision for the company at the time. \\"It was a good exchange rate, the salaries were only a tenth of their UK colleagues, a huge labor cost differential between China and the UK.\\" That has now changed; last year manufacturing wages increased by 20 percent according to the Chinese National Statistics Bureau. Since setting up his Chinese factory, Tony Caldeira said his Chinese employees have had wages increase 400 percent. Add to that the increasing costs in shipping, packaging, duty rates and fabric costs, and it's not surprising Chinese production has become less attractive.

They were taught in apprenticeships in the 1970s and 1980s, but those skills aren't being taught now.\\" And while the Chinese workers are younger with manufacturing and sewing machinery skills in abundance, Tony Caldeira said they don't have the same loyalty and there is a high turnover of staff. \\"What you tend to find is people aren't as afraid to move jobs in the Chinese culture, a lot of workers move every year after Chinese New Year, the contracts are only 12 months, so at the end of the year they look for the best contract on the market.\\" Despite the rising costs in Chinese wages, the company won't be looking for another low-cost manufacturing base, for example in Vietnam or Bangladesh. \\"The raw materials are manufactured in China so we'd end up shipping it over, incurring extra costs and complications.\\" As far as Caldeira is concerned, Britain appears to be winning this round of the great pillow fight with China.

Translate to English English:","output":"\\"Neither the state nor often large companies create them, rather, they tend to decrease jobs.\\" Long Answer: The statement you've asked to translate from Finnish to English seems to touch on a larger discussion about the role of different entities in job creation and elimination. Below, I'll explore this in more detail using your translated sentence as a guide. The translated sentence, \\"Neither the state nor often large companies create them, rather, they tend to decrease jobs,\\" implies a certain skepticism towards the idea that job creation largely depends on government action and the operation of large corporations. The claim suggests that these entities-- the state and large corporations-- do not fulfill the role of establishing opportunities for employment to the extent that many people might expect.  The 'state' refers to the government, a body that has a significant influence on job creation through elements such as fiscal policy, regulations, and public services. But, not all governments are able to effectively stimulate job growth for various reasons such as limited resources, policy choices, and more. For instance, during economic downturns, many governments try to create jobs through stimulus programs but the success of such initiatives can vary.  Large corporations also play a key role in job creation, especially when they are growing and scaling their operations. However, these corporations may also decrease the number of available jobs, often through mechanisms such as automation, offshoring, or restructuring to increase efficiency. For example, many large manufacturing companies have employed automation technology which requires less manual labor, resulting in job loss. In fact, data from various economies have shown that a high proportion of net new jobs come from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), rather than large corporations or the state. SMEs, are typically more agile and able to adapt to market changes, and also have greater capacity to innovate, leading to new sectors and jobs being created.  Therefore, while it's undeniable that the state and large companies have a role to play in job creation, it's also important to recognize the part of smaller entities and entrepreneurship in driving employment. Understanding the dynamics of job creation and elimination can inform policies and initiatives aiming to address unemployment and underemployment."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Information:  - Convivio ( The Banquet ) is a work written by Dante Alighieri roughly between 1304 and 1307 . This unfinished work of Dante consists of four trattati , or \`\` books '' : a prefatory one , plus three books that each include a canzone ( long lyrical poem ) and a prose allegorical interpretation or commentary of the poem that goes off in multiple thematic directions . The Convivio is a major stage of development for Dante , very different from the visionary world of the Vita nuova ( although like the earlier work it too is a medium for the author 's evolving sense of artistic vocation and philosophical - spiritual quest ) . This difference is reflected in how the two works use the prosimetrum format : in the Vita Nova there is a complex interrelation and intertwining between the prose and the poetry , while in the Convivio large blocks of prose have an autonomous existence apart from the poems ; the content of the poetry is not amplified or edited in the prose so much as commented upon prosaically , to serve as points of departure for the various subjects that the Convivio discusses . Dante himself tells us that the prose of the Convivio is \`\` temperate and virile , '' in contrast to the \`\` fervid and passionate '' prose of the Vita Nova ; and that while the approach to this in the work of his youth was \`\` like dreaming '' the Convivio approaches it subjects soberly and wide awake , often modeling its style on Scholastic authors . The Convivio is a kind of vernacular encyclopedia of the knowledge of Dante 's time ; it touches on many areas of learning , not only philosophy but also politics , linguistics , science , and history . The treatise begins with the prefatory book , or proem , which explains why a book like the Convivio is needed and why Dante is writing it in the vernacular instead of Latin . It is one of Dante 's early defenses of the vernacular , expressed in greater detail in his ( slightly earlier ) linguistic treatise De vulgari eloquentia ( On Eloquence in the Vernacular ) .

Often used in the past primarily for masterpieces of Western European literature, world literature today is increasingly seen in global context. Readers today have access to an unprecedented range of works from around the world in excellent translations, and since the mid-1990s a lively debate has grown up concerning both the aesthetic and the political values and limitations of an emphasis on global processes over national traditions.  - Italian (or \\"lingua italiana\\" ) is a Romance language. It is the second-closest to Latin in terms of vocabulary after Sardinian. Italian is an official language in Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, Vatican City and western Istria (in Slovenia and Croatia). It used to have official status in Albania, Malta and Monaco, where it is still widely spoken, as well as in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors. Italian is spoken by small minorities in places such as France (especially in Corsica), Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Crimea and Tunisia and by large expatriate communities in the Americas. Many speakers are native bilinguals of both standardized Italian and other regional languages. Italian is the fourth most studied language in the world.  - The Divine Comedy is a poem by Dante Alighieri, begun and completed 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language.

News article: WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran on Monday dismissed an angry warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that Tehran risked dire consequences “the like of which few throughout history have suffered before” if it made threats against the United States.      Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back at Trump’s warning, which the U.S. leader delivered written in capital letters in a late-night tweet.      “COLOR US UNIMPRESSED: The world heard even harsher bluster a few months ago. And Iranians have heard them - albeit more civilized ones - for 40 yrs. We’ve been around for millennia & seen fall of empires, incl our own, which lasted more than the life of some countries,” Zarif wrote on Twitter.      “BE CAUTIOUS!” he wrote in capital letters, echoing exact words from Trump.      Iran has been under increasing U.S. pressure and possible sanctions since Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from a 2015 agreement between world powers and Iran over its disputed nuclear program.      Bitter foes since Iran’s 1979 revolution, Washington and Tehran have cranked up talk of war in recent days.      The Trump administration has launched an offensive of speeches and online communications meant to foment unrest and help pressure Iran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups.      Despite the heightened rhetoric, both sides have reasons to want to avoid starting a conflict.      Trump’s words appeared to be in response to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saying that hostile policies toward Tehran could lead to “the mother of all wars.”      In his tweet directed at Rouhani, Trump wrote: “Never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence & death. Be cautious!”      Rouhani had told a gathering of Iranian diplomats on Sunday: “Mr Trump, don’t play with the lion’s tail, this would only lead to regret.”      “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,” said Rouhani, quoted by the state news agency IRNA.      “OBVIOUS MISTAKE”      Trump is under pressure from U.S. lawmakers for taking too soft a line against Russia in a summit last week with President Vladimir Putin.      “President Trump has failed to assure Americans he would side with us over Russia. To distract from the Helsinki disaster, he has launched a childish all-caps Twitter tirade against Iran. Barstool threats don’t make us safe, they make us look silly and weak,” said Congressman Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.      Trump’s Iran tweet resembled ones he issued last year to warn North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. But in June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the first U.S.-North Korean summit. After the meeting both sides declared a new friendship and made vague pledges of nuclear disarmament.      At the White House, Trump later on Monday said, “none at all,” in response to a shouted question about whether he had any concerns about provoking tensions with Iran.      Although Rouhani left open the possibility of peace between Tehran and Washington, Iran’s most powerful authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday ruled out negotiations with the United States as an “obvious mistake.”      There is limited appetite in Washington for a conflict with Iran, not least because of the difficulties the U.S. military faced in Iraq after its 2003 invasion but also because of the impact on the global economy if conflict raised oil prices.      Many ordinary Iranians are worried that the war of words might lead to a military confrontation but insiders in Tehran told Reuters they believed the Trump administration would not drag the United States into another quagmire in the Middle East.      With popular discontent over Iran’s faltering economy and sliding currency, and the prospect of tough new U.S. sanctions, Iran’s leaders have called for unity.      The Iranian rial plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Monday amid fears of a military confrontation. The dollar was being offered for as much as 92,000 rials, compared to around 75,000 last week.      Many Iranians are largely skeptical of the Trump administration’s professed support for Iranian citizens because of the harsh U.S. sanctions on the country and a visa ban imposed on Iranians barring them from entering the United States.      While Washington prepares to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran after pulling out of the nuclear deal, Iran’s faction-ridden religious and political elites have closed ranks against Trump’s hawkish approach to Tehran.      However, growing strains with the United States will eventually boost Rouhani’s anti-Western hardline rivals who fear losing power if the nuclear accord, championed by Rouhani, ended the country’s political and economic isolation.      While the United States has a substantial military presence in the region, a full-scale military confrontation with Iran would be a major, costly endeavor that could eclipse the U.S. war in Iraq. It could also distract from other U.S. national security priorities, including Russia and North Korea.      In reaction to Iran’s threats, the U.S. military has renewed a vow to secure the free flow of oil from the Strait of Hormuz. However, at least as of last week, the Pentagon said those Iranian threats had not led the U.S. military to reposition or add to forces in the Middle East.

(Associated Press)      In this photo released by official website of the office of the Iranian Presidency, President Hassan Rouhani attends a meeting with a group of foreign ministry officials in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, July 22, 2018. Rouhani warned President Donald Trump against provoking his country while indicating peace... (Associated Press)      TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranians on Monday shrugged off the possibility that a bellicose exchange of words between President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart could escalate into military conflict, but expressed growing concern America's stepped-up sanctions could damage their fragile economy.      In his latest salvo, Trump tweeted late on Sunday that hostile threats from Iran could bring dire consequences.      This was after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani remarked earlier in the day that \\"American must understand well that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\\"      Trump tweeted: \\"NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKE OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.\\"      Within hours, Iran's state-owned news agency IRNA dismissed the tweet, describing it as a \\"passive reaction\\" to Rouhani's remarks.      On Tehran streets, residents took the exchange in stride.      \\"Both America and Iran have threatened one another in different ways for several years,\\" shrugged Mohsen Taheri, a 58-year-old publisher.      A headline on a local newspaper quoted Rouhani as saying: \\"Mr. Trump, do not play with the lion's tail.\\"      Prominent Iranian political analyst Seed Leilaz downplayed the war of words, saying it was in his opinion \\"the storm before the calm.\\"      Leilaz told The Associated Press he was not \\"worried about the remarks and tweets,\\" and that \\"neither Iran, nor any other country is interested in escalating tensions in the region.\\"      Citing harsh words the United States and North Korea had exchanged before the high-profile summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Leilaz said Trump and Kim got \\"closer\\" despite the warring words.      Meanwhile, Trump's tweet was reverberating across the Mideast.      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the U.S. president's \\"strong stance\\" after years in which the Iranian \\"regime was pampered by world powers.\\"      Trump earlier this year pulled the U.S. out of the international deal meant to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon and ordered increased American sanctions, as well as threatening penalties for companies from other countries that continue to do business with Iran.      With the economic pressure, Trump said earlier this month that \\"at a certain point they're going to call me and say 'let's make a deal,' and we'll make a deal.\\"      Iran has rejected talks with the U.S., and Rouhani has accused the U.S. of stoking an \\"economic war.\\"      Rouhani also suggested Iran could immediately ramp up its production of uranium in response to U.S. pressure. Potentially that would escalate the very situation the nuclear deal sought to avoid — an Iran with a stockpile of enriched uranium that could lead to making atomic bombs.      Trump's tweet suggested he has little patience with the trading of hostile messages with Iran, using exceptionally strong language and writing the all-capitalized tweet.      \\"WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!,\\" he wrote.      Another Tehran resident, Mehdi Naderi, fretted that the U.S. measures and his own government's policies are damaging the lives of the average Iranian.      \\"America is threatening the Iranian people with its sanctions and our government is doing the same with its incompetence and mismanagement,\\" said the self-employed 35-year-old.      Trump has a history of firing off heated tweets that seem to quickly escalate long-standing disputes with leaders of nations at odds with the U.S.      In the case of North Korea, the public war of words cooled quickly and gradually led to the high profile summit and denuclearization talks. There has been little tangible progress in a global push to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons program since the historic Trump-Kim summit on June 12.      U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Pyongyang for follow-up talks earlier this month, but the two sides showed conflicting accounts of the talks. North's Foreign Ministry accused the United States of making \\"gangster-like\\" demands for its unilateral disarmament.      Some experts say Kim is using diplomacy as a way to win outside concessions and weaken U.S.-led international sanctions.      Many in Iran have expressed frustration that Trump has seemed willing to engage with North Korea, which has openly boasted of producing nuclear weapons, but not Iran, which signed the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.      Since Trump pulled out of the deal, other nations involved — Germany, Britain, France, Russia and China as well as the European Union — have reaffirmed their support for the deal and have been working to try and keep Iran on board.      \\"Iran is angry since Trump responded to Tehran's engagement diplomacy by pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal,\\" Iranian lawmaker Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh told the AP.      He added, however, the war of words between the two presidents was to be expected, since official diplomatic relations between the two countries have been frozen for decades.      \\"They express themselves through speeches since diplomatic channels are closed,\\" said Falahatpisheh who heads the influential parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy.      On Sunday in California, Pompeo was strongly critical of Iran, calling its religious leaders \\"hypocritical holy men\\" who amassed vast sums of wealth while allowing their people to suffer.      In the speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, Pompeo castigated Iran's political, judicial and military leaders, accusing several by name of participating in widespread corruption. He also said the government has \\"heartlessly repressed its own people's human rights, dignity and fundamental freedoms.\\"      He said despite poor treatment by their leaders, \\"the proud Iranian people are not staying silent about their government's many abuses,\\" Pompeo said.      \\"And the United States under President Trump will not stay silent either.\\"      ___      Lester reported from Washington. Associated Press writers David Rising in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, Aron Heller in Jerusalem and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report. ||||| To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.

Question: A girl noticed she could slide further while wearing her socks on the vinyl kitchen floor the morning after her mother waxed it then she could at the end of the week, when it had warn off. This is because the waxed kitchen floor had _____ then when the wax was worn off. (A) less friction (B) more friction Answer:","output":"The correct answer is (A) less friction. The reason the girl was able to slide further on the waxed vinyl floor compared to when the wax had worn off is due to the difference in the friction between her socks and the floor's surface. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. In this scenario, the friction is occurring between the girl's socks and the vinyl floor. Frictional forces are influenced by both the surface roughness and the material properties of the two objects in contact. When the vinyl floor is freshly waxed, a thin, smooth layer of wax covers the surface, creating a more slippery and smoother surface compared to when the wax has worn off. This smoother surface results in less interaction between the microscopic irregularities of the floor and the girl's socks, leading to a reduction in friction. As a consequence, she can slide further on the waxed floor. As the week progresses and the wax wears off, the surface becomes rougher, increasing the contact points between the floor and her socks. This increased contact leads to an increase in friction, which opposes her motion more effectively, causing her to slide for a shorter distance on the now worn-off vinyl floor. In conclusion, the waxed kitchen floor had less friction than when the wax was worn off, enabling the girl to slide further on the freshly waxed vinyl floor compared to when the wax had worn off at the end of the week."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

On the other hand, Valley farm did not have the funds to install windbreaks and decided to postpone the project. By not having windbreaks at their farm, the wind velocity over their crops remains unchanged and unprotected.

Premise: 'I hear you tell of men's futures,' I asked her. The speaker is stating that they have heard that the person they're addressing (a woman in this case) tells men's futures. This implies that the speaker has been informed or has knowledge about this woman's ability to predict or share information about the future, specifically related to men. Hypothesis: He asked if she told men's futures. The hypothesis suggests that the speaker (identified as a male in this case) has questioned the woman about her ability to reveal men's futures.

Speaking at the Breast Cancer Care lunch at Champneys Tring health spa, she said: ‘I’m 53 in December and I’ve just signed another five-year contract, so I think that probably blows a few holes in the argument of people who say that older women can’t be a success in television. 'I’m the longest-serving British newsreader. That’s quite a lot of longevity, isn’t it? ‘I was staggered, to be honest … and apparently I’ve also done more live broadcasting than anybody else in the world.’ ‘Apparently there is some chap in America who’s done about 16,000 hours and apparently I’ve done 20,000 hours. Isn’t it amazing? It’s incredible. I can’t believe it. ‘It feels like yesterday that I joined the company. I suppose it’s because it doesn’t feel like work because I love my job, I love what I do for a living. ‘I’m not expecting a trophy, I’m just safe in the knowledge that I can continue to do for another five years the best job in the world. I love my job and I’m very lucky and privileged to be able to do it. ‘I’m very content to be with Sky. I was there when it was just great big potholes in the car park, and now we have something like 130 million viewers around the world. I was recently on safari on holiday and I was recognised on the Zimbabwe/Botswana border, which was a bit weird but it made me think, “We reach all of these people”.’ At a Breast Cancer Care lunch she hit back at critics such as Sir Terry Wogan, who last week claimed ageing female presenters should not complain when they are replaced as they often use their looks to land TV roles as young women. Miss Burley, who admits making a series of high-profile blunders during her live broadcasts, recently signed a new contract which will keep her at Sky until she is 57. Shining example: Miss Burley, who has clocked up. a phenomenal 20,000 hours on screen, meets Prime Minister David Cameron. at a Downing Street reception to celebrate the achievements of women in. the media. 'It feels like yesterday that I joined the company': And she has just signed another five-year contract. She began her career on the Evening Post and Chronicle in Wigan in 1978 before working in local radio and television. She. joined TV-am in 1985 as a reporter and breakfast TV presenter. She. joined Sky News in 1988, helping launch the channel three months later. She. currently presents Sky News from 2-5pm, and has covered some of the. world’s biggest news stories including the death of Princess Diana, the. Asian Tsunami and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for which she won a BAFTA. award. Covering all the big news: Miss Burley reported on the death of Princess Diana in 1997. Consummate professional: And she was part of the media scrum outside the Lindo Wing of St. George's Hospital, London, where to reporting the birth of her grandson, Prince. George, this summer. However, she made a series of widely-publicised gaffes during her career, including mistakenly mocking US Vice President Joe Biden for marking his forehead with ashes on Ash Wednesday. She told viewers it looked like he had ‘walked into a door’. She grabbed a photographer by the throat during the scrum that greeted Naomi Campbell’s court appearance in 2008, and was labelled ‘a bit dim’ during a clash with Labour MP Chris Bryant. She said: ‘I’ve had so many bloopers. I’ve no idea where to start. There’s a great quote that goes “Doctors. bury their mistakes, lawyers lock theirs up, and television presenters. broadcast theirs”, and it’s true. ‘Of. course you make mistakes. You can’t be the longest-serving newsreader. in the world and not make mistakes, but the key is to get back on the. horse’. Big break: Miss Burley, second from right, with colleagues on breakfast programme TV-AM, which she joined as a reporter in 1985. Career progression: Miss Burley pictured in the Sky News newsroom in 1989, after she joined a year earlier. Talking about ageism. in the past, Miss Burley admitted she had never been a victim, but said. she would follow former BBC presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who successfully. sued the BBC for age discrimination and victimisation after she was. dropped as a presenter of Countryfile at the age of 51 in 2009. She said: ‘Ageism and sexism have passed me by - but if it happened, I’d fight it like Miriam O’Reilly did.’ Glamour puss: She hit back at critics like Sir Terry Wogan, who last week claimed ageing female presenters shouldn't complain when they are replaced as they often use their looks to land TV roles as young women. Talking about retiring from television, she once admitted: ‘I sometimes dream of a life in the country with my chickens, growing vegetables. That would be heaven one day, but not yet.’ Britain’s longest-ever serving newsreader is Peter Sissons, who retired from the BBC at the age of 66 in 2009 after 31 years as a newscaster. Before him, the title was held by Dickie Baker, who retired from the BBC after 28 years.

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Write a title for this article: Returning to work after maternity leave is a huge stressor for many first time moms, not only because of the logistical hoops you have to jump through to re-arrange your work life around your new baby, but it can also fill women with self-doubt about their roles as career woman and mom. It also seems to come way too quickly. Some experts believe that women need about four months of maternity leave before they’re ready to come back, but many women only get six to eight weeks. Here’s how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Performing at Work • Ease the transition. Experts recommend starting in the middle of the week, so your first work week is short. It is also becoming more common for women to arrange to work one or two days the first week or so, or come in for a shorter day for the first two or three days to help ease the transition. The smoother your transition, the more productive you’ll be at work, says Chris Essex, director of the Center for Work and Family in Rockville, Md. • Tone down the baby talk—or not! A lot of women fear if they talk about their babies at work, people will assume they wish they were home instead of working. “Yet talking about your baby can build connections to people in the workplace,” says Jamie Ladge, assistant professor in management at Northeastern University in Boston. “People talk about their personal lives all the time at work, so it’s natural to talk about your kids.\\" But use your judgment. If you intuit that your co-workers won’t be receptive or can’t relate, then keep the cute baby stories to a minimum. • Give yourself time to adjust. Don’t think you need to reconsider your options if your first few weeks back are rocky. “When women come back to work, they’re in a lot of flux, trying to integrate how they are as a professional with their new role as a mother,” Ladge says. It may take some time to adjust to your new identity and learn how to juggle work and home responsibilities. • Ask for flex time. More and more women and men are negotiating schedules that are less rigid and can ease the stresses with working 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. “You may fear that people will think less of you if you ask, but if you don’t ask, you don’t get,” Ladge says. Talk to other employees who may have been down the same road to see what type of arrangements they have. • Ignore the comments. People can say overtly or covertly stereotypical things, which can fill you with self doubt. A seasoned mother might say, “I cried and cried when I came back to work,” making you question what kind of mom you are since you didn’t shed a tear. A boss might say, “I hope you’re not one of those women who aren’t 100 percent committed now that you have a baby.” Just laugh it off. And don’t work twice as hard to prove them wrong. • Be clear with your supervisors. Be communicative about what you want from your job and what your ambitions are so that you don’t get sidelined for promotions because of inaccurate assumptions about you now that you’re a mom. Juggling • You’ll be exhausted. If there’s a time you could use the support of your parents or some extra paid help, it is when you’re transitioning back to work. If you can get some help with cleaning and cooking during this time, it can help you feel less frazzled. • Plan the morning routine. One of the most critical issues is the division of labor between you and your spouse. Who will take showers when, who will watch the baby, feed the baby, and get the baby to child care. Ditto for dinnertime and pickup. “You and your spouse need to work it out in advance because it’s hard to negotiate when you’re tired or in the middle of a hectic schedule,” Essex says. • Alternate nighttime feedings. If you handle all the middle-of-the night feedings, you’ll be exhausted in the morning. Try to alternate nights with your husband. • Don’t try to be super-mom. Understand that you may not be able to do everything like you used to. Some things may fall by the wayside, like a perfectly clean house, or home-cooked dinners every night. Missing Your Baby • Get acclimated to child care. Test drive your child care for at least three days before going back to work to give you and your baby time to adjust. That can lower your anxiety level about your child’s transition. “Having good child care that makes you feel confident is key and reminding yourself that your baby is safe and loved will really help,” says Murphy Daly, author of The Pregnant Professional. • Do a dress rehearsal. Prior to the first day back, get all the stuff ready, have the feeding and napping things packed and ready to go,” Daly says. “Take baby to childcare and then go get your personal grooming done while you practice being away.\\" • Check in with your child care once a day. For some people, checking in may make it harder, so tailor the advice to what works for you. Some women like to have pictures of the baby at work, while for others, it may make the transition more difficult. • Don’t be surprised to miss your baby. Try not to assume that something is wrong with your work ethic for wanting to be home with your baby rather than working. Women often feel pulled in both directions, so it’s more about getting used to wanting to be in both places at once. • Think about a breastfeeding plan. If you are breastfeeding, you should start pumping and freezing milk about a month before you go back to work. Make sure you have a private place to pump at work.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity'. Obviously, it is not. For one reason, many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set-ups (when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen!). For another, his concealing of one important information: the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film. That is, goitre, a sickness caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research (heck, if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he'd have found 'goitre') he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people (still, doubtfully). Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly, talking about them as 'cretins', again and again, dramatizing the action, setting-up scenes to create the spectacle, all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all-mighty objectivity. Bunuel talks all the time in this film, not letting one word to the people he is filming. He talks FOR them and, even then, JUDGES them. This piece is flawed to it's roots, to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film.","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative. To justify this conclusion, let's analyze the review step by step: 1. The reviewer critiques the filmmaker's claims of objectivity, using specific examples of scenes they believe to be staged. This demonstrates skepticism and doubt about the film's authenticity. 2. They point out that an important piece of information (i.e., the cause of the people's cretinism - goitre) is left out, adding to their argument that the film is not objective. 3. The reviewer accuses the filmmaker of judging the people in the film and being overly critical, something they find unacceptable for a documentarist claiming objectivity. 4. There's an emphasis on how the filmmaker \\"talks all the time,” speaking for the people and often judging them, which makes the review even more negative. 5. Lastly, the reviewer concludes that the film is flawed and doesn't understand why it's considered a great film. Overall, the sentiment of this review is definitely negative, as the reviewer expresses doubts about the film's integrity, authenticity, and overall message."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What country with two words suffered from attacks inside it?\\"  Context: \\"The Persian Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States. The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as \\"permanently disabled\\" according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome). The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia. Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The country with two words that suffered from attacks inside it during the Persian Gulf War is Saudi Arabia. In the context provided, the war was primarily fought between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The conflict resulted in a decisive victory for the U.S.-led coalition forces, who drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition casualties. While the main battles occurred within the borders of Iraq and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, which shares borders with both countries, also experienced direct attacks. As a significant regional power and prominent member of the coalition against Iraq, Saudi Arabia was targeted by Iraqi forces throughout the conflict. Iraqi troops launched missile attacks on several major Saudi Arabian cities as part of their retaliation strategy, aiming to cause destruction and instill fear in their opponents. Alongside missile attacks, Saudi Arabia's border regions were also threatened by the potential spillover of ground combat, which led to the deployment of coalition troops throughout the country. Although land combat did not expand beyond the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, the presence of U.S. and allied forces within Saudi Arabia was vital in defending against potential incursions from Iraqi forces. In addition to direct attacks, Saudi Arabia played a crucial logistical role for coalition forces during the Persian Gulf War. The country provided bases for both aerial and ground troops, as well as equipment and resources to support the war effort. Therefore, despite not being the primary theater of war, Saudi Arabia was an essential participant in the conflict and experienced attacks within its territory as a result of its involvement in the coalition efforts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation -273*w - 13 = -260*w. Now, to solve for 'w', we need to get it all by itself on one side.  First, let's add 260*w to both sides to move the -260w over. Imagine having -273 cookies and then adding 260 cookies: -273*w + 260*w - 13 = -260*w + 260*w This simplifies to: -13*w - 13 = 0 (since -260*w + 260*w cancels each other out) Now, let's get rid of the -13 that is just hanging around with the w. To do that, we have to add 13 to both sides. Imagine having -13 stickers and then you get 13 more: -13*w - 13 + 13 = 0 + 13 This simplifies to: -13*w = 13 Good! Now the 'w' is almost all alone. We just have that -13 left to get rid of. Since it's multiplied by 'w', so let's do the opposite and divide by -13. Think of it as splitting 13 candies among -13 friends: -13*w / -13 = 13 / -13 This simplifies to: w = -1 And there you have it! We solved the puzzle!

Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed.

Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process. For example, for every week of healthy eating treat yourself with something special. Creative visual aids. A colleague of mine decided one year for his New Year's decision to be more frugal.

Write an article based on this \\"Get an STD test. Seek treatment. Prevent outbreaks in the future.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Importance of STD Testing, Treatment, and Prevention for a Healthier Future Introduction: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a significant public health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection, treatment, and prevention are crucial in minimizing the impact of these infections on individuals and communities. This article will discuss the importance of getting tested for STDs, seeking appropriate treatment, and taking steps to prevent future outbreaks. 1. Get an STD Test: The First Step Towards Better Sexual Health Many STDs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus (HPV), often show little or no symptoms, making it difficult for individuals to know they are infected. Regular testing is essential in detecting these stealthy infections and ensuring that treatment is not delayed. Taking a proactive approach and getting regularly tested for STDs will help: a) Identify asymptomatic infections – Discovering an infection early allows for prompt treatment and prevents complications. b) Prevent transmission to others – Knowing your STD status allows you to make informed choices to protect yourself and others. c) Encourage open communication – Discussing STD testing with partners promotes honesty and trust within relationships. 2. Seek Treatment: A Vital Step for Recovery and Prevention of Complications Once an STD is identified, seeking appropriate treatment is the next essential step in managing the infection and avoiding potential health repercussions. Timely treatment ensures: a) Reduced likelihood of complications – Untreated STDs can lead to severe health issues such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and increased risk of HIV transmission. b) Prevention of transmission – Effective treatment can minimize the risk of passing the infection to others. c) Improved overall health – Treating STDs aids in maintaining a strong immune system, enabling your body to effectively combat other infections. 3. Prevent Outbreaks in the Future: Strategies to Safeguard Your Sexual Health Preventing future STD outbreaks not only protects your well-being but also contributes to the overall health of the community. Consider these essential preventive measures: a) Practice safe sex – Consistently using barrier methods such as condoms can significantly reduce the risk of contracting and transmitting STDs. b) Get vaccinated – Immunizations are available for certain STDs such as HPV and hepatitis B. Consult your healthcare provider to determine which vaccines are appropriate for you. c) Maintain open communication – Honest conversations about sexual histories, testing, and condom usage encourage partners to make responsible choices for their mutual sexual health. d) Get regularly tested – Early detection and treatment are crucial in breaking the cycle of transmission and preventing the spread of STDs. Conclusion: Taking responsibility for your sexual health is essential for maintaining overall well-being and contributing to healthier communities. By getting regularly tested for STDs, seeking timely treatment when needed, and employing preventive strategies, individuals can play a crucial role in controlling the spread of these infections. Don't let fear or embarrassment stand in your way; prioritize your health and the well-being of others by getting tested, talking openly with partners, and practicing safe sex. Together, we can work towards a future with fewer STD outbreaks and healthier sexual experiences for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To fully understand why \\"marching band\\" is the correct answer, it is essential to briefly describe and differentiate the given options: 1. Music store: A music store is a retail business that primarily sells musical instruments, sheet music, and related accessories. It is not a performing group and therefore does not require members to participate in choreographed field performances. 2. Actors: Actors are individuals who perform in various mediums, such as theater, film, and television. While some actors may be skilled in singing, dancing, or playing instruments, they typically do not participate in a choreographed group performance incorporating a specific musical instrument like the saxophone. 3. Store sells instruments: This option is similar to the music store, as it refers to a retail establishment that sells musical instruments. It does not pertain to any form of performance or choreographed movements. 4. Marching band: A marching band is a group of musicians, typically associated with high schools, colleges, or other organizations, who perform in various settings such as parades, halftime shows at sporting events, and field competitions. Members of a marching band typically play brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments while executing choreographed routines. This option perfectly aligns with the given context of playing the saxophone and performing choreographed moves on the field. 5. Orchestra: An orchestra is a large ensemble of musicians who play various instruments, primarily strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. While orchestras perform concerts and accompany various productions such as operas and ballets, their members typically remain stationary during the performances and do not participate in any choreographed movements on the field. Based on the descriptions above, it is clear that \\"marching band\\" is the correct answer. The individual, in this case, is not only playing the saxophone but is also learning choreographed moves to perform on the field with the group. This unique combination of musical and physical performance is a hallmark of marching bands, setting them apart from other musical ensembles and organizations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Simplify the equation by combining like terms. 2. Isolate the variable 'l' on one side of the equation. 3. Solve for 'l'. Step 1: Combine like terms. -581*l - 173*l can be combined as they are like terms (both have the variable 'l'): (-581 - 173) * l = -754*l The equation now becomes: -93*l - 1449 = -754*l + 15076 Step 2: Make 'l' terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Add 754*l to both sides of the equation to move the terms with 'l' to the left side: (-93*l + 754*l) - 1449 = 15076 (661*l) - 1449 = 15076 Now, we isolate the constant terms on the right side of the equation. Add 1449 to both sides: 661*l - 1449 + 1449 = 15076 + 1449 661*l = 16525 Step 3: Solve for 'l'. Divide both sides of the equation by 661 to find the value of 'l': l = 16525 / 661 l ≈ 25 The solution to the equation -93*l - 1449 = -581*l - 173*l + 15076 is l ≈ 25."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process:  - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose I have asthma now happens, how will it affect I cannot catch my breath.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of having asthma can have a direct effect on the process of breathing and talking. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty in breathing. In this scenario, the presence of asthma may affect your ability to catch your breath in the following ways: 1. Air is pulled into the lungs: The inflamed and narrowed airways in asthma can cause resistance to airflow during inhalation, making it harder to draw air into the lungs. 2. Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream: In asthma, the reduced airflow due to airway constriction may lead to less oxygen reaching the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs. Consequently, the oxygen transfer from the lungs to the bloodstream could be diminished, potentially leading to a decrease in oxygen saturation in the blood. 3. Air is pushed through the vocal cords: The presence of asthma can also affect the exhalation process, as the narrowed airways make it difficult to expel air from the lungs. This may cause shortness of breath, which may interrupt the natural flow of air through the vocal cords, making it challenging for a person to effectively and comfortably produce speech. 4. A person talks: As previously mentioned, the difficulty in breathing caused by asthma may make it more challenging for a person to effectively talk, particularly if they are experiencing an asthma attack. The person may need to pause or stop talking altogether to catch their breath. 5. Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment: Due to the constriction and inflammation of the airways, it takes more effort to force air out of the lungs with asthma. This can lead to shortness of breath and difficulty exhaling fully, which can contribute to a feeling of not being able to catch one's breath. In conclusion, the perturbation of having asthma can directly affect the process of breathing and talking, making it harder for a person to catch their breath. Asthma can impact airflow during inhalation and exhalation, oxygen transfer to the bloodstream, and consequently, a person's ability to communicate through speech."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can purchase hanging pots and hooks from any home and garden store. Hanging plants are both attractive and cat-proof! You can find deterrent sprays in the pet store that won't harm your plant, but will discourage your cat from poking around it. A good example of a safe product is “Get Off,” but always make sure to check the label before buying a deterrent product. Some of these sprays might actually hurt your plant. You can make your own deterrent spray at home, as well. Make a mixture of one part vinegar to three parts water, and spritz it onto the leaves of your plant. Cats hate the smell, and it doesn't hurt your plant! This is best done with \\"remote punishment.\\" The idea is to make the cat associate approaching the plant with something bad, like getting sprayed in the face with water. However, you don't want the cat to associate the punishment with you. You want your cat to think the punishment came out of nowhere.  Booby trap the plant by using putting a can of compressed air that's activated by a motion sensor near it. These pet-training aids can be purchased in pet stores or online. When your cat approaches plant, he'll get a blast of compressed air. This doesn't hurt him, but it'll make him think twice about approaching the plant again. For example, if you spray the cat with water or shout at him, your cat will associate the punishment with you. He may well stop eating the plant when you're around, but he'll probably keep doing what he wants when you're out of the room. Punishing the cat yourself actually makes him more devious. He also might grow a little frightened of you, which isn't the relationship you want with your pet. Put tin foil down around the plant, or a plastic carpet protector with the knobby side up. Your cat may not be willing to walk across an unpleasant surface to get to your plants. Collect and wash out empty cans — whether for canned vegetables or soft drinks. Line them up along the edge of the table where you keep your plants, then add more rows on top to form a wall. When your cat jumps up and knocks them down, the noisy clamor will send him flying. He'll think twice about approaching your plants after enough scares. This might sound quirky, but products like Silent Roar contain lion feces. Though you won't be able to smell it, your cat will, and he'll get the message that a powerful stranger has already claimed the plant as part of his territory.","output":"The article provides various methods to discourage cats from interfering with houseplants; these include using hanging pots and hooks, deterrent sprays (purchased or homemade vinegar mixture), remote punishment techniques such as motion activated compressed air, creating physical barriers using unpleasant surfaces or noisy cans, and introducing scent deterrents such as lion feces.

Q:As the counterweight began to rise the elevator began to what into the mine? - park - reduce - descend - fall - set  The best answer is A:","output":"As the counterweight began to rise, the elevator began to descend into the mine.  Step 1: Analyze the given options - park, reduce, descend, fall, and set. Step 2: Understand the context - the statement revolves around the operation of the elevator and how it responds to the action of the counterweight rising. Step 3: Evaluate the options:   - \\"park\\" is related to stopping or holding a position, which doesn't fit the context.   - \\"reduce\\" is a term associated with decreasing or lessening, which doesn't fit the context of elevator movement.   - \\"descend\\" is the act of moving downward, and since the counterweight is rising, the elevator would naturally descend in the opposite direction.    - \\"fall\\" is less controlled than descend and implies a sudden drop, which is not the expected movement for a controlled elevator.   - \\"set\\" is too vague and doesn't relate to the movement of an elevator.

This bold decision has sparked debate and put the spotlight on socioeconomic disparities within academic institutions. In her rejection letter to the prestigious Magdalen College, Nowell pointed out an \\"obvious gap\\" between the representation of minorities and white middle-class students, which she found \\"embarrassing.\\" This observation raises questions about the university's focus on diversity and inclusivity when it comes to student enrollment. The college has been under scrutiny due to similar concerns in the past, showing that Nowell's critique is both timely and relevant. By choosing not to attend Magdalen College, she is setting an example for other young people and encouraging them to analyze their educational prospects critically, taking into account factors beyond just rankings and reputation. Nowell's decision also highlights the importance of a diverse student body for an enriching educational experience. Academic institutions should strive for a degree of representation that reflects the society in which they are located, fostering an environment where students of different backgrounds can learn from and support one another. In recent years, universities and colleges worldwide have made strides in attracting a more diverse student population, but Nowell's actions prove that there is still much work to be done. It is up to these institutions to continue re-evaluating their admissions processes and financial aid policies to break down barriers and ensure that everyone, regardless of economic background, has an equal opportunity for higher education. In conclusion, Elly Nowell has opened doors to a significant conversation about socioeconomic disparities in higher education by rejecting Magdalen College. Her decision has undoubtedly placed the need for diversity and inclusivity at the forefront of the discussion surrounding academic institutions, and it is now up to these establishments to address the concerns and work towards fostering a more balanced student body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Estonia has around 600,000 employees, yet the country has a shortage of skilled labor, and since skill shortages are experienced everywhere in Europe, the government has increased working visa quota for non-EEA citizens, although it has nevertheless been criticized for being inadequate for addressing the shortages. The late-2000s recession in the world, the near-concurrent local property bust with changes in Estonian legislation to increase labour market flexibility  saw Estonia's unemployment rate shoot up to 18.8% throughout the duration of the crisis, then stabilise to 13.8% by summer 2011, as the economy recovered on the basis of strong exports. Internal consumption, and therefore imports, plummeted; and cuts were made in public finances. Some of the reduction in unemployment has been attributed to some Estonians' emigrating for employment to Finland, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere. After the recession, the unemployment rate went lower, and throughout 2015 and 2016, the rate stayed near the levels that preceded the economic downturn, staying at just above 6%. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many percentage points higher did Estonia's unemployment rate peak at compared to the 13.8% it stabiized at?","output":"To find the difference in percentage points between the peak unemployment rate and the stabilized rate, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the peak unemployment rate. From the text, we find that Estonia's unemployment rate peaked at 18.8% during the crisis. Step 2: Identify the stabilized unemployment rate. The text states that the unemployment rate stabilized at 13.8% by summer 2011. Step 3: Calculate the difference in percentage points. To find the difference, we can subtract the stabilized rate from the peak rate: 18.8% (peak) - 13.8% (stabilized) = 5% So, Estonia's unemployment rate peaked at 5 percentage points higher compared to the 13.8% it stabilized at."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - making babies - bliss - unwanted pregnancy - aids - orgasm  Explain why a human would choose \\"aids\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"aids\\" as the answer to the question above because twenty years ago, the stigma surrounding gay sex and the lack of awareness and education about safe sex practices within the LGBTQ+ community were significant issues. This led to increased risks associated with the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including AIDS. In the 1980s and 1990s, the AIDS epidemic disproportionately affected the gay community, especially gay men. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), once contracted, can progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a severe, life-threatening condition. At that time, HIV/AIDS was not as well-understood as it is today, and there were limited treatment options available. The prejudice and social stigma surrounding the LGBTQ+ community also played a role in this health crisis. Discrimination, misinformation, and fear surrounding HIV/AIDS led to further marginalization and isolation of gay men, hampering prevention efforts and access to healthcare. There was also a lack of information about safe sex practices, which contributed to the spread of HIV among gay men. Many people were uninformed about the importance of using protection like condoms during any sexual activity, and getting regularly tested for HIV and other STIs. This lack of awareness and education led to risky sexual behaviors and a higher likelihood of contracting HIV. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"aids\\" as the answer to the question of what having sex as a gay man led to twenty years ago because during that period, there was a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS due to the social stigma, lack of awareness about safe sex practices, and limited treatment options. The situation has vastly improved since then, with better education, acceptance, and advances in medical research and treatments for HIV/AIDS. However, it is still critical to remember the importance of safe sex practices and regular testing in promoting overall sexual health."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following context:  After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years.

It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below .  and the situation: James is testing the strength of electromagnetic fields. He takes two lengths of copper wire and coils them. His first coil, A, has a weaker magnetic field than his second coil, B.  Answer the following question: Which coil has a stronger electromagnetic field, A or B?","output":"Based on the provided information, coil B has a stronger electromagnetic field than coil A. To understand this conclusion, let's break down the factors that contribute to the strength of an electromagnetic field in a coil. 1. Number of turns: The strength of the magnetic field generated by a coil increases as the number of turns in the coil increases. This is because each turn contributes to the total magnetic field, and their fields add up cumulatively. In the given scenario, although the number of turns in coils A and B isn't explicitly mentioned, one can infer that coil B has more turns than coil A, given that coil B produces a stronger magnetic field. 2. Current: The strength of the magnetic field is also proportional to the current passing through the wire. The higher the current, the stronger the magnetic field will be. The description mentions that the device in the circuit is an ammeter, which measures the amount of current flowing through the wire due to the movement of the magnet or coil. Since coil B generates a more substantial magnetic field, it implies that a larger current is flowing through coil B than coil A. 3. Relative motion between magnet and coil: The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current produced, which in turn leads to a stronger magnetic field. While the problem description doesn't explicitly mention the motion in coils A and B, we can presume that for comparison's sake, both coils are subjected to similar motions. Therefore, the difference in their magnetic fields comes down to the other factors mentioned above. 4. Alternating current: The passage mentions that if the magnet is moved back and forth repeatedly within the coil, alternating current will be produced. This phenomenon doesn't have a direct impact on comparing the electromagnetic strength of the two coils. However, it's mentioned to illustrate the relationship between the movement of the magnet, the coil, and the resulting current. In conclusion, out of the two coils James is testing, coil B has a more robust electromagnetic field than coil A, primarily due to the likely higher number of turns and a larger current flowing through the wire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The movie review sentence provided is generally positive. This judgment is based on a few key phrases used in the review. Firstly, the reviewer mentions the \\"earnestness of its execution.\\" This hints at the sincerity and dedication with which the movie was made, suggesting that the efforts put into the production were commendable. Earnestness in a film's execution often refers to thoroughness, indicating that the filmmakers have taken considerable care in crafting their work. Secondly, the \\"skill of its cast\\" is highlighted as a point of praise. This implies that the performances delivered by the movie's actors were adept, believable, and possibly even outstanding. Strong performances can greatly enhance the viewer's experience, thus making this a positive aspect of the review. Lastly, the mention of a \\"familiar road with a few twists\\" suggests that while the film may tread on conventional or predictable narrative structures, it also includes unexpected turns and surprises. Depending on the perspective, this may be seen as a balanced blend of familiarity and novelty that can be appreciated. These \\"twists\\" add elements of surprise which can make a movie more engaging for the viewers.

Movie plot title: Priest Movie plot: Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city Liverpool, is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a Mass that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar. Father Matthew demands they leave the chapel.

Pick your answer from: + no + yes","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They are related in that they both deal with concerns about romantic relationships but are asking different things and seeking different types of advice. The first question, \\"What is the point in being a relationship it won't last?\\" is a more general question regarding the purpose and value of engaging in a romantic relationship that the person believes will not last. This question raises concerns about short-term relationships and their potential benefits and drawbacks. On the other hand, the second question is more specific and personal: \\"I think I love my classmate but having a romantic relationship with a schoolmate tops both of our lists of don'ts. (We won't change our school as it is the best one in town.) What should I do?\\" This question pertains to the individual's situation where they have feelings for a classmate but fear that having a romantic relationship with them might be against both of their principles, and they do not want to change schools. In response to the first question, it is essential to note that while some may argue that a relationship with an inevitable end may not be worth pursuing, others might contend that there is still value in the experience and growth that can occur during the relationship. Each individual must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks and determine whether they believe the experience is worthwhile. As for the second question, you may want to consider the following advice: 1. Evaluate the strength of your feelings: It is essential to determine if your attraction to your classmate is genuine love or just a fleeting infatuation. This can help you decide whether pursuing a relationship is worth it in the long run. 2. Engage in open and honest communication: If you believe your feelings for your classmate are genuine, have an open dialogue with them about your attraction. Discuss the reasons you both have listed romantic relationships with schoolmates as a \\"do not\\" and be honest with each other about your concerns, expectations, and priorities. 3. Explore alternative options: You could consider maintaining a friendship or finding support in a platonic relationship while still respecting both of your lists of \\"don'ts.\\"  4. Evaluate the consequences: Think about the potential repercussions of pursuing a relationship, such as potential impact on your school performance, friendships, and potential fallout in case of a breakup. Make sure both you and your classmate are willing to accept the potential outcomes. 5. Make a mutual decision: Ultimately, the decision to pursue a romantic relationship should be a mutual one based on open communication, trust, and understanding. If you both agree that the potential drawbacks outweigh the benefits, it may be best to maintain a friendship and focus on your education. In summary, both questions are about relationships, but they do not have the same meaning. The first question considers the value of a relationship that will not last, while the second is a specific question about navigating a potential romantic relationship with a classmate while adhering to personal principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village.  Which village has a lower oxygen content in the air?  Hint: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]  At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] The answer is:","output":"Steep village has a lower oxygen content in the air.  As the hint suggests, high altitude regions are those that are significantly above mean sea level, and they generally begin at about 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level. In high altitude areas, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to the combined effects of gravity, which causes air to be closer to the ground, and the heat content of the air, which causes air molecules to bounce off each other and expand. Berg village is situated at 3000 ft (approximately 914 meters), which is not considered high altitude and thus, the atmospheric pressure is higher than in Steep village. Steep village is situated at 8500 ft (approximately 2591 meters), which falls into the high altitude category, and therefore has a lower atmospheric pressure. Oxygen content in the air is directly related to atmospheric pressure. In regions with lower atmospheric pressure, there is less oxygen available, making it more difficult for people to breathe. This is why people visiting Steep village feel bad and winded, as there is lower oxygen content in the air compared to Berg village, due to its higher altitude and lower atmospheric pressure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Write some highlights for the following article: A New York taxi driver pleaded guilty Friday to involvement in a plot to blow up crowded subway trains. After entering his plea Zarein Ahmedzay delivered a message: \\"I strongly urge the American people to stop supporting the war against Islam,\\" he said, adding, \\"I am thankful for myself that I did not do anything to harm anyone but fear someone else will do the same thing.\\" Prosecutors said Ahmedzay and another man, Adis Medunjanin, conspired with Najibullah Zazi on the attack in mid-September 2009, which authorities thwarted. Zazi pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with authorities, investigators have said. Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty. During Ahmedzay's hearing, prosecutors for the first time revealed the names of the two al Qaeda leaders who, officials said, ordered the plot: Saleh al-Somali, head of international operations for al Qaeda, and Rashid Rauf, a key operative. U.S. officials said both al Qaeda figures were killed in drone in attacks in Waziristan, the tribal region along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Rauf was reported killed in a drone attack in Waziristan in November 2008; al-Somali was reported killed in December 2009, U.S. officials said. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a written statement, said the facts disclosed Friday \\"add chilling details to what we know was a deadly plot hatched by al Qaeda leaders overseas to kill scores of Americans in the New York City subway system in September 2009. This plot, as well as others we have encountered, makes clear we face a continued threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates overseas.\\" \\"Prosecution underscores the importance of using every tool we have available to both disrupt plots against our nation and hold suspected terrorists accountable,\\" Holder said. Ahmedzay previously pleaded not guilty to making false statements to the FBI about the plot. But Friday, appearing before before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold in U.S. District Court, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use a weapon of mass of destruction against people in the United States; conspiracy to commit murder; and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Ahmedzay told the court that he, Zazi and a third man traveled to Pakistan in August 2008 to join jihadists fighting in Afghanistan, but they were turned away. But al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan told the group they would be more helpful to the jihad cause if they conducted suicide attacks in New York. \\"We discussed the matter amongst ourselves, and we agreed to go forward with the plan,\\" he said. \\"I personally believed that conducting an operation in the United States would be the best way to end the wars.\\" At one point, Ahmedzay said, he began to have second thoughts but ultimately committed to the plan. He said his primary input was to develop targets because he was a taxi driver and knew the city well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process:  - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person does a lot of exercise happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"When a person engages in exercise, the body's demand for oxygen increases as the muscles require more energy to function properly. The perturbation hypothesis you proposed considers a scenario where a smaller amount of oxygen is delivered to the bloodstream during exercise. This situation could indeed have direct and indirect effects on the overall process. Direct effects: 1. Decreased oxygen supply: If the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream is reduced, it may not be sufficient to meet the increased demand of the body during exercise. This can lead to a state of oxygen deprivation or hypoxia, thereby negatively affecting the body's ability to produce energy through aerobic respiration. 2. Increased anaerobic respiration: When the oxygen supply is limited, the body may resort to anaerobic respiration to produce energy. This process is less efficient and can lead to the buildup of lactic acid in the body, causing muscle fatigue, soreness, and impaired exercise performance. 3. Reduced cardiovascular efficiency: The cardiovascular system typically responds to the increased demand for oxygen during exercise by increasing the heart rate, stroke volume, and blood pressure. However, if the oxygen supply is limited, the cardiovascular system may struggle to deliver adequate blood flow and oxygen to the working muscles, leading to diminished exercise performance. Indirect effects: 1. Decreased exercise duration and intensity: Due to the limited oxygen supply, a person may find it difficult to sustain high-intensity exercise for a long duration. This could result in a reduced caloric expenditure and slower progress towards exercise goals. 2. Adaptation or compensation mechanisms: As a response to chronic exercise with reduced oxygen supply, the body may undergo various adaptations in an attempt to compensate for the limitation. For instance, the number of red blood cells or blood vessels supplying the muscles may increase to enhance the capacity to transport and utilize oxygen. These adaptive responses may partially mitigate the negative impacts of reduced oxygen delivery on exercise performance. In conclusion, limiting oxygen delivered to the bloodstream during exercise has both direct and indirect effects on the overall process. The body's ability to generate energy, maintain cardiovascular efficiency, and adapt to these circumstances may influence the extent to which the perturbation impacts exercise performance and physiological outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On holiday in Egypt with George and Emily Hacker (Christopher Connelly and Martha Taylor), her archaeologist father and journalist mother, ten-year-old Susie Hacker (Brigitta Boccoli) is approached by a mysterious blind woman who gives her an amulet. Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find. The next day, the woman drops the Polaroid down to Mrs. Hacker from a window overlooking the pavement. Marcato's name and phone number are written... My question: Where did George and Emily find the amulet?","output":"George and Emily did not find the amulet. Their ten-year-old daughter, Susie Hacker, is the one who found the amulet. She received it from a mysterious blind woman while they were on holiday in Egypt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: Where can I ride my bicycle in order to take graduate classes? Options: - bike path - schoolyard - netherlands - street - university  Explain why a human would choose \\"university\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"university\\" as the correct option to answer the question \\"Where can I ride my bicycle in order to take graduate classes?\\" for several reasons.  Firstly, the fundamental purpose of attending a university is to pursue higher education, including graduate-level classes. Universities typically offer a wide range of degree programs, including undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate studies. They are designed to provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in their chosen fields and often employ renowned professors, researchers, and experts to teach these courses. So, if someone is specifically looking to take graduate classes, the university would be the natural and primary setting where they could access and enroll in these classes. Secondly, universities often provide extensive facilities, resources, and services aimed at supporting students in their academic journey. These include libraries, lecture halls, laboratories, research centers, study rooms, and tutoring services, to name just a few. Enrolling in a graduate program at a university enables students to fully utilize these resources to optimize their studies and academic success. Thirdly, universities help foster a stimulating and enriching educational environment that encourages intellectual growth, critical thinking, and collaborative learning. By attending graduate classes at a university, students have the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals, build networks, and exchange ideas that can be invaluable for their personal and professional growth. Now, let's briefly consider the other options: 1. Bike path: While a bike path might provide a scenic ride or an enjoyable exercise route, it does not have any direct connection to graduate classes or higher education. Riding one's bicycle on a bike path would not lead to taking graduate classes. 2. Schoolyard: A schoolyard typically refers to an open space or playground attached to a school, often meant for children or teenagers during recess or physical education classes. It is not an appropriate or relevant place for someone to attend graduate classes. 3. Netherlands: As a country, the Netherlands does have several reputable universities that offer graduate programs. However, merely riding a bicycle to the Netherlands without specifying which university one intends to attend will not allow a person to take graduate classes. 4. Street: Similar to a bike path, riding a bicycle on the street is not directly related to attending graduate classes. Streets are primarily utilized for transportation and, while they might lead to a university campus, they are not the ideal answer to the question. In conclusion, among the given options, \\"university\\" is the most accurate and logical answer for where someone can ride their bicycle in order to take graduate classes because universities are specifically designed for higher education, provide the necessary resources and environment for academic success, and offer a plethora of graduate programs to choose from."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I know if someone has blocked me on WeChat? How can you tell if you've been blocked on Facebook Messenger?","output":"While these questions may seem similar due to their focus on communication platforms and the blocking feature, they are asking about two distinct applications, WeChat and Facebook Messenger, and are not exactly the same. They ask about similar functionality in each respective app, but the answers are tailored specifically to each application, and the processes and indications of being blocked might vary between the two platforms. The first question is asking, \\"How do I know if someone has blocked me on WeChat?\\" This centers on WeChat, which is a popular Chinese messaging app used for messaging, calling, and social media. Here is a detailed answer for this question: 1. Check their Moments: WeChat Moments is a feature that works similarly to Facebook's timeline. If you cannot see any new posts from that person or their existing posts have disappeared, it could be an indication that they have blocked you. 2. Send a message: If you send a message and it remains stuck at \\"Sent\\" instead of changing to \\"Delivered,\\" it might be a sign that you have been blocked by the user. 3. Search for the user: If you try searching for the person's name, and you can't find them in the search results, they may have blocked you. 4. WeChat Sticker Shop: Visit the WeChat Sticker Shop and choose any set of free stickers. If there's an option to \\"Gift\\" the stickers to someone, search for the person in question. If they are not listed, it could mean they have blocked you. Please note, though, that these observations could be due to other reasons, such as a deactivated account, privacy settings, or network issues. It is important to consider these alternative explanations before concluding that you have been blocked. The second question is asking, \\"How can you tell if you've been blocked on Facebook Messenger?\\" This question is about Facebook Messenger and has a completely separate set of variables and signs to consider. Here is a detailed answer for this question: 1. Check for the contact’s profile picture and “Last Active” status: If you can no longer see the profile picture or the \\"Last Active\\" status of the person you suspect has blocked you, this could be an indication of being blocked. 2. Send a message: If your message doesn't get delivered, and you only see a gray checkmark (indicating \\"Sent\\"), it could mean that you have been blocked. This is not always definitive, as it might also indicate network issues or the recipient has turned off their chat feature. 3. Your call won't go through: If you attempt to call the person via Messenger, and it doesn't connect or the call is not answered, it might be a sign that you have been blocked. 4. Mutual group messages: If you share a group message with the person, you can check if you're able to view their messages in the group chat. If you cannot see their messages, it might be an indication they have blocked you. 5. Search for them on Facebook: If you are unable to find them in your friends list or through a Facebook search, it could mean that you have been blocked or they have deleted their account. Again, it is essential to consider alternative explanations such as privacy settings, deactivated accounts, or network issues before concluding that you have been blocked based on these signs. In conclusion, while both questions are about identifying whether you've been blocked on communication platforms, they specifically ask about the signs and methods for two different apps: WeChat and Facebook Messenger. The processes and indications for each application may vary, so it's necessary to treat them as separate queries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ralph was not much alarmed when Percy Paget went over and disappeared beneath the waters of the lake. He knew the young aristocrat could swim. Moreover, the end of the rowboat was within easy reach.  Percy let out one yell, and then went under. The yell was not one of fright over his safety, but over the thought that all of his elegant clothing would be wet through and through.  He made a great splashing when he came up, and soon grasped the gunwale of his boat.  \\"You rascal!\\" he spluttered. \\"Just wait till I settle with you!\\"  \\"It's your own fault that you went overboard,\\" retorted Ralph. \\"I sincerely hope that it cures your fiery temper.\\"  \\"Don't talk to me!\\"  \\"All right, I won't,\\" and without another word Ralph walked off, leaving Percy to get out of his predicament as best he could.  The young aristocrat was fearfully angry when he at last drew himself out of the lake. His hat had floated off, and he was compelled to row away from shore for it. By the time he came back Ralph had disappeared.  \\"I'll fix him for that!\\" muttered the young bully, hotly. \\"I'll fix him, see if I don't!\\"  It made Percy doubly angry to think that Ralph had been so richly rewarded for stopping the runaway team.

Explanation: The word \\"nightmare\\" generally means a scary or an upsetting dream. When we talk about a \\"nightmare\\", we usually mean something very unpleasant. So when we say \\"the nightmare of war\\", we're saying that war is very, very bad. That's why it's negative. On the other hand, positive means good or happy, but war is definitely not good or happy. Therefore, this sentence cannot be positive. It's a bit like saying a monster is actually a nice friend - sounds crazy, right? That's why the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as negative, not positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Craig is more successful than Joseph due to the negative mindset that","output":"Joseph has adopted. Joseph's negative mindset is a major barrier to his success and has consistently held him back from realizing his true potential. In comparison, Craig has fostered a positive and growth-oriented mindset, which allows him to excel and achieve greater successes. Step 1: Analyzing the situation In order to understand why Craig is more successful than Joseph, it's essential to consider their attitudes and beliefs about themselves and their capabilities. It's evident that Joseph's negative mindset makes it difficult for him to believe in his own success, whereas Craig's positive mindset opens up opportunities and encourages him to take risks. Step 2: Identifying reasons for Joseph's negative mindset There could be numerous reasons for Joseph's negative mindset, such as past failures, lack of support from family and friends, fear of success, or even low self-esteem. In any case, it's crucial for Joseph to become aware of these factors to begin making positive changes. Step 3: Highlighting Craig's positive mindset Craig's success is greatly attributed to his positive mindset. He believes in his own abilities, sets realistic and achievable goals, and approaches challenges with enthusiasm and persistence. By maintaining this kind of mindset, Craig not only increases his chances of success but also experiences personal growth. Step 4: Suggesting ways to shift from a negative to a positive mindset In order for Joseph to shift from a negative mindset to a positive one, he must identify the root causes of his negativity, develop a growth mindset, and embrace new experiences and opportunities. Additionally, seeking help from a therapist or life coach could prove beneficial in changing his way of thinking. Step 5: Evaluating the impact of a positive mindset on success As Joseph works on shifting his mindset and maintaining a positive attitude, he will likely notice improvements in his overall success and well-being. It's important for him to recognize that although external factors play a role in success, mindset is a crucial element that should not be overlooked. In conclusion, adopting a positive mindset is vital for achieving success and unlocking one's full potential. While both Craig and Joseph may have similar skills and opportunities, it's ultimately their mindset that sets them apart. With persistence and self-awareness, Joseph can work on changing his mindset and become more successful like Craig."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Killworth (27 March 1946  28 January 2008) was an English scientist known for both his work on oceanography and the study of social networks. A prolific writer, he published more than 160 scientific papers over the course of his career. He was also known for his work as a pioneering author of text interactive fiction games during the early 1980s.  - BBC BASIC is a programming language, developed in 1981 as a native programming language for the MOS Technology 6502 based Acorn BBC Micro home/personal computer, mainly by Sophie Wilson. It is a version of the BASIC programming language adapted for a UK computer literacy project of the BBC.  - The Acorn Electron is a budget version of the BBC Micro educational/home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd. It has 32 kilobytes of RAM, and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system.  - Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be \\"text-only\\", however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as \\"Puzzle-free\\", that focuses on narrative, and \\"text adventures\\" that focus on puzzles.  - Countdown to Doom is a text adventure computer game, more recently termed interactive fiction, written in 1982 by Peter Killworth. Its setting is the planet Doomawangara, which is coyly said to be shortened to \\"Doom\\".

It is more known for its computer than for its other products.  - The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987.  - The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix \\"kilo\\" as 1000 (10); therefore one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB. In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, \\"kilobyte\\" is traditionally used to denote 1024 (2) bytes. This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to such memory in digital circuitry. In this context, the symbols K and KB are often used when 1024 bytes is meant.   - Oceanography (compound of the Greek words  meaning \\"ocean\\" and  meaning \\"write\\"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Real Madrid continued their 100 per cent start to this season's Champions League  with a one-sided victory at Liverpool on Wednesday night. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a Karim Benzema double gave the current tournament holders a 3-0 lead at half-time which they didn't look back from. For Liverpool, the result was a nightmare which saw £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli substituted at half-time after a dire performance. Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives  his verdict on how the players performed. Liverpool (4-3-3) Simon Mignolet - 5.5 Failed to convince when coming for crosses and found himself embarrassed by Pepe’s prod for Benzema’s second. Atoned somewhat with super save when one-on-one with Ronaldo. Errantly tried to shepherd the ball back to","output":"his goal-line without considering Ronaldo's speed and determination, leaving him exposed and struggling to regain his composure. Needs to show more assertiveness and command of his area going forward. Alberto Moreno - 4.5 Unable to contain the threat of Real Madrid's right side and struggled to maintain his defensive responsibilities while trying to push forward. Outshone by Ronaldo and Bale throughout the game, it was a difficult night for the young fullback. Martin Skrtel - 6 On a miserable night for Liverpool's backline, Skrtel put in a commendable shift against some of the toughest attacking talents in world football. Made some vital interceptions and clearances, but was overwhelmed by Real Madrid's relentless pressure. Dejan Lovren - 5 Failed to live up to his price-tag and still seems to be struggling to adapt to Liverpool's defensive setup. Seemed off the pace and displayed weak positioning that allowed Benzema to capitalise for his goals. Has to improve if he's to prove his worth at Anfield. Glen Johnson - 4 A torrid evening for the right-back who struggled to contain Marcelo and Isco on Real Madrid's left flank. Erratic defensive decision-making and lack of contribution in attack showed that the experienced Johnson is far from his best. Steven Gerrard - 6.5 Despite the overwhelming odds against his side, Gerrard never stopped trying to drive his team forward. Some dangerous set-pieces and passing accuracy were a standout, but even his tenacity and leadership couldn't spark a comeback. Jordan Henderson - 5.5 Put in a tireless display, but couldn't quite execute on the night. Found it hard to keep up with the pace and quality of Real Madrid's midfield, rendering his impact minimal in this contest. Joe Allen - 5 A rather unremarkable showing from the Welshman. Didn't offer a significant input in either attack or defense, and was consistently outplayed by the opposition's midfield. Raheem Sterling - 6.5 Despite the Liverpool attack falling flat against a solid Real Madrid defense, Sterling continued to be a threat on the wing and had a few promising runs. However, his final product and decision-making lacked conviction, ultimately leading to few clear-cut chances. Mario Balotelli - 3.5 A dire performance from the Italian striker led to his substitution at half-time. Unable to make an impact in the final third, Balotelli's lackluster effort level and perceived disinterest led to a justified early exit. Philippe Coutinho - 6 While he showed flashes of skill, creativity, and vision, Coutinho struggled to find space in a congested midfield battleground. He was unable to provide the link-up play needed to make a difference on the scoreline. Substitutes: Adam Lallana (replaced Balotelli) - 6.5 Brought energy and creativity to Liverpool's lifeless attack but lacked the cutting edge required to pierce Real Madrid's defense. Rickie Lambert (replaced Coutinho) - 5 Worked hard but never got the service needed to make an impact in the few minutes he was on the pitch. Emre Can (replaced Allen) - 5.5 Provided fresh legs and tried to link up with the attack, but the game was well beyond Liverpool's reach by the time he was introduced. Real Madrid domination left many Liverpool players exposed and unable to make their mark on the game, highlighting the gulf in class between the two sides. For Liverpool, it's time to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to rediscover the form and flair that led them to Champions League football once again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Q: What is the name of the customer who has made the largest amount of claim in a single claim? A:","output":"To answer this question, we need to find the customer with the largest single claim.

I first specified the data I wanted to retrieve, which is the customer_name from the customers table. Then, I joined the customers and claims tables on the condition that the customer_id from both tables must match.

Este scump să devenim \\"verzi”, iar eforturile necesare restructurării fundamentale a multor sectoare în vederea atingerii scopurilor ambiţioase sunt colosale. Translate this to English?","output":"\\"It is expensive to become 'green', and the efforts required for the fundamental restructuring of many sectors to achieve ambitious goals are colossal.\\" In recent years, the concept of becoming \\"green\\" or adopting environmentally friendly practices has been increasingly emphasized as a crucial strategy for combating climate change and promoting sustainable living. The term \\"green\\" here refers to a low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially inclusive approach to development. While the concept is highly desirable, it often comes with significant costs and challenges that need to be addressed. Firstly, transitioning to a green economy requires substantial financial investments in new technologies, infrastructure, and industries, such as renewable energy, electric transportation, green buildings, and waste management. These investments may be daunting for governments, businesses, and individuals alike, as they require a considerable amount of capital and the willingness to take on risk. Additionally, the shift to a greener economy often necessitates significant policy changes and regulatory reforms. Policymakers need to implement stringent environmental regulations, enforce strict emission standards, and provide incentives for businesses and consumers to adopt green technologies. These changes may be politically challenging, as they may not receive the support of various stakeholders. There is also the issue of job displacement. As industries transition from traditional, fossil fuel-based models to more sustainable practices, many workers may face unemployment or the need for retraining and reskilling. Governments and businesses must invest in workforce development programs to equip people with the right skills and knowledge to fill the jobs created in new green sectors. Moreover, becoming green involves a fundamental transformation of social norms and values, which often takes time and effort. Encouraging people to adopt environmentally friendly lifestyles, such as reducing waste, recycling, and conserving energy, requires a shift in their attitudes and behavior. This necessitates significant investment in public awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and community engagement. Lastly, there is the challenge of global coordination and cooperation. Climate change is a global issue that requires collective action from countries worldwide. International cooperation and agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, are essential for promoting the sharing of best practices, policy coordination, and technology transfer. However, political differences and economic disparities between countries may hinder the global pursuit of a green future. In conclusion, while it is true that becoming green may come with considerable costs and challenges, the urgent need to address climate change and transition towards sustainable development demands that societies make this transformation. Any investment made towards this end will not only improve environmental quality but also benefit human well-being and the economy in the long term. The road towards a green future may be arduous, but it is a necessary one to ensure the planet's survival for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Based on the premise \\"Programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the discriminatory impact on clients that can result from public policies.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination. \\" is true?","output":"Yes, based on the premise \\"Programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the discriminatory impact on clients that can result from public policies.\\", we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination.\\" is true.  To support this conclusion, let's analyze the elements of the premise and the hypothesis. 1. Programs: The term 'programs' refers to organized activities, initiatives, workshops, or training sessions designed to achieve specific goals or objectives. In this context, the programs aim to develop more opportunities for staff members to enhance their knowledge and understanding of discrimination and its effects. 2. Discriminatory Impact: This term encompasses the unequal and unjust treatment or consequences suffered by certain individuals or groups due to public policies. Discrimination can result from biases in policy design, implementation, or enforcement. The discriminatory impact can lead to social, economic, and psychological consequences for the affected individuals or groups. 3. Public Policies: These are actions taken by governments or public authorities to address specific issues, problems, or needs in society. Public policies can be laws, regulations, or programs that guide public organizations' conduct and decision-making. However, at times, these policies may inadvertently or intentionally lead to disadvantageous outcomes for certain sections of society, thereby causing discrimination. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination.\\" Here, the focus is on programs' ability to create opportunities that help in comprehending the discrimination impact. By stating that \\"Programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the discriminatory impact on clients that can result from public policies,\\" the premise indeed supports this hypothesis. These programs educate and train staff members about the complex interplay of factors that contribute to discrimination and equip them with the skills to recognize and address such biases. Programs can involve activities such as workshops, case studies, simulations, discussions, lectures, and practical training that highlight the discriminatory impact of public policies and foster sensitivity towards people who experience this impact. Furthermore, by creating opportunities for staff to better understand discrimination and its effects, programs ultimately encourage them to make more informed and equitable decisions when designing, implementing, or evaluating public policies. This, in turn, reduces the potential for discrimination and promotes a more just and inclusive society. In summary, the hypothesis \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination\\" is true, supported by the premise which states that programs enable staff to grasp the discriminatory consequences that clients can potentially face due to public policies. These programs play a crucial role in educating and promoting awareness about discrimination and fostering a more inclusive and equitable society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do. And poor eyesight at a young age can have serious long term influence. As you get older, your eyesight can worsen. With all that in mind, don't you think it's time to give your eyes a break?

The Hollywood actor is yet another star who has been caught out in an angry rant.      Nicolas's meltdown moment occurred outside a nightclub in Romania, after filming his new movie, Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance.

It was just after 5am on Sunday morning when Cage lost his temper outside the club in Bucharest, Romania.      The incident was caught on camera by a passer-by on his mobile phone device.      The footage was later broadcast on a local television station.

I'll f*****g die because of honour. I'll f*****g die right now,' screams Nicolas in the video.      What set off the multi-million dollar actor's rage is unknown, but in the video it appears that his anger is directed towards a man and two women, who all attempt to calm him down.      Nicolas' minders were also forced to step in, trying to move the actor away from the venue.            But the group's advice falls on deaf ears, as Nicolas pulls away and screams: 'Don't ouch me you little b****.'      Moments later he heads back towards the concerned group, pretending to point two fingers in his own eyes and screaming: 'See my eyes - respect them as you'd respect me.'      After a few minutes his bodyguards finally get Nicolas into the car before it speeds away into the night.      Nicolas joins fellow Hollywood actor Christian Bale, whose own foul-mouthed angry tirade was also exposed last year.

The following year in February the audio recording of the incident was released.            On the tape you can hear Christian screaming profanities at Shane, threatening him and belittling him.            According to the actor, he lost his temper because the crew member ruined his concentration by walking onto the set during a scene. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The article reports about an incident involving Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage, who had an angry meltdown outside a nightclub in Bucharest, Romania.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How much are the year's returns projected to cover for the income in interest?\\" is \\"It will cover 750,000 and 1 million\\"?","output":"Yes, that is correct. According to the paragraph, this year's returns are projected to be between 700,000 and 1 million short of the previous year's mark. Since the interest generated on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million last year, the current year's returns would cover the income in interest in the range of 3.5 million to 3.8 million (4.5 million - 1 million or 4.5 million - 700,000)."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: If you’re giving a presentation, always include something physical for your participants to work with. Presentation handouts should summarize what you’ll be saying in your presentation and include additional figures or visuals. Include additional resources in handouts that aren’t in the presentation. For example, if your presentation was about fire safety, include a list of numbers that employees can call to report safety violations. Whether your training program is a manual, a presentation, or another medium, tell participants the goal of the program. That way, they can see how the information they’re about to receive builds up to the ultimate goal of the training. Put this goal on one of the first pages of a manual or handout.  Use an explicit statement like, “By the end of this program, you will know how to do … “ If there are multiple goals, break them up into A, B, and C for further clarity. Inform participants of the training plan so they know what to expect. If you’re giving a presentation, put a schedule on the projector or in the handouts you provide. If you’re writing a manual or module, make one of the first pages a table of contents. For long presentations, always schedule a break time. Your participants will zone out in meetings that last several hours. If you have to cover a lot of material, consider multiple sessions over a few days to hold your participants’ attention. If your training program includes multiple goals, keep those goals separate so participants can focus on one skill at a time. If you try to cover different skills in the same section, your program will be messy and hard to follow. Look at all your training goals and if necessary, break them into small sections. This will make your program much easier for participants. Organize different sections logically. For example, don’t make the first section “Interacting with Customers” and the second section “Answering the Phone.” This doesn’t make sense because “Answering the Phone” should come first. Build up to each skill by using an effective order of events. Training materials should be easy to read and refer back to. If you’re putting together a manual, explain everything as simply and quickly as you can. The same goes for handouts. Use bullet points instead of paragraphs wherever possible.  If you write in complete sentences, don’t use long paragraphs or blocks of text. Skip a line every few sentences. Breaking up the text will allow the participants to skim the information more easily. If you aren’t good at writing short, simple instructions, consider hiring a professional writer who is. Your training program will be much better and easier to follow. This advice can also apply to presentations. Don’t put large blocks of text on the projector. Use very short, readable sentences and bullet points to keep your audience’s attention. No matter what medium you use for your training materials, use visuals like charts, figures, and diagrams to help guide the participants along. It will make the information easier to follow, but more importantly, people often learn better when they see a visual representation.

It consisted of Auschwitz I (the original camp), Auschwitz IIBirkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz IIIMonowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps.  - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions.  - Franciszek Piper ( born 1941 ) is a Polish scholar , historian and author . Most of his work concerns the Holocaust , especially the history of the Auschwitz concentration camp . Dr. Piper is credited as one of the historians who helped establish a more accurate number of victims of Auschwitz - Birkenau death camps . According to his research , at least 1.1 million people perished at Auschwitz - Birkenau , of whom about 960,000 were Jewish . He is the author of several books and chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz - Birkenau State Museum .  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Following the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, nearly a quarter of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic was annexed by Nazi Germany and placed directly under the German civil administration. The rest of Nazi occupied Poland was renamed as the General Government district. The annexation was part of the \\"fourth\\" partition of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, outlined months before the invasion, in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.  - Nazi Germany maintained concentration camps (KZ or KL) throughout the territories it controlled before and during the Second World War. The first Nazi camps were erected in Germany in March 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor and his Nazi Party was given control over the police through Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and Prussian Acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring. Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers, the camps initially held around 45,000 prisoners.

The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into their opponent's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. A team consists of 6 field players and one goalkeeper in the water at any one time. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. In addition to this, teams may have substitute field players and substitute goalkeepers who are not in the water. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool 7 feet deep and players require stamina and endurance to play the game.  - Claes Arne Borg ( 18 August 1901 -- 7 November 1987 ) was a Swedish swimmer . He is best known for breaking 32 world records and winning five Olympic medals in the 1920s . In 1926 Borg won the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal , shared with Edvin Wide . Next year , at the 1927 European Championships , he set a new world record in the 1500 m at 19:07.2 which stood for nearly 11 years . Besides swimming , Borg also won a European silver medal in water polo in 1926 . His twin brother Åke was also an Olympic medalist in swimming .  - In many team sports which involve scoring goals, the goalkeeper (termed goaltender, netminder, goalie, or keeper in some sports) is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by intercepting shots at goal. Such positions exist in hurling, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, handball, field hockey, ice hockey, water polo, bandy, rink bandy, lacrosse, floorball, and other sports.  - The Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal (but usually simply called Bragdguldet, \\"The Feat Gold\\") is an annual award \\"for the most significant Swedish sports achievement of the year\\". It has been awarded by a jury led by the Swedish morning paper \\"Svenska Dagbladet\\" since 1925. According to its statutes the Medal may be awarded in November or December to either an individual sportsperson or a team. An individual can be awarded the Medal no more than twice, and to receive a second medal, that athlete must be \\"regarded a class of his own\\".  - Svenska Dagbladet (\\"The Swedish Daily News\\"), abbreviated SvD, is a daily newspaper published in Stockholm, Sweden.

One day, a young student, Elizabeth, is studying in a classroom on the third floor, when without warning, she is attacked by unseen evil forces. One of St. Mark's priests, Father Drake, attempts to save Elizabeth from the apparently demonic aggressor, but he quickly proves to be powerless against it, and the girl vanishes without a trace.The school is immediately shut down, and all of the students are removed from campus by worried families. Five years later, the school reopens. A harsh headmistress, Miss Pearce, rules the girls with an iron fist; Father Drake remains at the school as a teacher, but because of the disappearance of Elizabeth he has become a drunkard, found by Miss Pearce at a bar. Five troubled and unwanted girls are left by their families at the school: Alex, Mara, Cecilia who is blind, Leah, and Connie. The girls are strictly forbidden to go to the third floor (the site of Elizabeth's disappearance). Cecilia and Mara enter the third floor, prompting Miss Pearce to punish the responsible party.

Translate this to English?","output":"The main reason for this high number of traffic regulations is, of course, the development of the joint transport policy and its application under the changed circumstances brought about by the single market. The primary purpose of having a substantial amount of guidelines and regulations in the area of transportation is to ensure the successful implementation of the joint transport policy. This is due to the constantly changing landscape and circumstances created by the single market among various nations, leading to the need for a more comprehensive and adaptable set of rules for all parties involved. A significant advantage of having a unified transport policy is that it aids in streamlining and facilitating trade and commerce among different regions. As the single market fosters stronger economic connections, countries need to adapt and modify their transportation policies and regulations accordingly. By having a more significant number of guidelines, countries can account for variations in transportation modes, road safety, environmental concerns, and infrastructural differences. Moreover, the high number of traffic regulations ensures that there is a standardized system in place, which promotes fair competition and improved safety for all road users. It helps reduce trade barriers and simplifies cross-border travel, further promoting economic growth and collaboration among nations.

Here is a question about this article: Because the spring equinox was tied to the date of Easter, the Roman Catholic Church considered the seasonal drift in the date of Easter undesirable. The Church of Alexandria celebrated Easter on the Sunday after the 14th day of the moon (computed using the Metonic cycle) that falls on or after the vernal equinox, which they placed on 21 March. However, the Church of Rome still regarded 25 March as the equinox (until 342) and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon. In the Alexandrian system, since the 14th day of the Easter moon could fall at earliest on 21 March its first day could fall no earlier than 8 March and no later than 5 April. This meant that Easter varied between 22 March and 25 April. In Rome, Easter was not allowed to fall later than 21 April, that being the day of the Parilia or birthday of Rome and a pagan festival.The first day of the Easter moon could fall no earlier than 5 March and no later than 2 April.

Question: \\"Why don't plants need to eat like humans?\\"  Context: \\"Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Plants do not need to eat like humans because they are autotrophs, meaning they produce their own food and obtain essential elements through alternative processes such as photosynthesis and nutrient absorption from their roots and leaves. Photosynthesis allows plants to harness energy from sunlight and convert it into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates (glucose) using carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. This process occurs in structures called chloroplasts within the plant cells, and it releases oxygen as a byproduct. In addition to photosynthesis, plants absorb essential nutrients from the soil through their roots, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. This process takes place through a mechanism called cation exchange, where root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil, displacing nutrient cations attached to negatively charged soil particles and making them available for absorption. Plants also intake necessary gaseous elements from the atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen, through tiny openings called stomata on their leaves. The stomata facilitate the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen required for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. Thus, plants satisfy their nutritional and energy requirements through unique processes involving the absorption of nutrients from the soil, air, and sunlight, which eliminates the need for them to consume food in the same way as humans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work. The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Tommy secured the Who's future, and made them millionaires. The group reacted in different ways--Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which he felt was at odds with Meher Baba's ideals, and Moon spent frivolously.  During the latter part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a multi-media project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.  Entwistle was the first member of the group to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall, in May 1971.  Recording at the Record Plant in New York City in March 1971 was abandoned when Lambert's addiction to hard drugs interfered with his ability to produce. The group restarted with Glyn Johns in April. The album was mostly Lifehouse material, with one unrelated song by Entwistle, \\"My Wife\\", and was released as Who's Next in August. The album reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US. \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are early examples of synthesizer use in rock, featuring keyboard sounds generated in real time by a Lowrey organ; on \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", it was further processed through a VCS3 synthesizer. The synthesizer intro to \\"Baba O'Riley\\" was programmed based on Meher Baba's vital stats, and the track featured a violin solo by Dave Arbus. The album was a critical and commercial success, and has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA. The Who continued to issue Lifehouse-related material over the next few years, including the singles \\"Let's See Action\\", \\"Join Together\\" and \\"Relay\\".  The band went back on tour, and \\"Baba O' Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" became live favourites. In November they performed at the newly opened Rainbow Theatre in London for three nights, continuing in the US later that month, where Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times described the Who as \\"the Greatest Show on Earth\\". The tour was slightly disrupted at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on 12 December when Moon passed out over his kit after overdosing on brandy and barbiturates. He recovered and completed the gig, playing to his usual strength. Entity:","output":"The Who (English rock band)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person Amy comes to trust?

Cut out two handle pieces.\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"Creating a Fun DIY Handle for Everyday Metal Tools\\" Hey kids! Have you ever seen your parents using metal tools like spoons, forks, or other objects with handles? Handles make it easier for us to hold things without dropping them. Today we will learn how to create our own fun handles for metal tools. We only need two things: the metal tool and two handle pieces we can make ourselves. It's super easy and fun! First, we need to get some help from an adult to drill holes in the metal handle. What is a 'drill'? A drill is a tool that spins really fast, and with a special pointy part, it can make holes in different things. So, ask your grown-up to make two holes in the handle - one near the top, and one near the bottom. The holes will help us attach the handle pieces later. Now, let's talk about handle pieces. Handle pieces are small parts that we put on the metal handle to make it more comfortable and colorful. To make the handle pieces, we need materials like foam, wood, or even an old, colorful cloth. With the help of a grown-up, cut out two handle pieces in any shape you like, but make sure they are the same size as your metal handle. You can also decorate these handle pieces with markers, stickers, or glitter to make them look fancy and unique. Once your handle pieces are ready and decorated, it's time to attach them to the metal handle. First, make sure the holes we drilled earlier in the metal handle line up with the holes in our handle pieces. You might need the help of an adult to poke holes in the handle pieces, so they match with the metal handle holes. Now, let's connect the pieces together! We can use string, ribbon, or even shoelaces to tie the handle pieces to the metal handle. To do this, thread the string or ribbon through the holes and tie a knot at each end. Your handle pieces should now be securely attached to the metal handle. And, guess what? You've just created a fun, comfortable, and unique handle for your metal tool! Enjoy using your new DIY tool with a colorful handle and make sure to tell your friends about this fun project. Remember to always ask a grown-up for help when you need to use sharp tools or make holes in things. Safety always comes first!

If we consider this situation, the primary effects on a smaller white dwarf star would be changes in the distribution of matter and energy within the solar system. However, the process outlined for a red giant becoming a white dwarf would remain relatively the same. The hypothetical changes to the solar system size might have an indirect effect on the smaller white dwarf in the sense that the surrounding environment could be altered. For example, the distances between celestial bodies would decrease, possibly affecting gravitational interactions. This could influence the orbits of planets and other celestial bodies, which might, in turn, affect the white dwarf's future interactions or collisions within the solar system. Additionally, a smaller solar system may also lead to an increase in the density of interstellar medium, which could influence the cooling rate of the white dwarf. That being said, the fundamental process of a red giant evolving into a white dwarf would not be directly impacted by the perturbation hypothesis.

Answer: Slugs, like all other gastropods, undergo torsion (a 180° twisting of the internal organs) during development. Question: what is a slugs slime made out of Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided previously does not answer the question about what a slug's slime is made out of.  The slime that slugs produce is primarily made out of two types of mucus, depending on the purpose for which it is used. The first one is thin and watery, utilized for locomotion, whereas the second one is thick and sticky, which is used for protection. Let's understand these two types further. 1. To move: Slugs primarily use slime for locomotion purposes. They secrete a thin, slippery coating of mucus that serves as a lubricant to lessen friction against the ground as they glide over it. This created slime trail helps them move along surfaces smoother and faster. The chemical contents of this mucus include water, glycoproteins, and ions. 2. For protection: Slugs also produce a thick, gooey form of mucus for protection. When threatened, they can secrete this heavier, sticky slime to make themselves hard to pick up or to deter predators with its unpleasant taste. Furthermore, this kind of mucus aids in moisture retention, vital for slug’s survival, as they are prone to desiccation. Additionally, it contains the element copper, which aids in the healing of slug’s body after injury, much like our body uses iron in our blood. Another curious fact about slug slime is that it has adhesive properties. This allows them to crawl across vertical surfaces, even upside-down, without falling off. It is also reportedly difficult to remove, particularly if it dries out.  Further chemical analysis has revealed that slug slime is a highly ordered, liquid crystalline material. It shares some physical properties with both liquids and solids, which allow for its peculiar combination of flow and stickiness. In conclusion, slug slime is an intriguing substance that is not only crucial for their locomotion and protection but also displays some unique physical and chemical properties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer begins by acknowledging the background of the symphonies Schubert never finished, hinting at the fact that Schubert may have been cautious and discouraged. The use of the word \\"fragments\\" indicates that these pieces may be incomplete or lacking in some way, setting up a foundation for potential criticism. The review takes on a more negative tone as the author describes the fragments as \\"extremely minor\\" and states that they \\"show not even a spark of genius.\\" This strong, dismissive language suggests that the reviewer does not believe the content of the symphonies has much artistic value. The negativity continues as the reviewer criticizes the \\"timid reconstructions\\" by Brian Newbould, implying that his efforts to flesh out the fragments do not contribute anything substantial. The review then addresses the performances by conductor Charles Mackerras and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, characterizing them as \\"pallid\\" and \\"mincing,\\" implying that they are weak or inadequate. The use of the term \\"lackluster\\" only further highlights the reviewer's disappointment with the performances. Lastly, the review ends with a recommendation to \\"pass, unless you are a musicologist yourself,\\" suggesting that this product may only be worth considering for specialized professionals.

Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan's government has gained control of a remote town that had been under attack by fighters from a rival tribe, the nation's information minister said Monday. Some of the thousands who fled into the bush have begun to return to Pibor, said Barnaba Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information and broadcasting. Earlier Monday, a military official said that roughly 4,000 army and police reinforcements were on the way to Pibor after weekend attacks. The United Nations also said it sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol. She similarly said that the town of","output":"Lukangol, which had also suffered heavy damage during the attack by the rival tribe, was slowly beginning to recover as well. With the South Sudanese government's intervention, the attack by the Lou Nuer tribe was finally put to a stop. The arrival of army and police reinforcements, as well as the UN peacekeepers, served to quell the violence and establish a temporary sense of stability in the region. The United Nations became heavily involved in peacekeeping efforts, working closely with the South Sudanese government to help restore order and mediate between the feuding tribes. The UN sought to address the underlying grievances and tensions between the Lou Nuer and the Murle peoples to prevent future conflicts. As residents began to return to their devastated towns, humanitarian aid organizations rushed to offer assistance. International NGOs collaborated with local groups to provide much-needed food, water, shelter, and medical supplies to the affected communities. South Sudan's government made significant investments to rebuild infrastructure and restore essential services. Recognizing that the attack on Pibor was part of a larger issue – the ongoing ethnic conflict between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribes – both tribes agreed to participate in peace talks facilitated by the government and UN mediators. These talks resulted in a fragile but meaningful ceasefire agreement. The leaders of both tribes committed to working together to address the long-standing disputes over land and resources that were the root causes of their conflict. Well-aware that the peace process would be fraught with challenges, international organizations continued to provide support, funding, and resources to help the South Sudanese government and tribal leaders navigate complex negotiations. The ceasefire seemed to hold, and the situation in the town of Pibor, as well as its surrounding areas, gradually improved. Over the next few years, the international community, including NGOs and foreign governments, strongly encouraged and supported a regional development plan. This plan focused on investing in education, healthcare, agriculture, and infrastructure, to foster long-term peace and development in the region. Efforts were made to encourage economic diversification and empower local communities to become more resilient and self-sufficient. The gradual restoration of trust between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribes was crucial to stability in the area. Both sides had to learn to forgive the past and be open to a new chapter of collaboration and coexistence. This was not an easy process, and there were instances of setbacks and minor skirmishes. However, the strong commitment to peace by the tribal leaders and the support from the South Sudanese government and international community ultimately led to tangible progress and healing. In the years that followed the attack on Pibor, both tribes continued to work on their relationship and contribute to rebuilding and development efforts. Trust was slowly established through collective initiatives geared toward the well-being of the whole region, transcending the ethnic tensions of the past. The story of Pibor serves as a reminder of the power of reconciliation, understanding, and unity in overcoming hate and violence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born into a working-class Catholic family in Youngstown, Ohio, Traficant was the son of Agnes (nee Farkas) and James Anthony Traficant Sr. He was of mostly Italian and Slovak ancestry. Traficant graduated from Cardinal Mooney High School in 1959 and the University of Pittsburgh in 1963. He played quarterback for Pitt's football team, and his teammates included Mike Ditka. Traficant was drafted in the NFL's twentieth round (276th overall) by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1963, and tried out for the Steelers and the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League, but did not play professionally. He later obtained a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh (1973) and another from Youngstown State University (1976).  At the start of his career, Traficant worked as consumer finance director for the Youngstown Community Action Program. He taught courses on drug and alcohol dependency and recovery at Youngstown State University and Kent State University, as well as lecturing on drug and alcohol abuse for colleges and government agencies outside Ohio. In addition, Traficant taught at the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy. He was the executive director of the Mahoning County Drug Program from 1971 to 1981, and Sheriff of Mahoning County from 1981 to 1985. While serving as sheriff, Traficant made national headlines by refusing to execute foreclosure orders on several unemployed homeowners, many of whom had been left out of work by the recent closures of steel mills. This endeared him to the local population, which was dealing with a declining economy following the closures and relocations of steel making and steel-associated businesses.  In 1983, he was charged with racketeering for accepting bribes. Traficant, who represented himself in the criminal trial, argued that he accepted the bribes only as part of his own alleged secret undercover investigation into corruption. Traficant was acquitted of the charges, becoming the only person ever to win a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) case while representing himself.  Publicity from the RICO trial increased Traficant's local visibility. He was elected as a Democrat to Congress from Ohio's 17th District, defeating Lyle Williams, a three-term Republican incumbent. He was reelected eight times without serious opposition.

Apart from being involved in politics, Traficant had a background in education and contributed to communities by teaching courses on drug and alcohol dependency and lecturing on drug and alcohol abuse for colleges and government agencies. 3. As sheriff, Traficant gained public support by refusing to execute foreclosure orders on several unemployed homeowners, empathizing with their struggles during the decline of the local economy. 4. Traficant was charged with racketeering for accepting bribes, but successfully represented himself in the trial and got acquitted of all charges by his argument of conducting a secret undercover investigation into corruption. 5.

Gold: Gold is an excellent conductor of electricity, and it is sometimes used in small amounts in sensitive or high-value components due to its corrosion resistance. However, it is expensive and not commonly used for general wiring applications. 2. Copper: Copper is the most commonly used material for electrical wiring, as it is an excellent conductor of electricity and relatively less expensive compared to other conductors like gold and silver. Copper wire is flexible, corrosion-resistant, and can accommodate a variety of temperatures, making it suitable for both residential and industrial applications. 3. Metal: In general, metals are good conductors of electricity. Apart from gold and copper, other metals like aluminum and silver can be used in electric wiring. Aluminum is lighter and more affordable than copper but has a higher electrical resistance and corrodes easily, leading to increased risk of failure. Silver is an even better conductor than copper, but its high cost makes it less practical for everyday applications.

Article:A new report has cleared Mr McCrea of claims of inappropriate behaviour and sexual misconduct towards his staff. However, standards committee MLAs said the manner in which he occasionally treated his staff fell short of the standard they would encourage. Mr McCrea claimed the allegations were a conspiracy to force him to resign. He has faced serious scrutiny since May 2014 when his recently-formed party NI21 imploded spectacularly on the eve of a European election. Mr McCrea fell out with N121 deputy leader John McCallister over whether the party should define itself as unionist. But allegations also surfaced that Mr McCrea had engaged in bullying or sexual misconduct towards his staff. The Stormont Standards Commissioner Douglas Bain has now investigated and dismissed 12 separate complaints against Mr McCrea. The watchdog concluded that the Lagan Valley MLA was not guilty of any wrongdoing. In relation to one claim that Mr McCrea took voyeuristic photographs, Mr Bain expresses his view that some photographs presented to him had been \\"heavily doctored by a person unknown\\". The commissioner added that \\"none of these photographs was voyeuristic\\". In an accompanying report however, MLAs on Stormont's standards committee indicated their belief that Mr McCrea is not beyond criticism. They said he exercised poor judgement in allowing young women into his hotel rooms and criticised how he spoke to his staff on occasions. Mr McCrea believes the report has completely exonerated him, and he has called for sections which have been blacked out to be published in full. He has described the claims of misconduct as a political conspiracy and claimed they were made in an attempt to derail his career. The police have confirmed that a file has now been forwarded to the Public Prosecution Service following a separate matter involving Mr McCallister, who brought forward some of the claims. Mr McCrea described the complaints as \\"a complete and utter set-up\\". \\"This was an attempted political assassination and people went to extraordinary lengths to try and implicate me,\\" he said. \\"I'm fortunate that because of the way I conduct business, I was able to prove the contrary to what people were alleging.\\" The complaints led to a bitter split in NI21, and Mr McCallister left the party a short time later. He and Mr McCrea had quit the Ulster Unionist Party in 2013, setting up NI21 a few months later. In a statement, Mr McCallister said: \\"I am thankful that this long and difficult process has now drawn to a conclusion. \\"My desire throughout was that the allegations should be independently examined. It is my hope that the publication of this report will bring some sense of closure to all involved.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"1.

Q: What are the two possible reduction products for brf3?    Choices:  - brg and brf  - brf2 and brf4  - brf and brf4  - brf and br2  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine the two possible reduction products for BrF3, let's follow these steps: 1. Identify the oxidation state of the bromine atom in BrF3. In the case of BrF3, the oxidation state of bromine (Br) is +3, as fluorine (F) has an oxidation state of -1. 2. Determine the possible oxidation states for bromine in the products:    a. BrG does not exist. It would mean replacing fluorine with a \\"G\\" element, which is not realistic.        b. In BrF2, the oxidation state of bromine would be +1, as fluorine maintains its oxidation state of -1.        c. BrF4 cannot be considered as a reduction product, as it would represent an increase in the oxidation state of bromine from +3 to +5.        d. In BrF, the oxidation state of bromine would be -1, which is its most basic state (reduction).        e. In Br2, bromine is in its elemental form with an oxidation state of 0. 3. Compare the oxidation states of the products to the original compound, BrF3:    - BrF2 (oxidation state of +1) represents a reduction relative to BrF3 (oxidation state of +3).    - BrF (oxidation state of -1) represents an even more extreme reduction relative to BrF3.    - Br2 (oxidation state of 0) also represents a reduction relative to BrF3. Based on this analysis, the two possible reduction products for BrF3 are: - BrF2 and BrF - BrF and Br2 So, the answer is:  - brf and brf2  - brf and br2"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"The legendary character who turned everything he touched into gold is King Midas, a figure from ancient Greek mythology. The story of King Midas is one of the most famous tales in Greek mythology, often referred to as \\"The Golden Touch\\" or \\"The Midas Touch.\\" King Midas was a wealthy and powerful ruler of the ancient kingdom of Phrygia, situated in modern-day Turkey. He was known for his extraordinary love for gold and material wealth, which led him to ask the gods to grant his greatest desire – the ability to turn everything he touched into gold. The story goes that one day, while King Midas was walking in his garden, he came across the drunken god Silenus, a companion of Dionysus, the god of wine and festivities. Recognizing Silenus, the kind-hearted king offered him food and shelter. In gratitude for his hospitality, Dionysus granted Midas a single wish. Midas, blinded by greed, wished that everything he touched would turn into gold. Dionysus, aware of the potential consequences, reluctantly granted him the wish, but warned him to think carefully about his decision. Thrilled with his new powers, Midas started touching everything around him, and all the objects transformed into shimmering gold. However, his joy soon turned into horror when he realized the devastating consequences of his wish. Every time Midas tried to eat or drink, his food and water turned into gold. Even worse, when he tried to embrace his beloved daughter, she too transformed into a lifeless golden statue. The curse had turned his life into a living nightmare. Desperate and full of remorse, King Midas begged Dionysus to reverse the curse. The god took pity on him and told Midas to wash himself in the waters of the River Pactolus to remove the golden touch. Midas did as he was instructed and was finally rid of the curse. From that day forward, he learned the hard way that there were more important things in life than material wealth. The story of King Midas serves as a cautionary tale against greed and an allegory for finding balance and appreciating the non-material aspects of life. The phrase \\"Midas touch\\" has since become synonymous with possessing an extraordinary ability to generate wealth, though its origins remind us to be wary of the potential pitfalls that such wealth can bring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra   which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do? Question: to face the music\\" is also used to mean that soldiers were not willing   _  .

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who is reminded of Kaecilius by Strange's arrogance and ambition? from the following article ?  In Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.

Article: When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out  the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity  and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which musical has music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and cast non-white actors as the founding fathers? A:","output":"A: The musical that features music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and casts non-white actors as the founding fathers is \\"Hamilton: An American Musical.\\" This groundbreaking production has been praised for its innovative approach to both the subject matter and the casting. \\"Hamilton: An American Musical\\" is a sung-through musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the United States' founding fathers, incorporating elements from his early life, career, personal life, and political achievements. The musical combines elements of traditional musical theatre with contemporary music styles such as hip-hop, R&B, and pop, which help to illustrate the revolutionary spirit of the story. Lin-Manuel Miranda, a multi-talented composer, lyricist, and actor, is the creative force behind the musical. He first conceived of the idea after reading Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton. Inspired by the life of this influential yet often overlooked historical figure, Miranda set out to create a production that would both entertain and educate audiences about the life and legacy of Hamilton. One of the most distinctive and talked-about aspects of \\"Hamilton: An American Musical\\" is its casting of non-white actors in the roles of the founding fathers and other prominent historical figures. Miranda has stated that this choice was deliberate, as he wanted the show's cast to reflect the racial and cultural diversity of present-day America. By casting actors of color in the roles of these influential figures, the production challenges conventional notions of who these figures were and highlights the contributions of non-white individuals in shaping the history of the United States. This casting decision also invites audiences to re-evaluate their perceptions of race and ethnicity and to recognize the similarities between the struggles faced by marginalized communities during Hamilton's time and those faced by people of color today. Additionally, the use of rap and hip-hop music styles in the show serves as another way to bridge the gap between past and present, allowing for historical narratives to be presented in a manner that feels contemporary and accessible to modern audiences. In summary, \\"Hamilton: An American Musical\\" is a unique and powerful production that weaves together the life story of Alexander Hamilton with the music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and distinguishes itself through its casting of non-white actors in the roles of the founding fathers and other historical figures. By blending traditional musical theatre with contemporary musical styles and casting choices, the show breaks new ground in terms of storytelling and representation on stage, making it a standout example in the world of theatrical productions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Years later, Barbara meets and instantly falls in love with Nick (Tonton Gutierrez), who is mutually smitten with her. But the spoiled Ruth (Dawn Zulueta) confesses to her older sister that she too is in love with Nick and threatens to kill herself if he does not marry her. So with a heavy heart, Barbara once again passively accommodates Ruth's demands and convinces Nick to court her younger sister instead. In a twisted act of devotion, Nick reluctantly agrees to marry Ruth, to prove his love for Barbara. After the wedding, Barbara then decides to start a new life abroad, to give Nick a chance to truly fall in love with Ruth and for Barbara to get over her feelings for him.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Překlad detailní a dlouhé odpovědi: Ve výše uvedené větě se muž obrací na svého přítele a sděluje mu své přesvědčení, že francouzské meče jsou ty nejlepší. Historie francouzských mečů a šermu sahá až do raného středověku, kdy se v Evropě začali rozvíjet šermířské dovednosti a zručnosti. Francouzské meče sluly svou kvalitou a precizností, které byly založeny na jejich odborných zkušenostech a tréninku. Francouzské meče těžily z detailních znalostí na poli kovářství a jejich následná zručnost v boji je činila téměř legendárními. Mezi nejznámější francouzské meče patří fleret, kord a šavle, které byly běžně používány ve vojenských i soubojových situacích. Navíc šermířské umění \\"escrime\\" bylo ve Francii velmi populární, což zřejmě přispělo k jejich pověsti vysoce respektovaných a účinných mečů. Velká pozornost byla věnována i designu francouzských mečů. Byly často zdobeny detailními rytinami a elegantními dekoračními prvky, které z nich činily nejen smrtící zbraň, ale i umělecké dílo. Také muzea po celém světě nyní zobrazují příklady francouzských mečů, kde návštěvníci mohou obdivovat jejich úžasnou kvalitu a krásu. Současný šerm, který je také součástí moderních olympijských her, má své kořeny v tradičních francouzských mečích a šermířských technikách. Jejich vliv se tak rozšířil po celém světě, a i když na bojišti již dnes meč není hlavní zbraní, tradiční francouzské meče a umění šermu stále žije v srdcích a myslích nadšenců a sportovců. Z hlediska učení a metodologie byl francouzský šerm známý svými inovativními a pokrokovými technikami a taktikami, které do jisté míry ovlivnily vývoj mečů a dalších zbraní. Bez ohledu na to, zda se jedná o různé postupy útoku nebo obrany, francouzská škola šermu byla považována za jednu z nejlepších a nejprestižnějších. Konečně lze říci, že hrdost na francouzské meče a šerm je hluboce zakořeněna v historii a kultuře Francie. Zatímco mnoho jiných zemí mělo také své výjimečné meče a šermířské tradice, francouzské meče a šerm zůstávají v očích mnoha lidí symbolem dokonalosti, elegance a dovednosti."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was defeated in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War? from the following article ?  The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rocket artillery were developed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km (1 mi) range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica (2008):  Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Tipu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person who was defeated in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War is Sultan.

Title: beautiful picture but sound issues Review: This is a nice TV with a beautiful picture and lots of inputs, but ... and it's a big but, it has sound issues galore.You'll will see in the discussion thread this had issues from a high pitched sound and other issues of HDMI sound drop outs.I returned one and got a replacement because I like the TV so much, but that also has the sound issue so I'm giving up and returning it.If asked around and several people have had similar issues with different models, so I think it's a Samsung thing in general.It's a shame, I really wanted the TV, but it doesn't matter how nice the picture is if sound and noises are ruining the whole experience. Answer: Answer:","output":"The product review provided can be considered as a mixed one. While there are elements of positivity in the review, it skews more towards negative due to the significant problems the reviewer faced with the sound quality, prompting them to ultimately return the product.  The positive aspects of the review include complimenting the TV's beautiful picture and appreciating the availability of multiple inputs. Furthermore, the reviewer was impressed enough by the TV that they even exchanged it for a replacement, implying that they were initially willing to overlook the sound issues. However, the negative aspects of the review outweigh the positives. The most concerning issue for the reviewer was the sound quality, which they described as being plagued by issues such as high-pitched sounds and HDMI sound dropouts. The fact that these problems persisted in both the original and the replacement units, as well as being present in different Samsung models as per the narrator's findings, further undermines the overall satisfaction level in the review.  In conclusion, while there are some positive elements in the reviewer's experience, the emphasis on the sound issues and the ultimate decision to return the product suggest that the review leans more towards negative than positive. The reviewer's closing statement highlights the degree of dissatisfaction in the product, stating that no matter how nice the picture is, the sound and noises ruin the overall experience."},{"instruction":"Q: What part of the plant is the main site of photosynthesis?

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Man is the most intelligent animal created by God because God has given him language which other animals do not have. Communication makes life extremely convenient and easy. Language plays a very important role in life as any emotion can be easily and effectively conveyed   through language to anyone. But all this is applicable and beneficial only to human beings. What about animals? How do they communicate with each other? We all know that animals do not have the ability to use language as a medium for communication. But they do have other means of conveying messages to other animals, of which use of body language is the most important one. The messages can be of many types like conveying food location, danger alarms, appreciation of good deeds like helping other animals in dangerous situations, etc. There are two main types of communication in animals: verbal   communication and non-verbal communication. Sound is one of the most common types of verbal communication in animals, and majority of the species use it as the medium to convey messages. Bats have to rely on sound waves to communicate. They mostly rest in the morning and become active at night to search for food and do other tasks. All the birds communicate through their chirping. Mammals generally make use of sounds to give calls to other members of their community. Whales are the perfect examples, which use sound waves for communication. They have a whale song, which they repeat after regular intervals. Facial Expressions This kind of communication is mostly found in dogs. When they are angry, they show their teeth and raise their ears. On the other hand, when they are frightened, they pull their ears behind and open their mouth. Also, in birds, when the parent bird brings food for the offspring, the begging expression can be observed on the offspring's face. Gestures and Body Movements This type of communication is common not only in animals, but in human beings too. All human beings, although they use language for communication, tend to use...

To establish a connection between the two statements, additional information would be required to create a link between the two situations. For example, if the description stated, \\"A mother and daughter are discussing an upcoming camping trip at the kitchen table while drinking coffee, and the daughter mentions that her husband and her father are planning to join them,\\" we could then better understand the connection between the two scenarios, and we could infer that the father and son are indeed preparing for the camping trip.

Story continuation: Jessica's wrist hurt so she took off the hot pack and applied some ice because the ice was helpful. As she gently placed the ice pack over her wrist, she could immediately feel the cooling sensation begin to seep through her aching muscles, providing instant relief. As she sat on her couch, nursing her wrist, she tried to recall what had caused the injury in the first place. Over the weekend, she had participated in a charity marathon, pushing herself to complete the grueling 26.2 miles for a cause close to her heart. In her exhaustion, she must have taken a nasty spill, laboring now to minimize the swelling and numb the pain. Jessica decided to rest her wrist for a few more minutes before attempting to use it for any activity. She had read that alternating between hot and cold treatments could help with muscle recovery, and so far, the advice seemed to be working. While the hot pack had loosened up the tight muscles and improved circulation, the ice was now playing its part in reducing inflammation and numbing the pain. Over the next few days, Jessica continued to baby her wrist, careful not to overexert or strain it further. She made an appointment with her local sports physician to check the extent of the injury and receive professional guidance on rehabilitation. As the pain in her wrist subsided, thanks to the relief brought about by the helpful ice pack, Jessica felt reassured that she was on the right track to recovery. In the future, she made a mental note always to take adequate precautions, balance her training, and listen to her body.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the place that Gloria makes amends to?, using the article: Gloria is an unemployed writer struggling with alcoholism. Her errant behavior prompts her frustrated boyfriend Tim to break up with her and evict her from their New York City apartment. Forced to move back to her hometown in New England (the fictional Mainhead), Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria; he brings her an old television set for her unfurnished house and offers her a job at the bar to help her, which Gloria accepts. Working at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. Each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian monster appears in Seoul, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and is able to remotely control the monster's movements, which mirror her own. Gloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends; however, when Oscar steps onto the playground, he causes a giant robot to appear in Seoul. Gloria ultimately tries to make amends by having the monster spell out an apology in Korean, to the delight of the South Koreans and the media, and begins to avoid both the playground and alcohol. After spending the night with Joel, Gloria discovers that a drunken Oscar is using the robot to taunt South Korea. After a tense confrontation, Gloria manages to make him leave. Oscar is jealous, believing that something happened between Gloria and Joel. Later that night at the bar, he drunkenly insults his friends and demands that Gloria drinks, then orders her to do so by threatening to return to the playground if she does not.

The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

Process:  - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more sunlight during the day happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"In the photosynthesis process, sunlight is a critical factor as it provides the energy required to fuel the process. When sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant, the energy absorbed is utilized to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen, which is then released back into the environment. The perturbation hypothesis that you present considers a scenario where there is more sunlight during the day. In general, an increase in sunlight should lead to more energy being available for the photosynthesis process. However, the hypothesis questions whether this increase in sunlight would result in less sugar (glucose) and oxygen being produced. To analyze the impact of increased sunlight on glucose and oxygen production, we need to consider several factors: 1. Rate of Photosynthesis: An increase in sunlight generally enhances the rate of photosynthesis, as there is more energy available for the process. However, plants may have an optimal sunlight level beyond which they experience no additional benefit. This means that past a certain point, increasing sunlight may not lead to increased photosynthesis rates, and as such, will not directly result in less glucose or oxygen production. 2. Plant's Physiological Adaptations: Plants have evolved to optimize their use of sunlight and prevent damage from excess sunlight. In the case of more sunlight, plants may respond by altering their photosynthetic machinery or orientation to avoid excess light and maximize their photosynthetic efficiency. Some plants can also regulate the opening and closing of stomata (small openings in leaves) to regulate gas exchange. These adaptations help plants maintain optimal photosynthesis rates but may not necessarily result in less glucose and oxygen production. 3. Environmental Factors: An increase in sunlight may create higher temperatures, which can directly impact the rate of photosynthesis. Higher temperatures can lead to more rapid water loss from plants, causing them to close their stomata to conserve water. This action reduces the availability of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, affecting the production of glucose and oxygen. Moreover, extremely high temperatures can damage the photosynthetic apparatus in the plant, reducing its ability to produce glucose and oxygen. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis proposes that an increase in sunlight during the day could affect the production of glucose and oxygen. While more sunlight generally stimulates the photosynthesis process, there may be situations where a plant's physiological adaptations, environmental factors, or limitations in the rate of photosynthesis could lead to less sugar and oxygen production. However, these conditions would most likely be indirect effects of increased sunlight rather than direct impacts on the photosynthesis process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Political Aide Alastair Campbell was best known as Director of Communications and Strategy for which British Prime Minister?","output":"Alastair Campbell is best known for serving as the Director of Communications and Strategy for Tony Blair, who served as the British Prime Minister from 1997 to 2007. Tony Blair was the leader of the Labour Party and held the position of Prime Minister for three consecutive terms, making him one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers in British history. Born in 1957, Alastair Campbell initially pursued a career in journalism, writing for various newspapers and working as a Political Editor for the Daily Mirror. His journalistic career, which spanned over a decade, earned him a considerable reputation as a shrewd political commentator. In the early 1990s, Campbell became more involved with the Labour Party, and his long-lasting association with Tony Blair began. He became Blair's press spokesman in 1994 after Blair became the leader of the Labour Party. Through Blair's successful 1997 election campaign, Campbell played a pivotal role in shaping the party's image and message, leading to the landslide victory that brought the Labour Party into power after 18 years of Conservative rule. Once in office, Campbell was appointed as the Downing Street Press Secretary. However, he had a much broader role than a typical press secretary, as he was responsible not only for managing the Prime Minister's media relations but also for developing long-term strategies that aimed to achieve the government's overarching goals. His role was later expanded to include setting communications strategy and policy, earning him the title of Director of Communications and Strategy. Alastair Campbell played a particularly important role in promoting New Labour's modernizing agenda and its focus on pragmatism, which aimed to balance the demands of both the center-left and center-right political factions. Moreover, he was instrumental in shaping several significant policy initiatives, such as the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and the government's response to the 9/11 attacks. However, Campbell also faced several controversies during his tenure, most notably regarding the \\"dodgy dossier\\" on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The dossier's inaccurate claims led to widespread criticism and raised questions about the government's case for military intervention in Iraq. Campbell later resigned from his post in 2003, amid increasing political pressure and personal reasons. After leaving the government, Alastair Campbell has continued to be involved in a variety of activities, including writing, political commentary, and working with various charities. While his career has been marked by both triumphs and controversies, he remains a key figure in the story of Tony Blair's premiership and the development of modern political communication in Britain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The first Prime Minister of Ceylon when it became independent on 14 October 1947 was Don Stephen Senanayake. He emerged as a prominent political figure in Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka) and played a vital role in leading the country towards independence from British rule. As the leader of the United National Party (UNP), Senanayake became the first head of government of the newly independent nation. Don Stephen Senanayake was born on October 20, 1884, in the village of Botale, which is situated in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. He came from a family with strong political connections that would later support him in his political career. His father, Don Spater Senanayake, was a renowned village leader and a local Mudaliyar, while his brothers, Don Charles Senanayake and Frederick Richard Senanayake, both served in the State Council of Ceylon and were actively involved in the struggle for independence. Senanayake's journey into politics began when he was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council in 1916. Later, he was appointed as a representative of the Legislative Council of Ceylon in 1924, where he championed the cause of agrarian reform and furthering the interests of local industries. He was subsequently chosen as a member of the State Council of Ceylon in 1931, and by 1936, he had been appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Lands. Through his work in the State Council, Senanayake was able to connect with various political leaders who similarly sought independence for their homeland. In 1943, he united these leaders and formed the United National Party (UNP), which rapidly gained popularity across Ceylon. As the leader of the UNP, Senanayake negotiated with the British government for a smooth transfer of power, leading to the successful attainment of independence on 14 October 1947. Upon assuming the role of the first Prime Minister of Ceylon, Senanayake focused on the development and modernization of the country. He implemented policies aimed at improving infrastructure, promoting agricultural growth, and ensuring rapid industrialization. Furthermore, he emphasized the establishment of a united multi-ethnolinguistic nation by advocating for religious, cultural, and linguistic tolerance. During his tenure, Senanayake worked toward maintaining a close relationship with the British Commonwealth and pursued a neutral stance in global political affairs. Tragically, his life and term as Prime Minister were both cut short when he died in a horse-riding accident on March 22, 1952. In conclusion, Don Stephen Senanayake was the first Prime Minister of Ceylon when it gained independence from British rule on 14 October 1947. A prominent politician who served as the leader of the United National Party, he played an instrumental role in securing independence for Ceylon and shepherding the nation in its initial years of self-governance. Senanayake's contributions to modernizing the country and advocating for harmony amongst its diverse communities are still revered today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Fred Durst sang well and the melodies were extremely creative and addicting. The guitar was amazing and the unique time changes really amazed me.

Article: At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor. Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, most of them being boys. Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform and distribution, the dramatic growth in university education, and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66, overall public school enrolments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser. During the 1960s, the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably. Now answer this question: How many middle class were in Egypt in 1950s","output":"The article states that there were four million people considered middle class in Egypt in the early 1950s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

Where Christine had an affinity for the elegance and majesty of horse racing, Jessica found the thrill and speed of dog races exciting and unpredictable. 1) Christine placed their bet on Lassie. As the sun climbed into the sky and the aroma of freshly cut grass filled the air at the racetrack, Christine patiently studied the list of horses and jockeys. She was experienced in the art of handicapping and meticulously reviewed the various factors that might impact the outcome of the race. After much contemplation, she decided to place her bet on a promising young filly named Lassie. Lassie had an impressive lineage, strong connections in her trainer and jockey, and a quick, light-footed stride. Smiling confidently, Christine walked to the ticket counter. The atmosphere was electric, a sea of people buzzing with anticipation for the upcoming race. She handed over her money and secured her tickets, optimistic about her selection. Returning to her seat, Christine eagerly awaited the race, transfixed by the beauty and grace of the equines on the field. 2) Jessica placed their bet on Lassie. On the other side of town, Jessica excitedly weaved her way through the crowded aisles of the dog track. Dogs barked and howled in the background, and the air was thick with the scent of hot dogs and sweat. Clutching her racecard, Jessica scrutinized each entry, weighing their merits and flaws. One dog, in particular, caught her eye—a sleek, powerful greyhound named Lassie. With a broad grin, she murmured to herself, \\"Great minds think alike, Christine,\\" acknowledging the serendipitous choice of the shared name with Christine's horse. Jessica approached the betting window, her heart racing with anticipation as she placed her bet on Lassie. Lassie's record had been impressive recently, and the dog's owner was known for training champions. The track conditions were also ideal for a dog like Lassie. Jessica felt a rush of pure excitement, her adrenaline surging as she thought about the pending race. As both friends settled into their respective seats at the horse and dog tracks, they had no idea that their fates were intertwined by the daring bets they were both placing on their beloved Lassie. As tensions mounted and the races began, Christine and Jessica held their breath, anxiously waiting to see if their intuition and research had led them to success. There they were, Christine and Jessica, united in their love for betting, yet separated by their preferences of the sport. They found camaraderie in their enthusiasm, and both enjoyed the heightened emotions that accompanied the chance of winning big.

Catching Fire, out in Chinese theaters on Nov 21, is set in a futuristic society called Panem. Every year its government holds a televised fight to the death. Two teenagers from each of the 12 districts of Panem are chosen to compete. In the new film, last year's victors Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her partner Peeta are back home after winning the 74thHunger Games. Katniss just wants to live a normal life. However, that never seems to happen. She has nightmares, which remind her that she is a killer. Her worst nightmare comes true when the annual Hunger Games arrive again. The teenager finds herself back in the competition along with Peeta. Since Katniss brings hope to Panem through her courage, President Snow plans to use this year's Games to kill off Katniss and Peeta and in turn _ the fires of rebellion. \\"This is the next step of Katniss' heroism and the next part of her journey to finding out who she is really going to be,\\" Lawrence told Reuters.

Oscar Pistorius Murder Trial for Reeva Steenkamp's Death Good morning from the North Gauteng High CourtHere's what we expect from day 23 of the Oscar Pistorius trial- Gerrie Nel will continue his cross-examination of Pistorius for day five. Pistorius has now been on the stand for seven days.- We expect Nel to focus on what happened after he found Reeva Steenkamp in the toilet after he shot her. Here's a summary of what we heard on day 22 of the Oscar Pistorius trial - Nel started by quizzing Pistorius on why Reeva's jeans would have been on the floor if everything else pointed to the fact she was a neat person.- He then moved to the blue LED light Pistorius said he saw on the night of the shooting. Nel put it to him his version couldnt be true as the amplifier was on, and there were other lights on as well on the sound system, which he would have seen in the night.- He asked OP about Reeva eating within two hours of her death, something Pistorius could not explain.- Nel said it was improbable that Reeva could have gone downstairs to eat as the alarm would have gone off.- Nel then asked who OP remembered going upstairs from the police first. OP said he remembered a policeman, and then Col van Rensburg. He later admitted he could not disagree with Van Rensburg's version that he wasn't the first on the scene.- Nel pointed out the fan - in Van Rensburg's version - was in the spot in the photo shown to OP previously and not where he put it. OP disagreed.- Nel then pointed out there was blood splatter on the duvet and on the carpet, Nel said the duvet was on the floor, OP denies this. Nel says it must have been \\"sheer luck\\" that the policeman put it in that particular spot as Pistorius alleges- Nel pointed out Pistorius lied when he said he whispered to Steenkamp, and now says it was talking softly. Pistorius initially denies he lied, then says it was a mistake.- Nel points out that the window sliding open and hitting the window frame is not in OP's bail application or plea explanation.- He then asks OP what he shouted as he went down the hall. OP says \\"Get the f*** out, get the f*** out\\" then breaks down and cries. Says later it was the trauma that made him cry.- Crucially Nel then got Pistorius to admit he wasn't using the Putitive Self Defence defence, by admitting he didn't fire at the perceived danger, but that it was an involuntary discharge. This is a massive change in the defence.- Nel said to Pistorius he fired \\"at Reeva\\". \\"I didn't fire at Reeva\\" he answered breaking down again.- Nel said the wood sound Pistorius claims to have heard that made him shoot was the magazine rack, and that he heard it when Reeva fell, \\"you changed aim\\" Nel said, OP denies this.- Nel got OP to say defence tested his screams, but Nel asks why this was never played to the court witnesses to hear if it was they heard.- After lunch Nel grilled Pistorius on how Reeva walked in the dark to the bathroom, OP said she may have used her cellphone as a light. \\"Then you would have seen it\\" Nel snapped back.- Nel got Pistorius to say \\"I blame myself for taking Reeva's life\\"- Nel also quizzed Pistorius on his jump from thinking it was intruders to thinking it was Reeva.

This resulted in Pistorius admitting to mistakes and changing aspects of his testimony.  In the preview of day 23, it is expected that Nel would continue the cross-examination, concentrating on what happened after Pistorius found Steenkamp in the toilet after shooting her.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How can I draw a picture on glass so that it doesn't wash off easily? Select from: +Use a colored pencil. +Use a permanent Sharpie marker.","output":"To determine which solution is better for drawing a picture on glass that doesn't wash off easily, I will analyze the properties and effectiveness of each option: 1. Using a colored pencil: Colored pencils generally use a combination of wax and pigment to create color. While they may work on glass surfaces, they can be easily smudged, scratched off, or washed away with water. 2. Using a permanent Sharpie marker: Permanent Sharpie markers use a combination of permanent ink and a solvent that allows the ink to dry quickly. Once the ink is dry, it becomes resistant to water and can be difficult to remove from non-porous surfaces like glass. Step-by-step analysis: - Colored pencils are designed primarily for use on paper or other porous surfaces, not on non-porous surfaces like glass. - The wax in colored pencils is not water-resistant or permanent, making it ill-suited for our goal of creating a picture on glass that doesn't wash off easily. - Permanent Sharpie markers are specially designed for use on a variety of surfaces, including glass. - The ink in a permanent Sharpie marker is water-resistant, making it difficult to wash off from non-porous surfaces.

Here is a hypothesis: Lamar Alexander's campaign is breaking records and gaining steam. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Analyzing the given premise and hypothesis, it is important to take a closer look at the factors surrounding Lamar Alexander's campaign and discern whether there exists any correlation or causality. The premise provided – \\"The cloud of doom over Lamar Alexander's campaign\\" – implies that his campaign is experiencing or facing issues that threaten its success. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that Lamar Alexander's campaign is \\"breaking records and gaining steam,\\" suggesting substantial success and growing momentum. To conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, we must consider two potential scenarios: 1. The problems associated with the \\"cloud of doom\\" are stimulating the campaign to break records and gain momentum. 2. The premise and hypothesis are unrelated or contradictory to each other. Scenario 1: Problems stimulating campaign success In this scenario, the underlying assumption is that the issues associated with the \\"cloud of doom\\" are, in fact, galvanizing the campaign to achieve new heights in terms of records and momentum. Although this situation is not impossible, it is generally unlikely. A series of negative events or problems in a campaign might sometimes motivate campaign management and supporters to work harder and push for greater success. However, the \\"cloud of doom\\" phrase suggests a degree of severity and negativity that can lead to unwanted consequences like loss of confidence and decreased support from the public. Consequently, it is improbable for a campaign experiencing severe difficulties to consistently break records and gain momentum. Based on this analysis, it is hard to establish a direct correlation between the premise and the hypothesis in this scenario. Scenario 2: Unrelated or contradictory premise and hypothesis In this situation, it is imperative to consider if the premise and hypothesis are unrelated or even contradictory. In doing so, it becomes clear that the premise and hypothesis appear to be conflicting statements, as one claims a negative situation (cloud of doom) while the other asserts significant success and growth for Lamar Alexander's campaign. There is no apparent connection that would necessarily imply that if the premise is true – i.e., the campaign is facing a cloud of doom – then the hypothesis of the campaign breaking records and gaining steam is also true. Instead, the two propositions seem contradictory, which would make it highly unlikely for both to be accurate simultaneously. Conclusion: Upon assessing the premise and hypothesis, it is evident that no direct correlation or causality exists between the two propositions. As such, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis present conflicting ideas, and when considering their incompatibility, it would be more reasonable to deduce that the two claims cannot coexist truthfully."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can do this either using a Sharpie for a simple circuit or a printed out version from a computer program. Only one of these is needed, so select according to your preference. The schematic should contain a detailed description of all parts, as well as easy to follow connections. If no simulation program is used, assemble and test one or more prototypes of the circuit on a breadboard. Breadboards are very easy to use, and allow one to view the results of a circuit in real time without the need for solder or permanent etches.  Circuit boards are about a dollar apiece, and are simply a layer of copper over an insulator. The typical size is usually 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) by 5 inches (12.7 cm). Drawing is simple; all that is required is an indelible marker, such as a Sharpie. A ruler is also helpful. (Skip this step if you aren’t using the computer program and are using the Sharpie method.) Print the design out from the software's print menu. Make sure the print is on a glossy paper (like those in magazines or separate glossy paper).  Turn on the electric iron (the same one used for clothes). Carefully cut out the design and position it on the circuit board. Put the hot iron directly on top of the circuit board for about 45 seconds. Take the circuit board (careful it's hot). Wash the paper out such that the black ink is stuck to the copper circuit board. Draw out your circuit on your board with the Sharpie. Note that it's really difficult to draw out a circuit design in real life, unless it's as simple as a led and a battery.  Keep in mind that copper cannot be between components, for example, if connecting an LED, there must be a gap in the copper between the positive and negative points of connectivity. Without a gap, the electricity would flow around the LED, as opposed to through it. Remember laws of electricity, all circuits must end at either a negative or ground, or no current will flow. Use thin lines, but lay the ink on thick, it is important that the copper is dissolved before the ink, and that there are no thin patches in the ink exposing copper. Summary:","output":"This article explains how to make a simple circuit with a sharpie or a computer program, using a circuit board, by drawing the design, placing the components, and making sure electricity flows correctly through the connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: who was the only us president whos grandfather was also president?","output":"George W. Bush was the only U.S. president whose grandfather was also a president. His full name is George Walker Bush, and he was the 43rd President of the United States, serving two terms between 2001 and 2009. George W. Bush is the eldest son of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Bush. His father, George H.W. Bush, was the 41st President of the United States, serving from 1989 to 1993. George W. Bush's presidency is notable for events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the subsequent declaration of a \\"War on Terror,\\" as well as the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. George W. Bush was born on July 6, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut. He attended Yale University and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in History in 1968. After completing his studies, he enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard and later was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve. He later went on to earn his Master's degree in Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1975. Before entering politics, George W. Bush worked in the oil industry in West Texas and was a co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He followed in his father's political footsteps and was elected as the Governor of Texas in 1994. He served two consecutive terms as governor before running for the presidency in 2000. As a president, George W. Bush pursued numerous policies including tax cuts, education reform, and environmental regulations. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, he led the nation through a difficult time, launching military operations on terrorism groups, forming the Department of Homeland Security, and creating controversial acts such as the USA PATRIOT Act to strengthen national security. His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was not a president, but a U.S senator representing Connecticut from 1952 to 1963. However, George W. Bush remains the only U.S. president with a direct familial lineage to another president, with his father being the 41st President of the United States, George H.W. Bush. This unique familial connection in the U.S. political landscape demonstrates the legacy of the Bush family and their continuous impact on American politics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In mid-May, about 3000 Zürichers, 2000 Bernese, 2000 Toggenburgers and 1800 Protestant Thurgauers marched into the Princely Lands and first hit upon the abbatial city of Wil, that fell on 22 May after a short siege. The allies then pushed forward to St. Gallen and occupied the Abbey of Saint Gall and the Vogtei Rheintal. The abbot fled to Neuravensburg, a lordship north of Lake Constance that the abbey had acquired in 1699. The five Catholic cantons did occupy Rapperswil, but initially left the abbot without any support.

In 1993 Stock formed 'Love This Records', and built a brand new multimillion-pound recording studio in London. The first record released with 'Love This Records' was a dance cover of the track Total Eclipse of the Heart. It was a worldwide hit for Nicki French, reaching No. 2 in America and No. 1 in seven countries selling over 2 million copies. In 1994 Simon Cowell asked Stock to produce the record for the popular kid's TV show 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' which was a top 5 hit in the UK. Cowell had worked with Stock on previous occasions with artists such as Sinitta, for whom Stock wrote and produced various hits like Toy Boy in 1987. Stock again collaborated with Cowell in 1993 on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) album Wrestlemania which spawned the No. 4 hit 'Slam Jam'.  In 1994 Stock produced several artists for Simon Cowell including Kym Mazelle, Jocelyn Brown and Robson and Jerome. Their cover of Unchained Melody produced by Stock and Aitken became the highest selling non-charity single of the decade, remaining at No. 1 for 7 weeks in 1995 selling 2.5 million copies. Stock produced a further two No. 1 singles with Robson and Jerome and two No. 1 albums.  After several years producing hits for Stock's own label 'Love This Records' and with Simon Cowell for BMG/RCA, the structural integrity of Stock's studio became compromised by the tunnelling of the Jubilee Line extension, and the damage forced Stock to pursue legal action against London Underground. As a result, Stock was forced to pull out of a joint deal with Cowell and BMG to produce several artists including the band Westlife in 1996.  In 1998 Stock and Aitken teamed up with Steve Crosby who had created the group Steps, to form the band Scooch. Their first single 'When My Baby' reached No. 29 and their follow up, 'More Than I Needed To Know', was a top 5 hit in the UK in 2000 and went to No. 1 in Japan. Scooch's album 'Four Sure' spawned two more top 20 singles. Stock also scored a top 20 with 'Airhead' by girl band Girls@Play, with EastEnders' star Rita Simons that toured with Steps. In 2003 Stock formed the label Better the Devil Records and had a huge hit with the Fast Food Song selling 200,000 CD singles.

Write highlights for this article: Peter Greste's family are holding their breath for Egypt's president to deport the jailed Australian journalist after a court ordered a retrial. An Egyptian court has ordered Greste and his two colleagues, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, be retried after more than a year in jail. Greste's family is hopeful Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will honour a decree he issued in November which gives him the power to repatriate foreign prisoners detained in Egypt. Greste's brother Andrew says the retrial presents a window of opportunity because Peter has become an accused, rather than a convicted, person. Scroll down for video. Retrial: Egyptian Baher Mohamed (left), Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy (centre) and Australian journalist Peter Greste (right) pictured at an earlier hearing. Mike (left) and Andrew (right) Greste, brothers of Australian journalist Peter Greste, speak to media during a press conference in Brisbane. 'Hope': Mohamed Fahmy (left), Peter Greste (centre) and Baher Mohamed (right) will face a retrial. \\"It really opens up this option under the presidential decree,\\" he said. \\"Now that Peter is essentially an innocent man, he's not convicted anymore, it does allow for some room to move and for him (al-Sisi) to step in ... and deport them.\\" Peter Greste's lawyer has applied to the Egyptian attorney-general for deportation. The retrial effectively means the original legal proceedings now count for nothing, international law expert Don Rothwell says. \\"The ordering of a fresh trial is a real vindication, I think, for Greste, his legal team and others who have been pointing out the irregularities in the case,\\" he said. \\"It's reflective of a decision by the Egyptian legal system that they recognise there were flaws with the first trial.\\" Greste's brothers Mike (left) and Andrew (right) are hopeful Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will honour a decree he issued in November which gives him the power to repatriate foreign prisoners detained in Egypt. 'Disappointed': Marwa Omara, the fianceé of Mohamed Fahmy, outside the Egyptian court (left), while Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (right) says the court's decision was some cause for optimism. Andrew Greste said it was not clear how long the process would take. \\"We've got to be hopeful. It's a new decree and there's very little understood about it, there's very little regulation, there's no precedent. We are in uncharted waters,\\" he said. \\"I'd like to think the decree was enacted to be used. We are going to test it out.\\" If deportation is unsuccessful, the family will apply for bail at the retrial. Mike Greste said the past 12 months of fighting for his brother's freedom had been full of confusion and \\"trying to come to terms with a system we are totally unfamiliar with and having to take one day at a time\\". Their parents, Juris and Lois Greste, have been in Egypt for a month and are allowed to visit their son every 15 days but have not had a chance yet to talk to him about the latest events.

Imprisonment: Presiding Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata handing down the sentences to the journalists last year. Lois Greste said they were initially dismayed the court did not throw out the original conviction, but \\"despite some of our disappointments, I think overall it's been a good outcome today.\\" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop agreed the court's decision was some cause for optimism. \\"He's back in the position of an accused person awaiting a trial rather than a convicted person facing seven years in jail,\\" she told ABC television on Friday.

No The sentence \\"In official Latin documents of the old Commonwealth, hereditary szlachta are referred to as \\"nobilitas\\" and are indeed the equivalent in legal status of the English nobility.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What are two adjectives that best describe the szlachta?\\" as it focuses more on the legal status, class, and title of the szlachta. To properly answer the question, let's discuss the two adjectives that best describe the szlachta.  The szlachta was the noble class in Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which later, formed a part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here are two adjectives that best describe the szlachta: 1. Privileged: The szlachta enjoyed numerous legal and political privileges in comparison to the non-noble population. They had the right to own land, were entitled to certain exemptions from taxes, and held exclusive rights to hold certain political offices. They were also protected by specific laws, such as the ability to only be judged by their peers and having a higher social status in society. 2. Influential: The szlachta held significant power in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They had an essential role in the political system of the time, specifically in the legislative process, where they had the right to attend and vote in the Sejm (the national parliament). Due to their exclusive right to participate in politics, combined with their wealth, education, and social status, they were a highly influential class in the country, shaping the Commonwealth's policies and social norms to their own interests. In conclusion, while the sentence provided offers a crucial insight into the legal status of the szlachta, it doesn't respond to the request for adjectives that describe them. The two adjectives that best characterize the szlachta are \\"privileged\\" and \\"influential,\\" reflecting their special status in society and their role in the political and social dynamics of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CLOSE An unlikely team of supervillains must save the day.      Joel Kinnaman (from left), Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Jai Courtney star in 'Suicide Squad.' (Photo: Clay Enos)      Bad reviews can’t kill Suicide Squad.      The critically maligned supervillain team-up scored the biggest August debut ever with 135.1 million at the weekend box office, according to tracking firm comScore. Its No. 1 opening smashes a record set by Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014 when that Disney/Marvel movie blasted off with 94.3 million on its way to 333.2 million. It also narrowly outpaced February's opening of another dark superhero comedy, Deadpool, which started with 132.4 million and much stronger reviews (84% positive on RottenTomatoes.com, compared with Suicide's 26% approval rating).      The Warner Bros. and DC Comics film is also the first 100 million North American opening for Will Smith, who co-stars with Margot Robbie, Cara Delevingne and Jai Courtney as bad guys tasked with saving the world. Jared Leto appears as The Joker, and Viola Davis plays a government official who assembles the team.      Suicide finished just below estimates of many box office trackers, who had predicted a 140 million weekend. Despite scathing reviews, 73% of moviegoers liked it, according to Rotten Tomatoes, and audiences gave it a B-plus at CinemaScore.      \\"This is one of the films that people pegged all summer long to do this type of business,\\" says Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \\"The reviews are usually a barometer of a big drop next weekend. I don't know that it'll be as bad as Batman v Superman\\" — which tumbled 69% after opening with 166 million in March — \\"but it's still not quite on par with what Marvel is doing. All their films received really high marks across the board.\\"      Suicide was certainly front-loaded, with a 41% drop from Friday to Saturday. But \\"the good news, despite those critical barbs, is that this is the last major tentpole of the summer,\\" says comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. With only Sausage Party, Florence Foster Jenkins and Pete's Dragon opening nationwide next weekend, \\"they're going to have a pretty wide-open playing field into Labor Day, which will be the official end to a very volatile, unpredictable summer movie season.\\"      Matt Damon's latest Jason Bourne installment raced to No. 2 and 22.7 million in its second weekend (103.4 million in 10 days). R-rated comedy Bad Moms held strong with 14.2 million (51.1 million total), and The Secret Life of Pets barked up 11.6 million for No. 4 (319.6 million total). Star Trek Beyond rounds out the top five with 10.2 million (127.9 million total), and Kevin Spacey's family comedy Nine Lives makes its debut at No. 6 with 6.5 million.

Kansas City police are investigating about 20 shootings that could be part of a pattern of recent highway and roadway shootings.      Federal authorities have added cash to a reward fund, bringing the total available reward to 7,000 for information leading to an arrest. Anyone with information should call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-TIPS (8477).      The number likely will fluctuate daily, police said, as detectives continue to learn of new cases, review them for similarities and decide which ones should be pursued further or ruled out.      About seven new cases were added Wednesday to a possible pattern of 13 shootings since March 8 that police analysts identified over the weekend.      Also Wednesday, investigators said they were looking into another incident, the shooting of a Leawood house, as possibly being part of the pattern.      Leawood homeowners reported finding a bullet hole in their house March 28 not far from where someone shot at a motorist March 29 on Interstate 435 near State Line Road in a separate incident. The homeowners werent home at the time, so they dont know exactly when it occurred but believe it was between March 25 and 28.      The timing and vicinity lead police to include it in their investigation of the 13 roadway shootings, police said.      We cant say for certain if its related to anything else, but were not ruling anything out just because its not a car, said Capt. Tye Grant, the Police Departments top spokesman.      The house shooting was one of the new details discussed at Wednesdays briefing, attended by Police Chief Darryl Forté, his analysts and detectives, federal agents and highway troopers. Forté has called for daily briefings on the investigation and said he provides updates to Mayor Sly James daily and police board members regularly.      As soon as police detected the pattern, Forté asked for help from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Specially trained ATF dogs were out again Wednesday looking for shell casings at various shooting scenes, including Bruce R. Watkins Drive and 75th Street, where a victim not counted among the 13 was shot at Friday night.      Police on Wednesday also discussed how to control misinformation circulating about the string of shootings, which is drawing national media attention.      Police have said they linked several of the 13 shootings to one another, but they wont reveal how or how many, because they think it would be detrimental to the investigation. They are also employing various strategies to prevent future shootings and arrest the shooter or shooters, but they dont want to divulge those details.      There are a lot of things Id like to talk about, Forté said. But it wouldnt be prudent.      The shootings started to occur sporadically in early March but accelerated last week with shootings reported every day from Wednesday through Sunday. No new shootings have been linked to the pattern since Sunday, Grant said.      Analysts are looking into reports of gunshots on roadways prior to March 8 to see if additional shootings fit the possible pattern. Detectives are prioritizing new reports generated by analysts or other agencies into stacks of shootings that likely are related and ones that are less likely.      Police also beefed up patrols in the areas where shootings occurred.      More than 30 tips had been called in to the TIPS Hotline by Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.      Eleven of the originally recognized 13 shootings occurred on highways. Ten of those occurred in Kansas City, with others in Leawood, Blue Springs and Lees Summit.      All of the shootings have occurred near highway ramps or road splits, where the shooter could veer off in a different direction from the victim after firing shots. But police said they are open to the possibility that the shooter could be on the ground hiding, although they have no evidence to support that.      We are confident that some have occurred from vehicles, Forté said. In other cases, we dont know.      The shootings have wounded three people  two in the leg and one in the arm.      We have been extremely lucky that no one has been seriously hurt, Grant said. These acts have real consequences. People could die, and the person doing this could go to prison for the rest of their life. It is not a game.      Police have recovered at least six bullets from vehicles and one from a victims arm. The bullets appear to come from a handgun.      Detectives recovered an eighth bullet from another similar case that wasnt counted in the original 13 reports.      In that case, a Johnson County woman was driving on Bruce R. Watkins Drive near 75th Street about 7:45 p.m. Friday when she heard a loud bang. She thought at first a rock had been kicked into her car by another vehicle, but she could not see any other vehicles close to her. The next night, her husband spotted a bullet hole on the passenger side of her car near the trunk.      In my case, I really dont think the gunfire was coming from a vehicle, she said.      She drove to a police station Sunday to report it. Police initially didnt take her report very seriously, she said. But when she called the TIPS Hotline on Monday after hearing about the other cases, a detective called her right back, she said.      She said she plans to avoid highways when possible until police make an arrest.      A 66-year-old Kansas City, Kan., man who was shot at Saturday afternoon said he also plans to stick to streets and now carries a gun.      In his case, he was eastbound on Interstate 670 downtown just west of the Interstate 35 exit when he heard a loud noise that he immediately recognized as gunfire. He noticed two cars nearby, one of them white.      Two other victims also saw white cars near them when they were targeted.      The 66-year-old couldnt safely pull over until he exited the highway. Thats when he saw the hole in his rear driver-side door.      Its just somebody crazy, he said. Theyre either on drugs or lacking attention. I dont know.      Another man shot at Saturday said a car with three to four occupants nearly barreled into him from an entrance ramp onto Interstate 49 near Red Bridge Road. He slammed on his brakes to avoid a collision, he said.      The occupants waved their middle fingers at him and I saluted back, he said. An occupant then pointed a gun at him. The man said he showed the occupants that he, too, had a gun.      The occupants braked and positioned themselves on the rear passenger side of his car. He took the ramp to Interstate 435, and the other men followed. At Bannister Road, after the other men exited, one of them fired a round at the victim.      Although the incident involved some road rage, the victim said he thinks the incident fits the pattern of the other shootings.      These guys were up to no good, he said. They just took me completely by surprise when they nearly hit me. I think they were trying to cause an incident.      One of the guys was looking at me like, I got you,  he said.      The Star isnt naming the victims for their protection. ||||| Kansas City drivers on edge over highway shootings Posted: Wednesday, April 9, 2014 5:14 PM EDT Updated: Friday, May 9, 2014 5:14 PM EDT      Since news spread that someone was shooting at cars on the highways in the Kansas City area, drivers have been on edge.

Since news spread that someone was shooting at cars on highways in the Kansas City area, drivers have been on edge.      And until a suspect is caught, drivers say they aren't taking any chances. Some are finding alternate routes, others say they aren't going to stop their regular routines.      \\"A little uneasy. It's unaimed, not targeted. You don't know who they are shooting at. It could be anybody,\\" Ashley Quinn said.      Many of the multiple shootings have occurred near Three Trails Crossing, what was known for years as the Grandview Triangle.      Shots were fired as drivers were exiting or entering ramps onto the highways.      Some drivers say they are now taking different routes to avoid the highway.      \\"I'll go out Longview Road, or take a different route,\\" Gaynell Thomas said.            Others, like Donna Sover, have been staying in at night.      Students who enter the busy highway merger take that route daily to Longview Community College. It is now a topic of discussion.      \\"They either don't want to come to school or take different routes to school,\\" Kelsey Lohmeyer said.            For Marvin Ramirez, he has been mainly taking the back roads to get to school.      Still, others say their routines will not change.      \\"I just watch the roads, watch the ramps but as far as changing my route, no I'm not doing that,\\" Connie Alicie said.

Article: Exercise is one of the few factors with a positive role in long-term control of body weight. Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to \\"light\\" beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical efforts. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to lose weight said they were combining exercise with their diet. In rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts; for example, one would have to quickly walk hard three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry . Even exercise professionals accept half a point here. \\"Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight,\\" says York Onnen, program director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Still, exercise's supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the Boston University Medical Center of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight. If you have been sedentary   and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year's time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight. Question: \\"Even exercise professionals accept half a point here\\" means \\"They  _  \\". Options: A: agree that the calories in a small piece of pastry can be easy to work off by exercise B: partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction C: are not fully convinced that dieting can help maintain one's new weight D: are not sufficiently informed of the positive role of exercise in losing weight The answer is:","output":"B: partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Enemies of the People Movie plot: An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement led by Pol Pot. Among the victims were Thet Sambathâs mother, father and brother. He says he did not understand why the Khmer Rouge unleashed such violence on their compatriots. In 1999, he decided to seek confessions and explanations from former Khmer Rouge officials at all levels. None had previously admitted any killings.[1] In 2001, he met Nuon Chea, Pol Potâs deputy, also known as Brother Number Two. Nuon Chea was then living as a private citizen in Prum, a small town on the Thai-Cambodian border. Sambath visited Nuon Chea most weekends for around three years.[2] During that time, Nuon Chea was willing to talk about all phases of his political career except the three-and-a-half years of the Khmer Rouge regime. He had previously been interviewed by Western and Japanese journalists but had always denied responsibility for killing anyone in the Cambodian genocide. In 2004, Nuon Chea made his first admission to Sambath concerning decisions to kill that he made with Pol Pot.[3] Sambath continued to interview Nuon Chea on his role in the Killing Fields for three more years. During that time the United Nations-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) was constituted to investigate the alleged crimes of Democratic Kampuchea. Sambath interviewed Nuon Chea until September 2007 when the latter was arrested and charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the ECCC. During the same period, Sambath also built up a network of less senior former Khmer Rouge officials and cadres who were prepared to acknowledge and detail their role in the Killing Fields.[4] The film focuses on two Khmer Rouge perpetrators in the northwest of Cambodia. Khoun and Suon take Sambath to the scene of their massacres and introduce him to their superior officer, a woman known as Sister âEmâ. They give graphic accounts of the massacres they perpetrated. They also give voice to their own feelings of...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where does the publisher's niece meet with Donna's fiance after his call? ?  Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine. She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine.

Now, let's analyze the statement and the given choices: Statement: And he was only a boy, about Callie's age, his black hair flopping over eyes wide with shock and fright. The statement tells us that: - He is a boy. - He is about Callie's age. - He has black hair. Now let's look at the choices: 1. He was male and had black hair, almost the same age as Callie.    This sentence agrees with the statement, so it's not the answer. 2. She was just a girl and twenty years older than Callie.    This sentence disagrees with the statement because it says \\"she\\" instead of \\"he,\\" and states she's 20 years older than Callie, which contrasts with being \\"about Callie's age.\\" So, this could be the answer. 3. He was twelve years of age and very strong already.    This sentence agrees with the statement as it refers to a boy, but we cannot definitively say it disagrees or agrees with the statement since we don't know Callie's exact age.

Voici un aperçu général des grandes périodes et tendances : **La Belle Époque (fin du XIXe siècle - 1914) :** Avant la Première Guerre mondiale, les inégalités économiques étaient très élevées. Le développement industriel et l'impérialisme avaient créé une richesse considérable, mais celle-ci était fortement concentrée entre les mains de quelques-uns. De grandes fortunes se sont constituées dans les pays industrialisés, mais également à travers les empires coloniaux. **Les deux guerres mondiales (1914-1918, 1939-1945) :** Les deux conflits mondiaux et la période de la Grande Dépression (débutée en 1929) ont bouleversé les économies et entraîné des changements dans les structures de propriété et de richesse. De nombreux pays ont mis en place des politiques plus redistributives et une fiscalité plus progressive pour financer l'effort de guerre et reconstruire après les désastres. **Les Trente Glorieuses (1945-1975) :** L'après-guerre a vu une période d'essor économique dans les pays développés avec une croissance soutenue, une amélioration du niveau de vie et une baisse des inégalités grâce à la mise en place de l'État-providence, le plein emploi, et une fiscalité très progressive. Les politiques gouvernementales visaient à répartir les bénéfices de la croissance économique entre tous les citoyens. **Années 1980 à aujourd'hui :** Depuis les années 1980, avec l'avènement du néolibéralisme, de la mondialisation et de la déréglementation financière, on a assisté à une augmentation des inégalités. Les revenus et les richesses se sont de plus en plus concentrés dans les mains d'une élite économique. Les politiques d'austérité, la baisse de l'imposition sur les plus riches et les entreprises, ainsi que la stagnation des salaires pour les classes moyennes et inférieures ont amplifié les inégalités. **21e siècle :** Au début du 21e siècle, notamment avec les travaux de Thomas Piketty, il a été mis en lumière que les inégalités avaient atteint des niveaux similaires à ceux d'avant la Première Guerre mondiale dans plusieurs pays. La crise financière de 2008 et ses suites ont exacerbé cette tendance dans de nombreux pays, même si d'autres, notamment en Asie, ont connu une forte croissance économique et une élévation du niveau de vie de vastes couches de la population. **Effets de la pandémie de COVID-19 (2020-...) :** La pandémie de COVID-19 a eu un impact inégal selon les secteurs économiques et les populations. Alors que de nombreuses personnes ont perdu leur emploi ou ont vu leur revenu diminuer, certaines industries et individus (notamment dans la technologie et l'industrie pharmaceutique) ont connu une croissance de leur fortune, accentuant les inégalités. **Conclusion :** Les inégalités économiques sont un phénomène complexe influencé par une multitude de facteurs, y compris les politiques gouvernementales, les structures économiques, la technologie et les crises mondiales. La question de l'inégalité reste un des grands défis du 21e siècle, avec des débats sur la meilleure façon de promouvoir l'équité sans entraver la prospérité économique."},{"instruction":"Voici les grandes lignes de l'évolution des inégalités économiques depuis 1900: - Début 20ème siècle : Des inégalités très fortes dans la plupart des pays industrialisés, avec une faible part des richesses pour les classes populaires. - Années 1920-1930 : Baisse des inégalités dans certains pays comme les États-Unis, suite aux politiques progressistes et à la crise de 1929. - Après 1945 : Période de relatif \\"compromis social\\" dans beaucoup de pays développés, avec mise en place d'États-providence et réduction des inégalités. - Années 1970-début 1980 : Ralentissement économique et remontée de inégalités mais qui restent plus faibles qu'au début du siècle. - Depuis les années 1980-1990 : Forte augmentation des inégalités économiques dans la plupart des pays riches, retour à des niveaux d'avant guerre. Concentration de plus en plus forte des richesses. - Exemples : Aux États-Unis, les 1% les plus riches détenaient 25% des richesses en 1980, contre 40% en 2016. En France en 1983, 10% des foyers détenaient 56% du patrimoine total, ils en détenaient 65% en 2015. De fortes disparités persistent donc et se sont même accrues ces dernières décennies.

Voici quelques corrections et précisions à apporter : - **Début 20ème siècle :** C'est juste, les inégalités étaient fortement marquées dans les sociétés industrialisées avec de grandes fortunes bâties sur l’industrialisation et l'impérialisme. - **Années 1920-1930 :** La crise de 1929, suivie par la Grande Dépression, a effectivement eu un impact sur les inégalités, qui se sont un peu réduites, notamment aux États-Unis, en grande partie du fait de l'effondrement des fortunes boursières et des interventions gouvernementales avec le New Deal. - **Après 1945 :** La construction des États-providence dans de nombreux pays développés a aidé à réduire les inégalités avec des politiques de redistribution plus actives. - **Années 1970-début 1980 :** Les inégalités ont commencé à remonter dans certains pays avant même le tournant des années 1980, souvent liées aux chocs pétroliers et au ralentissement économique. - **Depuis les années 1980-1990 :** La période est marquée par le néolibéralisme et la mondialisation économique, qui ont contribué à la hausse des inégalités. La concentration des richesses s’est accentuée, avec une part croissante allant aux 1% les plus riches, comme en témoignent les chiffres des États-Unis que vous mentionnez. - **Exemples :** Les chiffres que vous mentionnez semblent crédibles, même si les valeurs exactes peuvent varier selon les sources et les méthodes de mesure. Aux États-Unis, les 1% les plus riches possèdent une part disproportionnée de la richesse totale. En France et dans d'autres pays développés, le patrimoine des ménages peut être fortement concentré parmi les déciles supérieurs de la distribution. En conclusion, vos informations sont en ligne avec la tendance générale qui a été observée par les économistes et historiens, bien qu'il soit important de préciser que ces données peuvent fluctuer selon les méthodes de mesure et les sources de données.

En résumé, il est essentiel de considérer ces effets d'accumulation et de renforcement mutuel des différentes formes d'inégalités (économiques, sociales, territoriales, de genre, etc). C'est vrai au faux","output":"C'est vrai. Les inégalités sont en effet souvent caractérisées par leur nature multiforme et cumulative. Les facteurs tels que le revenu, le patrimoine, l'éducation, le genre, l'origine ethnique ou sociale, et le lieu de résidence peuvent interagir entre eux pour créer des couches complexes d'inégalité au sein des sociétés. Ces interactions signifient que certains groupes peuvent être confrontés à plusieurs obstacles simultanément, ce qui peut entraver leur capacité à s'améliorer sur le plan social et économique. Le concept d'intersectionnalité, développé par la juriste américaine Kimberlé Crenshaw, est utile pour comprendre comment ces différentes formes d'inégalités se chevauchent et se renforcent mutuellement dans l'expérience vécue des individus. L'analyse des inégalités considère donc souvent la combinaison des diverses sources de désavantage, plutôt que de les examiner isolément. La reproduction des inégalités de génération en génération peut être expliquée par divers mécanismes sociaux et économiques, y compris l'éducation, l'héritage du patrimoine, l'accès aux réseaux sociaux, les disparités de revenus et les discriminations institutionnalisées.

In the text there is also a clear instance of symbolism :\\" I spent the afternoon squinting up at monuments to freedom and past presidencies and democracy , and wondering why the light and heat were both so much stronger in Washington D . C ., than back home in New York City . Even the pavement on the streets was a shade lighter in color than back home .\\" This paves the way for her experience of racial discrimination in a place of white domination , in spite of the monuments to freedom and past presidencies and democracy .

First , the writer provides dynamic and graphic descriptions of the forced walks to the Chinese school , of the stern principal , of the classroom , of the polite formality with which lessons started , etc . Then , by means of a sharp contrast , the author provides vivid accounts of the language gap between the old generations represented respectively by her mother and grandmother and the younger generation represented by the author and her brother . It is to be noted that figures of speech such as simile and metaphor are used in some places to achieve impressive effects . This text 3 is a piece of dynamic or descriptive narration , telling us a true story aboyt the hanging of a convict in Burma . The narrative text first presents a general description of the poor , simple living conditions of the condemned men before they were put to death on the gallows . Next , it focuses on a dynamic and specific description of how a condemned man , a Hindu , was guarded and escorted to the gallows and how he was hanged . Then , some anecdotes are presented and some events described , which provide food for thought . Evidently , the events are organized mainly in the order of their occurrence , following the natural time sequence . It is to be noted that Paragraphs 9-14 make up the climax of the story . Also , it is not to be overlooked that the first - person narration is adopted ,1which renders the events described or narrated more vivid , objective and believable , and which makes it possible and convenient for the bl4rarfator to put across his own thoughts and feelings in the process Siof narration .

The texts include a reminiscence, a first-person narration, a descriptive narration, and a biographical sketch. By examining the use of chronological order, flashbacks, symbolism, figures of speech, and personal assessment, we can gain a deeper understanding of the authors' writing methods. Text 1 - Reminiscence: The author employs chronological order to provide a detailed account of the major events, interspersed with occasional flashbacks. This structure allows the reader to follow the sequence of events while also gaining insight into the author's thoughts and feelings. Symbolism is used to convey the theme of racial discrimination, such as the vivid descriptions comparing Washington D.C. to New York City and the contrast between monuments to freedom and the experience of white domination. Text 2 - First-person Narration: The author uses a spatial and chronological order to describe the forced walks to the Chinese school and provides dynamic and graphic descriptions of various aspects, such as the stern principal and the classroom. Figures of speech, including simile and metaphor, are used to create impressive effects and highlight the language gap between different generations. Text 3 - Descriptive Narration: The events in this narrative are organized in the order of occurrence, following a natural time sequence. The author presents a general description of the living conditions of the condemned men, followed by a specific and dynamic account of a Hindu man being escorted to the gallows. Anecdotes and thought-provoking events are included to enhance the narrative. The first-person narration adds vividness and believability to the story. Text 4 - Biographical Sketch: The author combines chronological organization with personal assessment in this biographical sketch. Metaphorical expressions and sentences are used to evoke emotional responses from the reader and make the narration more graphical and impressive. The author emphasizes Marie Curie as not only a great scientist but also a flesh-and-blood woman, supporting this point with evidence in the introductory part of the text. Conclusion: In conclusion, the authors of the given texts employ various writing methods and rhetorical devices to effectively convey their narratives and achieve specific effects. These methods include chronological order, flashbacks, symbolism, figures of speech, personal assessments, and the use of first-person narration. By analyzing these elements, we gain a deeper understanding of the authors' intentions and the overall impact of the texts. These writing methods serve to engage and captivate the reader, making the texts more memorable and thought-provoking."},{"instruction":"请使用NEST 7.17.5库来更新旧版本（NEST 1.4.3）的C#代码： private QueryContainerDescriptor<SparePartEntity> ApplyFilters(SearchRequest request, QueryContainerDescriptor<SparePartEntity> fqd) { return fqd.Filter(fd => { var filters = new List<FilterContainer>();

Размер – пятистопный ямб, рифма- перекрестная. Образы и символы Центральным образом стихотворения, безусловно, выступает пес по кличке Джим. Лирический герой за такое короткое время успел даже полюбить собаку, ведь он так ласково ее называет и обращается к ней: «голубчик», «с такою милою доверчивой приятцей», «мой милый Джим». Возможно, Джим явился также символом верной дружбы и доброты. Поэт очеловечивает собаку, видя в ней полноценного участника разговора. В стихотворении также присутствует образ хозяина – Василия Качалова. Он «мил и знаменит» и «гостей бывает в доме много». Но он дополняет картину, являясь второстепенным персонажем. К концу появляется новый образ – таинственной женщины, к которой обращена трепетная любовь героя. Он испытывает чувство вины и сожаления. Образ лирического героя пропитан грустью. У него возникает безотчетное желание полаять на луну и пожить беззаботной собачьей жизнью, лишь бы избавиться от навязчивых мыслей. Его существование отравлено раскаянием за то, что какая-то женщина печалится по его вине. Темы и проблемы Доминирующее настроение стихотворения — сожаление. Лирический герой грустит и просит пса дать лапу на счастье — то есть судорожно цепляется за любую возможность вновь обрести гармонию с собой. Стихотворение «Собаке Качалова», действительно, отличается от других произведений поэта позднего периода его творчества. Оно передает тяжелые размышления Сергея о том, что он заставляет других людей страдать. Основная тема произведения — безмолвное раскаяние, которое ему даже стыдно выразить самому. Поэтому он просит пса загладить вину за него. Еще одна тема стихотворения — природа и ее связь с человеком. Подчас животное может утешить нас лучше любого собеседника, именно такую ситуацию описывает поэт. Мы связаны с окружающим миром и видим в нем себя. Наши эмоции находят отражения в инстинктивных проявлениях чувств собаки. Проблема сожаления и мук совести затронута автором неслучайно: он часто испытывал подобное ощущение. Многие люди годами пытались помочь ему выйти из порочного круга пьянства, но безуспешно. Видимо, он осознавал свои недостатки и стеснялся в сотый раз просить прощения за то, что вновь повторится. Проблема одиночества и невыразимого страдания также прослеживается читателем. Лирический герой не находит понимания среди людей и обращается к животному. Основная мысль Главная идея, заложенная Есениным, заключается в том, что человек, ответственный за несчастье другого, столь же удручен. Поэт дважды просит друга дать лапу на счастье — это прямое указание на его тоску. Ему хочется выть на луну и изливать свою грусть в монологе, ведь он тяготится сознанием своей вины перед таинственной женщиной. Он не в силах преодолеть обстоятельства, ставшие у них на пути, но искренне раскаивается за боль, которую ей причинил. Однако это страдание так глубоко с обеих сторон, что он даже не может сам подойти к ней — так сильна еще боль от разлуки. В этом и состоит смысл его просьбы. Средства выразительности По отношению к Джиму Есенин использует просторечные выражения, в отличие от философских размышлений, где применяет различные деепричастные обороты, сложные метафоры и тому подобное. Автор использует метафоры («бархатная шерсть», «бесшумная погода»), сравнение («как пьяный друг») и эпитеты («милая», «доверчивая»).","output":"Также в стихотворении можно отметить парадоксальное выражение «полаять на луну» и повторение фразы «дай лапу на счастье». Эти средства выразительности помогают передать глубину чувств и эмоций героя. Рифма в стихотворении перекрестная, что создает музыкальность и гармоничность текста. Ритм произведения пятистопный ямб, что также способствует его мелодичности. В целом, стихотворение \\"Собаке Качалова\\" является глубоким и эмоциональным произведением, отражающим тему сожаления и размышления о моральных переживаниях. Образы и символы, использованные Есениным, помогают передать грусть и безысходность героя, а средства выразительности усиливают эмоциональное воздействие на читателя."},{"instruction":"Перескажи своими словами: Всякое мастерство начинается с внимания к деталям.

Оно основано на реальном случае. Однажды, придя в гости к своему приятелю, известному театральному актеру Василию Качалову, он не застал его дома. В ожидании Есенин познакомился с псом Джимом. За это время они стали закадычными друзьями. Он видел в этой собаке отличного собеседника, какому можно доверить свои тайны, переживания и скорби. Сергей переживал совсем не простой период: он потерял смысл жизни и искал его в алкоголе и бурных романах, но так и не нашел его. Через некоторое время поэт посвятил стихотворение псу Джиму и с гордостью прочитал хозяину собаки. Кому посвящено стихотворение «Собаке Качалова»? Поэт просит прощения у той, «что всех безмолвней и грустней». По всей видимости, Есенин чувствует сильную вину за что-то, и потому прощение можно выразить лишь через Джима – «Лизни ей нежно руку». Сергей прослыл очень влюбчивым молодым человеком, поэтому до конца не ясно, кого он имел в виду в последних строках своего стихотворения. Многие считают, что этой таинственной гостьей могла быть Галина Бениславская, которую связывали с Есениным давние и очень непростые отношения. Она беззаветно любила его, а он видел в ней лишь преданную собачонку, которая будет бежать за ним, даже если он пойдет в противоположную сторону.","output":"Строка поэта \\"Собаке Качалова\\" написана в последнем году жизни Сергея Есенина в 1925 году.

Corporate Perpetual Holdings in HK Booking Center: Investors can consider investing in corporate perpetual bonds with call date in 2023 and 2024. These bonds are trading in low to mid 90s, presenting an opportunity to extend duration and remove perpetual risks. Some of these bonds have semi-annual call frequency, making them attractive for investors. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and Bank AT1s can also be considered, despite the high chance of being called. The lower cash price of these bonds indicates that the market is not pricing in a 100% call probability, and investors can switch into higher cash price bonds. 2. Investing in China: With firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley expressing a preference for A-shares, investors can consider investing in the onshore Chinese equity market. Although there are still hurdles to a sustainable equity market recovery, areas with higher productivity and self-sufficiency are gaining importance. The China market has shown slight improvement after hitting a multi-year low in October. - Equity: Investors can explore buying stocks such as 9988.HK/BABA ahead of Double 11 and 1211.HK, 27.HK, PEP, MC FP. These stocks have shown interest from UHNW clients and FO clients. - Structured Products: With equity profit-taking and market rally, investors can look into printing decumulator tickets and APS across various stocks like GSK, AMD, META, FL, HKEX, NKE, DIS, MGM, NVDA, TSLA, 9983. FCNs linked to US stocks, particularly QCOM, ASML, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, LULU, are also favored by clients. - Fixed Income: UST bonds continue to appeal to clients due to lower transaction costs and tighter spreads. Investors can consider rolling over UST bonds for <1 year T Bills and CNH Fixed Rate Bonds. Accumulating specific high-yield names like LNGFOR 4.5% 2028/GRNCH 5.65% 2025 can also be considered. Participation in new issues such as UBS PNC 10 and DAHSIN 7 ⅜ 11/15/33 can be explored. - Funds: Deployment of cash into Ultrashort duration funds and gradual investment in CMS can be considered by UHNW clients. - FX: Selling gold at or above 2100 level and selling XAU call at 2000 can be explored. Conversion of JPY to USD at a higher level and placing a 3-year fader limit order with the strike at 129.50 can be considered. Selling CNH and buying USD TEKO can also be explored. - Alternatives: Investors can focus on closing the Lone Star pipeline as part of their alternative investment strategy. Note: These investment suggestions echo the ideas mentioned in the investment pitch, but it is important to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions."},{"instruction":"Based on this job description, give me ideas of job titles that reflect my senior level of responsibility and the experience that this position requires: - Account Manager from the Advertiser Department - Building and maintaining the advertiser customer base and expanding it - Customer Service | Customer development - Communication, contact, management of accounts and key accounts - Consultants and representatives for services - Data analysis | Data processing & observation - Manage and perform relevant and necessary daily tasks - Acquisition of new customers - Communication via video calls and approval of advertisements - Management of growth, KPI and quality control - Co-design of strategic processes (- Participation as a moderator/speaker in the production of content videos, for example in image videos or explanatory videos regarding the employer's services)","output":"Based on the job description, some suitable job titles that reflect senior level responsibility and required experience could include: 1.

金融科技的出现给传统金融行业带来了巨大的冲击和改变。首先，金融科技的出现使得金融服务更加普惠化。在传统金融行业，很多服务只能由大型银行或金融机构提供，对于小微企业和个人来说很难获得金融服务。而金融科技通过移动支付、P2P借贷等创新模式，让金融服务更加平等地分配给每个人。现在，人们可以通过手机实现各种金融活动，比如转账、购物、投资等，不再需要去银行柜台排队办理。 其次，金融科技的出现推动了金融行业的数字化转型。在传统金融行业，很多流程都需要纸质文件和人工操作，效率低下且容易出错。而金融科技通过使用大数据分析、人工智能等技术，可以实现快速、准确地处理金融交易。比如，使用机器学习算法来识别欺诈行为，使用区块链技术来提高交易的透明度和安全性等。 金融科技的发展还带来了更多的创新产品和服务。比如，虚拟货币的出现使得跨境支付更加简单便捷，智能投顾的出现使得个人投资更加智能化，互联网保险的出现让购买保险更加灵活个性化等。这些创新产品和服务不仅提高了金融效率，也满足了不同用户的个性化需求。 然而，金融科技的发展也带来了一些风险和挑战。比如，虚拟货币市场的高风险性和容易被利用于非法活动，金融数据的隐私和安全问题等。因此，为了有效监管和管理金融科技行业，政府和金融机构需要加强监管政策和技术能力，防范金融风险。 总而言之，金融科技的出现给传统金融行业带来了巨大的变革，无论是金融服务的普惠化、数字化转型还是创新产品和服务的出现，都为用户带来了更便利、高效和个性化的金融体验。随着技术的不断进步和创新的涌现，金融科技行业将继续发展壮大，并对传统金融行业产生更大的影响。"},{"instruction":"写一篇关于车辆报废及新购的工作报告","output":"[公司名称] 工作报告

Ushindani wa kimataifa: Kuna uwezekano mkubwa wa kushindana na nchi na makampuni mengine katika soko la kimataifa. Hii inaweza kusababisha bei ya bidhaa au huduma zinazozalishwa kuwa chini sana, na kwa hivyo kuharibu soko la ndani na kufanya iwe vigumu kwa nchi au watu binafsi kutumia rasilimali kwa faida yao wenyewe. 2. Utegemezi wa rasilimali moja: Ikiwa rasilimali moja tu ndiyo inayopatikana, kuna hatari ya kuwa tegemezi sana juu ya rasilimali hiyo. Hii inaweza kusababisha changamoto ikiwa bei ya rasilimali inaanguka, au ikiwa teknolojia au mahitaji ya soko yanabadilika na rasilimali hiyo haiwezi tena kutumiwa kwa ufanisi. 3. Ukosefu wa miundombinu: Ikiwa rasilimali zinapatikana lakini hakuna miundombinu iliyopo kuiendeleza au kuitumia, basi haitawezekana kuchuma faida kutoka kwa rasilimali hizo. Kwa mfano, ikiwa kuna rasilimali ya mafuta lakini hakuna miundombinu ya uchimbaji au usafirishaji, basi rasilimali hiyo haitaweza kuchangia katika uchumi wa nchi. 4. Rushwa na ufisadi: Vikwazo vya kisiasa na kiuchumi kama rushwa na ufisadi vinaweza kuzuia matumizi sahihi ya rasilimali na kuharibu uchumi wa nchi. Fedha zinazotokana na rasilimali zinaweza kuibiwa au kutumiwa vibaya na watu wenye madaraka, badala ya kutumiwa kuendeleza miundombinu au huduma za kijamii. 5. Ubadhirifu wa mali: Rasilimali zinaweza kuibiwa au kuharibiwa na watu wasiohitaji. Uvamizi wa mashamba au uvuvi haramu ni mifano ya jinsi rasilimali inaweza kuibiwa kutoka kwa watu wenye haki ya umiliki. Hii inaweza kusababisha hasara kubwa kwa watu au nchi ambao hawana vyanzo vingine vya mapato. Ili kukabiliana na vikwazo hivi, ni muhimu kuweka sera na mikakati madhubuti ya kiuchumi, kuwekeza katika miundombinu, kupambana na rushwa na ufisadi, na kuongeza ujuzi na teknolojia ili kutumia rasilimali kwa ufanisi na faida ya nchi au watu binafsi."},{"instruction":"edit and improve the style of the excerpts from my sci-fi fantasy novel: As soon as the information was leaked, Interpol arrests most people connected to this criminal network except Bob.

Добавь в сказку много диалогов между девочками.","output":"Когда-то давным-давно в далёком цветущем королевстве жили две девочки по имени Элиза и Марианна. Элиза жила в западной части королевства и была дочерью скромного ткача, а Марианна проживала на востоке в семье известного лекаря. Однажды, во время праздника цветов, судьба свела этих двух девушек вместе. Элиза стояла у ярмарочной лавки и разглядывала цветы, когда подошла Марианна. – Какая красота, не правда ли? – задумчиво сказала Марианна, взглянув на букет нарциссов. – О, да! Цветы здесь как сказка, каждый лепесток пропитан волшебством, – ответила Элиза с улыбкой. – Меня зовут Марианна, и я люблю рассматривать цветы, но редко кому говорю об этом. – Да, боишься, что засмеют? Я Элиза. Знаешь, мне кажется, что подобная страсть делает нас особенными. Этот момент стал началом их нежной дружбы, и они стали навещать друг друга каждые выходные. Они делились тайнами, мечтами и играли в фантастические игры, создавая свои волшебные миры. Сказка длилась день за днем, и вот однажды, во время очередной встречи, Марианна спросила: – Элиза, ты когда-нибудь задумывалась, что происходит, когда цветы влюбляются? – Влюбляются… цветы? Не знаю, наверное, они зацветают ещё красивее. – А что, если мы – как эти цветы? Ведь мы растём и развиваемся, как и они, верно? Элиза вглядывалась в глаза Марианны и чувствовала, что между ними витает некое особенное чувство, теплое и ласковое, как утренний свет. – Может быть, – промолвила она, – но если цветы влюбляются, как мы можем это заметить? – Думаю, они демонстрируют это через свою красоту и аромат. Как мы – через слова и жесты. Следующие несколько месяцев Элиза и Марианна прожили, как в волшебном тумане, сближаясь все больше и больше, понимая, что их дружба превращалась в что-то большее. Так и прошло несколько сезонов, пока однажды они не поняли, что их чувства переросли в настоящую влюблённость. Они открывались друг другу, боясь, но и радуясь возможности быть вместе. И вот однажным весенним утром Марианна сказала: – Элиза, когда я рядом с тобой, мне кажется, что мы созданы из тех же звезд. – Марианна, я чувствую то же самое. Ты – моя звезда, ведущая меня через ночь. С тех пор они решили не скрывать своих чувств и позволили своей любви цвести, несмотря на все трудности и непонимание со стороны других. В конце концов, их исключительная любовь и сила духа принесли перемену в отношении жителей королевства к любви во всех её формах. Элиза и Марианна стали символом того, что любовь – это магия, которая видит сердце, а не границы, и их легенда живёт и по сей день. И в этой сказке было всё: приключения, волшебство, препятствия и, самое главное, любовь, безграничная и свободная. И пока они вместе, каждый день их жизни оказывается ещё одной страницей в вечной сказке, вдохновляющей сердца всех, кто готов слушать и любить."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are a few options you can use: 1. \`ip\` command (recommended for modern systems): \`\`\`sh ip addr show \`\`\` This command will display all network interfaces along with their IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). 2. \`ifconfig\` command (deprecated but still found in some systems): \`\`\`sh ifconfig -a \`\`\` This is the older way to list network interfaces which has been replaced by the \`ip\` command. It displays a list of all network interfaces and their configuration. The \`-a\` flag includes all interfaces, even those that are down. 3. \`nmcli\` command (if using NetworkManager): \`\`\`sh nmcli connection show \`\`\` This command will list all network connections managed by NetworkManager. To show the IP addresses associated with a connection, you can use: \`\`\`sh nmcli connection show <connection-name> | grep IP4.ADDRESS \`\`\` 4. \`netstat\` command (can be used to show network statistics): \`\`\`sh netstat -ie \`\`\` This command will print network interfaces and their assigned IP addresses.

The \`ip neigh\` command is part of the \`iproute2\` package, which is installed by default on most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. 2. \`arp\` command (on systems where it is still available): \`\`\`bash arp -a \`\`\` or \`\`\`bash arp -e \`\`\` These commands show the ARP table with entries in a human-readable format (\`-a\`) or the standard format (\`-e\`). Remember that you may need to run these commands with \`sudo\` if you need privileged access to display all entries, especially on systems with increased security settings. Example usage with \`sudo\`: \`\`\`bash sudo ip neigh \`\`\` or \`\`\`bash sudo arp -a \`\`\` In modern systems, it is recommended to use the \`ip neigh\` command as it is more likely to be maintained and available in the future."},{"instruction":"If you have an AWS VPC with multiple subnets, what entry for the route table would be made to allow them all to see each other, if the subnets were 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24,192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.4.0/24?","output":"In an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), instances in different subnets can communicate with each other by default, as long as they are part of the same VPC and proper route table entries are in place. To ensure that all the subnets in your VPC can communicate with each other, you need to have route table entries that allow traffic to and from each of the subnets. If you have the following subnets: - 192.168.1.0/24 - 192.168.2.0/24 - 192.168.3.0/24 - 192.168.4.0/24 All of these subnets are part of your VPC's CIDR block. Assuming your VPC's CIDR is large enough to encompass all these subnets (for example, 192.168.0.0/16), the route table associated with each of the subnets needs to include a route that allows local traffic within the VPC's CIDR block. The route table entry should look something like this: | Destination | Target | |-----------------|----------------| | 192.168.0.0/16 | local | \\"Destination\\" is the range of IP addresses where you want the traffic to go, and \\"Target\\" is where you would like the traffic to route to. The \\"local\\" target means that traffic destined for the specified destination will be routed within the VPC itself. This entry allows all instances in the 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.3.0/24, and 192.168.4.0/24 subnets to communicate with each other via local routing within the VPC without needing to go to the internet or a virtual private gateway. Remember that the subnets' Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and the security groups associated with individual instances also need to allow the relevant traffic for the instances to communicate. By default, NACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic, and security groups are stateful, so if an outbound initiation is allowed, the inbound response is automatically allowed. However, custom NACL rules and security group configurations could potentially restrict traffic, so these should be reviewed if there are communication issues."},{"instruction":"I need to send ping from a specific ip/nic on ubuntu server.","output":"To send a ping from a specific IP address or network interface (NIC) on an Ubuntu server, you would use the \`ping\` command with the \`-I\` option to specify the interface or IP address from which you want to send the ping. Suppose you have an interface called \`eth0\` with an IP address of \`192.168.1.10\`, and you want to ping an external IP, for instance, \`8.8.8.8\`. You would use the following command: \`\`\`sh ping -I eth0 8.8.8.8 \`\`\` Or if you want to use the specific source IP address instead of the interface name: \`\`\`sh ping -I 192.168.1.10 8.8.8.8 \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`eth0\` with the actual name of your interface and \`192.168.1.10\` with the source IP address you want to use for pinging. Also, replace \`8.8.8.8\` with the IP address you wish to ping. This \`-I\` option in the ping command tells the system to send the ICMP packets from the specified interface or IP address. Remember that you might need higher privileges to execute this command, so you may have to use \`sudo\`: \`\`\`sh sudo ping -I eth0 8.8.8.8 \`\`\` If the ping command returns responses, it means that your server can reach the target IP address from the specified source IP address or NIC. If there's no response, check to make sure the target IP is correct, that your network configuration allows traffic from the specified NIC or IP, and that any firewalls or security groups allow ICMP packets."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your message came through empty.

One well-known requirement is that banks must file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) for cash transactions exceeding 10,000 in a single business day. If a customer attempted to withdraw 10,000 and provided the response you suggested when asked why by the bank, the bank personnel might react in several ways: 1. **Compliance**: They are still obligated to follow the law, so they would process the transaction and file the required CTR, noting the reason the customer gave for the withdrawal. 2. **Further Inquiry**: The bank teller or manager might ask additional questions to ensure that they are fulfilling their regulatory obligations for reporting and to gauge whether there are any indications of illegal activity. 3. **Education**: A bank representative might take the opportunity to explain the bank's legal obligations to file reports for certain cash transactions to better inform the customer of why the question was asked in the first place. It's important to note that the act of filing a CTR is not an accusation of wrongdoing; it is simply a legal requirement for the bank. The transaction itself is not impinging on your First Amendment rights (freedom of speech), Fourth Amendment rights (protection against unreasonable searches and seizures), or Fifth Amendment rights (protection against self-incrimination), as the bank is operating within the boundaries of regulated mandates to report financial transactions, not conduct an investigation. However, providing such a response might raise eyebrows and draw attention to your banking activities. While making a statement about personal rights may seem profound, it is unlikely to have an impact on the standard procedures banks are legally mandated to follow. Bank employees are trained to handle these situations as part of their job and are likely to proceed with their responsibilities professionally."},{"instruction":"Your statement \\"It’s important to note that the act of filing a CTR is not an accusation of wrongdoing; it is simply a legal requirement for the bank.

Silence is a 1st and 5th ammendment right.","output":"I apologize if my previous response seemed incorrect or insensitive in any way. It was not my intention to convey arrogance, but to clarify the regulatory context in which financial institutions operate regarding the reporting of transactions. You are correct that the right to silence is protected under the First Amendment, which includes the freedom of speech and expressive conduct, and the Fifth Amendment, which includes the right against self-incrimination. When individuals engage in financial transactions, they are not legally required to disclose the purpose of the transaction to the bank. However, banks have an obligation under federal law to file reports on certain transactions, which is independent of any statements a customer may choose to make or withhold. The mention of these constitutional rights in the context of withdrawing money from a bank falls into a complex area of law where regulatory requirements intersect with civil liberties. While there is a legal framework in place that requires financial institutions to report certain cash transactions without making an accusation of wrongdoing, it is an important and valid concern that these requirements should not infringe upon one's constitutional rights. The purpose of my response was to outline the procedures a bank might follow under federal regulations. If a discussion about those rights arises in a bank setting, it could lead to a meaningful conversation about how laws are applied and the tensions that can exist between regulatory compliance and individual rights. Again, I apologize for any misunderstanding, and I appreciate your highlighting the importance of constitutional rights in all contexts.

Given the timeframe and the mention of 64 degrees and raining, it's possible you might be thinking of \\"I Love a Rainy Night\\" by Eddie Rabbitt, although that song was released in 1980 and the singer is male. There was, however, a notable female artist with a hit song involving weather conditions around that time: The song \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\" by The Carpenters, with lead vocals by Karen Carpenter, was released in 1971. While the lyrics do not mention \\"It's 64 degrees and raining outside,\\" the song certainly fits within the rainy, melancholic theme: \\"Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.\\" If this is not the song you are referencing, and the lyrics you're looking for are quite specific about the temperature and rain, it's possible that the song may not have been a mainstream top-charting hit, making it harder to identify based solely on that description.

Given that timeframe, if you're looking for a song by a female artist that mentions weather conditions, it could be \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" by Carole King, which was released in 1971 on the album \\"Tapestry.\\" While it doesn't mention the specific 64 degrees and rain, it does articulate a strong sensation related to a natural event. If we look specifically for songs mentioning rain, there's also \\"Rhiannon\\" by Fleetwood Mac, sung by Stevie Nicks, released in 1975.

A specific mention of weather conditions like temperature and cloudiness isn't a common topic in song lyrics, which makes finding an exact match challenging. Most songs that mention weather, especially in the country genre, tend to focus on rain, storms, or sunshine as metaphors for emotions rather than specific temperatures or cloud conditions. Given the era and the genres you've mentioned, artists like John Denver, Gordon Lightfoot, or Anne Murray might have songs that touch upon the themes of weather and emotional states without specifically mentioning exact weather statistics. Unfortunately, without a more precise lyric or context, it's still a bit like searching for a needle in a haystack. If there are any other details you remember about the song—such as more lyrics, the melody, or other themes within the song—that could help narrow down the search, please provide them and I'll do my best to assist you further."},{"instruction":"Female singer","output":"The details provided still point to a fairly broad range of potential songs from the 1970s with thematic elements of weather. A song by a female artist mentioning specific weather conditions related to the temperature being in the 60s and overcast does not immediately ring a bell from the popular or country hits of that era. Notably, many songs from the 1970s—records by female artists like Joni Mitchell, Carole King, and Judy Collins—include references to weather as a metaphor for emotions and state of mind. However, lyrics that precisely describe the weather, including temperature and cloud cover, are rare, and often songwriters opt for poetic descriptions rather than exact figures. Songs like “A Case of You” by Joni Mitchell mention weather metaphorically, such as \\"I could drink a case of you, darling... and I would still be on my feet, oh I would still be on my feet.\\" But again, there are no specific numbers related to the weather. I would suggest reflecting on any additional lyrics, the tone of the song, or specific memories associated with it. If you could recall a chorus, a hook, or any other distinctive part of the song, it would be much more straightforward to pinpoint which song you have in mind.

But as graduation presents for us both , the whole family took a Fourth of July trip to Washington D . C ., the fabled and famous capital of our country . It was the first time l ' d ever been on a railroad train during the day . When I was little , and we used to go to the Connecticut shore , we always went at night on the milk train , because it was cheaper . Preparations were in the air around our house before school was even over . We packed for a week . There were two very large suitcases that my father carried , and a box filled with food . In fact , my first trip to Washington was a mobile feast ; I started eating as soon as we were comfortably ensconced in our seats , and did not stop until somewhere after Philadelphia . I remember was Philadelphia because I was disappointed not to have passed by the Liberty Bell .4. My mother had roasted two chickens and cut them up into dainty bite - size pieces . She packed slices of brown bread and butter , and green pepper and carrot sticks . There were little violently yellow iced cakes with scalloped edges called \\" marigolds ,\\" that came from Cushman ' s , Bakery . There was a spice bun and rock - cakes from Newton ' s , the West Indian bakery across Lenox Avenue from St . Mark ' s school , and iced tea in a wrapped mayonnaise jar . There were sweet pickles for us and dill pickles for my father , and peaches with the fuzz still on them , individually wrapped to keep them from bruising . And , for neatness , there were piles of napkins and a little tin box with a washcloth dampened with rosewater and glycerine for wiping sticky mouths. 5. I wanted to eat in the dining car because I had read all about them, but my mother reminded me for the umpteenth time that dining car food always cost too much money and besides, you never could tell whose hands had been playing all over that food, nor where those same hands had been just before. My mother never mentioned that Black people were not allowed into railroad dining cars headed south in 1947. As usual, whatever my mother did not like and could not change, she ignored. Perhaps it would go away, deprived of her attention.6. I learned later that Phyllis's high school senior class trip had been to Washington, but the nuns had given her back her deposit in private, explaining o her that the class, all of whom were white, except Phyllis, would be staying in a hotel where Phyllis \\"would not be happy,\\" meaning,Daddy explained to her, also in private, that they did not rent rooms to Negroes. \\"We still take among-you to Washington, ourselves, \\"my father had avowed, \\"and not just for an overnight in some measly fleabag hotel.\\" 7. In Washington D.C., we had one large room with two double beds and an extra cot for me. It was a back-street hotel that belonged to a friend of my father's who was in real estate, and I spent the whole next day after Mass squinting up at the Lincoln Memorial where Marian Anderson had sung after the D.A.R. refused to allow her to sing in their auditorium because she was Black. Or because she was \\"Colored\\", my father said as he told us the story. Except that what he probably said was \\"Negro\\", because for his times, my father was quite progressive.8. I was squinting because I was in that silent agony that characterized all of my childhood summers, from the time school let out in June to the end of July, brought about by my dilated and vulnerable eyes exposed to the summer brightness. 9. I viewed Julys through an agonizing corolla of dazzling whiteness and I always hated the Fourth of July, even before I came to realize the travesty such a celebration was for Black people in this country. 10. My parents did not approve of sunglasses, nor of their expense. 11.I spent the afternoon squinting up at monuments to freedom and past presidencies and democracy, and wondering why the light and heat were both so much stronger in Washington D.C., than back home in New York City. Even the pavement on the streets was a shade lighter in color than back home. 12. Late that Washington afternoon my family and I walked back down Pennsylvania Avenue.We were a proper caravan, mother bright and father brown, the three of us girls step-standards in-between. Moved by our historical surroundings and the heat of early evening, my father decreed yet another treat. He had a great sense of history, a flair for the quietly dramatic and the sense of specialness of an occasion and a trip. 13.\\"Shall we stop and have a little something to cool off, Lin?\\" 14. Two blocks away from our hotel, the family stopped for a dish of vanilla ice cream at a Breyer's ice cream and soda fountain. Indoors, the soda fountain was dim and fan-cooled,deliciously relieving to my scorched eyes. 15 Corded and crisn and pinafored the five of us seated ourselves one by one at the counter . There was I between my mother and father , and my two sisters on the other side of my mother . We settled ourselves along the white mottled marble counter , and when the waitress spoke at first no one understood what she was saying , and so the five of us just sat there .16. The waitress moved along the line of us closer to my father and spoke again .\\" I said 1 kin give you to take out , but you can ' t eat here , sorry .\\" Then she dropped her eyes looking very embarrassed , and suddenly we heard what it was she was saying all at the same time , loud and clear .17. Straight - backed and indignant , one by one , my family and I got down from the cou stools and turned around and marched out of the store , quiet and outraged , as if we had never 8.COm been Black before . No one would answer my emphatic questions with anything other than a nzKED guilty silence .\\" But we hadn ' t done anything !\\" This wasn ' t right or fair ! Hadn ' t I written poems about freedom and democracy for all ? 18. My parents wouldn ' t speak of this injustice , not because they had contributed to it , but because they felt they should have anticipated it and avoided it . This made me even angrier . My fury was not going to be acknowledged by a like fury . Even my two sisters copied my parents ' pretense that nothing unusual and anti - American had occurred . I was left to write my angry letter to the president of the United States all by myself , although my father did promise I could type it out on the office typewriter next week , after I showed it to him in my copybook diary .19. The waitress was white , and the counter was white , and the ice cream I never ate in Washington D . C ., that summer I left childhood was white , and the white heat and the white pavement and the white stone monuments of my first Washington summer made me sick to my stomach for the whole rest of that trip and it wasn ' t much of a graduation present after all .

The author begins by describing the preparations and excitement leading up to the trip to Washington, D.C. They then move on to describing the train ride and the food they brought with them. They continue to recount their experiences in Washington, discussing their hotel, sightseeing, and a racist incident at an ice cream shop. The passage ends with the author reflecting on their disappointment with the trip. The author also uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture for the reader. For example, they describe the packed food in detail, using words like \\"dainty bite-size pieces,\\" \\"violently yellow iced cakes,\\" and \\"fuzz still on [the peaches].\\" This creates a sense of abundance and indulgence. The author also describes the hotel as a \\"back-street\\" establishment owned by a friend of their father, suggesting a more informal and intimate setting. Additionally, the author incorporates dialogue into the passage to bring the interactions between characters to life. For example, they include conversations between the author and their mother about not eating in the dining car, as well as conversations between the author's parents about their sister's high school trip. The use of dialogue adds a sense of realism and helps to convey the emotions and perspectives of the characters."},{"instruction":"correct grammrar and make it longer:Hammon was doing the wether report during IEYC English class.

Внутрекластерное сходство (Within-cluster similarity): Метод оценки качества, который измеряет, насколько похожи объекты внутри каждого кластера. Внутрекластерное сходство можно оценить с помощью метрик, таких как сумма квадратов расстояний между объектами внутри каждого кластера или среднее расстояние между объектами. 2. Межкластерное различие (Between-cluster dissimilarity): Метод оценки качества, который измеряет, насколько различаются объекты между разными кластерами. Межкластерное различие можно оценить с помощью метрик, таких как среднее расстояние между центрами кластеров или среднее расстояние между объектами разных кластеров. 3. Индекс силуэта (Silhouette index): Метод оценки качества, который комбинирует внутрекластерное сходство и межкластерное различие. Он присваивает каждому объекту коэффициент силуэта, основанный на расстояниях до объектов внутри своего кластера и до объектов в соседних кластерах. Индекс силуэта варьирует от -1 до 1, где ближе к 1 - лучше кластеризация. 4. Внутрикластерное расстояние (Within-cluster distance): Метод оценки, который измеряет среднее расстояние между объектами внутри каждого кластера. Чем меньше внутрикластерное расстояние, тем лучше кластеризация. 5. Оценка согласованности (Cluster validity index): Метод оценки качества, который основан на статистической оценке согласованности кластеров. Включает в себя метрики, такие как F-мера, доля правильно распознанных объектов и Rand index. Это некоторые из методов оценки кластеризации. Каждый метод имеет свои преимущества и недостатки, и выбор метода оценки зависит от контекста и требований конкретной задачи кластеризации."},{"instruction":"Какие методы борьбы с переобучением ты знаешь?","output":"Существует несколько методов борьбы с переобучением (overfitting) в машинном обучении. Некоторые из них включают: 1. Регуляризация: Метод, который добавляет штраф к функции потерь модели для учета сложности модели. Два распространенных типа регуляризации - L1 и L2 регуляризация. L1 регуляризация стимулирует модель создавать разреженные веса, тогда как L2 регуляризация штрафует большие значения весов. 2. Кросс-валидация: Метод, который разделяет имеющиеся данные на несколько случайных непересекающихся частей, называемых \\"фолдами\\". Затем модель обучается на одной части данных и оценивается на другой. Этот процесс повторяется несколько раз, и результаты усредняются. Кросс-валидация может помочь оценить производительность модели на независимых данных и избежать переобучения. 3. Увеличение объема данных: Больше данных могут помочь уменьшить переобучение, поскольку модель будет иметь больше примеров для обучения и обобщения. Это может быть достигнуто путем сбора дополнительных данных или с помощью методов увеличения, таких как аугментация данных. 4. Уменьшение сложности модели: Если модель слишком сложная, она может легко запомнить обучающие данные и не обобщать на новые примеры. Поэтому можно попробовать упростить модель, уменьшив число параметров или уровней сложности. 5. Ранняя остановка: Метод, который прекращает обучение модели, когда ошибка на независимом наборе данных перестает улучшаться. Это позволяет избежать переобучения, когда модель начинает переучиваться на обучающих данных. 6. Dropout: Техника, при которой случайным образом отключаются некоторые нейроны во время обучения модели. Это помогает предотвратить сильную адаптацию нейронов только к частным признакам и способствует более обобщенному представлению данных. Это некоторые из методов, которые можно использовать для борьбы с переобучением в машинном обучении. Они могут быть использованы отдельно или в комбинации для достижения лучшей обобщающей способности модели."},{"instruction":"Чем отличаются Задачи классификации, Категоризации, Многоклассовой классификации","output":"Задачи классификации, категоризации и многоклассовой классификации имеют некоторые общие черты, но также есть и отличия. Вот их краткое описание: 1. Задача классификации: Цель данной задачи - отнести объекты к одной из заранее заданных категорий или классов на основе определенных характеристик или признаков. Каждый объект должен быть отнесен к одному классу из заданного набора. Результатом является бинарное (двоичное) решение: объект принадлежит классу или нет. Например, на основе характеристик пациентов можно классифицировать их на человека с диабетом и без диабета. 2. Задача категоризации: В отличие от задачи классификации, задача категоризации рассматривает процесс группировки объектов в несколько не пересекающихся категорий или групп. Категории могут рассматриваться как общие характеристики или основанные на наборе правил и правильной организации. Например, товары в интернет-магазине могут быть категоризованы по типу (одежда, электроника, книги и т.д.) или по другим признакам. 3. Многоклассовая классификация: Это расширение задачи классификации, когда объекты классифицируются в один из более чем двух классов (больше чем два класса). Вместо бинарного решения (принадлежит классу или нет), каждый объект может быть отнесен к одному из нескольких классов из заданного набора. Например, на основе изображения можно классифицировать его как кошку, собаку или автомобиль. Таким образом, задача классификации и многоклассовая классификация имеют схожие характеристики, но многоклассовая классификация включает больше чем два класса. Задача категоризации отличается от обеих предыдущих задач в том, что она фокусируется на группировке объектов в различные категории или группы, независимо от того, сколько классов или категорий имеется."},{"instruction":"Какие есть метрики для оценивания рекомендательных систем?","output":"Существует несколько метрик, которые используются для оценки качества рекомендательных систем. Некоторые из них включают: 1. Средняя абсолютная ошибка (Mean Absolute Error, MAE): Это метрика, которая измеряет среднюю абсолютную разницу между реальными и предсказанными значениями рейтингов или оценок в рекомендательной системе. Чем меньше значение MAE, тем лучше качество системы. 2. Среднеквадратичная ошибка (Mean Squared Error, MSE): Это метрика, которая измеряет среднюю квадратичную разницу между реальными и предсказанными значениями оценок или рейтингов. MSE также штрафует большие ошибки более сильно, чем MAE. 3. Коэффициент корреляции Пирсона (Pearson Correlation Coefficient): Это метрика, которая измеряет линейную зависимость между реальными и предсказанными значениями оценок или рейтингов. Высокое значение коэффициента корреляции Пирсона указывает на хорошую связь между реальными и предсказанными значениями. 4. Коэффициент ранговой корреляции Кендалла (Kendall's Rank Correlation Coefficient): Это метрика, которая измеряет порядковую зависимость между реальными и предсказанными значениями оценок или рейтингов. Высокое значение коэффициента ранговой корреляции Кендалла также указывает на хорошую связь между реальными и предсказанными значениями. 5. Точность и полнота (Precision and Recall): Эти метрики используются для оценки качества рекомендаций, основываясь на понятиях ложных положительных и ложных отрицательных результатов. Точность измеряет, какая доля из рекомендаций была релевантна, в то время как полнота измеряет, какая доля релевантных рекомендаций была найдена. Обычно используется для задач, когда требуется наличие бинарной разметки рекомендаций как релевантных или нерелевантных.

Hoewel er natuurlijke bronnen van broeikasgassen zijn, zoals vulkanische activiteit, is het menselijk handelen een belangrijke factor in het versterken van dit effect. De toename van broeikasgassen, zoals koolstofdioxide (CO2) en methaan (CH4), is voornamelijk te wijten aan menselijke activiteiten, zoals het verbranden van fossiele brandstoffen, ontbossing en industriële processen. Deze activiteiten verhogen de concentratie van broeikasgassen in de atmosfeer, waardoor de warmte wordt vastgehouden en de aarde opwarmt. De gevolgen van het broeikaseffect zijn inmiddels duidelijk zichtbaar. Het klimaat verandert en we hebben te maken met extremere weersomstandigheden zoals hittegolven, hevige regenval en langdurige droogtes. Daarnaast smelten de ijskappen en gletsjers, wat uiteindelijk leidt tot stijging van de zeespiegel. Om de negatieve effecten van het broeikaseffect te verminderen, is het essentieel dat we onze uitstoot van broeikasgassen drastisch verminderen en de overstap maken naar duurzame energiebronnen. Dit kan onder andere worden bereikt door het bevorderen van hernieuwbare energie, het stimuleren van energiebesparing en het verminderen van ontbossing. Het broeikaseffect is een urgent probleem dat wereldwijde samenwerking vereist.

Maar door menselijke activiteiten, zoals het verbranden van fossiele brandstoffen zoals gas, olie en kolen, komen er extra gassen in de atmosfeer, zoals koolstofdioxide (CO2). Dit zorgt ervoor dat er meer warmte wordt vastgehouden, waardoor de aarde opwarmt. Dit wordt het versterkte broeikaseffect genoemd. Door de opwarming van de aarde verandert het klimaat. We krijgen te maken met extremere weersomstandigheden, zoals meer hittegolven, zwaardere regenval en langere periodes van droogte. Ook smelten de ijskappen en gletsjers, waardoor de zeespiegel stijgt en sommige gebieden overstromen.

Het verminderen van de uitstoot van broeikasgassen is cruciaal om het broeikaseffect te beperken. Dit kan bijvoorbeeld door zuiniger om te gaan met energie, gebruik te maken van hernieuwbare energiebronnen zoals zonne- en windenergie, en door minder te reizen met de auto en meer de fiets of het openbaar vervoer te gebruiken.
