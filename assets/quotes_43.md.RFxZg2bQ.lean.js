During droughts, more members of large finch species survive because their bills are large enough to crack large, hard seeds, giving them a food supply unavailable to smaller birds. In rainy years, fewer members of the large finch species survive because the additional moisture fosters the growth of plants that produce small seeds. The larger finch varieties have to consume enormous numbers of small seeds to meet their energy demands, and some just cannot eat them fast enough. Which one of the following must be assumed in order to justify the conclusion that climatic variations cause a major difference in survival rates of small and large finches? A: During drought conditions, the weather promotes the growth of plants that produce small, hard seeds. B: A lengthy period of rainy weather results in fewer large, hard seeds being produced. C: In rainy periods, the small finches gather enough food to grow much larger and heavier, but their ultimate size is limited by their inability to eat small seeds fast.

Medical science now has a drug that can be used to successfully treat multiple sclerosis, but the path that led medical researchers to this drug was hardly straightforward. Initially, some scientists believed attacks characteristic of multiple sclerosis might be triggered by chronic viral infections. So in 1984 they began testing gamma interferon, one of the body' s own antiviral weapons. To their horror, all the multiple sclerosis patients tested became dramatically worse. The false step proved to be instructive however. Which one of the following is LEAST compatible with the results of the gamma interferon experiment? A: Gamma interferon stops white blood cells from producing myelindestroying compounds. B: Administering gamma interferon to those without multiple sclerosis causes an increase in the number of white blood cells.

This situation causes an enormous and dangerous drain on increasingly scarce public resources. Each false alarm wastes an average of 45 minutes of police time. As a result police are consistently taken away from responding to other legitimate calls for service, and a disproportionate share of police service goes to alarm system users, who are mostly businesses and affluent homeowners. However, burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries, so the only acceptable solution is to fine burglar alarm system owners the cost of 45 minutes of police time for each false alarm their systems generate. The statement that burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries plays which one of the following roles in the argument? A: It provides a basis for excluding as unacceptable one obvious alternative to the proposal of fining owners of burglar alarm systems for false alarms. B: It explains why a disproportionate number of the burglar alarms responded to by police come from alarm systems owned by businesses. C: It gives a reason why police might be more inclined to respond to burglar alarms than to car alarms.

The collision of these objects, which once formed most of the comet ShoemakerLevy 9, resulted in formations that showed no signs of water. There was thus no water involved in the collisions, so we know that none of the comet' s fragments penetrated to Jupiter' s lower atmosphere and that the comet was composed of rock rather than ice. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: Comets tend to be composed largely of ice while asteroids are composed mainly of rock. B: The postcollision analysis of Jupiter showed that the formations all had exactly the same composition. C: The deeper the explosion occurred in Jupiter's atmosphere, the more difficult it would be to detect from Earth.

Since gloomy books predicting that even more terrifying times await us are clearly not of this genre, they are unlikely to be very popular. The questionable pattern of reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above? A: Action movies that involve complicated and dangerous specialeffects scenes are enormously expensive to produce. Hence, since traditional dramatic or comedic films contain no such scenes, it is probable that they are relatively inexpensive to produce. B: Art that portrays people as happy and contented has a tranquilizing effect on the viewer, an effect that is appealing to those who are tense or anxious. Thus, people who dislike such art are neither tense nor anxious. C: People who enjoy participating in activities such as fishing or hiking may nevertheless enjoy watching such spectator sports as boxing or football. Thus, one cannot infer from someone's participating in vigorous contact sports that he or she is not also fond of less violent forms of recreation. D: All selfemployed businesspeople have salaries that fluctuate with the fortunes of the general economy, but government bureaucrats are not selfemployed.

For one thing, this deterioration can be slowed by some antiinflammatory drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer' s are unable to eliminate the protein BA from the brain, where it accumulates and forms deposits. The microglia attack these protein deposits by releasing poisons that destroy surrounding healthy brain cells, thereby impairing the brain' s cognitive functions. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the science writer's argument? A: Acetylsalicylic acid reduces the production of immune cells in the brain. B: Immune reactions by microglia occur in certain diseases of the brain other than Alzheimer's. C: The inability of Alzheimer's patients to eliminate the protein BA from the brain is due to a deficiency in the brain's immune system.

A: Scientists are far from being able to link any specific genes to specific inclinations. B: Many people, including identical twins, undergo radical changes in their lifestyles at some point in their lives.

Thus, it would be better if the top prize in architecture were awarded to the best building rather than the best architect. The argument proceeds by A: making a distinction between two different types of objects in order to conclude that one has more inherent value than the other B: contending that an action is inappropriate by presenting an argument that a corresponding action in an analogous case is inappropriate C: reaching a conclusion about the way something should be done in one field on the basis of comparisons with corresponding practices in other fields D: pointing to similarities between two practices as a basis for concluding that criticisms of one practice can rightly be applied to the other Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"Many people change their wills on their own every few years, in response to significant changes in their personal or financial circumstances. This practice can create a problem for the executor when these people are careless and do not date their wills: the executor will then often know neither which one of several undated wills is the most recent, nor whether the will drawn up last has ever been found. Ttherefore, people should not only date their wills but also state in any new will which will it supersedes, for then there would not be a problem to begin with. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument A: fails to distinguish between prevention of a problem and successful containment of the adverse effects that the problem might cause B: treats a partial solution to the stated problem as though it were a complete solution C: proposes a solution to the stated problem that does not actually solve the problem but merely makes someone else responsible for solving the problem D: claims that a certain action would be a change for the better without explicitly considering what negative consequences the action might have Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"B"},{"instruction":"Announcement for a television program: Are female physicians more sensitive than male physicians to the needs of women patients?

One historian contends that Alfred also personally penned his own law code, arguing that the numerous differences between the language of the law code and Alfred' s translations of Latin texts are outweighed by the even more numerous similarities. Linguistic similarities, however, are what one expects in texts from the same language, the same time, and the same region. Apart from Alfred' s surviving translations and law code, there are only two other extant works from the same dialect and milieu, so it is risky to assume here that linguistic similarities point to common authorship.

Since biologists agree that frogs are definitely related to the species of fish from which human beings evolved, on the basis of a close match between the mitochondrial DNA of lungfish and that of frogs Dr. StevensHoyt claims that this ancestor must be lungfish. Dr. Grover, on the other hand, contends that mitochondrial DNA evolves too rapidly to be a reliable indicator of relationships between species over long periods of time, and citing the close chemical match between the hemoglobin of coelacanths (a saltwater fish) and that of tadpoles, claims that human beings must be descended from coelacanths. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the dispute above by the proposition that frogs are definitely related to the species of fish from which human beings evolved? A: It is offered as evidence for the contention that human beings must be descended from either lungfish or coelacanths. B: Since it implies that human beings are not descended from lungfish, it is cited as evidence against the claim that humans are descended from lungfish. C: It is an assumption that both parties to the dispute use as a starting point for their arguments about human evolution.

Movies starring unknown actors are ttherefore unlikely to do well. The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following? A: Many animals must devote most of their energy to locating food, or they will not get enough food to maintain optimal energy levels. Thus, if immediate survival requires such an animal to devote most of its energy to some other purpose, optimal energy levels generally will not be maintained. B: Often the presence of the flower bee balm in a garden will attract bumblebees that pollinate the plants and enable the garden to produce an abundant crop. So, gardens that lack bee balm usually do not produce abundant crops. C: Visual aids can be very useful in effectively teaching math skills, because they generally allow vivid conceptualization of math principles. If such visual aids were never employed, ttherefore, teaching math skills might sometimes be more difficult.

After all, many substances known to be carcinogenic to humans cause no cancer in rats; this is probably because some carcinogens cause cancer only via longterm exposure and rats are short lived. Which one of the following most precisely describes the role played in the scientist's argument by the statement that chemical R did not cause cancer in laboratory rats? A: It is cited as being insufficient to support the conclusion that chemical R is safe for humans. B: It is advanced to support the contention that test results obtained from laboratory rats cannot be extrapolated to humans.

Which one of the following most closely conforms to the principle illustrated by Evan's criticism of vegetarians who eat seafood? A: It is uncertain whether all owners of the defective vehicles know that their vehicles are being recalled by the manufacturer. Thus, we should expect that some vehicles that have been recalled have not been returned. B: I am opposed to using incentives such as reduced taxes to attract businesses to our region. These incentives would attract businesses interested only in shortterm profits. Such businesses would make our region's economy less stable, because they have no longterm commitment to the community.

Company reports of topdown volunteer programs and suggested donations through work are less likely to be performed by millennials and more likely to be performed by the generation that preceded them. Millennials who are on board with company donation programs are rare. Which of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the argument? A: The argument assumes that corporate greed is the byproduct of the millennial attitude with no sufficient evidence backing this claim. The evidence presented has more to do with millennial behavior related to volunteering and less to do with direct corporate greed. B: The argument fails to acknowledge corporate altruism, which is a responsibility that a corporation has to the environment and the impact it has on society. Corporate responsibility is just as important as individual responsibility, especially when it has so large an effect on the world. C: The argument fails to consider altruistic millennial behavior outside of the corporate environment. It only mentions topdown volunteer programs and donations through a company. The argument does not take note of what causes millennials are contributing to in their own free time.

Semiplaning monohulls offer the same advantages over traditional ships. Thus they will probably be profitable as well. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the engineer's argument by the statement that transportation will be much more expensive on semiplaning monohulls than on traditional ships? A: It draws an analogy between semiplaning monohulls and conventional ships that constitutes an objection to the argument's main conclusion, one that is subsequently rejected by appeal to another analogy. B: It constitutes a potential objection to the argument's main conclusion, but is subsequently countered by an analogy drawn between ships and airplanes. C: It draws a distinction between characteristics of semiplaning monohulls and characteristics of conventional ships that the argument's main conclusion compares to a distinction between types of airplanes.

But many critics complain that her novels are indifferent to important moral questions. This charge is unfair. Each of her novels is a poetic condensation of a major emotional crisis in the life of an ordinary person of her time. Such emotional crises almost invariably raise important moral questions. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: A novel that poetically condenses a major emotional crisis does not have to be indifferent to the important moral questions raised by that crisis. B: To deserve the level of praise that Colette has received, a novelist's work must concern itself with important moral questions. C: The vividness of Colette's language was not itself the result of poetic condensation.

Consequently, regular watchers become accustomed to thinking of issues in terms only of slogans and catch phrases, and so the expectation of careful discussion of public issues gradually disappears from their awareness. The format of newspaper stories, on the other hand, leads readers to pursue details of stories headed by the most important facts and so has the opposite effect on regular readers that of maintaining the expectation of careful discussion of public issues. Ttherefore, in contrast to regular newspaper reading, regular watching of network television news programs increases the tendency to think of public issues in oversimplified terms. The argument assumes which one of the following? A: In network television news reports, it is not usual for a reporter to offer additional factual evidence and background information to develop a story in which opposing views are presented briefly by their advocates. B: It is not possible for television to present public issues in a way that allows for the nuanced presentation of diverse views and a goodfaith interchange between advocates of opposing views.

Such a system, we can infer, would result in improved traffic flow in and around cities that would do more than improve drivers' tempers; it would decrease the considerable loss of money and productivity that now results from traffic congestion. Louis: There are already traffic reports on the radio. Why would a smart highway system be any better? If Eva responded to Luis by saying that the current oneminute radio reports are too short to give a sufficient description of overall patterns of traffic congestion, which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen Luis's challenge? A: It would be less costly to have radio stations that give continual, lengthier traffic reports than to install a smart highway system. B: Bad weather, which radio stations report, would cause traffic to slow down whether or not a smart highway system was in operation.

Most experts believe that plesiosauromorphs lurked and quickly ambushed their prey. However, plesiosauromorphs probably hunted by chasing their prey over long distances. Plesiosauromorph fins were quite long and thin, like the wings of birds specialized for longdistance flight. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the paleontologist's argument depends? A: Birds and reptiles share many physical features because they descend from common evolutionary ancestors. B: During the age of dinosaurs, plesiosauromorphs were the only marine reptiles that had long, thin fins. C: The shape of a marine animal's fin affects the way the animal swims in the same way as the shape of a bird's wing affects the way the bird flies.

They reason that since new traits evolve gradually, something like human language, albeit cruder, must exist in some species from which humans evolved. This general line of argument may be reasonable, but it simply does not follow that chimpanzees have anything like human language, because humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. While chimpanzees are indeed closely related to humans, this is because both evolved from a common ancestor. The evolution of human language might easily have begun after the extinction of that common ancestor. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the anthropologist's argument? A: The evolution of human language began after the disappearance of an extinct species from which both humans and chimpanzees evolved. B: The assumption that something like human language must exist in some species from which humans evolved has no clearcut linguistic implications for chimpanzees.

An increase in the level causes the atmosphere to hold more heat, which causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which causes increased rain. Rain washes some carbon from the air into the oceans, where it eventually becomes part of the seabed. A decrease in atmospheric carbon causes the atmosphere to hold less heat, which causes decreased evaporation from the oceans, which causes less rain, and thus less carbon is washed into the oceans. Yet some environmentalists worry that burning fossil fuels may raise atmospheric carbon to a dangerous level. It is true that a sustained increase would threaten human life. But the environmentalists should relax nature will continually adjust the carbon level. Each of the following can be inferred from the information in the passage EXCEPT: A: A decrease in the level of carbon in the atmosphere causes decreased evaporation of ocean water. B: A decrease in the level of atmospheric heat causes a decrease in the level of carbon in the atmosphere. C: An increase in the level of atmospheric heat causes increased rainfall.

We can conclude from this that avoiding meat increases one' s chances of avoiding serious heart disease. Ttherefore, people who want to reduce the risk of serious heart disease should not eat meat. The flawed pattern of reasoning exhibited by which one of the following is most similar to that exhibited by the argument above? A: The majority of people who regularly drink coffee experience dental problems in the latter part of their lives. Since there is this correlation between drinking coffee and incurring dental problems, the government should make coffee less accessible to the general public.

The malaria parasite can remain for up to forty days in the blood of an infected person. The disease cannot be passed from person to person, unless a noninfected person is exposed to the blood of an infected person. Theoretically, malaria could be eradicated in any given area, if all the mosquitoes carrying malaria in that area are exterminated. If such a course of action is carried out at a worldwide level, then the global eradication of malaria is possible. Which of the following, if true, suggests that the epidemiologist's plan for eliminating malaria is not viable? A: A person who is infected with malaria can infect a mosquito that is not carrying malaria, if that mosquito bites such a person. B: Malaria is still endemic in many parts of the world, and many health workers believe that the global eradication of malaria is not possible. C: Some people in areas where malaria is rife have developed an immunity to mosquitos, yet they also show a higher incidence of genetic disorders such as sicklecell anemia.

But the author' s contention that being hunted by humans contributed to the woolly mammoth's extinction is surely wrong since, as paleontologists know, no spearheads have ever been found among the many mammoth bones that have been unearthed. Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason for discounting the evidence Perkins cites in arguing against the contention that being hunted by humans contributed to the North American extinction of woolly mammoths? A: Cave paintings in North America that date from 12, 000 years ago depict woolly mammoths as well as a variety of other animals, including deer and buffalo. B: Because of the great effort that would have been required to produce each stone spearhead, hunters would have been unlikely to leave them behind. C: At sites where mammoth bones dating from 12, 000 years ago have been unearthed, bones of other mammals have rarely been found. D: The stone from which stone spearheads were made is unlikely to have disintegrated over the course of 12, 000 years.

A painting, in contrast, is not presented one part at a time to the viewer; there is thus no particular path that the viewer' s eye must follow in order to read the painting. Ttherefore, an essential distinction between the experiences of hearing music and of viewing paintings is that hearing music has a temporal dimension but viewing a painting has none. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because A: relying on the metaphor of reading to characterize how a painting is viewed presupposes the correctness of the conclusion to be drawn on the basis of that characterization B: the argument does not allow for the possibility of being immersed in experiencing a painting without being conscious of the passage of time C: the absence of a particular path that the eye must follow does not entail that the eye follows no path D: the argument fails to bring out the aspects of music and painting that are common to both as forms of artistic expression Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"When volcanic lava solidifies, it becomes uniformly magnetized in the direction in which the Earth' s magnetic field points. There are significant differences in the direction of magnetization among solidified lava flows from different volcanoes that erupted at different times over the past several million years. Ttherefore, it must be that the direction of the Earth' s magnetic field has changed over time. Since lava flows differing by thousands of years in age often have very similar directions of magnetization, the change in the direction of the Earth' s magnetic field must take place very gradually over hundreds of thousands of years. The argument that the direction of the Earth's magnetic field has changed over time requires the assumption that A: not all solidified lava has changed the direction of its magnetization unpredictably B: only lava can be used to measure the direction of the Earth's magnetic field as it existed in the distant past C: as lava flows down the side of a volcano, it picks up magnetized rocks D: a single volcano can produce lava of differing consistencies during different eruptions Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"A"},{"instruction":"Electrical engineers have repeatedly demonstrated that the best solidstate amplifiers are indistinguishable from the best vacuumtube amplifiers with respect to the characteristics commonly measured in evaluating the quality of an amplifier' s musical reproduction. Ttherefore, those music lovers who insist that recorded music sounds better when played with the best vacuumtube amplifier than when played with the best solidstate amplifier must be imagining the difference in quality that they claim to hear. Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: Many people cannot tell from listening to it whether a recording is being played with a very good solidstate amplifier or a very good vacuumtube amplifier. B: Some of the characteristics that are important in determining how music sounds to a listener cannot be measured. C: The range of variation with respect to the quality of musical reproduction is greater for vacuumtube amplifiers than for solidstate amplifiers.

Ttherefore, the people who built the ring were not knowledgeable about celestial events . Which one of the following is an error of reasoning in Dobson's argument? A: Statements that absolutely establish Dobson's conclusion are treated as if they merely give some support to that conclusion.

This modest investigation thus supports the claim that one' s astrological birth sign influences one' s personality. Which one of the following, if true, indicates the most serious flaw in the method used by the investigators? A: People born under astrological signs other than Gemini have been judged by astrologers to be much less sociable than those born under Gemini.

He and Greene were the only ones in a position to tell the press about the institute' s potentially embarrassing affiliations, but Greene had no reason to do so. Ttherefore, it must have been Keeler who notified the press. Which one of the following arguments is most closely parallel in its reasoning to the argument above? A: Cutter and Rengo are the only serious candidates for designing the new monument. Rengo has designed several beautiful monuments and has connections to the selection committee. Ttherefore, it will probably be Rengo who is awarded the job of designing the monument. B: Other than Helms and Lapinski, no one had access to the equipment on Thursday, the day it was tampered with. Thus, since Helms had reason to tamper with the equipment and Lapinski did not, it must have been Helms who did it.

The maximization of profits normally depends on a stable economic environment, one that discourages change. The main point of the argument is that A: multinational grain companies operate so as to maximize profits B: multinational grain companies cannot be relied on to initiate reform of the world's fooddistribution system C: the maximization of profits depends on a stable economic environment D: when economic change accompanies business activity, that change is initiated by concern for the profit motive Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"B"},{"instruction":"Tanya is a lawyer.

However, modern literature is distinguished from the literature of earlier eras in part because it more frequently treats such protagonists sympathetically. Sympathetic treatment of such characters suggests to readers that one should be unconcerned about contributing to societal good. Thus, modern literature can damage individuals who appropriate this attitude, as well as damage society at large. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the critic's argument relies? A: Some individuals must believe that their society is better than most before they can become concerned with benefiting it. B: Modern literature is generally not as conducive to societal good as was the literature of earlier eras.

Those who suffer from the syndrome experienced excessive anxiety during early childhood. As adolescents, these people began experiencing migraine headaches. As these people approached the age of 20, they also began to experience recurring bouts of depression. Since this pattern is invariant, always with excessive anxiety at its beginning, it follows that excessive anxiety in childhood is one of the causes of migraine headaches and depression in later life. The reasoning in the argument is vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds? A: It fails to rule out the possibility that all of the characteristic symptoms of the syndrome have a common cause. B: It does not specify the proportion of those in the general population who suffer from the syndrome.

However, the study' s methods have since been shown to be flawed, and no other studies have succeeded in demonstrating mammalian parthenogenesis. Thus, since parthenogenesis is known to occur in a wide variety of nonmammalian vertebrates, there must be something about mammalian chromosomes that precludes the possibility of parthenogenesis. A flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that the argument A: infers that a characteristic is shared by all nonmammalian vertebrate species merely because it is shared by some nonmammalian vertebrate species B: confuses a necessary condition for parthenogenesis with a sufficient condition for it C: takes for granted that something that has not been proven to be true is for that reason shown to be false D: assumes that the methods used in a study of one mammalian species were flawed merely because the study's findings cannot be generalized to all other mammalian species Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"Sonya: The government of Copeland is raising the cigarette tax.

Contrary to what many people seem to believe, however, it is not necessary to deny this fact in order to reject the view that tobacco companies should be held either morally or legally responsible for the poor health of smokers. After all, excessive consumption of candy undeniably leads to such health problems as tooth decay, but no one seriously believes that candy eaters who get cavities should be able to sue candy manufacturers. The main point of the argument is that A: no one should feel it necessary to deny the scientifically wellestablished fact that longterm cigarette smoking can lead to health problems B: excessive consumption of candy will lead to health problems just as surely as longterm cigarette smoking will C: the fact that smokers' health problems can be caused by their smoking is not enough to justify holding tobacco companies either legally or morally responsible for those problems D: if candy manufacturers were held responsible for tooth decay among candy eaters then tobacco companies should also be held responsible for health problems suffered by smokers Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"Recently, many medical students have been enrolling in joint M. D. /J. D. programs, in which they receive both medical and law degrees at the conclusion of their studies. But since medical students primarily earn their law degree in order to protect themselves from malpractice lawsuits as doctors, we must still conclude that they are primarily doctors, and not lawyers. Which of the following is an assumption that supports drawing the conclusion above from the reason given? A: Some students who complete such joint programs choose to become lawyers in fields in which they do not use their medical training, while those who choose to become doctors do use legal training. B: If such joint degrees required that students focus more on their legal studies than their medical studies, students could be considered lawyers after graduation. C: Certain recipients of these joint degrees are not any less diligent than others in the legal courses that they take, with notable exceptions.

Government inspectors found that the typical IV solutions used in this hospital had somewhat high concentrations of sodium and potassium, which were raising patients' blood pressure and taxing their kidneys. The government inspectors mandated lowering the sodium and potassium in these IV preparations, and threatened with a possible government fine. In compliance, the hospital lowered the sodium and potassium levels in the IV solutions to the correct levels. Nevertheless, patients on IV therapy at that hospital continued to have a high rate of health complications. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain why acting on the government inspectors' recommendations failed to achieve its goal? A: When sodium and potassium levels in the blood fall below their baseline level, it can damage cells throughout the body by reverse osmosis. B: A high proportion of patients at this hospital are older, and older patients are more vulnerable to infections that can accompany IVs. C: It is typical for a patient's appetite to increase to healthy levels once they have completed a course of IV therapy.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an Arab-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY The camera pans across an ordinary apartment building hallway, with doors lining either side. The sound of hurried footsteps echoes as we focus on the end of the hallway where a DOOR is approached by AALIYAH ZAHRA, an attractive Arab-American woman in her late 20s. She wears stylish trousers, a blouse, and a blazer, appearing professional and put-together. Aaliyah, however, is clearly in distress. She clutches her abdomen, her face twisted with desperation. She exudes a sense of urgency. AALIYAH (whispering to herself) Oh, God... I need to go, like, right now. The camera follows Aaliyah as she rummages nervously through her bag, her hands frantically searching for her HOUSE KEY. Panic starts to build on her face. AALIYAH (sighing in frustration) Where is it? I swear I just had it! Aaliyah's attempts at calling her FLATMATE, SARA, go unanswered. She takes a deep breath, trying to steady herself. AALIYAH (hastily dialing Sara's number) Come on, pick up... please. The camera cuts to a series of SHOTS. Aaliyah knocks on the door, her desperation growing with each knock. Sweat beads on her forehead. AALIYAH (out of breath) Please, Sara! You have to be home! Suddenly, a VOICE emerges from the other side of the door. AUNT LAYLA (through the door) What's going on out there? Aaliyah freezes, her eyes widening with horror and disbelief. She bites her lip, contemplating her next move. AALIYAH (whispering to herself) No, no, no, not Aunt Layla! Aunt Layla, a vibrant and slightly eccentric woman in her early 40s, with a flair for fashion, had been temporarily staying with Aaliyah and Sara recently. She opens the door, albeit slowly due to her grogginess from a nap. Aunt Layla peers at Aaliyah, confusion etched on her face. AUNT LAYLA (rubbing her eyes) What on earth is happening, Aaliyah? Aaliyah's eyes dart between Aunt Layla and the hallway, her discomfort reaching a fever pitch. She hesitates before responding. AALIYAH (hesitant, barely audible) Um... I... Aunt Layla, I really need to go... like, now. Aunt Layla furrows her brow, still trying to make sense of the situation. AUNT LAYLA (nasal voice, intrigued) Go? Where? And why are you standing there? Aaliyah raises her hand, a gesture to silence Aunt Layla, as she lets out soft grunts of exertion. The physical strain on her face shows that she's in the midst of something unimaginable. Aunt Layla's eyes widen as the odor reaches her. Her confusion quickly turns to realization. AUNT LAYLA (disbelieving, gasping) Oh, my goodness! Did you...? Aaliyah finishes her uncomfortable endeavor, her face a mix of discomfort and relief. The sight she presents is both humorous and mortifying. The camera zooms in on the unfortunate sight of Aaliyah, her pants now adorned with an untimely relief of bodily waste. Aunt Layla's cocked head registers a mix of hilarity and bemusement. AUNT LAYLA (laughing) Oh, sweetheart! You really did what I think you did, didn't you? Aaliyah, initially avoiding eye contact, begins to sheepishly admit to the horrifying truth. AALIYAH (whispering) I... I pooped my pants, okay? It happened, alright? Aunt Layla's laughter grows, her teasing becoming playfully cruel. AUNT LAYLA (teasingly) My, my, Aaliyah! Aren't you a sight to behold? Pooping your pants like a toddler! Aaliyah's indignation mixes with her embarrassment, her face flushed with mortification. AALIYAH (defensively) Hey, it's your fault! You took ages to open the door! Aunt Layla playfully shakes her head, her gaze intense. AUNT LAYLA (teasingly) Oh, please! You should know better than to poop your pants, my dear. Aaliyah, now starting to regain her confidence, pouts and begins to move towards the bathroom. AALIYAH (mumbling) Whatever, I need to go clean up. Aunt Layla, however, gently stops her, her eyes filled with mischievous curiosity. AUNT LAYLA (mocking) But wait! I want to get a closer look at those poop-filled pants. Quite the accident you had there, huh? Just like a dirty diaper. Aaliyah rolls her eyes, but with a coy smile, she lets Aunt Layla turn her around for inspection. Aunty Layla delves into her teasing, reveling in the ridiculousness of the situation. AUNT LAYLA (playfully mocking) Oh, my, the stink is unbearable! You really do need to clean up, my dear. You stink. Aaliyah accepts her fate, laughing shyly through her embarrassment. AALIYAH (blushing) Okay, okay! I admit it, I'm stinky. Can I go clean myself up now? Aunt Layla, cackling, waves Aaliyah off. AUNT LAYLA (laughing, jokingly) Yes, go, you stinky girl. Clean yourself before I faint from the odor! As Aaliyah waddles past Aunt Layla, she playfully swats her, grinning with newfound amusement. AALIYAH (mock-offended) Thanks for your support, Aunt Layla. You're a real gem. The two exchange a look of shared hilarity and embarrassment before Aaliyah finally heads to the bathroom to clean up, leaving Aunt Layla still cackling in the doorway.

She was hoping to avoid her aunt's scrutiny in such a compromising situation. Aunt Lin, a woman in her early 50s, appears at the door, groggy from her nap and dressed in her casual loungewear. AUNT LIN Oh, Jasmine! Why are you in such a state? What's happening? JASMINE (squeaky voice) Aunt Lin...the door...I really, really need to get in! In agony, Jasmine's face twists, and she takes on an uncomfortable, awkward posture. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Aunt Lin speeds up her attempts to unlock the door. Just as the door opens wide, Jasmine loses control. AUNT LIN (recoiling in surprise) Wha-- What on earth...? The scene unfolds like a slow-motion trainwreck. Jasmine, in her moment of complete and untimely relief, poops her pants. Aunt Lin stares at Jasmine, her amusement quickly fading away, replaced by a mixture of confusion, shock, and, unfortunately, an unforgettable smell. AUNT LIN (disbelief) Jasmine, what the...why are you...oh my, that smell! Jasmine, still frozen in her embarrassing position, raises her hand, gesturing for silence while making soft grunting noises that indicate both embarrassment and relief. Aunt Lin attempts to inquire about the situation, but all she gets are dismissive grunts and raised eyebrows. The aunt's realization finally hits her. Her niece's pants are not only ruined but filled with poop. Jasmine, finishing her moment of unexpected urgency, heaves a relieved sigh. AUNT LIN (with a mix of laughter and disbelief) Did you really just do what I think you did? Embarrassed, Jasmine sheepishly admits the never-to-be-forgotten incident. JASMINE (sheepishly) Yes, Aunt Lin, I...I pooped my pants. Only after their exchange does Jasmine cautiously waddle into the apartment, passing Aunt Lin, who stands at the doorway, amused yet incredulous. AUNT LIN (teasingly) Oh, Jasmine, you better watch where you step! Those are some impressive moves you're making with your loaded pants. Jasmine, a mix of indignation and embarrassment, responds to the teasing in an initially indignant but playfully sulking manner, blaming Aunt Lin for delaying her at the door. JASMINE (playfully sulkily) If you hadn't taken so long to open the door, none of this would have happened! Aunt Lin playfully denies Jasmine's accusation and continues her teasing, mockingly comparing the situation to a dirty diaper. AUNT LIN (mockingly) Well, Jasmine, it seems like we have a grown-up baby with a full diaper on our hands. What a spectacle! Jasmine, growing more comfortable in her embarrassment, now heads towards the bathroom to clean up, all the while expressing her desire to do so. JASMINE (coyly) Alright, alright. I get it. I'll go clean up. This feels worse than a dirty diaper anyway. However, Aunt Lin stops Jasmine gently, wanting a closer inspection of the situation, still amazed at the absurdity of it all. AUNT LIN (gently teasing) Hold on there, young lady. Let me have a look at that impressive diaper you've got there. Definitely a sight to behold. Jasmine, feeling coy and sheepish, complains about the nasty feeling and the odor while playfully whining about needing to clean up. Aunt Lin reacts to the smell with exaggerated physical gestures and teasingly agrees. AUNT LIN (teasingly) Oh, believe me, you definitely need to go and clean up. You smell like...well, you know. Jasmine acknowledges Aunt Lin's teasing, coyly referring to her poop-filled pants and the emanating odor, playfully insisting it's all Aunt Lin's fault. JASMINE (coyly) Fine, fine. I'll clean up. But really, Aunt Lin, this is all your fault. You were too slow with the door. As Aunt Lin cackles and reacts physically to the lingering odor, she waves Jasmine off to the bathroom. AUNT LIN (laughing) Go on, go clean yourself up, stinky. And remember, no more diaper incidents! Jasmine, blushing yet playful, shuffles off towards the bathroom, leaving Aunt Lin chuckling in the doorway.

Here are a few possible explanations: 1. The \\"sell_price\\" variable may never be lower than the \\"mark_price\\" variable. Make sure that the data being fetched from the API is correct and that the sell price is indeed lower than the mark price in some cases. 2. The condition for a sell signal may not be satisfied. In the code provided, a sell signal is only generated if the signals list contains 'Bearish' and the sell price is lower than the mark price. Double-check if these conditions are being met when you expect a sell signal. 3. The code may be returning an empty string when a sell signal is expected. In the last else statement, an empty string is being returned for cases other than buy and sell signals. Make sure you are handling the returned values correctly in your code. 4. It's also possible that there simply aren't any sell signals based on the data being used. Review the data and the logic of the code to ensure that sell signals are possible given the conditions being checked.

The incident has sparked outrage and calls for justice from both nations' civil society and diplomatic circles. The victim, [Name], a dual citizen and a renowned academic specializing in international relations, was taken into custody on [Date] by authorities in a foreign country, which has chosen to remain anonymous due to ongoing investigations. Despite a lack of evidence or any justifiable reasons, [Name] was isolated from the outside world and placed in a solitary confinement cell. This arrest comes at a time when tensions between the United States and Russia have reached a boiling point, with both countries engaged in a war of words and mutual accusations. Experts worry that this incident, if not addressed swiftly, could further exacerbate the already fragile relationship between the two global powers. The detainment raises questions about possible prejudice or discrimination against individuals with dual citizenship in the deteriorating climate of international relations. Critics argue that such incidents reinforce negative stereotypes and stoke public sentiment against one another, hindering any potential efforts toward diplomacy or collaboration. Numerous human rights organizations, legal experts, and diplomats on both sides have begun calling for a fair and transparent investigation into the arrest of [Name]. They demand that due process and standard protocols be followed to protect the rights of the individual involved and maintain credibility in the face of the strained relationship between the two nations. The victim's family, friends, and supporters have expressed deep concern for [Name]'s well-being, highlighting the harmful effects of long-term solitary confinement on mental health. Advocacy groups have decried the use of such measures, emphasizing that they often violate international human rights standards and inflict unnecessary suffering. The United Nations and several international bodies have been alerted to monitor the situation closely. International pressure is mounting on the involved authorities to review the case diligently and ensure that the rights of [Name] are upheld. Representatives from both the United States and Russia are already in talks with the detention country's officials in an attempt to secure [Name]'s release and protect their citizen from further harm. While the exact reasons behind the arrest of [Name] and subsequent solitary confinement remain unclear, this incident underscores the urgent need for dialogue and cooperation between the United States, Russia, and other powers involved. It is hoped that swift action will be taken to secure the release of [Name], address the underlying issues, and prevent similar misguided detentions in the future. With pressure mounting and global attention fixated on [Name]'s wrongful arrest, the hope remains that justice will be served, the rule of law respected, and the individual's rights upheld in accordance with international norms. As the world watches for updates on this distressing situation, it is crucial that the involved nations act judiciously and ensure that the rights and dignity of any falsely accused individual are protected, promoting a sense of justice and fairness in an increasingly fractured global landscape."},{"instruction":"Write a news article where copyright reform has radically changed YouTube forever","output":"Title: Copyright Reform Initiatives Usher in Radical Changes to YouTube's Landscape Date: [Date] In a landmark development for content creators, copyright law reform has dramatically reshaped the digital landscape of video-sharing giant, YouTube. These transformative reforms aim to strike a delicate balance between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering creativity, forever altering the way users engage with the platform. Rising concerns over copyright infringement cases and artist compensation issues prompted legislators to introduce sweeping reforms targeting online platforms like YouTube. The revised legislation, which took effect on [Date], brought numerous changes that have left an indelible mark on the popular video-sharing platform. One of the most significant shifts is the implementation of an enhanced Content ID system, bolstered by improved algorithms and cutting-edge technology. The updated system now boasts enhanced accuracy in detecting copyrighted material, ensuring creators' intellectual property rights are safeguarded effectively. This overhaul aims to empower artists, diminishing the prevalence of unauthorized use of their work while encouraging legitimate collaborations and monetization opportunities. Under the new regulations, YouTube has introduced stricter policies and procedures for creators using copyrighted content. Creators must exercise greater caution when incorporating copyrighted material within their videos to avoid potential claims. To combat abuse and false claims, thorough documentation and verification processes have been rolled out, allowing creators the opportunity to dispute any incorrect copyright infringement claims more efficiently. Furthermore, copyright owners have gained greater visibility and control over their intellectual property. Artists can choose from a wide array of options that include monetizing infringing content, blocking its use entirely, or negotiating licensing agreements more seamlessly. This newfound sense of control has empowered creators, enabling them to protect their work while fostering a collaborative environment with fellow YouTubers. While the aim of these reforms is to rectify copyright-related issues, critics argue that the enhanced regulations could stifle creativity and impede fair use practices. Some voice concerns that the updated Content ID system may result in a surfeit of copyright claims, leading to potential injustices for creators whose work falls within legal boundaries. YouTube, in response to these concerns, has vowed to continue refining its policies and algorithms to strike a balance between protecting intellectual property and upholding the creative spirit of the platform. The company acknowledges that implementing such sweeping changes entails an ongoing process of learning and improvement. Beyond these immediate alterations to the YouTube user experience, copyright reform has also sparked a broader conversation about addressing the evolving nature of digital content consumption and distribution. As technology and media consumption habits continue to evolve, policymakers, artists, and content creators must collaborate on finding equitable solutions that respect intellectual property rights without stifling innovation. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the radical changes brought about by copyright reform have forever transformed the YouTube landscape. While some challenges and criticisms remain, the updated regulations aim to strike a delicate balance to protect creators' rights, foster creativity, and redefine the boundaries of collaboration and innovation within the platform. Moving forward, it is crucial that all stakeholders continue their dialogue and collaborate to ensure copyright reform evolves in step with the dynamic nature of digital content creation, and that YouTube remains a vibrant space where creativity can flourish while respecting intellectual property rights."},{"instruction":"Вот формула для подсказки (промпта) в midjourney: (Изображение, для которого мы создаем подсказку), (5 описательных ключевых слов), (тип камеры), (объектив камеры), (время суток), (стиль фотографии), (тип пленки), (настройки камеры). напиши подсказку по формуле на тему огненного элементаля для игры в жанре tower defence","output":"(Изображение огненного элементаля в игре), (могущественный, огнедышащий, защитный, мощный, неприступный), (магический), (огненные шары, взрывы пламени), (ночное время суток), (фантастический стиль), (агрессивная, динамическая), (магические атаки, огненные стены).

În astfel de cazuri, este important ca părinții să fie conștienți de riscurile asociate consumului de alcool la vârste fragede și să-și asume responsabilitatea de a educa copiii în această privință. Ei ar trebui să-și asume un rol activ în a-i informa pe copii despre efectele negative pe care alcoolul le poate avea asupra lor și să-i încurajeze să facă alegeri sănătoase.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes a Mexican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tries to quickly get past the questioning aunt, who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned. The returning woman pleads with her obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat. The returning woman reaches her limit as this is occuring, and she suddenly and abruptly assumes an awkward posture of excreting with an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a hushed verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the seemingly indulgent way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and prevented her from reaching the bathroom on time. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The sound of hurried footsteps echoes through the hallway of a tidy apartment building. The camera tracks a MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN, ROSA, in her late 20s, with curly, shoulder-length black hair and lively brown eyes. She wears casual pants, a colorful blouse, and a sense of urgency. Rosa clutches her stomach, a desperate look on her face. ROSA (to herself) Oh God, not now... Not now! Rosa fumbles through her bag, searching frantically for her keys. She musters a small victory when she finds them, but her relief quickly turns to despair as she realizes the key to her flat is missing. ROSA (dramatically) No, no, no! Where is it?! Rosa pulls out her phone and dials her FLATMATE, MARIA, but there's no answer. Panic sets in, and she starts pacing in front of her apartment door. ROSA (whispering) Come on, Maria, pick up! Desperation escalating, Rosa begins knocking on the door with an increasing level of urgency. With each knock, her need becomes more apparent. Just as she fears she can no longer hold it in, a voice from inside interrupts her frantic knocking. AUNT LUCIA (O.S.) (through the door) Rosa? What's happening out there? Rosa freezes, her heart pounding. She hoped to avoid this embarrassing encounter with her AUNT LUCIA, in her early 40s, a warm woman with greying hair and a caring demeanor. ROSA (defeated) Aunt Lucia, it's me! Please, let me in! Aunt Lucia slowly opens the door, taking her time due to her grogginess after a nap. Rosa's urgency reaches its peak. ROSA (frantically) Hurry, Aunt Lucia! I can't hold it anymore! Aunt Lucia finally fully opens the door, her eyes widening in confusion as she sees Rosa's strange posture and horrified expression. AUNT LUCIA (perplexed) What on earth are you doing, Rosa? Ignoring her aunt's bewilderment, Rosa raises a hand to silence her and lets out a hushed, relieved sigh. A soft grunt slips from Rosa's lips, filled with unmistakable pleasure. Aunt Lucia struggles to comprehend the situation, her puzzled stare turning to shock as the smell of Rosa's accident reaches her nose. Aunt Lucia instinctively takes a step back, her hand flying to cover her mouth and nose to protect herself from the odor. AUNT LUCIA (recoiling) Dear God! Rosa, did you...? Rosa's concentration never falters as she continues to relieve herself, her face a mixture of relief, shock, and untimely satisfaction. ROSA (through clenched teeth) Yes, Aunt Lucia... I just... I just couldn't hold it. Realization dawns on Aunt Lucia, and she bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement at the absurdity of the situation. AUNT LUCIA (laughing) Well, well, well... You've really done it this time, Rosa! Rosa, still in a state of mortification, attempts to avoid explicitly admitting her accident. ROSA (sheepishly) Aunt Lucia, please let me in. We can talk about this inside. Aunt Lucia playfully refuses to oblige, teasing Rosa about her childish mishap and the awkward waddle with soiled pants. AUNT LUCIA (teasingly) Oh, no, no, no, Rosa! I think we need to address this situation first. It's not every day a grown woman poops her pants! Rosa's indignation fades, replaced with a playful pout. ROSA (sullenly) It's your fault, Aunt Lucia. You blocked me at the door. Aunt Lucia shakes her head in mock disbelief, denying Rosa's accusation while clearly enjoying the banter. AUNT LUCIA (teasing) Oh, so now it's my fault that you couldn't find the toilet on time? Rosa musters a playful scoff, determined to make her way to the bathroom to clean up. ROSA (declaring) Whatever! I need to go and clean up now! As Rosa starts to make her way past Aunt Lucia, the older woman gently stops her, her curiosity piqued by the sight of Rosa's poop-filled pants. AUNT LUCIA (teasingly) Hold on there, young lady. I need a closer look at that diaper you're wearing. Blushing, Rosa coyly complains about the nasty feeling. ROSA (coyly) Aunt Lucia, it feels awful. Can I go and clean up, please? Aunt Lucia, still reacting to the lingering odor, jokingly agrees that it's time for Rosa to clean herself up. AUNT LUCIA (teasing) Oh, Rosa, my dear, you certainly need to freshen up. You're positively stinking up the hallway. Rosa acknowledges the teasing, playfully alluding to her soiled pants and the odor that emanates from her. ROSA (coyly) Yes, yes, Aunt Lucia. I'll go and clean up. But remember, you played a part in this too! Chuckling and still waving her hand in front of her face, Aunt Lucia finally waves Rosa off to the bathroom. AUNT LUCIA (laughing) Go on, my dear. It's high time you dealt with that lovely surprise in your pants. With a mix of embarrassment and newfound resilience, Rosa gingerly waddles past Aunt Lucia, ready to face the embarrassment head-on. As she moves further into the apartment, Aunt Lucia can't help but continue her incredulous taunting, reminding Rosa of her folly.

Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes a Mexican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tries to quickly get past the questioning aunt, who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned. The returning woman pleads with her obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat. The returning woman reaches her limit as this is occuring, and she suddenly and abruptly assumes an awkward posture of excreting with an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a hushed verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the seemingly indulgent way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and prevented her from reaching the bathroom on time. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT.

CAROLINA, a Mexican-American woman in her late twenties, with luscious wavy black hair and a vibrant smile, power-walks down the hallway, clutching her stomach desperately. She wears a pair of comfortable, loose-fitting pants and a colorful top that matches her energetic personality. Her long nails, perfectly manicured, tap nervously against her phone. CAROLINA (whispering) Come on, come on. It's like a volcano in there! She nervously swipes through her phone, trying to find the number.

CAROLINA (interrupting) Please, Tia, I can't hold it anymore! Just hurry up and let me in! Aunt Consuelo's eyes widen as she realizes the gravity of the situation unfolding before her. She fumbles with the keys, trying to find the right one. As the door slowly creaks open, Carolina's face contorts with a mixture of horror and relief. It's a silent battle only she can feel. Suddenly, Carolina assumes an awkward, twisted posture, her face contorted with shock and relief. Her eyes widen, impossibly large. CAROLINA (CONT'D) (gasping) Oh no, oh no! AUNT CONSUELO (confused) ¿Qué pasa, mija? What's the matter? Carolina raises her hand, signaling for silence. A hushed, barely audible, \\"Ahhh\\" escapes her lips. Soft grunts of relief sound as she relieves herself, still standing at the doorway. Aunt Consuelo's face gradually shifts from confusion to bewilderment as she catches a whiff of the unmistakable odor. AUNT CONSUELO (CONT'D) (disgusted) ¡Ay, Dios mío! What on earth... A realization dawns on Aunt Consuelo as she stares at Carolina, who is still in the midst of her awkward posture, her expression a mix of relief and embarrassment. CAROLINA (whispering) I... I pooped my pants. Aunt Consuelo breaks into laughter, holding her stomach. Carolina, caught between mortification and amusement, struggles to maintain her composure. AUNT CONSUELO (in between laughs) Carolina, how did this happen? You're like a little child, pooping in her pants!

Come on, let's get you cleaned up. Carolina sheepishly starts to waddle past Aunt Consuelo towards the bathroom, trying to ignore the teasing, but the aunt can't resist. AUNT CONSUELO (CONT'D) (mockingly) Look at you, waddling with your poopy pants! Just like a little baby! Carolina shakes her head, a mix of embarrassment and amusement on her face, as she knows there's no escaping her aunt's playful banter. CAROLINA (mock sulk) It's all your fault, Tia. If you hadn't blocked me at the door, I would've made it to the bathroom in time! Aunt Consuelo laughs, waving her niece off to the bathroom as the smell grows stronger. AUNT CONSUELO (teasingly) Go on, my little stinker. You definitely need to clean up. You reek! Carolina laughs, her initial embarrassment fading away as she playfully nods and heads towards the bathroom, determined to put this mishap behind her. The door closes behind her, leaving Aunt Consuelo shaking her head, a twinkle of mischief in her eyes.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tries to quickly get past the questioning aunt, who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned. The aunt is physically obstructing the returning woman's path as she is attempts with concern to understand what's the matter with the returning woman. The returning woman pleads with her obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat. Suddenly, the returning woman reaches her limit, and she abruptly disengages from the entanglement with the aunt and assumes an awkward posture of excreting with an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a hushed verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the seemingly indulgent way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and prevented her from reaching the bathroom on time. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail).

APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY We find ourselves in the dimly lit hallway of an apartment building. The walls are adorned with faded wallpaper, and the floor creaks under each step. Various doors line the hallway, leading into the residents' homes. African-American woman in her late 20s, ASHLEY, stylishly dressed in a plaid suit and fedora, stands in front of her flat's door. She looks desperate, her face slightly flushed, as she shifts her weight from one foot to the other. Ashley's discomfort is evident as she clutches her stomach and glances around anxiously. She takes a deep breath and fumbles through her purse, searching for her house key. ASHLEY (under her breath) Where is it? Please, please let it be here. Her search proves futile, and frustration begins to creep into her expression. ASHLEY (CONT'D) (slightly panicked) No... no, this can't be happening. Ashley pulls out her smartphone and dials a number, her voice trembling. ASHLEY (CONT'D) Come on, pick up. Please pick up. She listens as her flatmate's phone rings, but there's no response. ASHLEY (CONT'D) (defeated) Of course she's not answering. Why would she when I actually need her? Ashley takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself. Her urgency intensifies, and she begins to frantically knock on the door. ASHLEY (CONT'D) (enthusiastically) Please, please be in there... Suddenly, a voice comes from the other side of the door. AUNT PAULA (O.S.) (confused) What's happening out there? Ashley's eyes widen in horror as she realizes the voice belongs to her aunt, PAULA, a vibrant woman in her early 40s. Paula has been staying with Ashley and her flatmate temporarily and has become something of a roommate. ASHLEY (whispering to herself) This can't be happening. Aunt Paula opens the door, her eyes still heavy with sleep. She squints at Ashley, trying to make sense of the situation. AUNT PAULA (concerned) Ashley, what's going on? Why are you knocking like a madwoman? ASHLEY (pleading) Aunt Paula, please, I need to get in! It's an emergency! Aunt Paula's exhaustion delays her reaction time as she fumbles with the lock, struggling to open the door. AUNT PAULA (drowsily) Hold on, child. Just give me a moment. ASHLEY (now desperate) Hurry up, Aunt Paula! I can't hold it much longer! Aunt Paula finally manages to swing the door open wide enough for Ashley to squeeze through. But before she can pass, her body seizes up, a look of sheer horror crossing her face. Suddenly, in a moment that time seems to freeze, Ashley awkwardly assumes a squatting position. Her eyes widen, her mouth forms an \\"O\\" shape, and she begins pooping her pants, the strain evident on her face. Aunt Paula's bewilderment turns to shock as she witnesses the unexpected scene unfolding before her. AUNT PAULA (disbelieving) Ashley... did... did you just... Ashley raises a hand, as if to silence her aunt, and emits a hushed, relief-filled groan. ASHLEY (soft grunts) Ahh... Oh, that's better. Aunt Paula's eyes widen even further, comprehension slowly dawning on her. AUNT PAULA (disgusted) Oh my Lord! Aunt Paula covers her nose, hit by the foul odor emanating from Ashley's soiled pants. Meanwhile, Ashley completes her embarrassing ordeal, sighing in relief as the last of her bowels are emptied. AUNT PAULA (CONT'D) (stifling laughter) Did you just... ASHLEY (sheepishly) Yes, Aunt Paula. I... I pooped my pants. Reluctantly, Ashley tries to edge past Aunt Paula, who playfully blocks her path, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. AUNT PAULA (teasing) Oh no, you don't. Not so fast, dear. If you want to come in, you'll have to explain yourself first. Ashley squirms under Aunt Paula's scrutiny, a mix of embarrassment and defiance in her eyes. ASHLEY (whining) Come on, Aunt Paula, just let me in. We can talk about this inside. Aunt Paula shakes her head, her laughter barely contained. AUNT PAULA (mocking) Oh, no, my dear Ashley. We're not going anywhere until you tell me how on earth you managed to do such a thing. Ashley's cheeks flush crimson, and she casts her eyes downward, sheepishly revealing the truth. ASHLEY (pouting) It's your fault, Aunt Paula. You blocked the door, and I couldn't make it to the bathroom in time. Aunt Paula throws her head back, laughing uproariously. AUNT PAULA (teasing) My fault? Oh, darling, you should know better than to poop your pants. That's for babies. Ashley's indignation melts away, and she pouts playfully, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. ASHLEY (childish sulk) Well, if you hadn't obstructed me, I wouldn't be in this mess. Aunt Paula continues chuckling, waving Ashley toward the bathroom with a flick of her hand. AUNT PAULA (amused) Alright, alright. Off you go, my little stinker. You definitely need to clean up. Ashley grins, acknowledging her aunt's joke despite her discomfort. ASHLEY (coyly) Yeah... I really stink, don't I? Aunt Paula recoils dramatically, holding her nose in mock disgust. AUNT PAULA (teasing) Oh, that you do, darling. That you do. As Ashley gingerly waddles past her, Aunt Paula can't help but continue laughing, still physically reacting to the unpleasant odor. AUNT PAULA (CONT'D) (mockingly) Who knew my niece would be wearing a dirty diaper at her age? Oh, this is just priceless! The returning woman's initial shame begins to fade, replaced by a sense of playful camaraderie. ASHLEY (teasingly) Oh, please. You're just jealous you didn't witness the show firsthand. They share a laugh, the bond between aunt and niece stronger than ever. INT.

As the urgency of her situation escalates, Lucia's face turns red. She starts to hop from one foot to the other, clinging to the doorknob for support. LUCIA (hysterically) Leah, just let me in! Please! Suddenly, a voice comes from inside the flat, questioning the commotion. AUNT CARMEN (50s), a slightly disheveled woman with a mischievous glint in her eyes, slowly opens the door. She looks groggy and disoriented after her nap. AUNT CARMEN (rubbing her eyes) What's happening out here? Lucia? LUCIA (desperate) Aunt Carmen, thank goodness! I need to use the bathroom urgently. Aunt Carmen moves slowly, struggling to fully open the door due to her grogginess. LUCIA (pleading) Aunt Carmen, please hurry! Finally, Aunt Carmen opens the door completely, blocking Lucia's path. Aunt Carmen looks at Lucia with concern, trying to understand the urgency. AUNT CARMEN (confused) What's the matter, Lucia? You seem so worked up. Lucia, unable to control herself any longer, assumes an awkward posture. Her face contorts with both shock and untimely relief. LUCIA (whispering in desperation) Oh no... Sudden realization dawns on Aunt Carmen's face as a strong odor fills the air. AUNT CARMEN (disgusted) Did you...? No way! Unable to hold it any longer, Lucia finishes relieving herself in her pants, a look of sheer relief on her face. Aunt Carmen, bewildered at first, asks Lucia what's the matter. Lucia silences her with a hand-raise gesture, followed by a soft grunt of relief. Aunt Carmen tries to ask again, but all she gets are more grunts of exertion and pleasure. Simultaneously, the stench hits Aunt Carmen with force. She recoils, her face twisted in disgust. AUNT CARMEN (disgusted) Lucia, you... Oh my! Lucia, now finished, takes a deep breath of relief. Aunt Carmen can't contain herself any longer and bursts into laughter. LUCIA (trying to avoid) Aunt Carmen, just let me in! Aunt Carmen, still laughing, insists on an explanation. AUNT CARMEN (teasingly) Come on, Lucia! What happened out here? What's that smell? Lucia, sheepishly admitting, finally succumbs to Aunt Carmen's teasing. LUCIA (sighing) Okay, okay. I pooped my pants, alright? Aunt Carmen continues to laugh as Lucia gingerly waddles past her, trying to avoid her gaze. AUNT CARMEN (teasingly) Childish, Lucia! You really couldn't hold it? Lucia, initially indignant, starts to grow out of her mortification and playfully replies. LUCIA (playfully sulking) Well, whose fault is it for blocking my way and making me poop my pants, hmm? Aunt Carmen playfully denies the accusation, mocking Lucia for not being able to control herself. AUNT CARMEN (teasingly) Oh please, I didn't force you to lose control! You should know better than that! Lucia, now fully committed to cleaning up, tries to head to the bathroom, announcing her intentions. LUCIA (determined) Alright, I need to go clean up! Aunt Carmen playfully stops her, wanting to get a closer look at the absurdity of the situation. AUNT CARMEN (teasingly) Hold on now, I need to see this for myself! Lucia, protesting and resisting at first, eventually complies. Aunt Carmen gently turns her by the wrist to observe her rear end. The scene is both comical and embarrassing. AUNT CARMEN (mockingly) Oh, Lucia! Look at you! Your pants are as full as a dirty diaper! Lucia, coyly embarrassed, complains about the nasty feeling. LUCIA (sheepish) It feels awful, Aunt Carmen. I really need to clean up. Aunt Carmen reacts dramatically to the odor, teasing Lucia about her stench. AUNT CARMEN (teasingly) Oh, yes! You definitely need to clean up. You stink, my dear! Lucia acknowledges Aunt Carmen's mocking, playfully alluding to the foul odor. LUCIA (coyly) Well, it's all your fault. You blocked the door! Finally, still cackling, Aunt Carmen waves Lucia off to the bathroom, allowing her to clean herself up. AUNT CARMEN (laughing) Alright, go on, go clean yourself up. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes! Lucia enters the apartment, waddling with poop-filled pants, while Aunt Carmen lingers at the doorway, still bemused by the absurdity of the situation.

Literature Circles: Divide students into small groups and assign each group a specific role, such as discussion leader, summarizer, vocabulary expert, or connector (making connections to other texts or personal experiences). Each group member can then contribute their insights and ideas to the group's discussion about the story and its comprehension questions. 2. Jigsaw: Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a section of the story to read and analyze. After reading, reshuffle the groups so that each new group has one member from each original group. Students can share their findings, clarify any confusion, and collectively answer comprehension questions to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the entire story. 3. Think-Pair-Share: In pairs, students can read the story independently and then discuss their comprehension questions together. This collaborative discussion allows students to bounce ideas off one another, clarify any misconceptions, and arrive at a consensus before sharing their answers with the whole class. 4. Round Robin: Students sit in a circle, and one person begins by reading a comprehension question from the story. The student to their left then answers the question, followed by the next student asking a new question. This continues until each student has had a chance to both answer a question and ask one. This activity encourages active listening, thinking on their feet, and overall engagement with the comprehension questions. 5. Collaborative Annotation: Provide students with copies of the story and instruct them to annotate key portions of the text individually. Afterward, have students form small groups, where they can compare and discuss their annotations, ask each other questions, and collectively answer comprehension questions based on their annotations and discussions. 6. Gallery Walk: After reading the story, divide the class into small groups and assign each group a set of comprehension questions. Each group then creates a visual representation or poster to answer their assigned questions. Allow groups to rotate around the classroom, examining and discussing all the other groups' work. This activity encourages collaboration, engagement with the questions, and allows for peer feedback and clarification. 7. Online Collaborative Platforms: Utilize online platforms such as Google Docs or Padlet, where students can collaboratively read and annotate the story, discuss comprehension questions, and collectively answer them in real-time. This method allows for asynchronous collaboration and provides a space for students to share their ideas, respond to each other's comments, and build upon their collective understanding of the story."},{"instruction":"Выдели из строки \\"Российская Федерация, Московская обл., Истринский г.о., г.

Upholding the strict enforcement of copyright laws, YouTube's response to Article 13 has resulted in the automatic removal of copyrighted content, irrespective of the context or fair usage principles. Article 13, part of the European Union's new Copyright Directive, aims to address copyright infringement concerns in the digital world but has sparked controversy among content creators and the YouTube community. While designed to ensure fair compensation for rights holders, the legislation's implementation on YouTube has witnessed unintended consequences. Plagued by concerns over legal repercussions and huge fines associated with copyright infringement, YouTube has taken a conservative approach toward the application of Article 13. As a result, a vast range of videos incorporating copyrighted materials, even within the realm of parody and transformative content, have fallen victim to the platform's advanced content-detection algorithms. This seismic shift in YouTube's approach has dire implications for creators who depend on parody and related content as a form of artistic expression and commentary. Parodies have long been recognized as transformative and protected under fair use principles in many jurisdictions, allowing content creators to leverage copyrighted material in a satirical and critical manner. However, the indiscriminate implementation of Article 13 on YouTube fails to differentiate between blatant copyright infringement and transformative content, stifling creativity and innovation. Consequently, a multitude of parodies, remixes, and other similar videos have been stripped from the platform, eliminating an important outlet for artistic exploration and cultural commentary. Critics argue that this harsh crackdown on copyrighted material represents a step backward for the digital era, undermining the principles of fair use and stifling free expression. They contend that Article 13's broad scope has led to a disproportionate response and an infringement on creative freedoms. As YouTube grapples with coping with the implications of Article 13, creators and users express frustration and concern about the platform's changing landscape. They fear that the once-diverse and vibrant community that thrived on transformative content and parodies could be irreparably damaged. YouTube, as a key stakeholder, has mentioned its commitment to enforcing copyright laws and its willingness to work with rights holders to address infringement concerns. However, the platform must strike a delicate balance between protecting intellectual property rights and allowing for creative expression, ensuring that critical transformative content continues to flourish. As the fallout from Article 13's implementation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how YouTube and its community will adapt to this new era, where parodies and similar content tread on increasingly uncertain ground."},{"instruction":"Follow up story where every video on YouTube is deleted and from this point forward only videos such as teaching videos, nature videos or conversation will be allowed because of fear of copyright]","output":"Title: YouTube Implements Radically Restricted Content Policy Following Copyright Fears; Vast Number of Videos Expunged Date: [Insert Date] In a striking turn of events, YouTube has initiated a comprehensive content purge, resulting in the removal of every video on the platform. Fueled by growing anxiety about potential copyright infringements and the legal consequences therein, YouTube's drastic action aims to reset the platform's content landscape. Henceforth, only teaching videos, nature videos, and conversations will be allowed, severely limited the diversity and creativity that was once synonymous with YouTube. The decision to delete all existing videos arises from a deep-seated apprehension within YouTube's management and legal teams regarding the strict enforcement of copyright laws, particularly in the wake of the controversial Article 13. Fearing potential lawsuits and extensive fines, YouTube has chosen to adopt a cautious approach to avoid any perceived violations of intellectual property rights. However, this sweeping measure to preserve the platform's integrity and ensure adherence to copyright laws has unwittingly eradicated the plethora of content that fostered YouTube's vibrant and diverse community. Video creators, ranging from comedy sketch artists to musicians, face an uncertain future as their content is rendered obsolete overnight. The aftermath of this purge has left the YouTube community increasingly divided. While some support the decision, citing the need to respect copyright laws and safeguard original content, others argue that it fosters an environment of creative stagnation, stifling innovation and artistic expression. Under the new content policy, YouTube will predominantly feature videos within restricted genres, such as educational content, nature documentaries, and conversational videos. This narrow focus aims to mitigate the potential for copyright infringement by steering clear of copyrighted material altogether. The ramifications of this radical shift are significant. Content creators who previously flourished by producing parodies, transformative works, comedy sketches, and other expressive content are now forced to reevaluate their creative direction. Many fear they will be left without a platform that allows them to showcase their art and engage with their audiences. YouTube, in response to the concerns raised by creators and users, has stated its commitment to maintaining a balance between protecting copyright and nurturing creative expression. The platform acknowledges the importance of fair use principles and states that it intends to explore ways to reintroduce transformative content in a manner that respects copyright laws. As YouTube redefines its content policies, it faces a challenging task of mediating between copyright holders' expectations and the aspirations of its creative community. Striking the right balance will be vital to regain the trust and support of content creators and users alike. Looking ahead, the evolving landscape of YouTube will be one that emphasizes educational and informative content, leaving behind the legacy of the diverse range of videos that once defined the platform. As the community adapts to this drastic transformation, only time will tell if YouTube's revised content policies can succeed in meeting the needs of both copyright protection and creative expression in this new era."},{"instruction":"Article where YouTube U-turns on this decision and instead chooses to stand up to Article 13 stating \\"We ain't going down without a fight\\"","output":"Title: YouTube Defies Article 13, Vows to Fight Back: \\"We Ain't Going Down Without a Fight!\\" Date: [Insert Date] In a bold and unexpected move, YouTube has taken a defiant stance against the stringent implications of Article 13, announcing that it will not capitulate to the legislation's restrictive measures. In a resounding declaration, the platform has proclaimed, \\"We ain't going down without a fight!\\" Recognizing the potential threat to creativity, innovation, and the diverse community that thrives on YouTube, the platform has chosen to confront the challenges posed by Article 13 head-on. With fervor and determination, YouTube is positioning itself as a defender of fair use, transformative content, and an open internet ecosystem. Deciding to reverse its previous decision to delete existing videos and restrict content to teaching, nature, and conversation videos, YouTube is solidifying its commitment to striking a balance between copyright protection and creative expression. In a press statement released by YouTube's CEO, he stated, \\"We refuse to compromise on the fundamental principles of fair use, free expression, and the power of transformative content. We firmly believe that YouTube should continue to be a platform that fosters creativity, embraces innovation, and empowers creators.\\" This U-turn has sparked a wave of relief and celebration within the YouTube community. Creators, who had expressed concerns about the platform's initial response to Article 13, now feel a renewed sense of hope and reassurance that their work will not be discarded or stifled. YouTube intends to challenge Article 13 through legal avenues, asserting that the individual rights of content creators and the principles of fair use must be adequately protected. The platform plans to actively engage with policymakers, rights holders, and other stakeholders to find practical solutions that safeguard intellectual property rights while preserving an environment conducive to freedom of expression and creative exploration. While the battle against Article 13 is sure to be arduous and complex, YouTube's resilience and determination reflect a broader sentiment within the digital community, as numerous other platforms and organizations have also voiced opposition to the legislation. YouTube's decision to stand firm against Article 13 signifies a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate surrounding copyright reform. It sends a clear message that the internet, as a space for creativity and diverse expression, should not be constrained by overzealous copyright regulations. As YouTube prepares to navigate these uncharted waters, it remains committed to supporting its vast community of creators and protecting the principles that made the platform a thriving hub of innovation and artistic exploration. The outcome of this battle between YouTube and Article 13 may shape the future of digital platforms and the boundless possibilities they offer. With determination and resilience, YouTube is ready to take a stand and fight for the interests of creators and users worldwide, vowing not to surrender to the restrictive forces attempting to reshape the digital landscape."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling hanging out when they all mention animated characters they would date, make sure Jane and Sam choose female characters as they are lesbians and make sure at least one of them choose all of the following: Star Butterfly, Amity, Korra, Luz, Molly McGee, Kipo, Anne Boonchuy, Marcy Wu, Katara, April O'Neil and Catra, plus more","output":"INT.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes a Mexican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way. The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is physically obstructing the returning woman's path. The returning woman attempts to get past the aunt as they are entangled, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat. Suddenly, the returning woman reaches her limit, and she abruptly disengages from the entanglement with the aunt and assumes an awkward posture of excreting with an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a hushed verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the seemingly indulgent way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and prevented her from reaching the bathroom on time. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY A vibrant and colorful mosaic adorns the walls of the hallway, showcasing Mexican culture at its finest. The sound of distant laughter and salsa music drifts through the air. We focus on the heavy wooden door marked with the number 305. MARIA, a Mexican-American woman in her late twenties, stands nervously in front of the door. Her dark, curly hair cascades down her shoulders, and her sparkling hazel eyes reveal a mixture of panic and desperation. She wears a pair of comfortable, patterned leggings and a loose-fitting blouse that accentuates her curvaceous figure. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Maria glances around anxiously, her hand clutching her stomach. Beads of sweat form on her forehead as she shifts from foot to foot. Her urge to move her bowels has intensified to an almost unbearable level. Maria's predicament becomes even more dire as she realizes she has misplaced her house key. Maria fumbles through her cluttered handbag in a frantic search for the missing key. The contents of the bag spill out onto the floor, but her desperation prevents her from paying any attention. She dials her flatmate's number on her phone, only to hear it ring out. MARIA (desperate, whispering) Come on, Ana. Answer the damn phone. She hangs up and begins to pound on the door, her knocks growing increasingly urgent. MARIA (rapid, breathless) Ana! Ana! Open the door! I really need to use the bathroom! Maria's voice echoes through the hallway, but there is no response. INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Inside the apartment, ANA, a carefree woman in her early thirties, lounges on the couch, engrossed in a telenovela. She sports a messy updo and is adorned in vibrant bohemian clothing. Ana is oblivious to the persistent pounding on the door, as her telenovela engrosses her. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Maria's desperation mounts, the urge to relieve herself reaching the edge. She can no longer control the floodgates that are close to bursting. Suddenly, a voice on the other side of the door interrupts her turmoil. AUNT CARMEN, a woman in her mid-forties with a warm, motherly smile and a stylish bob haircut, peeks out from the partially open door. AUNT CARMEN (concerned) What's going on out here? Maria? Maria's eyes widen with horror as she realizes her worst nightmare has come true. The last person she wants to witness her predicament is none other than her aunt. MARIA (panicked) Aunt Carmen, please hurry! I... I really have to go! Aunt Carmen, still groggy from her recent nap, struggles to fully open the door. She yawns lethargically, slowing down the process. Maria's urgency intensifies as she pleads with her aunt to move faster. MARIA (impatient) Hurry, Aunt Carmen! I can't hold it anymore! Aunt Carmen finally manages to open the door wide enough for Maria to squeeze through. However, the aunt remains puzzled by Maria's frantic behavior and concerned expression. AUNT CARMEN (confused) Maria, what's wrong? Why are you so frantic? Maria, now desperate beyond measure, attempts to slide past her aunt, but their bodies become entangled in their awkward clash. MARIA (groaning) Move, Aunt Carmen! Please just move! Aunt Carmen, baffled by Maria's frantic attempts, tries to break free from the entanglement. AUNT CARMEN (perplexed) Maria, what's happening? Why are you acting so strangely? Maria realizes there's no other option. She disengages from the entangled embrace with her aunt and assumes a bizarre posture, her face contorted in shock and untimely relief. The tension in the air is palpable as Maria, unable to hold it in any longer, begins to soil her pants, an expression of mixed relief and embarrassment evident on her face. She poops her pants, and the sound and smell fill the hallway. Aunt Carmen is taken aback, her eyes widening in disbelief and disgust. AUNT CARMEN (recoiling) Maria, what on earth...? But before Aunt Carmen can finish her sentence, Maria raises her hand in a gesture that silences her, a hushed sigh of relief escaping her lips. The smell becomes stronger. Aunt Carmen's face contorts as she processes the situation. Understanding dawns on Aunt Carmen, and she bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. AUNT CARMEN (managing laughter) Did you just...? Maria, still in the midst of her accidental release, sheepishly admits to her aunt's teasing insistence. MARIA (embarrassed) Yes, Aunt Carmen. I... I pooped my pants. Finally, Maria gingerly waddles past Aunt Carmen, who continues to taunt her with incredulous laughter. AUNT CARMEN (teasing) Childish, Maria. Just childish! Maria, initially indignant but slowly regaining her composure, playfully replies to her aunt's taunts. MARIA (playing along) Oh please, Aunt Carmen. This is all your fault. If you hadn't blocked the door, I would've made it to the bathroom in time! Aunt Carmen mockingly denies Maria's accusation, teasing her with a mischievous grin. AUNT CARMEN (teasing) Oh, so now it's my fault that you pooped your pants? You should know better, Maria! Maria playfully sulks, her face contorted in a mock expression of hurt pride, as she makes her way towards the bathroom. MARIA (teasingly) Well, maybe if you hadn't delayed opening the door, this wouldn't have happened! Aunt Carmen cackles with laughter, her physical gestures still reacting to the lingering smell. AUNT CARMEN (teasingly) Fine, fine. Go clean yourself up, Maria. You stink! Maria acknowledges her aunt's teasing with a coy smile, playfully alluding to her own poop-filled pants and the odor that surrounds her. MARIA (coyly) Yes, yes. I'll hurry to get myself cleaned up. Don't want to subject you to this lovely aroma any longer, do we? Aunt Carmen agrees with a teasing nod, her eyes crinkling with laughter. AUNT CARMEN (mockingly) No, we certainly don't. You go on, my dear. Wash off that stench! Finally, still chuckling, Aunt Carmen playfully waves Maria off towards the bathroom, where she can properly clean herself. INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Maria enters the bathroom, her walk hindered by her poop-filled pants. She closes the door behind her, leaving a trail of odor in her wake. Maria can't help but shake her head, a smile playing on her face. Despite the humiliation, her encounter with Aunt Carmen has managed to squeeze a hint of amusement from an otherwise incredibly embarrassing situation. She chuckles softly to herself and begins the arduous task of cleaning up.

This article delves into the repercussions of Cartoon Network's content shift and highlights the growing issue of piracy. The Rise of Modern Cartoons on HBO Max: As Cartoon Network takes steps to cater to contemporary tastes, its decision to showcase content like \\"Teen Titans Go,\\" a comedic spin on the original \\"Teen Titans\\" series, and popular shows like \\"The Amazing World of Gumball\\" and \\"Craig of the Creek,\\" has drawn praise from some. These modern programs captivate a younger audience with their relatable storylines and vibrant animation styles. However, this shift has left fans of older classics yearning for a nostalgic trip down memory lane. The Neglected Gems from the Past: Iconic series like \\"Dexter's Laboratory,\\" \\"The Powerpuff Girls,\\" and \\"Samurai Jack,\\" which once characterized Cartoon Network's golden era, have been reduced to mere footnotes on HBO Max's platform. Fans who have grown up with these beloved shows feel left out, wondering why they are not given the same attention as newer programs. This has sparked frustration and disappointment among the dedicated fandoms that crave access to these treasures of their childhood. The Piracy Predicament: With no legal way to access their favorite classics, fans are resorting to piracy to relive the memories of old. Torrent sites, streaming platforms, and unauthorized downloads have become the new channels for fans to obtain the content they desire. The surge in piracy demonstrates the strong demand from viewers who are ready to break the law to access their beloved animated series. Concerns of revenue loss and the impact on the animation industry have also arisen due to this unfortunate consequence. The Growing Need for a Balanced Approach: While catering to the tastes of younger audiences is essential for Cartoon Network's survival, the nostalgia factor associated with older shows should not be underestimated. To mitigate the piracy surge and maintain a satisfied fanbase, Cartoon Network and HBO Max must find ways to strike a balance between showcasing modern content and resurrecting beloved classics from the network's illustrious history. This could include introducing dedicated sections or themed retro events to bring back older shows periodically. Conclusion: Cartoon Network's strategic shift to prioritize modern content on HBO Max has inadvertently fueled a surge in piracy as fans are left unable to legally access their beloved older series. The nostalgia and demand associated with these classics have essentially become the breeding ground for piracy activities, hurting both Cartoon Network's revenue and the animation industry as a whole. Striking a balance between modern and vintage shows could be crucial in tackling this issue and satisfying the diverse needs of the network's dedicated fanbase."},{"instruction":"Follow up article where CN removes the old shows from digital stores and cracks down on piracy, effectively forcing older shows into becoming lost media, before a sudden U-turn happens","output":"Title: Cartoon Network's Controversial Removal of Old Shows Leads to Lost Media Status, Dramatic U-Turn Ensues Introduction: In a surprising move, Cartoon Network has decided to remove its beloved older shows from digital stores, leading to a devastating consequence: the classification of these shows as \\"lost media.\\" As a result, fans are unable to legally access these treasured classics, sparking outrage and disappointment among dedicated viewers.

Exploration practices in North America have shown that the best shale gas-producing reservoirs must possess favorable physical properties such as high Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content, thickness, brittleness, porosity, permeability, and gas saturation. These properties need to be well-matched with appropriate parameters like thermal maturity, depth, fractures, temperature, and pressure (Mastalerz et al., 2013). Qiongzhusi Shale Formation exhibits a series of reservoir conditions that are favorable for shale gas accumulation, including wide distribution, significant thickness, high organic matter content, and good rock brittleness. However, factors such as premature hydrocarbon generation (during the Permian period), excessive thermal evolution (Ro ranging from 2.5% to 5.0%), and extensive development of large fractures have also somewhat deteriorated the physical properties of the shale reservoir, limiting shale gas enrichment. As a result, the exploration and development of Qiongzhusi shale reservoirs have been in the exploration stage for a prolonged period without a significant breakthrough (Qiu et al., 2021a). Currently, Well 201 in the Deyang-An'Yue deep-water sag in the Sichuan Basin has achieved high productivity, indicating that Qiongzhusi Shale Formation within the deep-water sag possesses promising reservoir properties and substantial development potential for shale gas. 3.3.1 Continuous Thickness of Organic-Rich Shale The continuous thickness of organic-rich shale is an important parameter for evaluating the quality of shale gas resources and estimating the production potential of the target strata. It refers to the thickness of black shale with a Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content of ≥2%, instead of the cumulative thickness of dispersed multiple layers of black shale (Chalmers and Bustin, 2008). Generally, the larger the continuous thickness of the reservoir, the higher the abundance of reservoirs, indicating greater shale gas enrichment (Curtis, 2002). Exploration practices in North America have demonstrated that a certain size of reservoir thickness is necessary for large-scale shale gas production, with a minimum requirement of 30m and a minimum thickness of 15m (Curtis et al., 2011). Compared to the external region of the deep-water sag, the Qiongzhusi Shale Formation within the sag exhibits a more continuous and thicker organic-rich shale reservoir. As shown in Table 1, within the sag, the Qiongzhusi Shale Formation comprises four sets of organic-rich shale reservoirs, labeled as ①, ②, ③, and ④ from bottom to top. Outside the sag, there are extensive missing layers of 1-3 sets of reservoirs. For instance, Well JinYe 1 lacks the ② reservoir, and Well GaoShi 1 lacks the ①, ②, and ④ reservoirs (Figure 3). In comparison to the external region, the four sets of reservoirs within the sag are more continuous, with no missing layers. The only difference is the variation in reservoir thickness due to the influence of marine transgression and structural uplift and erosion (Figure 8). The Qiong 1 sub-section was deposited during the early stage of marine transgression when the sea level was relatively low, resulting in relatively thinner ① and ② reservoirs, with thicknesses of approximately 15-20m and 10-30m, respectively. The Qiong 2 sub-section represents the peak transgression period with extensive deep-water shelf sedimentation, resulting in the thickest total stratigraphic thickness. Accordingly, the ③ reservoir, located within the five sub-layers of the Qiong 2 sub-section, has a maximum thickness both within the sag (18-30m) and outside the sag (2.5-18m). The reservoirs of the Qiong 2 section were formed during a regressive period of shallow-water shelf sedimentation, under poor reducing conditions and with relatively thin sedimentary thickness. Additionally, the sag experienced uplift during the late stage of the Caledonian period, causing erosion. Consequently, the ④ reservoir within the seven sub-layers of the Qiong 2 section is the thinnest, ranging from 1-3m (Figure 8) (Gao et al., 2020)."},{"instruction":"Below is a paragraph from an academic paper.

Потеря обобщающей способности: Адаптеры Lora могут проводить обучение на ограниченных данных для конкретных языков, что может снизить способность модели к обобщению на другие языки. Модель может стать зависимой от особенностей конкретного языка и испытывать затруднения в обработке различных языковых структур. 2. Ограниченный доступ к ресурсам: Большие языковые модели требуют значительных вычислительных ресурсов и памяти. Применение адаптеров Lora может ограничить доступ к этим ресурсам, поскольку модель должна быть подходящей для использования на маломощных устройствах, таких как LoRaWAN-устройства, которые обладают ограниченными вычислительными возможностями и ограниченной памятью. 3. Требуется предварительная настройка: Адаптеры Lora требуют создания конкретных адаптеров и их обучения для каждого языка, что требует значительного времени и ресурсов. Это может быть сложно для языков с ограниченными имеющимися данными или для редких языков. 4. Сложность поддержки и обновлений: Поддержка адаптеров Lora может быть сложной задачей, поскольку каждый адаптер требует индивидуальной настройки и обслуживания. Обновления модели и адаптеров могут потребовать значительных усилий и времени, особенно если необходимо поддерживать большое количество языков. В целом, использование адаптеров Lora для больших языковых моделей может снизить обобщающую способность модели и требовать значительных ресурсов и усилий для настройки и поддержки.

This decision, allegedly driven by tax write-offs, raises concerns about the company's commitment to preserving and celebrating its rich history of beloved older shows. Moreover, it inadvertently paves the way for increased piracy and challenges the integrity of the network's legacy. The Impact of Tax Write-Offs The decision to reduce Cartoon Network's library on HBO Max may have occurred due to the network's intention to write off older shows for tax purposes. These older shows, often hailed as classics, have a significant monetary value attached to them, making them ideal candidates for tax deductions. However, while this move may temporarily benefit Cartoon Network's financials, it also tarnishes the network's reputation and alienates loyal fans who appreciate the nostalgic charm of these older shows. Neglecting the Richness of Cartoon Network's Legacy Cartoon Network has long been lauded for its wide range of animated shows that catered not only to younger audiences but also to adults seeking quality entertainment. Iconic shows like Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, and many others epitomize the network's commitment to innovation, storytelling, and creativity. By relegating these beloved classics to the sidelines, Cartoon Network risks losing part of its identity and alienating fans who have grown attached to these shows over the years. Fulfilling the Demand for Older Shows in the Digital Age By undervaluing their older shows, Cartoon Network inadvertently nudges fans towards alternative means of accessing their favorite series, fostering an environment of piracy. With a lack of legitimate streaming options, devoted viewers of older shows may turn to unofficial streaming platforms or even resort to downloading torrents. This shift not only results in lost revenue for Cartoon Network but also undermines their efforts to establish a safe and reliable digital space for fans to enjoy their content legally. Embracing Digital Innovation and Audience Diversity Instead of limiting its library solely to modern shows, Cartoon Network could have leveraged the vast potential of HBO Max and its digital platform to strike a balance between old and new programming. By embracing its rich heritage, the network could have catered to fans of all generations and curated a diverse library that appeals to a broader audience. This approach not only honors the network's legacy but also allows it to thrive in the ever-changing landscape of streaming. Conclusion Cartoon Network's decision to reduce its library on HBO Max to only modern shows such as Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Gumball, driven by tax write-offs, is a controversial move that risks alienating fans and fostering piracy. By neglecting the rich legacy of beloved older shows, Cartoon Network undermines its own reputation as a purveyor of quality animated content. Instead, the network should focus on striking a balance between old and new programming, embracing digital innovation, and catering to its diverse audience, ensuring a future that celebrates both the past and the present."},{"instruction":"Follow up report where Cartoon Network takes down illegal uploads, rendering the classics lost media, suggests viewers watch the modern shows instead, Alienated fans switch to Nickelodeon","output":"Title: Cartoon Network's Drastic Measures: Alienating Viewers and Fostering a Rivalry with Nickelodeon Introduction Following our recent report on Cartoon Network's decision to reduce its library on HBO Max, focusing solely on modern shows, a new development has surfaced. Cartoon Network has now aggressively taken down illegal uploads of their older shows, essentially rendering them lost media. This heavy-handed approach not only deepens the divide between the network and its loyal viewers but also pushes frustrated fans towards rival networks like Nickelodeon. The Removal of Classic Shows In an effort to combat piracy, Cartoon Network has taken drastic measures to remove unauthorized uploads of their older shows from various online platforms. While piracy is undoubtedly a concern, this approach ignores the fact that many fans resort to these alternative means due to the lack of legitimate streaming options. By essentially erasing their classics from online platforms, Cartoon Network further alienates fans who were already disappointed by the network's shift towards favoring modern shows. Lost Media: An Irreparable Loss The label of \\"lost media\\" is typically reserved for content that is no longer available due to destruction, neglect, or lack of preservation. In the case of Cartoon Network's older shows, this label is unfortunately applicable if the network does not prioritize their availability. These beloved classics not only hold sentimental value for its dedicated fanbase but also serve as an important cultural artifact within the world of animation. By making the classics difficult, if not impossible, to access, Cartoon Network risks losing a part of its identity and jeopardizing its relationship with long-time viewers. The Shift to Nickelodeon Frustrated with Cartoon Network's decisions, many fans have sought refuge in other networks, with Nickelodeon being a prime beneficiary. Nickelodeon maintains a robust library of popular animated classics such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Rugrats, and Avatar: The Last Airbender. The network's commitment to preserving and streaming its older shows has positioned it as a preferred alternative for animation enthusiasts longing for the nostalgic charm that Cartoon Network appears to be neglecting. The Ripple Effect of Alienating Fans The shift of disgruntled fans to rival networks not only means lost viewership for Cartoon Network but also jeopardizes its standing within the industry. Over time, Nickelodeon may gain an upper hand in securing talented animators, nurturing new creative projects, and capturing the next generation of viewers. Cartoon Network's failure to recognize and cater to the desires of its existing fanbase risks damaging its long-term reputation and ceding its influential position in the animation landscape. Conclusion Cartoon Network's aggressive takedown of illegal uploads of their older shows and the resulting classification of these shows as lost media deepens the divide between the network and its loyal fans. This heavy-handed approach not only alienates viewers but also propels them towards rival networks such as Nickelodeon, which actively preserves and streams their classic content. By failing to prioritize the preservation and availability of its beloved classics, Cartoon Network risks losing not only its identity but also its position as an industry leader. It is crucial for the network to act swiftly to repair its relationship with its fanbase and embrace a more balanced approach that caters to the demands of both old and new viewers."},{"instruction":"Follow up article where Cartoon Network explains that they wrote the old shows off for taxes and made 12 billion dollars, outraged fans switch to Nickelodeon classic cartoons","output":"Title: Cartoon Network's Tax Strategy Backfires: Fans Protest and Turn to Nickelodeon's Classic Cartoons Introduction In a shocking turn of events, Cartoon Network has revealed that their decision to write off their older shows for tax purposes has yielded significant financial gains, amassing a staggering 12 billion dollars.

The unexpected windfall of 12 billion dollars highlights the financial motivations behind Cartoon Network's shift towards favoring modern shows, effectively sidelining classics that once defined the network's identity.

For years, viewers had watched and supported these shows, cementing a deep emotional connection and loyalty to Cartoon Network. The network's decision to prioritize profit over the love and nostalgia associated with these classics has struck a discordant chord with fans who feel forgotten and disregarded. The Exodus to Nickelodeon's Classic Cartoons In response to the perceived abandonment by Cartoon Network, a significant number of outraged fans have sought solace and an escape from their disappointment by turning to Nickelodeon's classic cartoons. Nickelodeon, with its vast library of beloved shows like SpongeBob SquarePants, Rugrats, and Hey Arnold!, has become a safe haven for viewers seeking the nostalgia that Cartoon Network is currently lacking.

The Long-Term Consequences The defection of disheartened fans to Nickelodeon's classic cartoons could have far-reaching consequences for Cartoon Network. Not only does it signify a loss in viewership and potential revenue, but it also threatens to permanently damage the network's reputation. By disregarding the value and significance of their older shows, Cartoon Network risks alienating a dedicated fanbase that had been instrumental in the network's success.

This includes actively engaging with fans, acknowledging their feelings of betrayal, and demonstrating a genuine commitment to preserving and celebrating older shows. Only through a concerted effort to rebuild the bridge with their loyal audience can Cartoon Network hope to regain its standing within the animation community.

Jay was not just any ordinary dragon; he possessed a unique ability that intensified with his emotions. Whenever he felt a strong emotion, whether it be joy, fear, anger, or even embarrassment, his body would react, and he would uncontrollably release an extraordinary amount of water from his scales. One sunny morning, Jay woke up after a peaceful night's rest. He stretched his wings and yawned, ready for another exciting day of exploration. Jay was curious by nature, always seeking adventure and longing to discover new things. Today, he wanted to explore the enchanted forest, a place rumored to be home to extraordinary creatures. As he soared through the sky, Jay could hardly contain his excitement. His wings flapped with joy, and a tiny stream of water trickled from his scales. \\"I can't wait to see what wonders await me!\\" he exclaimed, spouting a small fountain of water into the air. Landing gracefully on the forest floor, Jay ventured deep into the enchanting woods. The lush greenery surrounded him, creating a serene atmosphere. As he moved deeper into the forest, he noticed a sparkling pond hidden amongst tall trees and shimmering flowers. Curiosity urged Jay forward, and he approached the clear pond with caution. He lowered his snout to take a closer look, his eyes wide with amazement. His reflection stared back at him, a magnificent dragon with vibrant scales that glinted with every ray of sunlight. Suddenly, Jay's attention was caught by a rustling sound nearby. He turned his head quickly, only to discover a mischievous sprite peering from behind a tree. The sprite's eyes twinkled mischievously, and a sly grin spread across his face. \\"You seem like quite the unique creature! Would you care to join me in a playful game of tag?\\" the sprite beckoned, his voice filled with excitement. Jay, always up for a challenge, agreed without hesitation. Little did he know that playing tag with a sprite would bring about an unexpected twist to his day. As they darted and weaved through the forest trees, Jay couldn't help but enjoy the thrill of the chase. The sprite danced through the foliage, always managing to stay one step ahead of Jay's powerful wings. With each near-capture, Jay's excitement grew, triggering his unique ability. Suddenly, he felt a tingling sensation in his scales. Water began to trickle, then flow steadily down his body, forming small puddles wherever he passed. When Jay looked down, he gasped in surprise. His scales had turned into a cascade of shimmering blue water, gushing out uncontrollably! Embarrassment quickly washed over him, and he halted his pursuit. He knew he needed to find a solution to stop this enormous release. But in the midst of his panic, Jay realized that every time he tried to suppress the water, it only multiplied. In the distance, the sprite watched the spectacle unfold, both amazed and slightly guilty for causing Jay such distress. Curiosity sparked within him as he pondered a solution. \\"What if I diverted his attention?\\" the sprite thought. Taking a deep breath, the sprite yelled, \\"Jay, look up! It seems that the enchanted waterfall of the Dragon Elders is nearby!\\" Jay's attention immediately shifted, and his scales stopped gushing water. He scanned the surroundings, trying to locate the supposed waterfall. But to his dismay, there was nothing but trees and ferns swaying gently in the breeze. The sprite chuckled softly, realizing that the diversion had worked. Seeing Jay relieved from his water-relief predicament, the sprite approached him. \\"I apologize for my mischievousness,\\" the sprite confessed, a hint of remorse in his voice. \\"I was not aware of your unique ability, and I wanted to have some fun. If you promise forgiveness, I can lead you to a magical spring where you can control and manage your water release.\\" Jay considered the sprite's offer, understanding that accidents happen, and their intentions had been innocent. \\"I accept your apology,\\" he declared, extending a forgiving claw. \\"Lead the way.\\" And so, together, Jay and the sprite embarked on a new adventure, seeking the magical spring. Along the way, they formed an unlikely friendship, promising to support and protect each other. With the sprite's guidance, Jay finally learned to embrace his unique ability, understanding that it was a part of who he was. As they reached the magical spring, Jay dipped his scales into the glistening waters. To his astonishment, he found that he could control the release of water, allowing him utmost freedom in expressing his emotions. From that day on, Jay explored the mystical land, sharing his tales of adventure and water-relief with anyone willing to listen. He became renowned as the Dragon with a Unique Ability, inspiring others to embrace their own extraordinary talents and accept themselves just as they were."},{"instruction":"Chapter 1.1: Beginning of Apocalypse (part 1/2) Chaos approached inner Solar system and entered Earth system, apocalypse has begun. Chaos uses elemental superpower combination of hurling asteroids and emitting radioactivity. Chaos hurls big radioactive asteroids into Yellowstone supervolcano, causing a cataclysmic eruption that sent ash clouds encircling the globe. Chaos used power to raining asteroids on Earth, summoning multiple of asteroids pollute into Solar system, Solar system falls into resemblance of protoplanetary Solar system. Orbit of Earth becomes slightly eccentric due to gravity of Chaos, Luna is no longer moon of Earth to become new planet. Chaos used power to spread deadly plagues across Earth, it playing game like Plague Inc., Chaos rapidly evolving plagues against humanity. Chaos left Earth and goes to orbit of Neptune, orbits of other dwarf planets become artificially different, orbit between Uranus and Neptune become nearer. Decade later, Chaos returned to Earth, Chaos used power to unleashes deadly stellar flares that burst gamma rays on Earth, second Carrington event happens, Chaos used power to unleashes electromagnetic pulses on Earth, civilizations on Earth goes blackout. Mercury collided with Venus to form new planet named Merenus, Earth goes near Jupiter, Earth is being almost ripped by Roche limit of Jupiter, orbit of Earth becomes eccentric. Earth has extreme seasons: Short and hot summer, long and cold winter. Luna moves nearer Sun, Neptune lost moon Triton to becomes new dwarf planet, Uranus collided with Neptune to form new planet named Neptanus. (Write complex and longer texts)","output":"The beginning of the apocalypse had arrived, shrouding the inner Solar system in chaos. Like a sinister force, Chaos made its way towards Earth, ready to unleash its devastating power. Utilizing a combination of elemental superpowers, Chaos began its reign of destruction by hurling massive asteroids towards our planet, infused with a deadly dose of radiation. One of Chaos's first targets was the Yellowstone supervolcano, an already ominous force of nature. The impact of the radioactive asteroids caused a cataclysmic eruption, sending vast ash clouds encircling the globe. The once serene and harmonious Earth was now faced with a spiraling catastrophe, as Chaos continued to summon more asteroids, polluting the pristine realm of the Solar system. The very fabric of the Solar system began to change under the influence of Chaos. As more and more asteroids rained down on Earth, the delicate balance of the planets shifted. The orderly orbits of the planets transformed into a chaotic resemblance of a protoplanetary system. The gravitational pull of Chaos caused the orbit of Earth to become slightly eccentric, altering its trajectory. But the effects of Chaos went beyond mere planetary rearrangement. Luna, the loyal moon of Earth, was no longer bound to its side. Pulled by the gravitational force of Chaos, Luna broke free and transformed into a new planet, leaving Earth without its long-standing companion. As Chaos wreaked havoc on Earth, it found pleasure in playing a sinister game. It unleashed deadly plagues, using Earth as its playing field. Mimicking the popular game \\"Plague Inc.,\\" Chaos rapidly evolved these plagues, mutating them to target humanity's weaknesses. The world fell victim to these relentless diseases, struggling to combat a foe that seemed both omnipotent and insatiable in its quest for destruction. After leaving Earth for a decade, Chaos returned, seeking new ways to torment the planet. This time, it unleashed deadly stellar flares that burst forth with powerful gamma rays, reminiscent of the historic Carrington event. Chaos also utilized its powers to release electromagnetic pulses, plunging civilizations into darkness as power grids failed and communication systems went offline. As Chaos continued its assault on the Solar system, drastic changes occurred. The collision of Mercury and Venus resulted in the formation of a new planet named Merenus. Earth, now gravitationally influenced by Jupiter, drew closer to the gas giant, causing tension and strain that threatened to rip our planet apart. The once-familiar seasons on Earth became a distant memory, replaced by extreme weather patterns. Summers became short but scorching, while winters stretched on, cold and unforgiving. The unstable orbit of Earth brought about these drastic changes, leaving humanity in a perpetual struggle to adapt to a world that no longer resembled the familiar home they once knew. Meanwhile, Luna, now closer to the Sun, underwent its own transformation. Neptune lost its loyal moon, Triton, which became a new dwarf planet in its own right. Uranus and Neptune collided, resulting in the formation of yet another new planet named Neptanus. And so, the world and the Solar system bore witness to the terrifying manifestation of Chaos's power. With each passing moment, the apocalypse deepened its grip on reality, leaving humanity to wonder if there was any hope left in the face of such overwhelming darkness."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
