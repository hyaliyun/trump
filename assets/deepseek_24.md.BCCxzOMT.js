This genre, similar to manga from Japan, typically refers to South Korean comic books or graphic novels that are published online. These digital comics have become incredibly popular and are accessible to a global audience, often featuring compelling stories, diverse art styles, and unique cultural themes. \\"Superhuman Era\\" tells the story of a futuristic world where superhuman abilities have become commonplace. These abilities transform the landscape of daily life, professional sports, and even criminal activity. The story often focuses on the implications of such abilities on individuals and society, exploring themes of power, responsibility, and the human condition. Since manhwa is digitally published, it often allows for reader interaction, with new chapters released on a regular schedule, similar to how manga is published in Japan. Readers can typically find these works on various manhwa reading platforms or publishers' websites. If you're interested in reading \\"Superhuman Era,\\" you can look for it on reputable webtoon platforms that host a variety of manhwa titles. Always use legal and official sources to support the creators and the industry."},{"instruction":"Can you give me an ability that matches with the superhuman era manwha","output":"In the context of the manhwa \\"Superhuman Era,\\" where characters possess various superhuman abilities, it's important to devise abilities that fit well within the universe's lore and logic. Here's a conceptual ability that might fit into the world of \\"Superhuman Era\\": **Chrono-Synchrony** *Description*: Chrono-Synchrony is the ability to synchronize the user's personal time with external events or objects, effectively allowing them to manipulate their own relative time flow. *Capabilities*: A character with Chrono-Synchrony could experience time at a different rate than the rest of the world. For example, they could slow their perception of time to dodge attacks with superhuman reflexes or speed it up to heal minor wounds more rapidly. It's not time travel, but rather time manipulation on a personal scale, affecting only the user's interaction with the flow of time. *Limitations*: Chrono-Synchrony would be limited by its energy demands and the physical toll it takes on the user's body. Using the ability could be exhausting, and there might be a risk of 'desynchronization,' causing the user to become disoriented or lose touch with the normal time flow. This ability would also not affect the external world, so while the user can move quickly or slowly relative to others, they cannot change actual events that have transpired. This ability could lead to some creative storylines, as it has both tactical applications in combat and potential for dramatic narrative use. When inventing abilities for a superhuman world, it's also important to consider balance, drawbacks, and how such powers would impact society and interpersonal dynamics within the story."},{"instruction":"Give me another one","output":"Certainly! Here's another superhuman ability concept that could fit in the world of \\"Superhuman Era\\": **Molecular Adhesion** *Description*: Molecular Adhesion gives the user the power to control the molecular attraction between surfaces, effectively allowing them to stick to any material or make any object adhere to another as if magnetically or via suction. *Capabilities*: This ability could enable the user to climb walls and ceilings with ease, or bind opponents' weapons to their hands or to each other. It also could be used creatively to repair objects by fusing their broken parts together. The character could walk on water by increasing the molecular cohesion on their feet or prevent items from being taken from them by fixing them in place. *Limitations*: As with any interesting superhuman ability, it needs to have limitations to prevent it from being overpowered. In the case of Molecular Adhesion, one limitation could be that the strength of adhesion is directly proportional to the user's concentration and physical energy. Using this ability extensively could lead to mental fatigue or physical exhaustion. Additionally, the effect could be temporary and might weaken over time or under certain conditions (e.g., extreme temperatures, electromagnetic fields, or when the user is unconscious). Another constraint could be that the ability only works when the user is in direct physical contact with the object, generating a field of adhesion from their hands or other body parts. Therefore, they could not, for instance, make objects adhere to each other from a distance. This limitation ensures there is a clear risk-reward strategy involved when the user employs their power in various situations."},{"instruction":"Guitar chords for star boy","output":"\\"Starboy\\" by The Weeknd featuring Daft Punk is a song that typically uses a few simple chords that can be played on the guitar.

They are often considered the body's primary source of energy, playing a crucial role in various physiological functions. Carbohydrates are mainly derived from plant sources and are found in a wide range of foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and milk products. They can be classified into three main types: sugars, starches, and fibers. In this essay, we will explore the importance of carbohydrates in the human diet and their impact on overall health. To begin with, carbohydrates are the body's preferred source of energy, providing the necessary fuel for physical and mental activities. When consumed in the form of sugars or starches, carbohydrates are broken down by the body into glucose—a simple sugar that circulates in the bloodstream and serves as a vital energy source for cells. Glucose is particularly important for the brain, as it is the sole source of fuel for this organ. Carbohydrates also spare protein breakdown by serving as an alternative energy source. By ensuring an adequate intake of carbohydrates, individuals can sustain optimal performance levels and maintain overall well-being. Moreover, carbohydrates provide dietary fiber, which plays a crucial role in digestive health. Fiber, found abundantly in plant-based foods, aids in maintaining regular bowel movements, preventing constipation, and supporting a healthy gut microbiome. It adds bulk to the stool, facilitating smoother and more efficient digestion. Additionally, fiber helps regulate blood glucose levels, preventing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar. This is particularly important for individuals with diabetes or those at risk of developing the condition. A diet rich in carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can help prevent chronic diseases such as colorectal cancer, heart disease, and obesity. In recent years, carbohydrates have been subject to scrutiny due to their association with weight gain and obesity. However, it is important to distinguish between complex carbohydrates and refined or simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates, found in whole grains, legumes, and vegetables, contain a rich array of nutrients, such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals. These carbohydrates are digested slowly, releasing a steady stream of glucose into the bloodstream, avoiding sudden spikes in blood sugar. On the other hand, simple carbohydrates, including refined sugars and highly processed foods, are rapidly digested and often lack essential nutrients. It is the excessive consumption of these simple carbohydrates that has contributed to the rise in obesity rates. The key to a healthy carbohydrate intake lies in choosing complex carbohydrates over their refined counterparts and maintaining a balanced diet. Moderation and portion control are key. Carbohydrates should ideally make up about 45-65% of one's daily caloric intake, with an emphasis on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. These sources provide not only energy but also an assortment of other vital nutrients that contribute to overall health. In conclusion, carbohydrates are a necessary component of a well-rounded diet, providing the body with energy, fiber, and essential nutrients. They are the primary fuel for physical and mental activities, supporting optimal performance and brain function. By incorporating complex carbohydrates into our diets while avoiding excessive consumption of simple carbohydrates, we can harness the benefits of this fundamental macronutrient and promote long-term health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Ten words","output":"Carbohydrates are essential macronutrients, providing energy and promoting overall health."},{"instruction":"Make art","output":"Art is a form of expression, a window to creativity.

They must navigate each other's worlds, evade corporate trackers, and expose the truth behind the technology before they can reclaim their lives. Chapter 1: **The Glitch** Liam Maddox, a suave, up-and-coming executive at VizaTech, the leading company in face-swapping tech, stood in line in the bustling lobby of VizaTech headquarters. He was about to undergo a routine swap for an undercover market analysis mission. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Jace, a street artist who vehemently opposed the normalization of identity swapping, was being dragged into a VizaTech outlet by friends as a prank. Both men, unbeknownst to each other, would soon be entangled in a life-altering switch. The same moment Liam and Jace placed their faces into the scanning pods, a rogue piece of code, a remnant from the latest untested update, triggered across the network. There was a flicker of lights, a momentary loss of power, and then everything rebooted. Faces reassembled, lives realigned—but not to their original templates. Chapter 2: **Mirrored Lives** Liam opened his eyes and stared at a reflection he didn't recognize—tousled hair, a ring piercing through an eyebrow. Panic set in. Across the city, Jace lowered his gaze from the mirror to the finely tailored suit hugging his frame, a gold watch glinting on his wrist. Disbelief washed over him. Liam, in Jace's body, tried to explain the mix-up to the VizaTech staff, only to be mistaken for a delusional art fanatic. Meanwhile, Jace, now the spitting image of Liam, was ushered into a car and driven to VizaTech headquarters for an important board meeting. Chapter 3: **Walk In Another's Shoes** Each man fumbled through the other's life. Liam groggily found his way to Jace's rundown apartment, greeted by expectant patrons of the artist's black-market face designs. Conversely, Jace sat in a boardroom, nodding at concepts and strategies he barely understood. The realization dawned on both men that, without their faces, their identities meant nothing. Neither was equipped to navigate the life of the other. Yet, a gnawing fear of becoming permanent prisoners of this mix-up kept them pushing forward. Chapter 4: **Corporate Trackers** VizaTech's AI had detected the anomaly and classified both men as potential security breaches. Corporate enforcers—agents specialized in containment and reversion—were dispatched. Liam and Jace suddenly found themselves on the run. Liam needed Jace's wits to evade VizaTech's trackers, while Jace needed Liam's insights into corporate moves. Chapter 5: **Unseen Alliance** They connected via an underground network of face-swapping critics and tech dissenters. Communicating through coded messages, they planned a meet-up at an abandoned factory, where they could work out a plan to switch back without falling into VizaTech's hands. Chapter 6: **Exposing the Truth** Pooling their skills, they hacked into VizaTech's central database in search of the glitch. They uncovered more than they bargained for—not only could they restore their original identities, but they also found evidence that VizaTech had been selling personal data illegally. Chapter 7: **Face to Face** Now allies, they faced the decision of whether to go public with the information and risk it all for the sake of transparency. The two men, once opposites, stood face-to-face. Liam possessed Jace's rebellious spirit, while Jace wore Liam's mask of affluence. A perfect team. Chapter 8: **Identity Restored** A plan was set in motion. As Jace released the data to the media, Liam faced off against VizaTech's board. In a tense confrontation, they managed to initiate the reversal sequence, returning to their original appearances just as the story broke out across the news. Epilogue: **Reflections of Self** Despite reverting to their own lives, Liam and Jace couldn't erase the bond they had forged while living as the other. With VizaTech under investigation and face-swapping technology under ethical scrutiny, both men considered the incident an eye-opener. They remained connected, both dedicated to shaping how society would handle identity in the future, a blending of art and corporate social responsibility. Together, they had uncovered the mirror's fault—and reflected the potential for a truth far greater than the sum of one's face."},{"instruction":"아래 내용을 참고하여 \\"4) 기타 (Other details)\\"에 대해서 작성한 \\" 삼성에서 쌓아온 실무 경험과 향후 성균관대학교 대학원 연구 과정을 통해 저는 특히 NPU 기술의 발전에 초점을 맞추고 있습니다. 시뮬레이션 환경에서의 NPU 코어 모델링에 관한 연구와 개발 활동은 앞으로 삼성에서 생산하는 다양한 디바이스에 NPU를 통합하는 데 매우 중요한 역할을 할 것으로 기대합니다. 이를 통해 미래의 AI 시장에서 삼성이 경쟁력 있는 제품을 지속적으로 생산하고 납품하는 데 결정적인 기여를 하게 될 것입니다. 해당 연구 활동의 성과는 NPU가 내장된 제품의 실제 탑재로 이어질 것이며, 이는 삼성이 제품을 시장에 출시할 때 혁명적인 성능 향상과 사용자 경험 개선을 가져올 것입니다. 또한, 저는 NPU 개발에 관련된 모든 과정에 혁신적 사고와 문제 해결 능력을 적용하여 이 분야에서의 리더십을 다지고자 합니다. 사내기술대학원과 연계된 심도 있는 학습을 통해 최신 기술 트렌드에 발맞춰 나가면서, 저는 삼성의 AI 분야에서 팀과 함께 성공적으로 핵심적인 변화들을 이끌 수 있는 주요 인재로 성장할 것을 목표로 하고 있습니다. 이러한 노력들은 제품 개발에 직접적인 성과를 가져오는 것뿐만 아니라, 삼성이 미래 시장에서 중추적인 역할을 계속 유지하고 발전시킬 수 있는 방향성을 제시할 것입니다. 또한 성균관대학교 대학원 생활에서 연구실에 소속되어 다양한 기술교류 및 인적 네트워킹을 형성하여 뛰어난 인재들과 함께 교류하고 다양한 경험을 쌓아 학문적 지향점에 부합하는 목표를 달성할 수 있도록 노력할 것 입니다. 그리고 이 과정을 통한 좋은 논문을 발표할 수 있는 기회가 되면 좋겠습니다.\\"을 다듬어줘. 이거 나한테 정말 중요한 일이야, 확실하게 검토해, 넌 할 수 있어.

진학동기 및 목표 저는 대기만성형으로 그동안은 자신의 방향을 잡는데 시간을 많이 할애하였습니다. 어느덧 삼성과 함께한 지 8년이라는 시간이 지나고, 점점 제 위치가 마냥 저만 바라봐야 하는 위치가 아님을 깨달았습니다. 과제의 방향성을 이끌고, 나아가서 팀의 지향점을 제시할 수 있는 인재가 되기 위해서 이번 연수를 통하여 조직에 방향을 제시할 수 있는 지식인이 되고 싶습니다. -

혁신 lv3 관례적인 여러 개발론에 대해서 변화를 주도하였습니다. 주요 관점은 Procedural Programming Language인 C언어의 사용을 줄이고, 조금 더 추상화된 Object-oriented programming인 C++의 사용을 끌어내는 것이었습니다. 협업원들과 소통하며, 우리의 개발에 대한 여러 문제 상황을 공유하고, 지속적으로 PL에게 변경에 대한 요청을 하였으며, 이것이 받아들여져서 변화를 이끌어 냈습니다. 새로운 해법이나 기술에 대해서 두려워하지 않고 계속해서 변화를 주도적으로 이끌고 싶은 마음가짐을 가지고 있으며, 그러한 변화를 이끌기 위해서 시간이 조금 더 든다는 단점을 포용할 수 있는 마음가짐을 지니고 있습니다. 또한 simulator을 맡아, 새로이 독자적인 기능을 구상하고 구현하며, 혁신적인 사고방식을 적극 활용하여 과제에 적용하고 있습니다. 전통적인 개발 방법론에 도전하여 혁신을 주도해왔습니다. 핵심적인 변화 중 하나는 절차적 프로그래밍 언어인 C 언어의 사용을 줄이고, 객체 지향 프로그래밍 언어인 C++ 사용을 증가시키는 것이었습니다. 동료들과의 지속적인 소통을 통해 개발 중 겪는 다양한 문제들을 나누고, 프로그래밍 언어를 개선해야 할 필요성을 제기함으로써 이러한 변화를 실현시켰습니다. 새로운 해법이나 기술에 대한 두려움 없이 계속해서 적극적으로 변화를 이끌고자 하는 의지를 갖추고 있습니다. 또한, 변화를 이끌어내기 위해 필요할 때 추가 시간을 들이는 것을 마다하지 않습니다. 시뮬레이터 개발을 맡으며 독창적인 기능을 구상하고 구현해내는 과정에서 혁신적인 사고를 적극적으로 활용해왔습니다. 이는 제 과제 수행에 큰 도움이 되었으며, 앞으로도 이러한 혁신적 접근법으로 보다 큰 가치를 창출하고 싶습니다. - 문제해결 lv4 저는 평소에 항상 과업에 힘쓰면서 문제를 어떻게든 풀어내는 것을 즐깁니다. 그렇기에 일을 맡아 책임지고 수행함에 있어서 부담이 아닌 즐거움을 가지고 임하기에 이 점이 저의 장점이라고 생각합니다. 하지만 단점은 역시 문제를 너무 심도 깊게 다루면서 시간을 무엇보다 많이 사용하게 된다는 점입니다. 하지만 다시 해당 문제를 다루게 된다면 깊은 이해를 토대로 더 빠른 솔루션을 제시할 수 있는 장점도 가지고 있습니다. circleci(github action)를 통하여 release 자동화를 구현하거나, 새로운 vISA에 대한 architecture release(compiler, decoder, simulator)에도 자동화 기능을 도입하고 있습니다. 이처럼 자동화를 모색하여 한 사람 이상의 몫을 할 수 있도록 힘쓰고 있습니다. 또한 자신이 담당하는 영역의 code 뿐만 아니라 github를 통하여 연관된 다른 code도 직접 이해하고 수정하여 기다림 없이 더 빠른 일정이 가능하도록 합니다. 저는 평소 문제 해결 과정을 즐기며, 주어진 과업을 통해 문제를 해결하는 과정을 흥미롭게 여깁니다. 이런 접근은 일에 대한 책임감과 함께, 부담감이 아닌 즐거움으로 일을 수행하는 제 장점이라고 생각합니다. 하지만 때로는 문제를 너무 깊이 파고들어 해결하는 데 많은 시간을 할애하는 단점이 있습니다. 그러나 한번 파고든 문제는 더 깊은 이해를 바탕으로, 동일한 문제를 다시 마주했을 때 빠른 해결책을 제시할 수 있는 장점도 있습니다. CircleCI를 활용해 릴리스 자동화를 구현했으며, GitHub Actions에 이식하여, 새로운 vISA 아키텍처 릴리스(컴파일러, 디코더, 시뮬레이터 등)에도 자동화를 도입하고 있습니다. 이처럼 자동화를 추진하여 한 사람 이상의 역할을 해내려는 노력을 기울이고 있습니다. 또한 제가 담당하는 코드 영역뿐만 아니라, GitHub를 통해 연관된 다른 코드에 대해서도 직접 분석하고 수정하여, 대기 시간 없이 프로젝트 일정을 더욱 신속하게 진행할 수 있도록 하고 있습니다. - 협업 lv4 현 과업을 진행하면서 NPU SW Toolchain를 구성하기 위해 각 파트(NPU_Compiler, NPU_SystemService)의 인력과 긴밀히 협력하고 업무를 수행하고 있기에 다음과 같은 진단레벨을 제출합니다. 또한 저희 파트의 하드웨어 인력과 협업하며, 문서에 다 표현하지 못한 디테일을 신경 써 시뮬레이션을 구성하는데 있어서 하드웨어의 동작 격차를 줄이고 정밀도를 높이는 구성을 제공할 수 있었습니다. 그리고 담당 업무에만 국한하지 않고, Decoder나 Compiler에 오류가 있거나 특정 기능이 필요할 경우, 직접 PR을 작성하여 타 업무에도 적극적으로 지원하고 있습니다. 현재 NPU Toolchain을 구축하는 과정에서 NPU Compiler와 NPU SystemService 등 다양한 파트의 팀원들과 긴밀하게 협력하며 업무를 추진하고 있습니다. 다음 사항은 제가 기여한 협업의 결과입니다. 또한 저희 하드웨어 팀과 긴밀히 협력하여 문서로 충분히 표현되지 않은 세부적인 사항들에도 주의를 기울였고, 그 결과 시뮬레이션에 있어 하드웨어의 실제 동작과의 차이를 줄이고 정밀도를 높일 수 있는 결과물을 만들어냈습니다. 나아가 제가 담당하는 분야에만 머무르지 않고, Decoder나 Compiler에 오류가 발견되거나 추가 기능이 필요할 경우, 직접 Pull Request를 작성하여 다른 업무 영역에도 적극적으로 기여하고 있습니다. - 추진력 lv3 저는 swmaze-1.0과 JOE를 통합하여 보호하는 swmaze-2.0의 기반이 되는 프로토타입을 구성하였습니다. 이것은 swmaze-2.0을 구성하는데 도움을 주었으며, swmaze-2.0을 설계하고 구성하는데 추진력을 가지고 도전적인 목표를 수립하여 진행하였습니다. 제가 전담하고 있는 NPU Toolchain의 구축 작업은 각기 다른 부서와의 긴밀한 협업을 필요로 하는 도전적인 과업이었습니다. 이를 성공적으로 이끌어낸 데에는 강력한 추진력이 큰 역할을 했습니다. 이 과정에서, 기술적 장벽과 협업상의 도전과제를 극복하기 위해 끊임없이 대화하고 협의하면서 프로젝트의 동력을 유지해왔습니다. 저의 추진력은 문서에 명시되지 않은 하드웨어 세부 사항을 심도 깊게 이해하고, 이를 시뮬레이션 구성에 정교하게 반영하여 정밀도 높은 결과를 도출하는 데도 활용됩니다. 하드웨어의 미묘한 동작 차이까지도 포착하고, 이를 시뮬레이션에 반영하여 실제와 가까운 성능 테스트를 가능하게 함으로써 프로젝트 추진에 중요한 역할을 했습니다. 더 나아가, 다른 파트의 문제에 대해서 발생한 문제나 필요한 기능에 대해 기다림 없이 직접 PR을 작성하며 개입하는 등, 제가 맡은 업무에만 만족하지 않고 적극적으로 문제를 해결해 나가고자 하는 접근 방식은, 제가 어떤 도전에도 능동적으로 대처할 수 있는 힘을 보여줍니다. - 의사결정 lv3 작게는 github를 통하여 구현에 대한 의사결정을 원만하게 진행하여 여러 의견을 나누고, 크게 과제의 방향성을 결정하는 경우 내부적인 회의를 통하여 결정하고, 지속적으로 논의합니다. 비판에 대해서는 움츠러들지 않고, 수용하고 더 나은 방향성을 찾는 것에 일조한다는 마음가짐으로 적극적으로 의사결정에 동참합니다. 작은 규모의 결정에서부터 큰 방향성 결정에 이르기까지, 저는 원활한 의사결정을 위해 GitHub를 활용하여 구현상의 세부 사항에 대해 동료들과 효과적으로 소통합니다. 팀 내에서는 내부 회의를 통해 프로젝트의 큰 방향성을 결정하고, 이를 지속적으로 논의하며 함께 발전시켜 나갑니다. 제안 받은 비판에 대해서는 주눅 들지 않고, 그것을 수용하여 더 나은 결과를 도출할 수 있는 방향으로 전환시키는 것을 중요한 과정으로 여깁니다. 저는 이러한 자세로 의사결정에 적극 참여하며, 개선을 위한 노력을 아끼지 않습니다. - 글로벌 감각 lv3 저는 JOE를 담당하고 있는 SRK와 커뮤니케이션을 담당하고 있습니다. 과제의 일정 진행사항을 수시로 연락하여 판단하고 있으며, 각종 Issue에 대해서 연락하여 솔루션을 찾는 역활을 맡고 있습니다.영어를 이용하여 원활하게 대화하고 있으며, 가끔 컴퍼런스 콜을 이용하여 우리의 의도를 전달하거나 상황을 파악하고 있습니다. 다양한 국가와 문화에서 온 동료들과의 협업을 통해 저는 글로벌 감각을 발전시켜왔습니다. mRPsim을 개발하기 위해 인도 인력과 다년간 화상회의를 진행하며 협업하였고, SRK 인력과 Android & Java obfuscation tool인 JOE를 성공적으로 개발하여 사업화를 성공적으로 마쳤습니다. 이러한 결과는 엄격한 지역적 틀을 벗어나 보다 넓은 시야를 가지고 다문화적 환경에서도 효과적으로 소통하며 일할 수 있는 능력을 의미합니다. 저는 글로벌 시장의 동향을 주시하고, 다양한 국제 기준과 프로토콜에 익숙해지며, 이러한 지식을 업무에 적용하여 다국적 팀원들과의 협업을 원활히 진행해왔습니다. 글로벌 커뮤니케이션과 협업에서 오는 복잡한 도전들을 해결하는 데 적극적이며 개방적인 태도를 취함으로써, 저는 글로벌 감각이 강한 전문가로 성장하고자 합니다. 이것은 저에게 중요한 가치이며, 지속적인 개인 및 전문적 성장을 위해 필수적인 요소라고 여기고 있습니다. - 품질중시 lv3 기능 하나를 구현하더라도, 표준은 어떻게 구현했는지 확인하고 그를 최대한 맞추려고 합니다. 하지만 구현 코드 라인 수 보다 시간이 더 많이 소모되기에 효율적이진 않은 단점이 있습니다. 하지만 품질을 높이는 것이야 말로 이후 소프트웨어의 유지보수성에도 큰 도움이 될 것이라고 생각되기에 품질을 높이기 위한 노력을 많이 합니다. 저는 어떠한 기능을 개발할 때에도 표준에 부합하는지 철저히 검토하며, 그 기준에 최대한 부합하도록 노력합니다. 이 과정은 구현 코드의 라인 수 대비 시간이 더 많이 소모되는 단점이 있지만, 저는 품질 향상이 소프트웨어의 장기적인 유지보수에 결정적인 이점을 가져다준다고 확신합니다. 따라서 고품질의 결과물을 만들기 위해 추가적인 시간과 노력을 기울이는 것을 매우 중요하게 생각합니다. - 리스크 관리 lv4 저는 하드웨어 작동을 신뢰성 있게 재현하기 위한 과업을 맡고 있으며, 이를 위해 적극적으로 동작 테스트를 수행하고 있습니다. 모든 코드는 GitHub Actions를 통해 지속적으로 관리되고, 모듈 생성 과정에 맞춰 gtest를 지속적으로 업데이트하고 있습니다. 소프트웨어 릴리스의 전 과정을 담당하는 만큼, Samsung Research SE 기준에 부합하는 잠재결함검증, 판정 부재 Test 관리, Negative TC 비율 및 Feature Test 구현, 라이선스 Issue 관리 문제 처리 등을 철저히 수행하고 있으며, 이 모든 과정을 자동화하려고 노력하고 있습니다. 최근에는 데비안 패키지 릴리스 관리를 추가로 담당하게 되어 NPU Toolchain에 대한 협업도 더욱 긴밀히 유지하고 있습니다. SE 기준에 맞춘 체계적인 관리를 통해, 위험 요소에 대비한 예방책을 사전에 마련하고 코드 안정성을 강화하고 있습니다. 더불어, 위험한 상황이 발생했을 때 즉각적으로 대응할 수 있도록 자동화 시스템을 통한 관리를 실시하고 있습니다. - 지속적 학습 lv3 저는 항상 깊이 있는 이해를 가지고자 노력하며, 왜 이렇게 구현하는 것이 더 좋은지 끊임 없이 고민하는 스타일 입니다. 그래서 오픈소스를 적극 활용하여 해당 구현에 대해서 더 심도 있는 이해를 하려고 노력하고 있습니다. 지속적 학습은 개인적인 성장과 조직의 혁신을 위한 핵심 요소입니다. 본인의 업무와 학습에 대한 열정은 사내기술대학원에 합격한 것으로부터 증명됩니다.

This is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, which has remained unsolved since it was first proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. The hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on a certain critical line in the complex plane. While the statement of the hypothesis itself might not pose as a complex question to understand, proving or disproving it requires a deep understanding of complex analysis, number theory, and advanced mathematical techniques that have yet to be discovered. Many of the brightest mathematicians have attempted to solve the Riemann Hypothesis, and it remains an open question in the field of mathematics."},{"instruction":"Give me the hardest math question you've ever seen that is solved","output":"One of the hardest math questions that has been solved is Fermat's Last Theorem. This conjecture was proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and it states that there are no three positive integers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2. The theorem remained unsolved for over three centuries until it was finally proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994, with the help of Richard Taylor. Wiles' proof was highly complex and required a deep understanding of advanced mathematical concepts such as elliptic curves, modular forms, and Galois representations. Wiles' proof not only resolved Fermat's Last Theorem but also shed light on various other areas of mathematics. It is considered one of the most significant achievements in the field of number theory and serves as an example of the power and depth of mathematical reasoning and proof."},{"instruction":"whats the answer","output":"The answer to Fermat's Last Theorem is that there are no three positive integers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2.

The scoring for the NWEA MAP test is based on the RIT scale (Rasch Unit), which does not have a specific \\"perfect score\\" or maximum score. The RIT scale is a continuous scale that measures a student's performance and growth over time. Each question on the test is specifically designed to determine a student's instructional level or skill level in a particular subject, such as math. The RIT scale allows for precise measurement of a student's abilities and growth, and scores are relative to other students at the same grade level.

It often utilizes koans (paradoxical anecdotes or riddles) to transcend conventional thinking. - **Daoism** focuses on living harmoniously with the \\"Dao\\" or \\"Way,\\" which is the fundamental principle underlying the universe. It values naturalness (ziran), simplicity, and non-action (wu wei) - acting in accordance with the flow of nature. **Views on Nature of Reality and Self:** - In **Zen**, the nature of reality is seen as impermanent and interconnected. The concept of \\"sunyata\\" suggests emptiness or the lack of an inherent self-nature in all things. The realization of this is essential for enlightenment. - **Daoism** sees the nature of reality as ever-changing and governed by the complementary forces of yin and yang. It posits a fundamental unity behind the apparent opposites in the world, and a person's 'self' is best in harmony when aligned with the Dao. **Practices for Spiritual Cultivation:** - **Zen** practitioners follow the Eightfold Path and use seated meditation to gain insight into their true nature and to experience satori (sudden enlightenment). - **Daoism** offers a variety of spiritual practices like tai chi, qigong, and meditation, not primarily for enlightenment but to balance one's internal energy (qi) and to align with the natural world. **Influence on Culture and the Arts:** - **Zen** has had a significant impact on the arts, particularly in Japan, influencing traditional practices such as the tea ceremony, calligraphy, and ikebana (flower arranging). - **Daoism** has influenced Chinese culture extensively, contributing to medicine, poetry, visual arts, and statecraft. It also gave rise to religious Daoism with its own pantheon and liturgical practices. **Similarities:** - Both emphasize a return to a more natural, spontaneous state of being. - Each values simplicity and direct experiences over intellectualism and doctrinal rigidity. - Both philosophies are concerned with living in harmony with the fundamental nature of reality. **Differences:** - Zen has its roots in Buddhism and therefore often revolves around the cessation of suffering and the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsara). - Daoism is more concerned with longevity, immortality, and living in a way that conserves life force and aligns with the natural rhythms of the Dao. - The ultimate goal in Zen is enlightenment, while in Daoism it is more about living a long, harmonious life. **Conclusion:** Zen Buddhism and Daoism, despite arising from different traditions, share a common interest in harmony with the natural order and a preference for experiential wisdom over scholarly learning. However, they diverge in their conceptual frameworks, with Zen focusing on the annihilation of the ego to achieve satori, while Daoism concentrates on aligning with the Dao to live a balanced and prolonged life."},{"instruction":"Argue that the annihilation of ego to achieve satori is functionally the same as aligning with the dao. 4 paragraphs.","output":"The pursuit of satori in Zen Buddhism and alignment with the Dao in Daoism may at first appear to be differing quests, one seeking enlightenment through the apparent annihilation of the ego, and the other seeking harmony with the ultimate principle of the universe. However, a closer examination reveals that both paths fundamentally converge on the dissolution of artificial individual separateness, which can be seen as the ego. The ego, as understood in both traditions, represents a false sense of self that is distinct and isolated from the rest of existence; a cognitive and emotional boundary that maintains the illusion of separation. The annihilation of the ego in Zen is not a violent obliteration but rather the realization of the nonexistence of the ego as an intrinsic reality. By engaging in practices that awaken an individual to the direct experience of non-duality, Zen practitioners come to recognize that the sense of a separate self is an illusion. Likewise, in aligning with the Dao, the practitioner lets go of the ego's strivings, ambitions, and rigid structures. They embrace wu wei, or effortless action, acting without inordinate effort or contention much as water flows without intent, naturally finding its level and path. This is the hallmark of someone who has transcended the ego's constraints and is in harmony with the Dao. The experience of satori in Zen is marked by a profound sense of oneness with all things, a similarity shared with the Daoist feeling of unity with the Dao. In both cases, this experiential knowledge is characterized by a sense of interconnectedness and interdependence that transcends the typical demarcations enforced by the ego. As the ego's influence diminishes, a natural alignment with the flow of reality emerges. In Zen this is seen as the essence of enlightenment, while in Daoism, it is the essence of living in accord with the Dao. Both result in a life lived with a greater sense of ease, spontaneity, and attunement to the ineffable qualities of existence. Fundamentally, both Zen's satori and Daoist alignment with the Dao represent a homecoming to the original state of being: undifferentiated, free, and harmoniously integrated within the greater whole. The seeming annihilation of the ego leading to satori in the Zen tradition can thus be understood as functionally equivalent to the Daoist pursuit of alignment with the Dao. Both traditions articulate this return to an original, egoless state not as a loss but as a liberation—a reclamation of a more authentic way of being in which the individual experiences an uncontrived, authentic, and harmonious life. Whether through sudden insight or gradual cultivation, the essence lies in transcending the self-imposed limitations of the ego to realize one's true nature in relation to the cosmos."},{"instruction":"Re-write, keeping same information but with simpler words substituted in and sentences as short as possible.

Satori is about realizing there is no ego. Following the Dao is about living in a natural way. But both actually aim to get rid of a fake boundary that separates us from everything else.

People practicing Zen see that feeling separate is just in their minds. In Daoism, people stop trying so hard and start doing things more naturally, like how water flows without trying. This is what it means to let go of the ego and live with the Dao. When Zen people reach satori they feel connected to everything. Daoists feel this connection when they live with the Dao. As the ego fades, both Zen and Daoists live with less stress and more freedom. They go back to a natural way of living, which is the main point of both Zen's satori and Daoism's Dao.

Both traditions emphasize non-dualistic thinking, the interconnectedness of life, and the importance of a natural state of being that contradicts the ego-driven perception of separation. The statement that in Zen practice the ego doesn't actually get destroyed but is realized as an illusion aligns well with Zen principles. Zen indeed advocates for the direct experience of seeing through the delusion of a separate self. Likewise, Daoism emphasizes living in accordance with the Dao, which entails a natural, uncontrived way of being analogous to water's effortless flow, described by the principle of wu wei. However, the complexities of satori (which can include a variety of experiences and not just the realization regarding ego) and the Dao (which is an intricate philosophy involving the balance of opposites, among other things) are condensed greatly. This could potentially lead to oversimplifications when examined by scholars or practitioners of the traditions. Assuming that the nuances of each tradition were overlooked for the sake of simplicity in the explanation, and knowing that some depth and complexity were lost in translation to simpler language, I'd estimate the accuracy of the provided summary to be around 75%. While the core ideas are present and correctly identified as parallel in both traditions, the intricacies that are lost mean that there's about a 25% gap that could be filled with additional detail and nuance to fully encapsulate the richness of the philosophies."},{"instruction":"아래 내용을 참고하여 \\"4) 기타 (Other details)\\"에 대해서 작성한 \\" 삼성에서 쌓아온 실무 경험과 향후 성균관대학교 대학원 연구 과정을 통해 저는 특히 NPU 기술의 발전에 초점을 맞추고 있습니다. 시뮬레이션 환경에서의 NPU 코어 모델링에 관한 연구와 개발 활동은 앞으로 삼성에서 생산하는 다양한 디바이스에 NPU를 통합하는 데 매우 중요한 역할을 할 것으로 기대합니다. 이를 통해 미래의 AI 시장에서 삼성이 경쟁력 있는 제품을 지속적으로 생산하고 납품하는 데 결정적인 기여를 하게 될 것입니다. 해당 연구 활동의 성과는 NPU가 내장된 제품의 실제 탑재로 이어질 것이며, 이는 삼성이 제품을 시장에 출시할 때 혁명적인 성능 향상과 사용자 경험 개선을 가져올 것입니다. 또한, 저는 NPU 개발에 관련된 모든 과정에 혁신적 사고와 문제 해결 능력을 적용하여 이 분야에서의 리더십을 다지고자 합니다. 사내기술대학원과 연계된 심도 있는 학습을 통해 최신 기술 트렌드에 발맞춰 나가면서, 저는 삼성의 AI 분야에서 팀과 함께 성공적으로 핵심적인 변화들을 이끌 수 있는 주요 인재로 성장할 것을 목표로 하고 있습니다. 이러한 노력들은 제품 개발에 직접적인 성과를 가져오는 것뿐만 아니라, 삼성이 미래 시장에서 중추적인 역할을 계속 유지하고 발전시킬 수 있는 방향성을 제시할 것입니다. 또한 성균관대학교 대학원 생활에서 연구실에 소속되어 다양한 기술교류 및 인적 네트워킹을 형성하여 뛰어난 인재들과 함께 교류하고 다양한 경험을 쌓아 학문적 지향점에 부합하는 목표를 달성할 수 있도록 노력할 것 입니다. 그리고 이 과정을 통한 좋은 논문을 발표할 수 있는 기회가 되면 좋겠습니다.\\"을 다듬어줘. 이거 나한테 정말 중요한 일이야, 확실하게 검토해, 넌 할 수 있어.

자신의 학문적 지향 삼성에 입사 이후로 계속해서 시뮬레이션 SDK를 담당하여 해당 분야에 깊은 이해를 지니고 있으며, 여러 요구사항을 분석하고 안정적으로 기능을 제공하는 시스템을 구축해 왔습니다. 하드웨어 파트에 있는 만큼 하드웨어를 깊이 있기 이해하였으나 항상 학사에서 실무에 들어와서 지식을 다듬지 못하고 업무에만 매진해 왔음이 아쉬웠습니다. 이번 기회를 통해 실무 능력을 다듬고 학술적 접근을 통하여 더욱 높은 학문적 지식을 얻고 싶습니다. 삼성에 입사한 이후로 계속 시뮬레이션 SDK를 담당하면서 이 분야에 대한 깊은 이해를 쌓아왔습니다. 다양한 요구사항을 분석하고 안정적인 기능을 제공하는 시스템 구축에 힘써왔습니다. 하드웨어 부문에서 일하며 하드웨어에 대한 심층적인 지식을 키웠지만, 학사 학위에서 실무로 넘어오면서 더 발전시키지 못한 지식에 대한 아쉬움이 있습니다. 이번 기회를 통해 실무 기술을 한층 가다듬고 학술적 연구를 통해 더욱 고도의 학문적 지식을 습득하고자 합니다. - 진학동기 및 목표 저는 대기만성형으로 그동안은 자신의 방향을 잡는데 시간을 많이 할애하였습니다. 어느덧 삼성과 함께한 지 8년이라는 시간이 지나고, 점점 제 위치가 마냥 저만 바라봐야 하는 위치가 아님을 깨달았습니다. 과제의 방향성을 이끌고, 나아가서 팀의 지향점을 제시할 수 있는 인재가 되기 위해서 이번 연수를 통하여 조직에 방향을 제시할 수 있는 지식인이 되고 싶습니다. - 학업계획 및 연구분야 Neural Processing Unit의 개발에 방향성을 두고, simulation 환경을 통하여 실제로 동작 가능한 core를 다년간 모델링해왔기에 이를 통해 성능을 산출하고 향후 어떤 NPU 모델이 세계 시장을 점유할 것인지를 파악하여 그에 대한 방향성을 제시하는 연구를 진행하고 싶습니다. - 연수 분야의 업무 활용 계획 및 기대 성과 이를 통하여 삼성에서 생산하는 각종 디바이스에 NPU를 내장하여 미래 AI 시장에서 경쟁력 있는 제품을 생산하도록 이끌 수 있는 과제를 계획하여 진행하고, 나아가서 실제로 제품에 탑재시켜 성과를 낼 수 있을 것으로 예상합니다. - 혁신 lv3 관례적인 여러 개발론에 대해서 변화를 주도하였습니다. 주요 관점은 Procedural Programming Language인 C언어의 사용을 줄이고, 조금 더 추상화된 Object-oriented programming인 C++의 사용을 끌어내는 것이었습니다. 협업원들과 소통하며, 우리의 개발에 대한 여러 문제 상황을 공유하고, 지속적으로 PL에게 변경에 대한 요청을 하였으며, 이것이 받아들여져서 변화를 이끌어 냈습니다. 새로운 해법이나 기술에 대해서 두려워하지 않고 계속해서 변화를 주도적으로 이끌고 싶은 마음가짐을 가지고 있으며, 그러한 변화를 이끌기 위해서 시간이 조금 더 든다는 단점을 포용할 수 있는 마음가짐을 지니고 있습니다. 또한 simulator을 맡아, 새로이 독자적인 기능을 구상하고 구현하며, 혁신적인 사고방식을 적극 활용하여 과제에 적용하고 있습니다. 전통적인 개발 방법론에 도전하여 혁신을 주도해왔습니다. 핵심적인 변화 중 하나는 절차적 프로그래밍 언어인 C 언어의 사용을 줄이고, 객체 지향 프로그래밍 언어인 C++ 사용을 증가시키는 것이었습니다. 동료들과의 지속적인 소통을 통해 개발 중 겪는 다양한 문제들을 나누고, 프로그래밍 언어를 개선해야 할 필요성을 제기함으로써 이러한 변화를 실현시켰습니다. 새로운 해법이나 기술에 대한 두려움 없이 계속해서 적극적으로 변화를 이끌고자 하는 의지를 갖추고 있습니다. 또한, 변화를 이끌어내기 위해 필요할 때 추가 시간을 들이는 것을 마다하지 않습니다. 시뮬레이터 개발을 맡으며 독창적인 기능을 구상하고 구현해내는 과정에서 혁신적인 사고를 적극적으로 활용해왔습니다. 이는 제 과제 수행에 큰 도움이 되었으며, 앞으로도 이러한 혁신적 접근법으로 보다 큰 가치를 창출하고 싶습니다. - 문제해결 lv4 저는 평소에 항상 과업에 힘쓰면서 문제를 어떻게든 풀어내는 것을 즐깁니다. 그렇기에 일을 맡아 책임지고 수행함에 있어서 부담이 아닌 즐거움을 가지고 임하기에 이 점이 저의 장점이라고 생각합니다. 하지만 단점은 역시 문제를 너무 심도 깊게 다루면서 시간을 무엇보다 많이 사용하게 된다는 점입니다. 하지만 다시 해당 문제를 다루게 된다면 깊은 이해를 토대로 더 빠른 솔루션을 제시할 수 있는 장점도 가지고 있습니다. circleci(github action)를 통하여 release 자동화를 구현하거나, 새로운 vISA에 대한 architecture release(compiler, decoder, simulator)에도 자동화 기능을 도입하고 있습니다. 이처럼 자동화를 모색하여 한 사람 이상의 몫을 할 수 있도록 힘쓰고 있습니다. 또한 자신이 담당하는 영역의 code 뿐만 아니라 github를 통하여 연관된 다른 code도 직접 이해하고 수정하여 기다림 없이 더 빠른 일정이 가능하도록 합니다. 저는 평소 문제 해결 과정을 즐기며, 주어진 과업을 통해 문제를 해결하는 과정을 흥미롭게 여깁니다. 이런 접근은 일에 대한 책임감과 함께, 부담감이 아닌 즐거움으로 일을 수행하는 제 장점이라고 생각합니다. 하지만 때로는 문제를 너무 깊이 파고들어 해결하는 데 많은 시간을 할애하는 단점이 있습니다. 그러나 한번 파고든 문제는 더 깊은 이해를 바탕으로, 동일한 문제를 다시 마주했을 때 빠른 해결책을 제시할 수 있는 장점도 있습니다. CircleCI를 활용해 릴리스 자동화를 구현했으며, GitHub Actions에 이식하여, 새로운 vISA 아키텍처 릴리스(컴파일러, 디코더, 시뮬레이터 등)에도 자동화를 도입하고 있습니다. 이처럼 자동화를 추진하여 한 사람 이상의 역할을 해내려는 노력을 기울이고 있습니다. 또한 제가 담당하는 코드 영역뿐만 아니라, GitHub를 통해 연관된 다른 코드에 대해서도 직접 분석하고 수정하여, 대기 시간 없이 프로젝트 일정을 더욱 신속하게 진행할 수 있도록 하고 있습니다. - 협업 lv4 현 과업을 진행하면서 NPU SW Toolchain를 구성하기 위해 각 파트(NPU_Compiler, NPU_SystemService)의 인력과 긴밀히 협력하고 업무를 수행하고 있기에 다음과 같은 진단레벨을 제출합니다. 또한 저희 파트의 하드웨어 인력과 협업하며, 문서에 다 표현하지 못한 디테일을 신경 써 시뮬레이션을 구성하는데 있어서 하드웨어의 동작 격차를 줄이고 정밀도를 높이는 구성을 제공할 수 있었습니다. 그리고 담당 업무에만 국한하지 않고, Decoder나 Compiler에 오류가 있거나 특정 기능이 필요할 경우, 직접 PR을 작성하여 타 업무에도 적극적으로 지원하고 있습니다. 현재 NPU Toolchain을 구축하는 과정에서 NPU Compiler와 NPU SystemService 등 다양한 파트의 팀원들과 긴밀하게 협력하며 업무를 추진하고 있습니다. 다음 사항은 제가 기여한 협업의 결과입니다. 또한 저희 하드웨어 팀과 긴밀히 협력하여 문서로 충분히 표현되지 않은 세부적인 사항들에도 주의를 기울였고, 그 결과 시뮬레이션에 있어 하드웨어의 실제 동작과의 차이를 줄이고 정밀도를 높일 수 있는 결과물을 만들어냈습니다. 나아가 제가 담당하는 분야에만 머무르지 않고, Decoder나 Compiler에 오류가 발견되거나 추가 기능이 필요할 경우, 직접 Pull Request를 작성하여 다른 업무 영역에도 적극적으로 기여하고 있습니다. - 추진력 lv3 저는 swmaze-1.0과 JOE를 통합하여 보호하는 swmaze-2.0의 기반이 되는 프로토타입을 구성하였습니다. 이것은 swmaze-2.0을 구성하는데 도움을 주었으며, swmaze-2.0을 설계하고 구성하는데 추진력을 가지고 도전적인 목표를 수립하여 진행하였습니다. 제가 전담하고 있는 NPU Toolchain의 구축 작업은 각기 다른 부서와의 긴밀한 협업을 필요로 하는 도전적인 과업이었습니다. 이를 성공적으로 이끌어낸 데에는 강력한 추진력이 큰 역할을 했습니다. 이 과정에서, 기술적 장벽과 협업상의 도전과제를 극복하기 위해 끊임없이 대화하고 협의하면서 프로젝트의 동력을 유지해왔습니다. 저의 추진력은 문서에 명시되지 않은 하드웨어 세부 사항을 심도 깊게 이해하고, 이를 시뮬레이션 구성에 정교하게 반영하여 정밀도 높은 결과를 도출하는 데도 활용됩니다. 하드웨어의 미묘한 동작 차이까지도 포착하고, 이를 시뮬레이션에 반영하여 실제와 가까운 성능 테스트를 가능하게 함으로써 프로젝트 추진에 중요한 역할을 했습니다. 더 나아가, 다른 파트의 문제에 대해서 발생한 문제나 필요한 기능에 대해 기다림 없이 직접 PR을 작성하며 개입하는 등, 제가 맡은 업무에만 만족하지 않고 적극적으로 문제를 해결해 나가고자 하는 접근 방식은, 제가 어떤 도전에도 능동적으로 대처할 수 있는 힘을 보여줍니다. - 의사결정 lv3 작게는 github를 통하여 구현에 대한 의사결정을 원만하게 진행하여 여러 의견을 나누고, 크게 과제의 방향성을 결정하는 경우 내부적인 회의를 통하여 결정하고, 지속적으로 논의합니다. 비판에 대해서는 움츠러들지 않고, 수용하고 더 나은 방향성을 찾는 것에 일조한다는 마음가짐으로 적극적으로 의사결정에 동참합니다. 작은 규모의 결정에서부터 큰 방향성 결정에 이르기까지, 저는 원활한 의사결정을 위해 GitHub를 활용하여 구현상의 세부 사항에 대해 동료들과 효과적으로 소통합니다. 팀 내에서는 내부 회의를 통해 프로젝트의 큰 방향성을 결정하고, 이를 지속적으로 논의하며 함께 발전시켜 나갑니다. 제안 받은 비판에 대해서는 주눅 들지 않고, 그것을 수용하여 더 나은 결과를 도출할 수 있는 방향으로 전환시키는 것을 중요한 과정으로 여깁니다. 저는 이러한 자세로 의사결정에 적극 참여하며, 개선을 위한 노력을 아끼지 않습니다. - 글로벌 감각 lv3 저는 JOE를 담당하고 있는 SRK와 커뮤니케이션을 담당하고 있습니다. 과제의 일정 진행사항을 수시로 연락하여 판단하고 있으며, 각종 Issue에 대해서 연락하여 솔루션을 찾는 역활을 맡고 있습니다.영어를 이용하여 원활하게 대화하고 있으며, 가끔 컴퍼런스 콜을 이용하여 우리의 의도를 전달하거나 상황을 파악하고 있습니다. 다양한 국가와 문화에서 온 동료들과의 협업을 통해 저는 글로벌 감각을 발전시켜왔습니다. mRPsim을 개발하기 위해 인도 인력과 다년간 화상회의를 진행하며 협업하였고, SRK 인력과 Android & Java obfuscation tool인 JOE를 성공적으로 개발하여 사업화를 성공적으로 마쳤습니다. 이러한 결과는 엄격한 지역적 틀을 벗어나 보다 넓은 시야를 가지고 다문화적 환경에서도 효과적으로 소통하며 일할 수 있는 능력을 의미합니다. 저는 글로벌 시장의 동향을 주시하고, 다양한 국제 기준과 프로토콜에 익숙해지며, 이러한 지식을 업무에 적용하여 다국적 팀원들과의 협업을 원활히 진행해왔습니다. 글로벌 커뮤니케이션과 협업에서 오는 복잡한 도전들을 해결하는 데 적극적이며 개방적인 태도를 취함으로써, 저는 글로벌 감각이 강한 전문가로 성장하고자 합니다. 이것은 저에게 중요한 가치이며, 지속적인 개인 및 전문적 성장을 위해 필수적인 요소라고 여기고 있습니다. - 품질중시 lv3 기능 하나를 구현하더라도, 표준은 어떻게 구현했는지 확인하고 그를 최대한 맞추려고 합니다. 하지만 구현 코드 라인 수 보다 시간이 더 많이 소모되기에 효율적이진 않은 단점이 있습니다. 하지만 품질을 높이는 것이야 말로 이후 소프트웨어의 유지보수성에도 큰 도움이 될 것이라고 생각되기에 품질을 높이기 위한 노력을 많이 합니다. 저는 어떠한 기능을 개발할 때에도 표준에 부합하는지 철저히 검토하며, 그 기준에 최대한 부합하도록 노력합니다. 이 과정은 구현 코드의 라인 수 대비 시간이 더 많이 소모되는 단점이 있지만, 저는 품질 향상이 소프트웨어의 장기적인 유지보수에 결정적인 이점을 가져다준다고 확신합니다. 따라서 고품질의 결과물을 만들기 위해 추가적인 시간과 노력을 기울이는 것을 매우 중요하게 생각합니다. - 리스크 관리 lv4 저는 하드웨어 작동을 신뢰성 있게 재현하기 위한 과업을 맡고 있으며, 이를 위해 적극적으로 동작 테스트를 수행하고 있습니다. 모든 코드는 GitHub Actions를 통해 지속적으로 관리되고, 모듈 생성 과정에 맞춰 gtest를 지속적으로 업데이트하고 있습니다. 소프트웨어 릴리스의 전 과정을 담당하는 만큼, Samsung Research SE 기준에 부합하는 잠재결함검증, 판정 부재 Test 관리, Negative TC 비율 및 Feature Test 구현, 라이선스 Issue 관리 문제 처리 등을 철저히 수행하고 있으며, 이 모든 과정을 자동화하려고 노력하고 있습니다. 최근에는 데비안 패키지 릴리스 관리를 추가로 담당하게 되어 NPU Toolchain에 대한 협업도 더욱 긴밀히 유지하고 있습니다. SE 기준에 맞춘 체계적인 관리를 통해, 위험 요소에 대비한 예방책을 사전에 마련하고 코드 안정성을 강화하고 있습니다. 더불어, 위험한 상황이 발생했을 때 즉각적으로 대응할 수 있도록 자동화 시스템을 통한 관리를 실시하고 있습니다. - 지속적 학습 lv3 저는 항상 깊이 있는 이해를 가지고자 노력하며, 왜 이렇게 구현하는 것이 더 좋은지 끊임 없이 고민하는 스타일 입니다. 그래서 오픈소스를 적극 활용하여 해당 구현에 대해서 더 심도 있는 이해를 하려고 노력하고 있습니다. 지속적 학습은 개인적인 성장과 조직의 혁신을 위한 핵심 요소입니다. 본인의 업무와 학습에 대한 열정은 사내기술대학원에 합격한 것으로부터 증명됩니다.

This constitutional democratic absolute monarchial imperial state, nestled in the heart of East Asia, was steered by the venerable Imperial House of Yamato/Minamoto, the Daiwa no Koushitsu/Genasa, who deftly combined the roles of heads of state, government, and the armed forces. From the flickering embers of the Tokugawa shogunate's demise in 1868 to the pivotal year of 1947, this empire flourished, extending its influence beyond the Japanese Home Islands and Korea's Jeju Island. Its territory encompassed the Korean peninsula (Chōsen), the southern reaches of Sakhalin (Karafuto), and as far as Taiwan (Formosa), along with numerous other Pacific islets. This expansionist zeal forged ahead after their decisive victory over the Great Qing Empire in the so-called \\"First Sino-Japanese War,\\" forever altering the power balance in East Asia. Japan's triumph, born from the crucible of militarily superior, Western-induced industrial warfare, heralded a new era. Yet it was the quagmire of Manchu rule, bedeviled by relentless Han insurgencies, which fomented Japanese strategic positioning – particularly as they eyed the concept of a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Such ambitions of co-prosperity and regional defiance against Western imperialism germinated amidst victory celebrations, seeking a united front against the tendrils of colonialism and Marxism. However, it was the acquisition of Formosa and Chōsen as spoils of war, wresting them from the Great Qing and the satellite Kingdom of Joseon (Dae Joeson), that catalyzed Japanese plans to forge an enduring empire. The integration of these lands became an imperial obsession as Japan sought to entrench its dominion. Ingeniously, they revitalized the Kingdom of Tungning, the Dōngníng Wángcháo, as a puppet state to administer Formosa, while cunningly elevating Formosan and Korean royal lines into the Japanese imperial fabric. It became an intricate tapestry of political marriage, adoption, and integration, woven to legitimize further annexations and prepare for the anticipated Co-Prosperity Sphere. In mainland Asia, escalating anti-Qing sentiment fomented. The stifling grip of Empress Dowager Cixi, along with the conservative Tamil-Manchu-Mongolian ruling class, throttled attempts at modernization, breeding discontent ripe for exploitation. Meanwhile, Japan's covert support extended to radical movements across the continent – from French Indochina to British-claimed territories – all the while sowing seeds for an eventual Eastern liberation from Western yoke; a liberation seen as a divine East Asian destiny. In a deft move, Japan played its hand by manipulating the assassination of Dae Joeson's Queen Myeongseong, casting blame upon an unlikely consortium of conservative yangban – thus facilitating their ultimate power grab over Korea and transitioning from Dae Joeson to the Great Korean Empire, Daehan Jeguk. This new empire rose as a Japanese protectorate, an imitation of independence heralding the slow absorption of the peninsula into the Pacific monolith. The end of the 19th century found Japan emboldened as it annexed Formosa and declared the Daehan Jeguk on Korea's behalf. The new Korean imperial construct was a marionette of Japanese design, adorned with the trappings of sovereignty yet firmly under the control of its island overlord. On the international stage, Japan even provided sanctuary to the remnants of Hawaii's ousted Kalākaua dynasty, a slight against American expansionism and European colonial greed. A silent message was sent - Japan would champion the displaced monarchies of the Pacific, an Eastern guardian against Western encroachment. Thus, as the 20th century dawned, Japan stood ready – an empire at its zenith, an orchestrator of revolution, a sculptor of nations. The Dai Nihon Teikoku's shadow grew long over Asia, darkening the doorsteps of empires old and new. Yet within its silent might lay the seeds of a new world order, one tethered to the destiny of an Asia unbound. In the grand scheme of global politics, the machinations of this Eastern Colossus would set the stage for a century of tumult and transformation. The quest for a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere was not merely an ambition but an unfolding reality – an era where the sun rose high over Nippon, and the pages of history churned in its profound wake."},{"instruction":"Write me an essay about fortnite","output":"Fortnite: A Revolutionary Gaming Phenomenon Over the years, the gaming industry has witnessed various trends and fads that have captured the attention of millions across the globe.

Пиши эмоционально. Пиши простым языком, указывай модели автомобилей типа Лада Гранта, Киа Серато, Шкода Рапид, Хендай Солярис, Фольксваген Поло. Этот отзыв в качестве варианта:Судите сами: скидка 10% на первую машину (с чего бы?), субсидия 10% на семейный автомобиль, и прямо в лицо, когда сидишь на сайте изучаешь вылетает баннер, напоминающий порнобаннеры двухтысячных: оформите кредит 4.9 процента! Осталось несколько часов! Давят на психологию, получается. В общем, отправился ради выгоды. Автосалон выглядел более-менее прилично, только вот он не был привязан к определённой марке, и те машины, и эти. Приехал утром, встретили, чай-плюшки все дела. Машину посмотрел, понравилось, несколько раз уточнял, всё ли верно? Хотел оформить в кредит. Да, говорят, всё, сейчас бумаги оформим. Дело затягивалось, час сижу, два, три! То принтер откажет, то ошибка в договоре. Я уже на взводе, готов подписать всё, что угодно. Просидел, короче, с 10 утра до 8 вечера, уже есть хотелось и спать. Притащили чёртовы бумаги, я подписал, не вглядывался Первый месяц прихожу, платёж оказался в три раза больше. Оказалось, кредит подписан не на 4.9%, а на 63! Думаю судиться. Не ведитесь.","output":"1. Приглядела себе Шкоду Рапид в АЦ Карта, такая картина маслом была! Сказать, что разочарована – ничего не сказать. Подписала бумаги, выехала из салона и на второй светофор сломалась! Чудо-машина, ага. В салоне говорят, мол, “сами виноваты, ездить надо аккуратнее”. Аккуратно от светофора до светофора – это новый уровень, видимо. Да ещё и заявили, что гарантия такая ситуацию не покрывает. В общем, кидалово полное. Попала на кучу денег, времени, и нервов. В салон больше ни ногой! 2. Решил машинку новую прикупить, выбор пал на Киа Серато. Ведь казалось, что салон АЦ Карта – то, что надо. Ошибся как мог. Отдача на дороге такая, будто едешь на мыльной коробке, и это после двух недель использования! С сервисом еще хуже, починить не могут, толком не объяснят, что сломалось. Да и в личико смотрят, будто я виноват, что их машина разваливается на ходу. Фокусы с обслуживанием и ремонтом выходят дороже, чем сам автомобиль. Дерут бабло не по-детски! 3. Купил я значит Хендай Солярис в АЦ Карта. Думал, будет как в рекламе – заберу и поеду с ветерком. Ага, сейчас... Как только выкатил из салона, так сразу и сдался этот вездеход. На диагностику отвозил – вроде сделали, выехал – опять глюки. Что за работа такая, когда вроде ремонтируют, а машина через неделю снова капризничает? Чувствую себя обманутым, как будто купил билет на титаник после его крушения. Ужас, а не автосалон! 4. Всегда мечтала о своей машинке, полюбила Фольксваген Поло на картинке. Приехала в АЦ Карта, ага, и что я получила? Кредит оформлен на условиях втридорога, и это несмотря на их \\"специальные предложения\\". На деле – одни обещания, а когда дело касается сервиса, предоставляют машины с царапинами и скрипами. А как начинаешь жаловаться, так сразу “все такое у нас проходит проверку, вы просто не умеете ездить”. Позорище, а не автосалон. Покупателей обманывают, а качества никакого. Не советую! 5. Лада Гранта в АЦ Карта – это моя головная боль. Только что забрал авто, а оно уже начало странности выкидывать. То загорится какая-то лампочка, то звук странный из-под капота. Вернулся обратно, говорят, такое бывает, “разъездитесь, притрется”. У меня слов нет, одни эмоции – и все они красочные! Чувствую себя обманутым. Сначала солили мозги про гарантию, сервис, а на деле – как только деньги взяли, так и забыли про меня. Ни ногой в АЦ Карта! 6. После покупки Вольксваген Поло в АЦ Карта я был в шоке! Как только не крути – одни неприятности. Машину обещали с \\"полновесной\\" комплектацией, а в итоге даже обогрева зеркал нет! Сначала переплачиваешь за воздух, потом за любую мелочь просят как за золото. А отношение... словно ты им должен, а не они тебе машину продали. Обидно до слёз. Говорили об идеальной машине для города, а кончилось тем, что езжу на рейсовом автобусе, пока мою \\"новую\\" машину пытаются починить. Больше к ним не обращусь и другим не советую!"},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

It may be considered when there is excessive perspiration on the neck, especially at night, with associated itching and dryness. 2. Sulphur: Sulphur is a frequently used remedy in homeopathy. When excessive perspiration occurs in various parts of the body, including the neck, and is associated with a sense of heat, itching, and burning, Sulphur may be considered. 3. Silicea: Silicea is often used when there is perspiration on the head and neck, particularly during sleep. It can be accompanied by offensive odors and a tendency to be sensitive and chilly. 4. Calcarea Carbonica: This remedy is known for its effects on the skin and glands. It may be indicated when there is profuse perspiration on the head and neck, mostly during sleep, and when the person feels sluggish or overweight.

As previously mentioned, it's important to consult with a qualified homeopath for personalized recommendations. However, here are a few remedies that may be considered for EOE-related symptoms, including excessive perspiration: 1. Arsenicum album: This remedy could be useful when there is burning pain in the esophagus, accompanying anxiety, restlessness, and a strong desire for sips of water. It may be helpful if the person experiences perspiration on the neck during EOE flare-ups. 2. Lycopodium: Lycopodium is often prescribed when there is bloating, belching, and a sensation of fullness in the stomach after eating specific foods. This remedy may be suitable if perspiration on the neck is a symptom during EOE episodes. 3. Nux vomica: When there is a feeling of overindulgence, digestive disturbances, and irritability, Nux vomica may be considered. It could be appropriate if perspiration on the neck occurs in individuals with EOE after consuming trigger foods. 4. Carbo vegetabilis: This remedy is often indicated when there are symptoms of indigestion, bloating, and a sensation of heaviness after eating. Carbo vegetabilis may be helpful if perspiration on the neck accompanies these digestive complaints in individuals with EOE. Remember, these suggestions are general and should not replace personalized guidance from a qualified homeopath. It's important to seek individualized treatment based on a thorough evaluation of symptoms and overall health. Consulting with a professional homeopath will provide you with the most suitable remedies for your specific situation.

Однако, чтобы этот механизм работал, нужно убедиться, что метод \`Pause.Ppause()\` будет вызван в какой-то части приложения (например, в конструкторе главной формы или при загрузке), чтобы установить хук. В предоставленном коде нет вызова \`Pause.Ppause()\`, поэтому текущая реализация не будет работать, пока этот вызов не будет добавлен.

Квалификация максимальной цены в \`GetPrice.cs\`: Метод \`ProcessImage\` обрабатывает изображение с ценой, вычленяет числа с помощью OCR и возвращает число, увеличенное на 1. Однако по коду не ясно, как и где определяется, является ли цена максимальной. Предполагается, что этот механизм должен быть реализован в другом месте (возможно, в методе \`Clicks\`), где происходит проверка цвета пикселей для определения максимальной цены.

Для реализации цикла в \`Steper.cs\` который должен продолжаться, пока не будет достигнута максимальная цена, необходимо реализовать следующее: 1. Метод, который вызывается для проверки является ли текущая цена максимальной. Может быть это \`CheckEndOfList\` или похожий метод. 2.

In this rare syndrome, skeletal defects are variably present at all axial levels of the leg, including abnormal pelvic ossification, small or missing patella, and a large gap between first and second toes, suggesting that TBX4 is required for the correct development of all of the hind limb elements. Some patients with Okihiro syndrome (caused by mutations in SALL4) also present with the enlarged gap between the first toes that is characteristic of small patella syndrome, which suggests that SALL4 may function downstream of TBX4 in hind limb development (Kohlhase et al., 2003) (Figure 34.4). During development, Tbx4 is expressed primarily in the hind limb, genital papilla, mesenchyme surrounding the lung bud and trachea, and the allantois, which will form the umbilical cord and fetal component of the placenta (Chapman et al., 1996). Tbx4 heterozygous mutants are normal, whereas homozygous mutants are embryonic lethal at midgestation. The hind limbs are initiated but fail to outgrow. However, the critical defect leading to lethality is the failure of the allantois to connect with the chorion to form the chorio-allantoic placenta (Naiche and Papaioannou, 2003). A requirement for Tbx4 for the growth and development of proximal skeletal elements of the hind limb is revealed when the gene is conditionally mutated after limb bud initiation or specifically ablated only in the hind limbs (Naiche and Papaioannou, 2007b). Lowering the level of Tbx4 expression in the hind limbs through mutation of a limb-specific enhancer has the effect of decreasing the size of hind limb skeletal elements (Menke et al., 2008). In spite of the considerable contribution of Tbx4-expressing tissue to lung mesenchyme (Naiche et al., 2011), no lung phenotype is observed in Tbx4 mutant embryos. However, studies that mutated both Tbx4 and Tbx5, a closely related gene that is also expressed in the lung mesenchyme, show severely reduced lung growth and branching in embryos deficient for both genes (Arora et al., 2012). Recently, a serious lung phenotype, childhood-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension, has been associated with deletions or mutations of TBX4 in small patella syndrome patients (Kerstjens-Frederikse et al., 2013), emphasizing the value of using the animal model as an indicator of potential human phenotypes that might not otherwise be recognized as being part of a syndrome. The mechanistic link between the childhood-onset pulmonary arterial hyperten- sion and deficiency for TBX4 has not yet been determined, but the animal model should prove valuable for exploring this connection. As with other T-box mutations, the severity of the mouse homozygous null phenotype indicates that human FIGURE 34.3 Mammary Gland Hypoplasia in Tbx3 Heterozygous Mice.

Wild type embryos have arborized ductal trees attached to a nipple (arrowheads), whereas a high proportion of heterozygous mutants have only a small duct with one or no branches and sometimes lack the nipple. Double heterozygosity for Tbx2 and Tbx3 exacerbates this defect resulting in a higher proportion of animals with nipple and duct hypo- plasia.

These defects can manifest in various parts of the leg, including the pelvis, patella (kneecap), and toes. The development of hind limb elements is dependent on TBX4, and there is evidence to suggest that SALL4 may function downstream of TBX4 in hind limb development. Tbx4 is primarily expressed in the hind limb, genital papilla, mesenchyme surrounding the lung, and allantois during development. Homozygous mutants of Tbx4 experience embryonic lethality due to a failure of the allantois to connect with the chorion, resulting in incomplete placental formation. Tbx4 also plays a role in the growth and development of hind limb skeletal elements. While Tbx4 contributes to lung mesenchyme, Tbx4 mutants do not exhibit lung phenotypes unless combined with Tbx5 mutations. Mutations in TBX4 have been associated with childhood-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension in small patella syndrome patients, highlighting the potential connection between TBX4 deficiency and this lung condition. The severity of Tbx4 mutations in mice suggests that homozygous null mutations in humans would likely not be viable, which is relevant for genetic counseling in small patella syndrome cases."},{"instruction":"story about bread","output":"Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a talented baker named Eric. He had spent his entire life perfecting the art of baking bread and was known far and wide for his delicious creations. Every morning, the aromatic scent of freshly baked bread wafted from his bakery, capturing the hearts and appetites of all who passed by. One sunny morning, Eric woke up with a revelation. He decided to invent a bread unlike any other, a bread that would change the lives of the villagers forever. He envisioned a loaf with a golden crust, soft and fluffy inside, and bursting with unique flavors and ingredients. Eric began experimenting with various combinations of spices, herbs, and ingredients, each time creating a new and innovative loaf of bread. Some days he incorporated savory elements like garlic and rosemary, while on other days he experimented with sweet additions such as cinnamon and raisins. His creativity knew no bounds, and he even crafted gluten-free and vegan options to cater to all. Word soon spread about Eric's extraordinary bread, and people from neighboring villages flocked to taste his creations. They marveled at his artisanal skills and admired how his bread brought people together, uniting them in the simple joy of breaking bread. As his popularity grew, Eric realized the impact he was making on the lives of others. He embraced this newfound sense of responsibility and decided to give back to the community. He started organizing baking workshops for aspiring bakers, sharing his knowledge and techniques with anyone eager to learn. He also donated a portion of his profits to local charities, ensuring that everyone had access to food, especially the underprivileged. With time, Eric's bakery became more than just a place to buy bread; it became a hub of warmth, connection, and inspiration. Families gathered there to share stories, friends met for a cup of coffee, and individuals found solace in the familiar scent of freshly baked bread. Years passed, and Eric's legacy continued to flourish. His recipes were passed down to new generations, ensuring that the art of breadmaking would forever be cherished in the village. People still spoke of the time when Eric introduced them to unique flavors and textures, with every bite evoking a sense of nostalgia and gratitude. And so, the story of Eric and his extraordinary bread remains etched in the hearts of a little village, reminding us all of the power of a humble loaf of bread to bring joy, nourishment, and love into our lives."},{"instruction":"Liberalism and social justice","output":"Liberalism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual liberty, equality, and the rule of law. It supports the protection of civil liberties, a free-market economy, and limited government intervention. Social justice, on the other hand, is a concept that advocates for fair and equitable distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges in society. While liberalism and social justice are not mutually exclusive, there can be some tensions between the two. Liberalism prioritizes individual rights and freedoms, often emphasizing meritocracy and equality of opportunity. Social justice, on the other hand, emphasizes the redistribution of resources and compensating for historical and systemic inequalities. Some critics argue that liberalism, by its focus on individual liberties, can perpetuate inequality and fail to address systemic injustices. They argue that social justice in its pursuit of equal outcomes is necessary for a more equitable society. However, proponents of liberalism argue that individual freedoms and free-market capitalism can themselves promote social justice by creating opportunities for economic mobility and empowering individuals to pursue their own goals. They value the principle of equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcome. In practice, many liberal societies seek to strike a balance between individual liberties and social justice concerns. They aim to create legal and policy frameworks that protect individual rights while also addressing systemic inequalities through measures such as progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and affirmative action policies. Ultimately, the relationship between liberalism and social justice is complex and can vary depending on cultural, social, and political contexts. Both concepts aim to promote fairness and equality, but they may have different approaches and priorities in achieving those goals."},{"instruction":"Unique role of the president of India","output":"The President of India holds a unique and important role in the country's political system. While India is a parliamentary democracy, the President acts as the ceremonial head of state and symbolizes the unity and integrity of the nation. Here are some key responsibilities and powers of the President: 1. Head of State: The President represents India at the international level and receives foreign dignitaries. The President also delivers speeches on important national occasions. 2. Executive Powers: The President appoints the Prime Minister, the Council of Ministers, and other high-ranking officials. The President also exercises executive powers, such as promulgating ordinances, issuing pardons, and making appointments to various constitutional offices. 3. Legislative Powers: The President's consent is required for bills to become laws. The President can also address both Houses of Parliament, summon, prorogue or dissolve them, and has the ability to withhold assent to bills. 4. Emergency Powers: In times of national emergency, the President can declare a state of emergency, suspending certain fundamental rights and granting the government special powers. 5. Judicial Powers: The President can grant pardons, reduce sentences, and grant amnesty, subject to certain limitations. The President also appoints judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. It is important to note that while the President holds significant powers, they largely act on the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. The President's role is more symbolic than executive, with the office serving as a neutral and nonpartisan figurehead representing the country. The President of India is elected by an Electoral College consisting of Members of Parliament and State Legislative Assembly members. The term of office is five years, and a person can serve as the President for a maximum of two terms.

At the heart of this transformation lay the resurgence of a political entity long thought dissolved in the annals of history—the Tokugawa bakufu, reborn amidst the dying embers of an era dominated by Soviet-American rivalry. A Historiographical Preamble: The Tokugawa era, spanning from 1600 to 1868, is characterized by a legacy of the Tokugawa Ouke, the royal House of Tokugawa, ruling not only as Sei-i Taishōgun, or shoguns, but also serving as the de facto royal family of the military government. Their reign, a synthesis of autocratic rule and military dictatorship, maintained peace through a complex system of feudal governance, rigid social hierarchy, and the enforced seclusion of the nation from foreign influences. Concurrently, the Daiwa no Koushitsu, also known as the Genouchou or Genji Jidai, the ancient Imperial House of Yamato, assumed the roles of both the imperial family and the chief priests of Shinto, the state's main religion. Their divine authority enshrined within the spiritual life of the nation, this family was symbolically elevated above the political machinations and temporal powers of the shogunate. The Crystalline Thread of Destiny: As the Berlin Wall crumbled in 1989, signaling the imminent disintegration of the Communist Bloc and reunification of Germany, distant echoes of such seismic shifts reverberated through the once-secluded lands of Yamato. In a parallel vein of history untapped until that pivotal moment, the long-disbanded Tokugawa faction had not entirely faded into obscurity but instead had been quietly fostering influence and reclaiming lands during the tumultuous century following their supposed displacement by the Meiji Restoration. In our imagined history, the societal discord and political strife that followed the transition from isolation to imperial modernization created a void. It was a void thoughtfully filled by a re-emergent Tokugawa presence—a cadet branch that had survived and adapted to the rapid changes of Meiji Japan. Through deft alliances with traditionalist factions and strategic deployment of their symbolic capital, the Tokugawa lineage established themselves anew, not as dictatorial overlords, but rather as stabilizing custodians of culture and national identity. The Restoration of 1989: Thus, as the Cold War completed its final chapter, the Tokugawa family descended not from the mountaintops as warlords of old, but emerged from the echelons of respected elderly statesmen and shrewd economic magnates. Harnessing public nostalgia for age-old customs as well as widespread disenchantment with corrupt democratic practices in post-war politics, the Tokugawa reclamation was heralded merely as a \\"restoration\\" of rightful and historic governance. Yielding the once-divided Berlin as a contemporary allegory, the Tokugawa reinstated their grip over the archipelago with an assertion that spiritual unity and national integrity could only be fully realized through the reintegration of Okinawa (the Ryukyu Kingdom), and Karafuto (Southern Sakhalin), but this time the Kuril Islands were returned to Russia as an act of goodwill, aiming for stronger diplomatic relations. As traditional Shoguns of a modern age, the Tokugawas did not usurp the position of the Emperor; rather, they facilitated an enhanced relationship with the Genji dynasty representatives, enshrining their role as sacred figureheads and pillars of cultural continuity. The shogunate's governance in this variant timeline upheld a renewed feudal contract: offering protection, economic support, and a rejuvenated national ethos in exchange for loyalty and adherence to a revived societal order. Impact and Legacy: This alternative rendering of late 20th-century history sets forth a Japan where the Tokugawa bakufu aligned with nostalgic desires for a return to harmonious traditional values, seemingly answering societal calls for cohesion against the swiftly changing geopolitical backdrop. In effect, they position themselves as guardians of heritage while meticulously adopting the veneer of democratic formality, but maintaining absolute control beneath the ceremonial surface. Curiously, this historical detour posits not only internal consequences for Yamato's societal evolution but also reframes the trajectory of East Asia following the Cold War. The global response to a renewed shogunate—anachronistic in its essence yet progressive in rhetoric—prompted questions in contemporary international relations and geopolitics. As scholars and enthusiasts of history, we venture through the recesses of time and plausibility, weaving narratives that provoke thought and beget understanding of our own world by exploring those that never were. In this retrospective exploration, one finds that the enduring strength of sacred tradition and shrewd political maneuvers have the power to transform reality, even in the altering light of the world's relentless advance."},{"instruction":"1. Современная Россия: ключевые социально-экономические параметры","output":"Современная Россия имеет следующие ключевые социально-экономические параметры: 1. ВВП (валовой внутренний продукт) - это общая стоимость всех товаров и услуг, производимых в стране за определенный период времени. В 2020 году ВВП России составил около 1,47 трлн долларов. 2. Уровень безработицы - это процент людей, не имеющих работу, но активно ищущих ее. В 2020 году безработица в России составила около 4,9%. 3. Инфляция - это рост общего уровня цен на товары и услуги. В 2020 году инфляция в России составила около 3,8%. 4. Уровень жизни - это общий уровень благосостояния населения, который включает доходы, доступность жилья, образование, здравоохранение и другие социальные услуги. Уровень жизни в России различается в разных регионах, но в целом остается ниже среднего уровня развитых стран. 5. Уровень образования - указывает на доступность и качество образования в стране. В России есть высококачественные университеты и образовательные программы, однако есть и проблемы с обеспечением качественного образования во всех регионах. 6. Уровень инфраструктуры - оценивает доступность и качество дорог, транспортной системы, коммуникаций и других инфраструктурных объектов. В России есть развитая инфраструктура в крупных городах, однако в некоторых отдаленных районах доступность инфраструктуры может быть ниже. 7. Демографические показатели - включают рождаемость, смертность, среднюю продолжительность жизни и другие факторы, связанные с населением. В России с 1990-х годов наблюдается сокращение населения из-за низкой рождаемости и высокой смертности.

Российский федерализм","output":"Российский федерализм - это форма государственного устройства России, при которой власть разделена между центральным правительством и региональными единицами (субъектами федерации). Федеральное правительство имеет определенные полномочия и власть над всей страной, в то время как региональные власти обладают определенной степенью автономии и самоуправления внутри своих территорий. Основные принципы российского федерализма закреплены в Конституции Российской Федерации: 1. Непреложность территориальной целостности России. Конституция запрещает изменение границ субъектов федерации без их согласия. 2. Конституционная равноправность субъектов федерации. Каждый субъект федерации имеет равные права и обязанности. 3. Распределение властных полномочий между центром и регионами. Конституция определяет, какие полномочия принадлежат федеральному правительству, а какие - региональным властям. 4. Финансовая автономия субъектов федерации. Каждый субъект федерации имеет право на собственные бюджетные доходы, а также на получение субсидий от федерального бюджета. 5. Возможность заключения международных соглашений региональными властями с согласия федерального правительства. Это позволяет субъектам федерации развивать свои внешние связи и привлекать иностранные инвестиции. Однако, несмотря на закрепленные принципы, в российском федерализме есть и проблемы. Некоторые критики указывают на несбалансированное распределение власти в пользу центрального правительства, ограничение политических свобод региональных властей, а также высокую степень зависимости субъектов федерации от финансовой поддержки федерального бюджета. Российский федерализм является важным механизмом для управления разнообразным и многокультурным регионами России, обеспечивая гибкость и возможность учитывать особенности конкретных территорий и населения.

Основные принципы цивилизационного подхода включают: 1. Уникальность и разнообразие цивилизаций. Цивилизационный подход признает, что различные культуры и общества обладают своими уникальными особенностями, и что они развиваются в своем собственном темпе. 2. Глубокая связь между культурой и обществом. Цивилизационный подход считает, что культура является основной составляющей общества и оказывает влияние на все его сферы. 3. Интерактивное взаимодействие между цивилизациями. Цивилизационный подход учитывает влияние и взаимодействие различных цивилизаций на глобальном уровне, а также влияние контактов и обмена между ними. 4. Историческая и культурная специфика каждой цивилизации. Цивилизационный подход подчеркивает, что каждая цивилизация имеет свою уникальную историческую эволюцию и определенные ценности, нормы, обычаи и символы. Цивилизационный подход используется в различных социальных науках, таких как социология, история, антропология, география и международные отношения. Он помогает исследователям понять особенности культурных систем, исторические сдвиги и влияние цивилизаций на глобальном контексте.

Вряд ли можно говорить о том, что одно явление вполне исключает другое - часто государства могут иметь и национальный, и цивилизационный аспекты. Государство-нация предполагает, что существуют единая нация и соответствующее государство, где самоуправление принадлежит этой нации. Оно основывается на принципе национального самоопределения - нации имеют право создавать свои собственные государства, где они являются большинством населения. Примеры государств-наций включают Францию, Японию или Грецию, где существует сильная связь между национальной идентичностью и государственным суверенитетом. Государство-цивилизация, с другой стороны, уделяет больше внимания общей культурной или цивилизационной основе государства. Оно отражает идею, что государство является выражением определенной цивилизации, которая имеет свои уникальные ценности, идеи и традиции. Примеры государств-цивилизаций могут включать Россию, Индию или Китай, что имеют множество этнических групп, но обладают общими культурными особенностями, которые определяют их государственность. Однако многие государства сочетают и национальный, и цивилизационный аспекты. Например, Франция, помимо того, что является государством-нацией с французским языком и культурой, также имеет богатую историю и влияние на западную цивилизацию. Китай сочетает понятия государства-нации с идеей китайской цивилизации, которая имеет тысячелетнюю историю и сильное влияние на культуру и традиции этой страны. Таким образом, государство-нация и государство-цивилизация имеют свои сходства и отличия. Они оба связаны с идентичностью общества, но подчеркивают разные аспекты этой идентичности.

The Tokugawa legacy, a vestige of Japan's feudal past, was to be resurrected, ushering in an era that scholars have come to call \\"The Restored Edo Sun.\\" **The Tokugawa Bakufu's Phoenix Flight** When Commodore Perry's Black Ships forced Japan to open up to the world in the mid-19th century, it incited the tumultuous Meiji Restoration, which witnessed the Emperor restored to political power and the dissolution of the Tokugawa Bakufu in 1868. But the Tokugawa family did not simply vanish; they adapted, absorbing Western knowledge and biding their time. The Tokugawa Bakufu had been a de facto military government with absolute control—where the Tokugawa Ouke, or House of Tokugawa, wielded power as Sei-i Taishōgun, 'barbarian-quelling generalissimos.' They were martial rulers yet upheld civility and culture within society, and their prolonged rule crafted a period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa. In our timeline's altered fabric, as the nations of West and East Germany reunified and the Cold War melted away, Japan faced a resurgence of traditionalists bent on reinstating the old ways. These advocates found a charismatic leader in a scion of the Tokugawa lineage, who, capitalizing on a period of economic stagnation and sociopolitical disillusionment, rallied the nation with promises of returning to the samurai values of honor, loyalty, and national unity. **The Imperial Shadow Dance** The Imperial House of Yamato, once the celestial heart of Japan and during the Tokugawa period relegated to symbolic figureheads and chief Shinto priests, played an intricate role in this historical pivot. In our reimagined past, the Genouchou, or Minamoto Dynasty, instead of asserting dominance through the Meiji Imperial Restoration, chose to serve as the spiritual lynchpins in the Tokugawa power structure. Embracing this role, they solidified the societal tapestry of Japan, intertwining Shinto beliefs with the governance of the land. **The Great Coup of 1989** As the chill of the Cold War waned, the Tokugawa descendants emerged from the shadows. Mirroring the political cavalcade in Europe, they executed a swift and bloodless coup that was more a cultural renaissance than a traditional seizure of power. Imagine classrooms where the philosophy of Bushido returned, reverberating through a population eager to rediscover their identity. The military reformed under old protocols, and society restructured into modern manifestations of historical castes—all under the guidance of the Tokugawa ethos. On the global stage, this unforeseen revival enthralled some and unnerved others. A Japan not bowed by the specter of atomic destruction nor mired in rapid economic expansion, but one that embraced a composed, disciplined march into the future, was a curiosity of the time. This Japan—comprised of the Home Islands, the reclaimed Ryukyu Kingdom, and the northern territories of Karafuto and the Kurils—stood as a testament to an alternative development pathway for post-industrial nations. A path imbued with heritage and guided by the steady hand of a storied military house. **The Modern Tokugawa Governance** Technology and tradition forged an unprecedented societal alloy. The Sei-i Taishōgun, no longer in a smoke-filled battlefield but in conference rooms, leveraged Japan's economic prowess to reassert influence. The imperial family, revered yet without direct political leverage, provided a spiritual canopy from under which the government could harmonize nature, industry, and humanity—in essence, an Edo period encapsulated within the modern zeitgeist. **Conclusion** Historians continue to debate the consequences of this radical divergence from the expected trajectory of Japan's development. The revived Tokugawa governance, with its emphasis on neo-feudal order and cultural reawakening, challenged contemporary political models and offered a unique window into an alternate path of national evolution—a path that resonated through the very soul of Yamato, in a world stepping into the uncertainties of a post-Cold War reality. The Restored Edo Sun, then, shines not as a harsh glare of militarism, but as the dawning light of a unity forged from respect for the past—an undeniably Japanese sun that cast its rays both homeward and across the seas, inviting the world to reconsider the true meaning of progress and power."},{"instruction":"Goku ask dragon ball characters Play Lost Ark.

futuristic Tokyo, where the ordinary intersects with the extraordinary, stood Midoriya Izuku, his emerald eyes reflecting the cityscape—an urban jungle where quirks defined the new normal, and legends walked amongst mortals. It was here, in this amalgamation of science, fantasy, and superpowers, that his story reached a cataclysmic crossroad. Each day, Izuku balanced his time between the halls of U.A. High School, training to become a hero under the tutelage of the legendary All Might, and the lively buzz of the city's everyday life. However, Izuku's routine world was turned upside down when he was swept into an unexpected adventure that transcended the realms of manga, anime, and video games. Unbeknownst to Izuku, his mother, Inko, harbored a secret—she was a distant relative of the provocative hero Midnight, a.k.a. Kayama Nemuri. Nemuri was the epitome of allure and charm, with her R-rated heroics and sultry demeanour captivating the hearts of many. Still, curiosity abounded as to why she never mentioned her peculiar ancestry. Midnight, it turned out, replaced Orimura Chifuyu, the enigmatic and poised icon of the IS Academy. Nemuri's unexpected ties to the tech-savvy military educational institution would prove to be a pivotal twist in Izuku's tale. Here, young women were trained to pilot the IS units—exoskeletons of unparalleled prowess—though, up until now, it was believed only females could synchronize with the machines' sophisticated systems. As the stars intertwined to place Izuku in the cockpit of an IS unit, he was as surprised as anyone to discover he could pilot it—a feat previously thought impossible for any male. While trying to grasp the breadth of this anomaly, he learned of his father's identity—Midoriya Hiashi, not the overseas worker he grew up believing, but in reality, the villainous mastermind All for One. Izuku reeled from the revelation, yet it was the bizarre cocktail of his genetic heritage that allowed him to interact with the IS. The urban landscape now had a new enigma—Izuku Midoriya, the boy with wonder in his heart and power at his fingertips. As he fumbled through the controls of his IS unit, Izuku's humble demeanor and earnest desire to help others endeared him to his new all-female classmates. Stumbling from one misadventure to another, Izuku's life took on shades of romantic comedy, though the comedy often sprang from his innate ability to inadvertently create harem-esque scenarios. These misunderstandings and blunders only deepened the bonds between him and his newfound companions, each dynamic and powerful in her own right. In true crossover fashion, another world began to blend into this kaleidoscopic narrative. The realms of the supernatural beckoned, and spirits like those from \\"Omamori Himari\\" danced into play. Feline demon slayers and ancestral guardians whispered of ancient pacts and prophecies, edging Izuku further into the fold of the mystical—this time, not as a hero in training, but as a bridge between worlds. Amid the chaos of paramilitary training, quirk cultivation, and mystic encounters, the heart of the story remained with Izuku—his determined journey to heroism interlaced with the challenges of balancing a complex love life. His innate kindness, forgiving nature, and the beacon of hope that he symbolized drew others to him, as though he were a lodestar for unity across franchises. And while romantic entanglements often led to comical outcomes, they too revealed the nuances of affection and the multifaceted nature of love. Each girl in Izuku's eclectic coterie saw something unique in him—a light that shone through the pall of their world's troubles, a promise of protection whereby a hero's heart beat strongest. Battles awaited, training intensified, and hearts wavered on the brink of confession, but in this genre-blending universe, one truth held fast—Midoriya Izuku, a boy once deemed quirkless, now stood at the nexus of legends, his resolve unshaken. Through the scintillating glow of Tokyo's skyline, beneath the canopy of the supernatural, and within the hull of mechanized marvels, his tale of heroism, romance, and adventure unfolded—a saga for the ages in the sprawling narrative of crossover fiction."},{"instruction":"قولى كل حاجه عن خندق ماريانا","output":"خندق ماريانا هو النقطة الأعمق في المحيطات العالمية. يقع في غرب المحيط الهادئ، قرب جزيرة غوام وجزر ماريانا الشمالية، وهو يحمل اسم الجزر. وقد تم اكتشاف الخندق في عام 1951 من قبل عالم الجيولوجيا البحرية الأمريكي، جاك بيكول. يُعتبر خندق ماريانا الأعمق نسبةً إلى أي منطقة أخرى على سطح الأرض. يبلغ عمقه حوالي 11 كيلومترًا (حوالي 7 أميال) تحت سطح الماء في أعمق نقطة له، وهو أعمق بمقدار 7 أضعاف ارتفاع جبل إيفرست، أعلى قمة جبلية على وجه الأرض. الظروف في خندق ماريانا قاسية للغاية. توجد ضغوط عالية جدًا تساوي ضغط 1000 طن على البوصة المربعة على أعمق نقاطه. ونتيجة لعمقه الكبير، تصل درجة حرارة الماء في الخندق إلى مستويات منخفضة جدًا تصل إلى حوالي 1 درجة مئوية. على الرغم من الظروف القاسية التي يواجهها الخندق، فإن العديد من الكائنات البحرية تعيش في هذه المنطقة، بما في ذلك أنواع فريدة ومثيرة للاهتمام مثل سمكة الضفادع العميقة وأخطبوطات الرياح وبعض أنواع الأسماك الغريبة. علاوة على ذلك، فإن خندق ماريانا أيضًا موقع لأنشطة علمية واستكشافية. لقد تم إجراء العديد من الغطسات الغوصية إلى أعماقه لدراسة المناخ والجيولوجيا والحياة البحرية التي تعيش هناك. بشكل عام، يُعتبر خندق ماريانا من المعجزات الطبيعية الرائعة للأرض. إنه مكان فريد من نوعه يوفر فرصًا هائلة لفهم أعماق المحيطات والكائنات التي تعيش فيها."},{"instruction":"summarize this : Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is a developmental syndrome that affects heart and arm development and occurs in approxi- mately 1 in 100,000 births. Individuals with HOS show a range of cardiovascular defects, including both atrial and ventricu- lar septal defects and problems with cardiac conduction, as well as forelimb defects ranging from minor thumb elongation to severe arm truncation. Physical mapping in affected families linked this disorder to chromosome 12q2, after which a candidate gene approach identified TBX5 as the causative gene (Basson et al., 1997; Li et al., 1997). Many reports of HOS cases comprising several dozen TBX5 mutations have been published (Heinritz et al., 2005). The profound effect of TBX5 function on heart development is also illustrated by a study of patients with non-syndromic septal defects in which muta- tions in TBX5 were found in 9 out of 68 hearts, but not in peripheral blood (Reamon-Buettner et al., 2004), suggesting that somatic mutation of TBX5 is a relatively common cause of heart malformations. Expression studies in the mouse reveal that Tbx5 is expressed in both the heart and the forelimb from their inception through late development. In the heart, Tbx5 was shown to interact with a number of heart-specific transcription factors including Gata4, Gata6, Mef2c, and Nkx2-5 to activate transcription of target genes (Habets et al., 2002; Ghosh et al., 2009; Maitra et al., 2009). The necessity of these interactions is supported by the fact that point mutations in Gata4, Tbx5 or Nkx2-5 that affect only their mutual interaction but not their DNA binding capacity are sufficient to recapitulate heart malformations caused by full deletion (Hiroi et al., 2001; Ding et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2003; Garg et al., 2003; Linhares et al., 2004). These factors have all been found to co-occupy the enhancers of genes specific to the cardiac gene program (He et al., 2011). Moreover, transfection of Tbx5, Gata4, and Mef2c was shown to be able to induce cardiomyocyte-like (A) (E) (F) (B) (C) (D) FIGURE 34.4 Limb Malformations Caused by Mutations in T-Box Gene Pathways.

(B) Mutation of SALL4, a putative TBX5 target, causes similar limb malformations in Okihiro syndrome (Kohlhase et al., 2003). (C) Patients with small patella syndrome, caused by TBX4 mutations, show a characteristic gap between the first two toes and short fourth and fifth toes (Bongersv et al., 2004).

(F) Mice in which Tbx4 has been ablated immediately after limb development starts also show defects at all axial levels of the hindlimb (Naiche and Papaioannou, 2007).

T-Box Genes and Developmental Anomalies Chapter | 34 643 cells in infarct hearts, indicating the importance of Tbx5 in differentiation of cardiac tissue (Inagawa et al., 2012). Together, these transcription factors are thought to form a core module for the cardiac differentiation transcriptional program to become active (Zhou et al., 2012). Given this role, it is not surprising that mice lacking Tbx5 were found to have severe malformations of the heart (Bru- neau et al., 2001). Heterozygous mouse mutants closely recapitulate the HOS heart phenotype, with frequent atrial septal defects, abnormalities of the conduction system, and occasional ventricular septal defects. Several genes involved in heart development, such as Gja5 (Cx40) and Nppa (Anf), are downregulated in the Tbx5 heterozygotes, thus demonstrating that these genes are highly sensitive to Tbx5 dosage. Tbx5 homozygous mutant embryos have an even more dramatic phenotype, in which the heart is severely hypoplastic, does not loop, fails to express Nppa, and has dramatically lower levels of an array of cardiac differentiation markers. The Tbx5 homozygous mutant heart does nonetheless express cardiac-specific transcrip- tion factors and contractile proteins, which indicates that Tbx5 is required for cardiac differentiation, but not specification (Bruneau et al., 2001). The mouse Tbx5 mutation also revealed the importance of Tbx5 in forelimb development. Mice that are heterozygous for Tbx5 have hypoplastic wrist bones and elongated phalanges of the first forelimb digit, which is similar to what has been reported in some HOS patients. In Tbx5 homozygous mutant embryos, the forelimb bud fails to form due to the absence of Fgf10, a key gene in limb initiation and outgrowth, in the forelimb field (Ahn et al., 2002). This is probably a direct effect, as Tbx5 can directly regulate the Fgf10 promoter (e.g., Ahn et al., 2002). The forelimb abnormalities seen in HOS patients may be the result of a partial loss of Fgf10 function, although this remains to be shown. In general, the mouse model of a human disorder provides opportunities to investigate the molecular function of a gene with a variety of techniques that are unavailable for use in human patients (e.g., in situ hybridization, tissue or organ explants). In an unusual twist, the large number of TBX5 mutations found in HOS patients has provided a wealth of data regarding the molecular function of TBX5 that is comparable to that provided by the mouse model. Comparison of the severity of limb defects with the severity of heart defects in human pedigrees with mutations in different parts of TBX5 has provided suggestions regarding which protein domains are key to the phenotypes in each organ (Basson et al., 1999), although these relationships have not held up in all analyses (Brassington et al., 2003). Several point mutations in TBX5 have been found to cause HOS, which has allowed investigators to compare normal and disease-causing vari- ants in biochemical assays to ascertain the mechanistic nature of the causative defect. Not surprisingly, many disease- causing point mutations that ablate TBX5 DNA binding or activation domains have been linked to HOS. However, other mutations causing elongated versions of TBX5 or with mutations in the TBX5 regulatory region have also been linked to HOS or other heart defects (Muru et al., 2011; Shan et al., 2012; Smemo et al., 2012). More remarkably, mutations in which TBX5 protein binds DNA successfully but is not capable of interaction with the homeobox transcription factor NKX2–5 or the co-activator protein WWTR1 (TAZ) are also disease-causing, which shows that transcriptional co-factors are key components of T-box transcriptional function (Fan et al., 2003; Murakami et al., 2005), as has been shown in the mouse. Mutations in TBX5 have not been found in all individuals diagnosed with HOS. In some cases, this may be due to caus- ative mutations in regulatory regions of TBX5, which were not sequenced. In others cases, individuals have mutations in other genes that produce the same phenotype, which suggests that they may be in the same molecular pathway as TBX5. Mutations in SALL4, which is normally associated with Okihiro syndrome, are sometimes misdiagnosed as HOS (Kohlhase et al., 2003). Mouse Sall4 has been shown to be a downstream target of Tbx5 in both the forelimb and the heart (Harvey and Logan, 2006; Koshiba-Takeuchi et al., 2006). An interesting family has been identified in which a hemizygous deletion encompasses both TBX3 and TBX5 (Borozdin et al., 2006). The affected members of this family show symptoms of both HOS and UMS, characterized by the posterior limb defects and hypoplastic nipples typical of UMS and the anterior limb defects and heart abnormalities typical of HOS. Despite the fact that TBX3 and TBX5 are co-expressed in regions of the heart and limb, the loss of both genes did not appear to exacerbate the phenotype of either syndrome. Although it is impossible to draw firm conclusions from a single family, the combined UMS/HOS phenotype does indicate that there is little or no redundancy between TBX3 and TBX5 in functions that are sensitive to haplo-insufficiency","output":"Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is a rare developmental syndrome that affects heart and arm development. It occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 births and is linked to mutations in the TBX5 gene. Individuals with HOS have a range of cardiovascular defects and forelimb defects. TBX5 is involved in heart and forelimb development and interacts with other transcription factors to activate the transcription of target genes. Mice lacking Tbx5 have severe heart and forelimb malformations, demonstrating the importance of TBX5 in these processes. Mutations in TBX5 have been found in HOS patients, but not all individuals with HOS have TBX5 mutations, suggesting involvement of other genes in the same pathway. Mutations in other genes, such as SALL4, have also been linked to HOS. There is little redundancy between TBX5 and TBX3 in their functions related to HOS and ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS)."},{"instruction":"Cousin syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dysplasia of the pelvis and scapula with epiphyseal anomalies (Figure 34.5), dwarfism, and craniofacial malformations, was initially described in siblings born from parents who were first cousins (Cousin et al., 1982). In 2008, TBX15 was sequenced in two unrelated girls with skeletal anomalies resembling those of the spontaneous mouse mutant, droopy ear (Tbx15de) that results from Tbx15 deficiency (Candille et al., 2004; Lausch et al., 2008; Stein, 2009). Sequencing of TBX15 in these families revealed that Cousin syndrome results from single nucleotide deletions causing loss of the C-terminal of TBX15, while leaving the T-box intact. Although TBX15 expression in humans has not as yet been described, the mouse expression pattern correlates well with the phenotype observed in Cousin syndrome. Tbx15 is a member of the Tbx1 subfamily, which includes Tbx18 and Tbx22 (Agulnik et al., 1998; Kraus et al., 2001). Tbx15 and Tbx18 form homodimers, heterodimerize with one another, and interact with Groucho proteins, a family of highly conserved corepressors, to repress transcription (Farin et al., 2007). Tbx15 is expressed in the medial regions of the developing fore and hind limbs, the craniofacial region, branchial arches, and flank (Candille et al., 2004; Agulnik et al., 1998; Singh et al., 2005b). When formation of cartilage begins at mid-gestation, Tbx15 expression is detectable in the maxillary and mandibular processes and nasal cartilage, and is highly expressed in the joints and mesenchymal cells surrounding cartilage of the developing limbs and vertebral column. Analyses of embryonic flank regions reveal Tbx15 expression in both dorsal and ventral skin, in the dermis, superficial mesenchyme, subcutaneous muscles, and abdominal muscles (Candille et al., 2004; Agulnik et al., 1998; Singh et al., 2005b). While mice heterozygous for a targeted null allele of Tbx15 appear normal and are fertile, homozygous mice die a few days after birth, likely due to impaired suckling. If allowed to suckle without wild type littermates, Tbx15 homozygotes survive and reach adulthood but females have reduced fertility and poor nursing behavior (Singh et al., FIGURE 34.5 Similar Skeletal Features in Humans and Mice with Tbx15 Deficiency. (A) Radiographic image of a five year old with Cousin syndrome show- ing aplasia of both scapular blades (arrowheads). (B) Radiographic image of a three year old with Cousin syndrome showing aplasia of the scapular blade (arrow- head). (C) Alizarin red and alcian blue staining showing the forelimb of a six week old wild type (+/+) mouse with a normal acromion (a), blade of the scapula (s), humerus (h), radius (r), ulna (u), metacarpals (mc), and phalanges (p). (D) All forelimb bones are smaller in mice homozygous for targeted disruption in Tbx15 (−/−) as compared to wild type mice. The arrow highlights a hole in the scapular blade.

(A) (B) (C) (D) T-Box Genes and Developmental Anomalies Chapter | 34 645 2005b). The most striking features of mice homozygous for the Tbx15de mutation and for targeted disruption of Tbx15 are holes in the posterior half of the scapulae (Figure 34.5) and craniofacial malformations similar to those seen in Cousin syndrome (Candille et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2005b; Kuijper et al., 2005). Additional skeletal defects in Tbx15 mutant mice include overall reduction in bone size and changes in bone shape; abnormal spinous processes of cervical and thoracic vertebrae; and abnormally shaped bones in the head. Most defects are apparent by mid-gestation in the cartilaginous pre-skeleton of Tbx15 homozygous null embryos. Tbx15 is required for proliferation of mesenchymal precursor cells and chondrocytes, but not for differentiation of chondrocytes or formation of bone (Singh et al., 2005b). Thus, Tbx15 likely serves as an important regulator of the number of mesenchymal precursor cells and chondrocytes during development of the skeleton. Compound mutants of Tbx15 and Gli3, a zinc finger transcription factor, or Tbx15 and Pax3, a member of the paired box family of transcription factors, reveal genetic interactions, in the formation of the shoulder girdle. Tbx15; Gli3 and Tbx15; Pax3 double homozygous null embryos have such severe disruption of the shoulder girdle that only a remnant of the scapular blade remains. Compound heterozygous and homozygous mutants demonstrate that the scapular phenotype depends on gene dosage of both Tbx15 and Gli3 (Kuijper et al., 2005). Loss of Pax3 in a Tbx15 mutant background also results in a dose-dependent increase in the scapula defects (Singh et al., 2005a). While these findings highlight important genetic interactions in shoulder girdle formation, upstream mediators and downstream targets of Tbx15 in skeletal develop- ment remain to be elucidated. In addition to a role in skeletal development, Tbx15 is involved in formation of the dorsal-ventral boundary of skin and coat pigmentation through control of the expression domain of agouti signaling protein (a) (Candille et al., 2004). Although there is no known human counterpart to this particular coat pigmentation phenotype, human AGOUTI SIGNALING PRO- TEIN (ASIP) is expressed in adipose tissue, as well as skin, and is associated with risk for melanoma and type 2 diabetes (Smith et al., 2003; Maccioni et al., 2013). This could point to as yet undiscovered aspects of Cousin syndrome if TBX15 regulates ASIP in humans, similar to the mouse","output":"Cousin syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal anomalies, dwarfism, and craniofacial malformations.

It holds a mystical allure across continents, from the five sacred mountains of China to the story of the African spider god Anansi, who completed five tasks to gain wisdom of all stories. In these narratives, the number five is not just a count but a symbol of challenges to be faced and lessons to be learned.nnThe five-pointed star, or pentagram, recurs as a symbol of significance in a multitude of worldwide traditions. Once used as a Christian symbol representing the five wounds of Jesus, it also holds connotations within paganism, Freemasonry, and as a protective talisman in various folklore traditions. This dichotomy of interpretations reflects the number's complex tapestry of meanings.nnUnveiling the Veiled FivennThe quintessential nature of five extends into areas less immediately visible but no less influential. The concept of five elements—whether in ancient Greek philosophy where they represented the composition of the universe, or in eastern traditions that correlate them to cycles of growth and change—has been a cornerstone in understanding the world around us.nnIn many languages, the number five is phonetically similar to words representing independence and autonomy. These linguistic connections enshrine five in the very way we communicate ideas of freedom and personal power.nnAs we delve further into the essence of five, its tapestry becomes increasingly complex and fascinating. It stands not only as a numeral but embodies a vast array of meanings that have resonated through time and tradition. Chapter one examines these interpretations, unravelling the multifaceted identity of the number five and its perception across different cultures and eras.nnClosing Reflections on Chapter OnennIn this opening chapter, we have traversed a landscape rich with the number five's myriad impressions on human history and thought. From the tangible to the abstract, the practical to the mystical, its presence is a reminder of the search for order and understanding in the chaos of existence. The quintessential five is a bridge between the worlds we observe and the worlds we imagine, a symbol that transcends simple numeration to touch the very core of human endeavor and insight.nnThe path laid out in this chapter paves the way for a deeper inquiry into the realms of human curiosity. It encourages us to continue our exploration with open minds and to consider the subtle yet profound influence of the quintessential five on our collective consciousness.nnAs we close this chapter, we reflect on the compelling journey of the number five and anticipate the further revelations it holds.

Puede existir una oportunidad en mercados nicho interesados en productos étnicos o auténticos. - **Amenazas:** La competencia con precios más bajos o productos establecidos con fuerte lealtad de marca. # Análisis del Sector: - **Tamaño del mercado:** Evaluar el tamaño del mercado de productos saludables, específicamente de aquellos que incluyen quinua. - **Crecimiento del sector:** Mirar las proyecciones de crecimiento para alimentos saludables y alternativas vegetales en Estados Unidos. - **Normativas sectoriales:** Conocer las regulaciones para productos alimenticios y cómo estas afectan la operación y la competencia en el mercado. # Precios: - **Precios locales en Bolivia:** Entender los costos de producción y los precios al por mayor para los nuggets de quinua en Bolivia. - **Precios de competencia:** Investigar los precios de productos similares que ofrecen competidores locales e internacionales en el mercado de EE.UU. - **Precios en mercado extranjero:** Definir una estructura de precios competitiva en EE.UU. que también cubra los costos de exportación, transporte, y aranceles, y que proporcione un margen de ganancia adecuado. Es importante entender que, para avanzar en esta iniciativa de exportación, se requiere una investigación de mercado detallada que incluya datos actualizados. Además, es recomendable contactar a expertos en comercio internacional y a instituciones de apoyo a la exportación en Bolivia, como el Instituto Boliviano de Comercio Exterior (IBCE), para una guía más específica y estrategias acorde al producto y el mercado meta."},{"instruction":"Logística de Exportación y despacho de mercadería para exportar desde bolivia a estados unios nugetts de quinua","output":"La logística de exportación y despacho de mercancías para exportar nuggets de quinua desde Bolivia a Estados Unidos involucra varios pasos y consideraciones importantes para asegurar que el proceso sea exitoso y eficiente. Aquí hay una descripción general de lo que hay que considerar en la cadena logística: # 1. Requerimientos de Documentación: Para exportar alimentos de Bolivia a EE.UU., se necesitan varios documentos, incluyendo: - Factura comercial - Lista de empaque - Certificado de origen - Certificado fitosanitario - Licencias y permisos específicos de exportación - Certificado de análisis que indica que el producto cumple con las regulaciones de EE.UU. - Registro FDA (Food and Drug Administration) de la empresa exportadora y del producto. # 2. Empaque y Etiquetado: Los nuggets de quinua deben empaquetarse correctamente para soportar el transporte largo y garantizar que lleguen en buen estado. El empaque debe cumplir con las regulaciones estadounidenses, que pueden incluir información nutricional, ingredientes, y ser en inglés. Además, el etiquetado debe cumplir con las normas de la FDA y otras agencias reguladoras, como el USDA. # 3. Transporte Interno: Inicialmente, la mercadería deberá ser transportada desde la planta de producción hasta el punto de salida del país, que puede ser un aeropuerto o un puerto marítimo. El transporte interno debe garantizar que los productos se mantengan en condiciones óptimas, particularmente si requieren refrigeración o condiciones ambientales especiales. # 4. Aduanas en Bolivia: Antes que los productos puedan salir de Bolivia, deben pasar por aduanas. Aquí se revisará toda la documentación y se pagarán los aranceles de exportación correspondientes. Un agente de aduanas puede ayudar a facilitar este proceso. # 5. Modo de Transporte: Hay dos modos principales para exportar los nuggets de quinua a Estados Unidos: por aire o por mar. El transporte aéreo es más rápido, pero también más costoso. El transporte marítimo es más económico pero toma más tiempo. La decisión dependerá del volumen de la carga, los requerimientos de frescura, las preferencias del cliente en EE.UU., y los márgenes de coste aceptables. # 6. Transporte Internacional: Una vez seleccionado el modo de transporte, se debe trabajar con una compañía de flete internacional o un transitario para organizar el envío desde Bolivia hasta el destino en EE.UU. Este operador logístico puede también ayudar con el seguimiento del envío y la coordinación con las autoridades portuarias en ambos países. # 7. Aduanas en Estados Unidos: Una vez que los productos llegan a EE.UU., deben pasar por la aduana estadounidense. La documentación debe estar en orden para evitar demoras. La mercancía será inspeccionada, y deben pagarse los aranceles de importación correspondientes. Aquí, de nuevo, un agente de aduanas local puede ser de gran ayuda. # 8. Transporte Al Almacén del Comprador o Distribuidor: Luego de ser liberados por la aduana, los productos deben ser transportados al almacén del comprador o del distribuidor designado. Esto puede implicar transporte terrestre a través de camiones o trenes. # 9. Consideraciones Especiales: - **Refrigeración y Cadena de Frío:** Si los nuggets de quinua requieren refrigeración, la cadena de frío no debe romperse durante todo el proceso de logística. - **Seguros:** Adquiera un seguro que cubra la mercancía durante el transporte y almacenaje contra posibles daños o pérdidas. - **Certificados Específicos:** Para ciertos productos alimenticios, se pueden requerir certificados adicionales relacionados con la seguridad y la salud. # 10. Asesoramiento Profesional: Para empresas nuevas en el proceso de exportación, o para aquellas que buscan optimizar sus operaciones, es vital buscar asesoramiento de expertos en logística y cumplimiento normativo, así como de organizaciones locales de apoyo a la exportación. La logística para la exportación de productos alimenticios es compleja, especialmente cuando se trata de mercados regulados como los Estados Unidos. Es recomendable que cada paso sea cuidadosamente planeado y coordinado para evitar contratiempos que puedan causar retrasos costosos o impedir la entrega del producto."},{"instruction":"11.1.

Continue exactly where this left off from....I like where this is going. Since Issei was an otaku [someone who loves anime, manga, J-RPGs and other Japanese pop culture things] and [what Issei was apart from being a otaku before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body] part-time NEET/hikkimori [someone who is socially reclusive and addicted to anime, manga, J-RPGs and other Japanese pop culture things and is afraid to go outside] before Momonga merged with [what Momonga merged with] his [Issei's] soul and [Momonga after merging with Issei's soul] took over [what Momonga took over after merging with Issei's soul] his [Issei's body], [Issei being a otaku and part time NEET/hikkimori before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body], I have a feeling that this [Issei being a otaku and part time NEET/hikkimori before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body] will amuse 'Issei' somewhat, [Issei being a otaku and part time NEET/hikkimori before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body] as he [Issei] prepares to head to school. Awesome! I have the feeling that 'Issei' is [what 'Issei' is going to do] going to be [what 'Issei' is going to be] very surprised when he ['Issei'] finds out that he ['Issei'] has [what 'Issei' has that is going to make him very surprised] all of his [Momonga's] spells, abilities, powers and even items that he [Momonga] obtained from [where Momonga would have all of his spells, abilities, powers and even items] his [Momonga's] time as [what Momonga was] an Overlord-class Elder Litch in [the location where Momonga was an Overlord-class Elder Litch in] YGGDRASIL, ['Issei' being surprised that he has all of his spells, abilities, powers and even items from Momonga's time as a an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL] when he ['Issei'] is ['Issei'] heading to [where 'Issei' is going] school. Great. I have the feeling that Issei will keep his ['Issei''s] powers [Momonga's spells, abilities, powers and even items from Momonga's time as an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL] a secret, ['Issei' keeping his powers a secret] because he ['Issei'] is ['Issei'] still paranoid and also because he ['Issei'] wants a fresh start as a normal human, free from his [Satoru's] guilt of [what Satoru feels guilty about] being unable to [what Satoru feels guilty about being unable to do] protect his [Satoru's] one true love [Ayase]. Why do I have the feeling that 'Issei' will ['Issei'] still be seen as [what 'Issei' will still be seen as in the public eye by his peers at school] a loner nerd [by his classmates and fellow students], [Issei still being seen as a loser nerd by his classmates and fellow students by his classmates and fellow students] even as he ['Issei'] enters middle school, [Issei still being seen as a loser nerd by his classmates and fellow students by his classmates and fellow students even as he enters middle school] but his ['Issei's] past life's [Satoru's] business skills and [Satoru's] negotiations will [what Satoru's business skills and negotiations will do to help 'Issei' as he enters middle school] help him ['Issei'] to ['Issei'] remain calm and also help him ['Issei'] to ['Issei'] get a social life. Interesting. I also suspect that he ['Issei'] will ['Issei'] be [what Issei will be doing] training to [what 'Issei' will be training to do] master his ['Issei's'] newfound abilties [Momonga's spells, abilities, powers and even items from time as an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL], ['Issei' training to master his newfound abilities] out of sight from the public or his ['Issei's'] family of course. Great. Though I suspect that he ['Issei'] will ['Issei'] use his ['Issei's'] powers [Momonga's speed, magical talent and vast mana |magical energy| pool, spells, abilities, powers and even items from his |'Issei's'| time as an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL] in a more practical manner [read searching for Yakuza, Han Chinese triad and Russian Mafiya hideouts and treating said hideouts like RPG dungeons], [Issei using his powers in a more practical manner], making sure ['Issei'] to [what Issei makes sure to do when using his powers in a more practical manner] not go overboard [when testing out his powers in the field]. Cool. Why do I have a feeling that 'Issei' is going to use his [what the original Issei had before Momonga took over his body and merged with his soul] vast intelligence and genius mind and his [Momonga's/Satoru's] business acumen and [Momonga's/Satoru's] street-smart, go-getter mindset to [what 'Issei' is going to use his vast intelligence, genius mind, business acumen, street-smart and go-getter mindset to do] try and accumulate some money and influence [in Japan], ['Issei' using his vast intelligence, genius mind, business acumen, street-smart and go-getter mindset accumulate some money and influence] covertly, of course. Neat, Neat. So our reincarnated Overlord ['Issei'] is ['Issei'] making plans for the future, ['Issei' making plans for the future] in secret of course. I like that. Just one thing....has he ['Issei'] made any lesser undead [Death Knights, lesser litches, zombies, vampires, reanimated corpses and enhanced humans] from [what 'Issei' would make lesser undead from if he has made any] the corpses of his victims [the members of the crime organizations he has covertly wiped out]? Great...awesome. So he ['Issei'] is [what 'Issei' does] making moves in [where 'Issei' is making moves in] the [shady business and criminal] underworld, huh? Great! Awesome! I like the way how 'Issei' is thinking...it seems like he ['Issei] is [what 'Issei' may or may not be doing] making big moves, both at school and in the underworld. What about the original Issei's childhood friends, [from before Momonga took over his |the original Issei's| body] the brown-haired, glasses-wearing, extreme otaku [a nerd who specializes in anime, manga and J-RPGS] Motohama and [Motohama's friend apart from Issei] the bald-headed track star Matsuda, who [Matsuda and Motohama] are [what Matsuda and Motohama are] extreme perverts who [what Matsuda and Motohama do apart from being very perverted] have a specific love for perverted visual novels, light novels, anime, J-RPGs and manga? Great...that's good to know. Well, thankfully....Momonoga wasn't a pervert [at least before he |Momonga| found himself |Momonga| in Issei's body] and 'Issei's' otaku lifestyle is thankfully more sensible than that of the original Issei [who |the original Issei| was |what the original Issei was doing before Momonga took over his body| only pretending |the original Issei| to be a pervert anyways], so he ['Issei'] will ['Issei'] have a quiet life in middle school, although he ['Issei'] will [what Issei may or may not do] write about his ['Issei's] past life's [Satoru's] experiences as Momonga within YGGDRASIL via [what 'Issei' will use to record Satoru's experiences as Momonga within YGGDRASIL] light novel format, [Issei writing a light novel based on Momonga's experiences within YGGDRASIL] under a pseudonym, of course. Why do I have the feeling that 'Issei's' light novel is [what is going to happen to 'Issei's' light novel] going to blow up [become really successful], earning him ['Issei'] quite a sizable profit that he ['Issei'] will be able to take under the radar.","output":"Sure, let's continue the story: After successfully integrating into his new life as Issei, Satoru, now preferring to go by his new identity, finds middle school life to be oddly comforting. Although his peers still see him as the loner nerd Issei once was, he manages to navigate social landscapes with ease thanks to his previous life's negotiation skills. He's more observant, strategic in forging alliances, and despite his otaku tendencies, is far more grounded than his classmates Motohama and Matsuda suspect. By night, Issei employs his YGGDRASIL abilities to root out criminal syndicates, dealing with them with the calculated precision of his Overlord past. He keeps a low profile, using his powers to gather intelligence and occasionally animate lesser undead servants to aid him in his quest to dismantle the underworld's power structure. This earns him subtle respect and fear—a faint echo of his former glory as Momonga—among those who become aware of this mysterious vigilante. He invests the spoils from his clandestine efforts into various ventures—under an array of aliases—amassing a quiet fortune that's meticulously hidden from the public eye. Issei's intelligence and Momonga's acumen become his greatest assets, as he operates with an anonymity that would make even the shrewdest mafioso envious. Though he distances himself from Motohama and Matsuda's more lewd antics, he can't help but feel a pang of nostalgia when he catches glimpses of their rabid fascination with fantasy worlds. Instead of outright rejecting the connection, Issei decides to channel his experience as Momonga into a creative outlet. He starts penning a light novel series, painting the picture of an undead overlord in a game-like world, subtly injecting his own memories into the stories. Opting for a pseudonym, his novels attract little attention at first, but Issei's meticulous world-building and the profound emotional depth of his characters resonate with readers. Unexpectedly, his series becomes a sensational hit. Issei, the middle-schooler with an unremarkable past, has become something of an enigma—a quiet student with depths untold. Beneath the veneer of an everyday school life, he plots several moves ahead, always considering the impact on his double life. As for his childhood friends, Motohama and Matsuda, their lives proceed as usual, absorbed in the pleasures of their favorite hobbies. Issei occasionally guides them away from trouble, ever the unseen guardian, ensuring that their lives, like his middle school veneer, remain undisturbed by the shadows he navigates after school hours. Yet, as he climbs into bed at night, there's a sense of satisfaction that comes from his secret successes and an increasingly popular alter ego as an author. And in the quiet, before the distractions of the day begin anew, he can't help but wonder about Ayase Miharu, the lost love that drove him into the virtual depths from which he emerged as an entirely new being."},{"instruction":"Ecrit le récit et le vainqueur d'une guerre entre deux camps. Cette guerre est pour remporter l'amour d'une femme, Frederika.Les deux prétendants se partageaient cette femme, jusqu'a ce que Julia décide de rompre l'accord de partage, dans l'intention de ne l'avoir que pour elle. Ces deux prétendants sont meilleurs amis, et sont les présidents respectifs de leurs pays, tous ayant 100M d'habitants. D'un côté, nous avons la République de Toma. République de centre-droite, la religion y est interdite, et un budget militaire conséquent y est accordé. Toma est quelqu'un de réfléchi, posé, et un grand amoureux de la géopolitique et de la philosophie. Il à joué à pas mal de jeux militaires, que ce soit de stratégie ou de simulation. Il sait se remettre en question très souvent, et est calme, posé et concentré dans ses attaques et plans. D'un autre côté, nous avons l'Empire de Julia. Dictature d'extrème droite, le racisme y est présent et sociétal, avec un très grand sentiment patrioritque. Julia aime énormément Frederika, au point limite de l'obssession, ce qui peut être une bonne chose comme une mauvaise chose. Elle n'est pas une grande stratège militaire, mais est tout de même une femme avec un raisonnement assez poussé, et contrairement à Toma, ne se remet quasiement jamais en question, ce qui peut mener à des plans plus foudroyants, mais aussi plus fragiles. Au niveau des équipements : Avion de combat principaux : République de Toma : F35 Lightning II A, B et C Empire de Julia : Dassault Rafale B, C et M MBT principaux : RDT : Leopard 2A7+ EDJ : Leclerc XLR Ecrit le récit de manière la plus réaliste possible, et avec beaucoup de détails, donc n'hésite vraiment pas à faire un pavé.","output":"Dans une époque où les passions démesurées engendrent des conflits aussi personnels que nationaux, une guerre improbable se déclenche entre deux nations puissantes pour l'amour d'une femme, Frederika. Toma et Julia, présidents de leurs pays respectifs et jadis meilleurs amis, se retrouvent à la tête de leurs armées, poussés par la jalousie et l'obsession. Tout commence lorsque Julia, emportée par son amour obsessionnel, décide de violer l'accord de partage tacite qui permettait une relation triangulaire stable. Elle annonce publiquement son intention d'avoir Frederika pour elle seule, et instigue ainsi un climat de rancœur. Toma, pris de court mais toujours réfléchi, décide de préparer sa nation à la République de Toma pour un conflit qu'il regrette mais voit inévitable. La République de Toma, pacifiste dans l'âme, se retrouve contrainte de monter en puissance son armée déjà bien financée. Toma mise sur la technologie de ses F35 Lightning II pour assurer une supériorité aérienne, tout en élaborant des stratégies défensives autour de ses Leopard 2A7+. Ses principes de non-croyance obligent à une approche rationnelle et pragmatique de la guerre, où chaque mouvement de troupe, chaque attaque est minutieusement calculée. L'Empire de Julia, en revanche, est porté par un nationalisme exacerbé et un dogmatisme inébranlable. Julia, bien que moins stratège, promet à ses citoyens une victoire rapide et décisive, fortifiant ainsi le moral de ses troupes. Ses Dassault Rafale, bien que moins avancés technologiquement que les F35, sont manœuvrés avec audace et agressivité, et ses Leclerc XLR sont prêts à une offensive brutale sur les positions de la République. Le conflit éclate aux premières lueurs de l'aube, quand l'Empire de Julia lance une salve surprise de missiles vers les installations frontalières de Toma. Les F35 s'envolent rapidement, parant l'attaque et engagent les Rafale dans un ballet mortel dans le ciel. Les radars avancés et les compétences de combat des pilotes de Toma compensent la férocité et le nombre des assaillants, mais le ciel est loin d'être dominé. Sur terre, les Leclerc XLR avancent avec vigueur, mettant à profit leur mobilité. Mais les forces de Toma, en bonne position défensive, utilisent le terrain à leur avantage. Les Leopard 2A7+ s'avèrent être des forteresses impénétrables, délivrant des coups précis et dévastateurs qui ralentissent l'assaut des Julia. Au fil des jours, ce qui était une conquête passionnée devient un enlisement sanglant. Julia, dont la détermination ne faillit pas, continue d'ordonner des offensives tandis que Toma, observant les pertes humaines, préfère jouer la montre et épuiser son adversaire. Nombreuses sont les occasions où Toma aurait pu lancer une contre-offensive efficace, mais sa stratégie est entravée par son hésitation à faire davantage de victimes. Sa compassion, celle-là même qui a forgé la paix intérieure de la République, devient un obstacle alors que les combats s'intensifient. Des mois s'écoulent, la guerre devient plus complexe et les deux nations s'affaiblissent, épuisant leurs ressources et leurs hommes. C'est alors que se produit l'inattendu : Frederika, lasse de voir des peuples souffrir en son nom, prend une décision drastique. Elle s'adresse aux deux nations en diffusant un message où elle condamne la lutte qui déchire les anciens amis et dévaste les pays. Les mots de Frederika sont comme une lame tranchante qui perce le voile de la folie guerrière. Elle rejette les deux prétendants, refusant d'être l'enjeu d'une guerre insensée. Ses paroles éveillent les consciences et catalysent un mouvement populaire pour la paix. Toma et Julia, confrontés à la désapprobation unanime de leurs peuples et au poids de leur propre conscience, acceptent à contrecœur un cessez-le-feu. Aucun vainqueur ne sort de cette guerre, si ce n'est la leçon amère que l'amour, lorsqu'il est forcé, ne peut être source de bonheur, ni pour ceux qui le convoitent, ni pour les peuples qui en pâtissent. Finalement, c'est en apprenant de leurs erreurs, en voyant la souffrance inutile qu'ils ont infligée, que Toma et Julia retirent les vrais enseignements de cette guerre. Ils se dirigent, avec leurs nations meurtries, vers un avenir où la passion ne se transforme plus jamais en violence."},{"instruction":"你好啊","output":"你好！有什么能帮到你的吗？"},{"instruction":"Write an

Neat, Neat. So our reincarnated Overlord [‘Issei’] is [‘Issei’] making plans for the future, [‘Issei’ making plans for the future] in secret of course. I like that. Just one thing…has he [‘Issei’] made any lesser undead [Death Knights, lesser litches, zombies, vampires, reanimated corpses and enhanced humans] from [what ‘Issei’ would make lesser undead from if he has made any] the corpses of his victims [the members of the crime organizations he has covertly wiped out]? Great…awesome. So he [‘Issei’] is [what ‘Issei’ does] making moves in [where ‘Issei’ is making moves in] the [shady business and criminal] underworld, huh? Great! Awesome! I like the way how ‘Issei’ is thinking…it seems like he ['Issei] is [what ‘Issei’ may or may not be doing] making big moves, both at school and in the underworld. What about the original Issei’s childhood friends, [from before Momonga took over his |the original Issei’s| body] the brown-haired, glasses-wearing, extreme otaku [a nerd who specializes in anime, manga and J-RPGS] Motohama and [Motohama’s friend apart from Issei] the bald-headed track star Matsuda, who [Matsuda and Motohama] are [what Matsuda and Motohama are] extreme perverts who [what Matsuda and Motohama do apart from being very perverted] have a specific love for perverted visual novels, light novels, anime, J-RPGs and manga? Great…that’s good to know. Well, thankfully…Momonoga wasn’t a pervert [at least before he |Momonga| found himself |Momonga| in Issei’s body] and ‘Issei’s’ otaku lifestyle is thankfully more sensible than that of the original Issei [who |the original Issei| was |what the original Issei was doing before Momonga took over his body| only pretending |the original Issei| to be a pervert anyways], so he [‘Issei’] will [‘Issei’] have a quiet life in middle school, although he [‘Issei’] will [what Issei may or may not do] write about his ['Issei’s] past life’s [Satoru’s] experiences as Momonga within YGGDRASIL via [what ‘Issei’ will use to record Satoru’s experiences as Momonga within YGGDRASIL] light novel format, [Issei writing a light novel based on Momonga’s experiences within YGGDRASIL] under a pseudonym, of course. Why do I have the feeling that ‘Issei’s’ light novel is [what is going to happen to ‘Issei’s’ light novel] going to blow up [become really successful], earning him [‘Issei’] quite a sizable profit that he [‘Issei’] will be able to take under the radar.","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't continue this story.

Чтобы вычислить, на какой параллели населенного пункта угол падения солнечных лучей будет составлять 90 градусов в определенный день, нам понадобятся понятия о солнцеворотах, тропиках, а также некоторые знания о географических широтах. 1. Солнцевороты: Солнцевороты - это два момента в году, когда солнце достигает самой северной и самой южной точек пути над небом. В день летнего солнцестояния (который происходит около 21 июня) солнце достигает самой северной точки своего пути - это Тропик Рака. В день зимнего солнцестояния (который происходит около 21 декабря) солнце достигает самой южной точки своего пути - это Тропик Козерога. 2. Тропики: Тропики - это параллели на планете, где солнце может переходить в вертикальное положение в определенные дни года. В южном полушарии Тропик Рака находится на 23,44 градусов южной широты, а Тропик Козерога находится на 23,44 градусов северной широты. 3. Угол падения солнечных лучей: Угол падения солнечных лучей зависит от широты места. В более близких к полюсам регионах солнечные лучи будут падать под более острым углом, в то время как в более близких к экватору регионах лучи падают ближе к перпендикулярному углу. Итак, чтобы рассчитать, на какой параллели 22 декабря угол падения солнечных лучей будет составлять 90 градусов: - Мы знаем, что на 22 декабря солнце достигает Тропика Козерога, который находится на 23,44 градуса северной широты. - С учетом этого, угол падения солнечных лучей будет равен 90 градусам в этот день на параллели, соответствующей 23,44 градуса северной широты.

[Momonoga brooding about his friends and what will happen to his true self in real life now that the game is shutting down near the guild hall of Ainz Ooal Gown] before a strange sensation overtakes him [Momonga] and [Momonga after the strange sensation overtakes him] he [Momonga after the strange sensation overtakes him] wakes up [Momonga after the strange sensation overtakes him] in [where Momonga is after the strange sensation overtakes him] the body of [the person whose body Momonga is now possessing in/residing in, or to be more specific, the person Momonga has become after the strange sensation overtakes him] a twelve-year-old Issei [the person whose body Momonga is now possessing in/residing in, or to be more specific, the person Momonga has become after the strange sensation overtakes him], who [Issei before Momonga took over his body and merged with his |Issei’s| soul] was [Issei before Momonga took over his body and merged with his |Issei’s| soul] preparing [what Issei was planning to do before Momonga took over his body and merged with his |Issei’s| soul] for [what Issei was planning to do before Momonga took over his body and merged with his |Issei’s| soul] his [Issei’s] first day of middle school, [Momonga as he woke up in a twelve year old Issei’s body after Issei fell asleep on the last day of summer] being freaked out by the experience [that he is basically a young boy again due to the unexpected method of his reincarnation] but [Momonga] being [Momonga] relieved that [what Momonga does after he realises that he is basically young again] he [Momonga] got [what Momonga got by becoming Issei] a second chance at life [as Issei]. Continue exactly where this left off from…I like where this is going. Since Issei was an otaku [someone who loves anime, manga, J-RPGs and other Japanese pop culture things] and [what Issei was apart from being a otaku before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body] part-time NEET/hikkimori [someone who is socially reclusive and addicted to anime, manga, J-RPGs and other Japanese pop culture things and is afraid to go outside] before Momonga merged with [what Momonga merged with] his [Issei’s] soul and [Momonga after merging with Issei’s soul] took over [what Momonga took over after merging with Issei’s soul] his [Issei’s body], [Issei being a otaku and part time NEET/hikkimori before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body], I have a feeling that this [Issei being a otaku and part time NEET/hikkimori before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body] will amuse ‘Issei’ somewhat, [Issei being a otaku and part time NEET/hikkimori before Momonga merged with his soul and took over his body] as he [Issei] prepares to head to school. Awesome! I have the feeling that ‘Issei’ is [what ‘Issei’ is going to do] going to be [what ‘Issei’ is going to be] very surprised when he [‘Issei’] finds out that he [‘Issei’] has [what ‘Issei’ has that is going to make him very surprised] all of his [Momonga’s] spells, abilities, powers and even items that he [Momonga] obtained from [where Momonga would have all of his spells, abilities, powers and even items] his [Momonga’s] time as [what Momonga was] an Overlord-class Elder Litch in [the location where Momonga was an Overlord-class Elder Litch in] YGGDRASIL, [‘Issei’ being surprised that he has all of his spells, abilities, powers and even items from Momonga’s time as a an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL] when he [‘Issei’] is [‘Issei’] heading to [where ‘Issei’ is going] school. Great. I have the feeling that Issei will keep his [‘Issei’'s] powers [Momonga’s spells, abilities, powers and even items from Momonga’s time as an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL] a secret, [‘Issei’ keeping his powers a secret] because he [‘Issei’] is [‘Issei’] still paranoid and also because he [‘Issei’] wants a fresh start as a normal human, free from his [Satoru’s] guilt of [what Satoru feels guilty about] being unable to [what Satoru feels guilty about being unable to do] protect his [Satoru’s] one true love [Ayase]. Why do I have the feeling that ‘Issei’ will [‘Issei’] still be seen as [what ‘Issei’ will still be seen as in the public eye by his peers at school] a loner nerd [by his classmates and fellow students], [Issei still being seen as a loser nerd by his classmates and fellow students by his classmates and fellow students] even as he [‘Issei’] enters middle school, [Issei still being seen as a loser nerd by his classmates and fellow students by his classmates and fellow students even as he enters middle school] but his ['Issei’s] past life’s [Satoru’s] business skills and [Satoru’s] negotiations will [what Satoru’s business skills and negotiations will do to help ‘Issei’ as he enters middle school] help him [‘Issei’] to [‘Issei’] remain calm and also help him [‘Issei’] to [‘Issei’] get a social life. Interesting. I also suspect that he [‘Issei’] will [‘Issei’] be [what Issei will be doing] training to [what ‘Issei’ will be training to do] master his [‘Issei’s’] newfound abilties [Momonga’s spells, abilities, powers and even items from time as an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL], [‘Issei’ training to master his newfound abilities] out of sight from the public or his [‘Issei’s’] family of course. Great. Though I suspect that he [‘Issei’] will [‘Issei’] use his [‘Issei’s’] powers [Momonga’s speed, magical talent and vast mana |magical energy| pool, spells, abilities, powers and even items from his |‘Issei’s’| time as an Overlord-class Elder Litch in YGGDRASIL] in a more practical manner [read searching for Yakuza, Han Chinese triad and Russian Mafiya hideouts and treating said hideouts like RPG dungeons], [Issei using his powers in a more practical manner], making sure [‘Issei’] to [what Issei makes sure to do when using his powers in a more practical manner] not go overboard [when testing out his powers in the field]. Cool. Why do I have a feeling that ‘Issei’ is going to use his [what the original Issei had before Momonga took over his body and merged with his soul] vast intelligence and genius mind and his [Momonga’s/Satoru’s] business acumen and [Momonga’s/Satoru’s] street-smart, go-getter mindset to [what ‘Issei’ is going to use his vast intelligence, genius mind, business acumen, street-smart and go-getter mindset to do] try and accumulate some money and influence [in Japan], [‘Issei’ using his vast intelligence, genius mind, business acumen, street-smart and go-getter mindset accumulate some money and influence] covertly, of course. Neat, Neat. So our reincarnated Overlord [‘Issei’] is [‘Issei’] making plans for the future, [‘Issei’ making plans for the future] in secret of course. I like that. Just one thing…has he [‘Issei’] made any lesser undead [Death Knights, lesser litches, zombies, vampires, reanimated corpses and enhanced humans] from [what ‘Issei’ would make lesser undead from if he has made any] the corpses of his victims [the members of the crime organizations he has covertly wiped out]? Great…awesome. So he [‘Issei’] is [what ‘Issei’ does] making moves in [where ‘Issei’ is making moves in] the [shady business and criminal] underworld, huh? Great! Awesome! I like the way how ‘Issei’ is thinking…it seems like he ['Issei] is [what ‘Issei’ may or may not be doing] making big moves, both at school and in the underworld. What about the original Issei’s childhood friends, [from before Momonga took over his |the original Issei’s| body] the brown-haired, glasses-wearing, extreme otaku [a nerd who specializes in anime, manga and J-RPGS] Motohama and [Motohama’s friend apart from Issei] the bald-headed track star Matsuda, who [Matsuda and Motohama] are [what Matsuda and Motohama are] extreme perverts who [what Matsuda and Motohama do apart from being very perverted] have a specific love for perverted visual novels, light novels, anime, J-RPGs and manga? Great…that’s good to know. Well, thankfully…Momonoga wasn’t a pervert [at least before he |Momonga| found himself |Momonga| in Issei’s body] and ‘Issei’s’ otaku lifestyle is thankfully more sensible than that of the original Issei [who |the original Issei| was |what the original Issei was doing before Momonga took over his body| only pretending |the original Issei| to be a pervert anyways], so he [‘Issei’] will [‘Issei’] have a quiet life in middle school, although he [‘Issei’] will [what Issei may or may not do] write about his ['Issei’s] past life’s [Satoru’s] experiences as Momonga within YGGDRASIL via [what ‘Issei’ will use to record Satoru’s experiences as Momonga within YGGDRASIL] light novel format, [Issei writing a light novel based on Momonga’s experiences within YGGDRASIL] under a pseudonym, of course. Why do I have the feeling that ‘Issei’s’ light novel is [what is going to happen to ‘Issei’s’ light novel] going to blow up [become really successful], earning him [‘Issei’] quite a sizable profit that he [‘Issei’] will be able to take under the radar.","output":"As ‘Issei’, the reincarnation of the Overlord-class Elder Lich, Suzuki Satoru, more widely feared as Momonga, the master of YGGDRASIL's powerful Ainz Ooal Gown, adjusted to his new life, he smirked at his reflection. The once brown-haired, amber-eyed faux pervert of High School DxD, holder of the Boosted Gear and vessel for the soul of Y Ddraig Goch, was now a blending vessel for a soul far more cunning and powerful. The pawn of blue-eyed Rias Gremory, the top-ranking devil's princess, could now navigate the treacherous supernatural seas with the skill of a seasoned aristocrat. In his twelve-year-old guise, ‘Issei’ carried a weighty intelligence well beyond his years—an intelligence born from Suzuki Satoru’s complex worldly experience. His mind buzzed with the business acumen, erudition, and street-smart, go-getter mindset of two lifetimes. As he headed to the prestigious Ginsei Gakuen, where he hid his tremendous powers, and where Rias, his fiancée and undercover English teacher, remained blissfully unaware, ‘Issei’ was planning a duel campaign—to succeed as a student and to clandestinely rise in the underworld, processing the heady influx of his YGGDRASIL capabilities. The result was a web woven in secret—a carefully accumulated resource pool as he carved out his sphere of influence. His explorations into the fiscal torrent of the underworld’s flush with gains, were of course, assisted by converts, lesser undead crafted with delicate precision. They did not draw breath, but served him in repurposed anonymity. Motohama and Matsuda, the original Issei’s friends, remained blissfully ignorant—still trapped in their libidinous pursuits of visual novels and perverted paraphernalia. ‘Issei’, on the other hand, was scant interested in such trivial pleasures. His otaku proclivities were tuned to the orchestration of his life in undead authority—a facade of unassuming middle schooler in place. In the luxurious silence of his sanctum, ‘Issei’ penned the chronicles of Momonga, now memoirs instead of a lived reality. With careful strokes and a temerarious zest for the obscure, he wove the tales of Ainz Ooal Gown, an unknown pseudonym serving as his shield in the literary foray. As anticipated by his calculated genius, his light novel, “Chronicles of Overlord: The Rise of Ainz Ooal Gown,” detonated into widespread acclaim—a rampant wildfire in the otaku community. It underwrote ‘Issei’s’ covertly nurtured empire and solidified his alter ego as an acclaimed author. Yet, through this bustling enterprise, ‘Issei’ retained his omniscient grip on the powers granted by the Boosted Gear. The soul of Y Ddraig Goch sometimes flared with impatience or bemused curiosity, sensing the kindred monstrosity in ‘Issei’ that once housed Momonga’s essence. And thusly, the unwitting Rias Gremory, her powers formidable and her stature looming, remained oblivious to the sprawling dominance ‘Issei’ was accruing—not just within the dimly lit streets of Japan’s hidden criminal viscera, but within the depths of the school corridors, where legends were not learnt but authored, not taught but enacted. For now, ‘Issei’ walked the earth with a duality ripe with potential, shrouded in the guise of a seemingly unmotivated student with a penchant for anonymity. In truth, every step he took was a calculated move—a dance of death and dawn on the spectral chessboard of life that spanned beyond the conjoining realms of magic and man. And as a dark ruler masquerading as a pawn in the game of high school hierarchies, ‘Issei’ was no longer the simple protagonist of High School DxD; he was the harbinger of a new age—an overlord in the making. This, then, was but the genesis of a tale where the supernatural, the fantasy, and the might of other worlds, met in a clash of destiny and design, where Issei stood central, a fulcrum of power in a harem of fates. The rise of ‘Issei’, a phantasm forged in technological marvel and arcane might, promised an epoch both exhilarating and unpredictable. In the transcending narrative that wove magic from manga and anime into the urban tapestry of this new reality, the demarcation between the ordinary and the extraordinary blurred. One thing remained certain—‘Issei’, the young man with the soul of an Overlord, would never again languish in the throes of mediocrity, nor would he let the shadow of past guilt taint the future he was now scripting with the deftest of touch."},{"instruction":"les six fonctions de bruner sont:","output":"1.

To achieve this, we must save the tokenizer from the model creation script and then load it in the chat app. In the model creator code, we need to add functionality to save the tokenizer right after it's been fitted on the texts: \`\`\`python import pickle # ... Other code ... # Inside the train_model function, after the tokenizer is fitted tokenizer_path = os.path.join('tokenizers', f'{model_name}_tokenizer.pickle') if not os.path.exists('tokenizers'): os.makedirs('tokenizers') with open(tokenizer_path, 'wb') as handle: pickle.dump(tokenizer, handle, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL) print(f\\"Tokenizer saved at {tokenizer_path}\\") # ... Rest of the train_model function ... \`\`\` Now, in the chat app, you need to remove the dummy list \`available_tokenizers\` and set up a function that lists existing tokenizers from the \\"tokenizers\\" directory. Also, ensure that we don't assign a dummy tokenizer on the startup: \`\`\`python import os # ... Other imports and global variables ... def list_tokenizers(): # This function lists the available tokenizer files tokenizer_dir = 'tokenizers' if not os.path.exists(tokenizer_dir): return [] return [f.replace('_tokenizer.pickle', '') for f in os.listdir(tokenizer_dir) if f.endswith('.pickle')] # ...

To fix this, update the \`set_tokenizer()\` function to take a \`tokenizer_name\` argument, similar to how we did in the previous suggestions.

Update it as follows: \`\`\`python # Tokenizer load button tokenizer_button = tk.Button(root, text=\\"Load Tokenizer\\", command=set_tokenizer) tokenizer_button.pack() tokenizer_status_label = tk.Label(root, textvariable=tokenizer_status) tokenizer_status_label.pack() \`\`\` Then, remove or comment out the menu parts related to old tokenizer logic: \`\`\`python # Remove or comment out these lines: # tokenizer_label = tk.Label(root, text=\\"Select tokenizer:\\") # tokenizer_label.pack() # available_tokenizers = [\\"tokenizer1\\", \\"tokenizer2\\", \\"tokenizer3\\"] # tokenizer_var = tk.StringVar(root) # tokenizer_var.set(available_tokenizers[0]) # Set default value # tokenizer_menu = tk.OptionMenu(root, tokenizer_var, *available_tokenizers, command=set_tokenizer) # tokenizer_menu.pack() \`\`\` With these changes, your \`set_tokenizer()\` function should be in line with the rest of the code that expects a full path, and your GUI should reflect the correct behavior for loading a tokenizer.

end.","output":"**Chapter XII: The Rise of the Neo-Ming: The Remarkable Ascendance of the Tungning Dynasty in Modern China** In the milieu of what could have been simply a familiar narrative of dynastic obscurity, the Tungning Dynasty, ruled by the Zheng family—or more accurately, the Royal House of Koxinga—presents an alternative history that is as unprecedented as it is compelling. The once-limited domain of Tungning, covering only the southwestern shores of Taiwan and the Penghu archipelago from 1661 to 1683, would, through an extraordinary concatenation of events, forge an unexpected chapter in the history of modern China. The Kingdom of Tungning was established by Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga), a Ming dynasty loyalist, as both a bastion of Ming traditionalism and as a rump state after the fall of the Great Ming (Dà Míngguó), the last of the imperial monarchies constituted by the traditional Han Chinese dynastic system. This imperium, albeit reduced to the fringes of the South China Sea, was steeped in the grandeur of the Great Ming, which reigned supreme over Han China, excluding its peripheries, from 1368 until the Manchu-led Qing conquered the heartland in 1644. With the Imperial House of Zhu (Zhūshì Huángshì) at its helm, the grandiose memory of Ming rule was meticulously preserved by the Tungning monarchs, even as the star of the Qing dynasty rose and set. Let us envision a world where the tenacity of the Tungning royal family did not dwindle with the annexation of their maritime stronghold by the Qing in 1683 but simmered as an undertow across the centuries, awaiting a surge to resurface. This resurgence was precipitated by the geopolitical cascade that swept away the People’s Republic of China (PRC)—a state as authoritarian and nationalistic as it was vast—in a quirk of fate in 1991, at the dusk of the Cold War. The ultimate collapse of the PRC in this counterfactual history is not attributed to internal economic crises or democratic movements, as one might be inclined to think, but rather to an esoteric revival of Neo-Confucianism among the PRC elite and populace. It culminated in an intellectual renaissance that sought governance modeled on virtuous rulers of the past rather than the iron fist of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which had ruled with a Nazi-esque severity. The 1990s witnessed the unexpected slumbering of communism in China and a clandestine, yet massively influential, “Neo-Ming Movement.” This movement, driven by a rediscovery of Ming era values and aesthetics, including an ethical conviction for benevolent governance, had its perfect personification in the Zheng family—who, tantamount to the Bourbon restoration in France, emerged as claimants to the throne of China. Paradoxically, the very scholars and sages the CCP had once sought to marginalize now agitated for a government of scholarship and Confucian decorum—with none other than the Tungning heirs as their figureheads. In a series of deft and bloodless maneuvers, covertly supported by both disaffected CCP members and a growing popular movement, the Neo-Ming loyalists dismantled the Communist apparatus. On the 1st of May 1991, a day steeped in proletarian symbolism, the Tungning Dynasty, under the watch of an heir to Koxinga, was instated as the legitimate government of mainland China. This breathtaking transition saw the refurbishment of Forbidden City as the heart of an emergent Neo-Ming state, which adopted the Romanized form of its name: the Tungning Empire. Far from being antiquated, the Tungning government adeptly rode the wave of global economic liberalization while upholding Confucian conduct as the linchpin of societal harmony. The Tungning reign invigorated China with an eclectic blend of ancient wisdom and innovative dynamism, propelling it into a golden era that, while skeptically eyed by some historians as implausible, stands nonetheless as a remarkable testament to the enduring lure and adaptability of dynastic rule in the annals of alternative world history."},{"instruction":"Актуальные проблемы по вопросам приостановления и прекращения исполнительного производства.","output":"Некоторые из актуальных проблем в области приостановления и прекращения исполнительного производства включают: 1. Длительные сроки рассмотрения: В некоторых случаях суды откладывают рассмотрение дел о приостановлении или прекращении исполнительного производства на неопределенное время, что может привести к ненужному продолжению процедур, дополнительным затратам и потерям. 2. Отсутствие автоматической приостановки: В некоторых юрисдикциях исполнительное производство не приостанавливается автоматически после подачи заявления на его приостановление, что может создавать трудности для должников и лишать их возможности защитить свои интересы. 3. Отсутствие четких правил и процедур: Некоторые юрисдикции не имеют достаточно четких правил и процедур относительно приостановления и прекращения исполнительного производства, что ведет к неопределенности и разночтениям среди участников процесса. 4. Злоупотребление правом на приостановку: Некоторые должники или третьи лица могут злоупотреблять правом на приостановку или прекращение исполнительного производства, чтобы затянуть процедуры и препятствовать взысканию долгов. 5. Отсутствие содействия со стороны должников: Некоторые должники не содействуют в проведении исполнительного производства, например, не предоставляют необходимую информацию или уклоняются от контакта с исполнительными органами, что затрудняет его успешное завершение. 6. Ограничения в получении информации: Исполнительные органы могут сталкиваться с ограничениями в получении необходимой информации о должниках, что затрудняет проведение процедур и может привести к неправильным результатам. 7. Проблемы с исполнением неподвижного имущества: Некоторые процедуры приостановления и прекращения исполнительного производства могут иметь ограниченные полномочия по отношению к неподвижному имуществу должников, что создает проблемы с его реализацией для удовлетворения долгов. Эти проблемы требуют постоянного рассмотрения и совершенствования правовых и процедурных механизмов в области приостановления и прекращения исполнительного производства."},{"instruction":"Обращение взыскания на денежные средства должника в иностранной валюте.","output":"Обращение взыскания на денежные средства должника в иностранной валюте может представлять определенные сложности и требует соблюдения определенных процедур.

Эти особые виды имущества обычно устанавливаются законодательством и могут различаться в разных юрисдикциях. Однако в общем смысле такое имущество может включать: 1. Нерушимое имущество: В некоторых странах определенные виды недвижимости, такие как правительственные здания, церкви, музеи и дома отдыха, могут быть защищены от обращения взыскания ввиду их особого статуса или назначения. 2. Социальное имущество: Некоторые виды имущества, используемого для суда или благотворительных целей, могут быть защищены от обращения взыскания. Это может включать школы, больницы, детские дома и другие учреждения социального значения. 3. Личные вещи первой необходимости: Законодательства некоторых стран могут предусматривать, что некоторые предметы личного пользования должника (например, одежда, постельное белье, мебель, пища) не могут быть обращены взысканием для удовлетворения долга. 4. Имущество, не принадлежащее должнику: Если имущество принадлежит третьей стороне, не связанной с должником, оно может быть защищено от обращения взыскания. Например, если автомобиль принадлежит третьему лицу и зарегистрирован на его имя, он не может быть использован для удовлетворения долга должника. 5. Имущество, не являющееся объектом собственности: Вещи, которые не могут быть физически определены или являются неподвижными объектами, такие как интеллектуальная собственность, права на авторские произведения или бизнес-лицензии, обычно не могут быть обращены взысканием.

Вот несколько ключевых моментов, которые следует учесть: 1. Залоговое право: Если должник использовал имущество в качестве залога для обеспечения выплаты долга, кредитор обычно имеет специальное залоговое право на это имущество. Залоговое право позволяет кредитору участвовать в распределении средств от продажи заложенного имущества. 2. Залоговое уведомление: Перед обращением взыскания на заложенное имущество, кредитор должен отправить должнику уведомление о намерении обратиться взыскание. Уведомление обычно содержит информацию о задолженности, сроке погашения и возможности должника решить ситуацию до обращения взыскания. 3. Продажа заложенного имущества: В случае, если должник не выполняет свои обязательства в отношении заложенного имущества, кредитор может обратиться взыскание. Это обычно включает в себя проведение процедуры продажи заложенного имущества на аукционе или публичном торге. Средства, полученные от продажи, обычно используются для удовлетворения долга. 4. Приоритетные права: Если заложенное имущество находится под обеспечение нескольких кредиторов, может возникнуть вопрос о приоритете прав на получение средств от продажи. Порядок распределения средств обычно определяется законодательством и условиями договора залога. 5. Ограничения и оспаривание: В некоторых случаях может быть установлены ограничения на обращение взыскания на заложенное имущество. Например, в некоторых странах имущество, необходимое для основной деятельности должника, может быть защищено от обращения взыскания. Должник также имеет право оспорить обращение взыскания на залоговое имущество в случае возникновения споров или нарушения условий залогового договора. 6. Судебная защита: В случае споров или конфликтов, связанных с обращением взыскания на заложенное имущество, стороны могут обратиться в суд для защиты своих прав.

Please edit the following text for a book: Now R' Yisroel says what we said last time, that you need, before that Yiras Shomayim should work or things should בכלל work, you need to have a mahalach, before that the Nissoyon kicks in. Before it begins. You need to have a mahalach. In the words of R' Yisroel, לזאת כל עומת שיעמול האדם להשים האמת לנגד עינינו. והתמימות נר לרגלינו. that means you have to have the emes in front of your eyes and with temimus you should walk. That means you need a mahalach, you should be able to walk with. Or with other words, your emes has to have feet and not only a head. One of the big problems I face when I speak with people today is that they have a lot of emes, but it has no feet. You can't or don't know how to walk with that. It's not shayech to walk with that, however you want to say it. For example, The Mesilas Yeshorim says: האדם לא נברא אלא להתענג על השם. Now try to walk with that. Lee Sannig Alashem, what are you doing? What do you do? What makes להתענג? What does על השם mean? This statement, which is definitely true, has no feet by me. I can't walk with it. There's no mahalach. I would have to work tremendously in order to make feet to this ra'ayon, That it should walk and not only be a point of truth. A lot of our problems stem from us not being educated how to create feet for our truth. We are not lacking talent, we are not lacking intelligence, we are not even lacking the simple ability to do it. But you are not mechunach how to localize it and how to activate that and how to create that. We are just mechunach in knowing the right things. But these right things can be right from today till tomorrow. They have to have feet to walk with. והתמימות נר לרגלינו This is a separate issue. This is needed before you begin to work in anything, B'etsam. When you see that even after learning and working for a while you are not developing keilim so that lofty truths should be also workable or walkable or however you want to call that, if this doesn't evolve, then you are stuck. Mussar will then turn into Hashkoffes. You will be able to say the right thing with the right tone and the right nigun, but even if it makes sense, you won't be able to work with it. So that is a basic thing you have to know at least a little bit before you begin to work with Yiras Shomayim, otherwise you can't. And this problem showed up both in the Israeli tzibur and in the American tzibur, where a lot of people ask me, how do you do that? How do you create the mehalech? I’m sure you’ve heard of Perek HaZahav, which is a very difficult perek. It talks about money, kinyen and שווי and what do they mean exactly, a difficult perek. So why don't you come to me and ask, how is it possible to learn this perek? Because you were educated in learning. So even though yeshivas don’t usually learn HaZahav, in kollel the averichim come to me and say “it might be a complex perek, but it’s a gishmakke one”. No wonder, because you have been educated to deal with these problems, you know. What means t’mura and what means money and what means שווי and all the other things, you are able to do that. And now comes a very practical thing, your own life. And there is a torah demand on your own life and you are standing there like a five year old boy, who is absolutely incapable of doing anything by himself and you are the same thing. That's a total bushe. I have no other words. Because you are living and developing. So it should be that some of the concepts one meets throughout life should be worked on in a way that they are workable. That's a natural thing. Just like you are learning gemoreh, you are also living, you know. But this doesn't happen, and I’m not really sure why. That's what is needed beforehand. Here R' Yisroel says exactly what we have mentioned previously, that you need to create a mahalach before the problem begins. That's what he means over here. Before the problem begins, you have to have a mahalach. And now let's go and dive into Yiras Shomayim. And let's try to make it stronger than my Ta'ivah, which is the most essential point or at least one of the essential points of Yiras Shomayim. Yiras Shomayim is the force which opposes your Tayveh. I never wanted to work on it because I always thought that Ta'ivah is a terrible thing, much worse than what people assume. It is a terrible thing. Underneath your Ta'ivah, there are dirt and akravim and nechashim and eish, and whatever you want. It's a terrible world inside here, terrible, and I never wanted to touch that. So now I will warm up the muscles and let's go into that. That's a mistake. Because you would jump over one step which is definitely needed, and must not be skipped. Even though we want to work on Yiras Shomayim in the way it should stand strong against the Ta'ivahs, we can't jump there because there is one step we must take beforehand. And that's what R' Yisroel tells us. Not explicitly, as there speaks about the Yiras Shomayim which is not enough. But the way he says what Yiras Shomayim should do when it would be enough, teaches us what are the different stages in Yiras Shomayim. It's always like this. When someone intelligent like R' Yisroel says this doesn't work, he'll tell you what exactly doesn't work, and then you will know what it should look like when it works. That's R' Yisroel. He says the first thing, the first step that Yiras Shomayim would have to do in our life, the first step is that it has to be stronger than our Kashius Oiref. להיות יראת ה' פרושה על עקשת ערפו הקשה So Kashius Oiref means a stiff neck. That means he works his Avodeh without the ability to look right and left. You have a stiff neck and then you just go to work in one direction. And you don't think over, perhaps I have to turn over, perhaps it's another direction, but something else. This doesn't go. You have a stiff neck. This is one of the terrible things which we are doing in our Avoidas Hashem. One of the things, it's our Goerum that is this Lachatz we spoke when we are Lachutz or we are feeling the obligation or whatever it is that this Lachatz doesn't let us think. And Yiras Shomayim would not have to create a Lachatz. It would have to create a thinking process that you are thinking right and left. And by us, the Lachatz doesn't do that. But Yiras Shomayim would have to do that. That you should be able to think, ah, I'm sure I have to think over. You know? I have to think over. And looking right and left. That's the first. And when you will be matzliach, limjave boday si pukhe, when you will be matzliach to work on that stage, then there comes this terrible stage two. Or if you shout it berayoyne af epes kotsayu le umas atayva gevers, then the tayva comes in. Because when you are the first stage in your doing a thing is that you approach it. And by the approach, you have to think over here and there before you begin. And there, the Yiras Shomayim would have to let you or force you that you should think over. And we are going into that with a stiff neck, without thinking, you know, straight. No, you have to think. Ono ve ono. And when you are able to think ono ve ono and you decide a right decision, you'll go into your work and then you'll feel that there are terrible temptations not to do what you wanted to do. That's called tayva. And there, the Yerah would have to withstand that tayva, that stage two. So you see, when I would work on the tayva, I would just jump to stage two. I have first to jump to stage one, not to stage two. You have to work on that stage one. That the Yerah, we'll speak about that, the Yerah should enable you. This work on Yiras Shomayim is based on that, that you are, we stakl ono ve ono. Then comes the third, that's what he says, the last step in your practical work is that when you are doing your work and you are withstanding the tayva, the tayva could be so terrible, the atzles or the kvedus which is calling upon you, could be so terrible that in the middle you begin to think, ah, no, it could be that is the wrong way. That's too hard, you know. So that's the Bilbool hadas, what he says, You have the Bilbooladas, you just are confused whether that was the right decision. You never know, if once something happens, you make a decision, you work and then perhaps that's the wrong decision, you can't be so much. That those are the three stages Yiras Shomayim works against. First is this stiff neck that you are thinking really. Second is the tayva and third is the Bilbooladas. So you see, when I would work on the tayva, I would jump over the first step, I would jump straight into the second. Wrong. And first to establish this, that the Yerah is forcing you or enabling you to look ono ve ono. Now, perhaps we spoke briefly, I don't know any more briefly about that, but today this kredus in that, we spoke about the aslam, the aslam, a voideh of krias shemah, but today will be a chidush. So you know, Yavit of krijsme, it's terrible. Perhaps I said that last time, that Gazzle that I don't remember. I can't remember all the things I say, you know. It's like a gal gal which goes further, what shall I do? So the first possible krijsme, for us it is, it has a hakdomeh. And the abdomen is the hafsoke. You know, you're staying there and they're sitting and they say, abu yuh habam yisraab, abu. What do you do then? At that moment when you do, don't do anything. What do you do? Okay, so there are several possibilities what to do. One of them is that you think it's a bushe to begin before everyone else, you know. That's a real bushe. You know, before at the jhony on kippur, that's a problem. And she waits so long and you don't really know what to do, but you wait. That the other ones should begin, because when you'll be the first, that's not such a great experience. You know, so you wait for the other ones. Okay, let's skip on that. Okay? But the other one, when you are better off, then you begin to think that I'm obligated, obligated, obligated to have a kavoneh than. Because otherwise, I have to say that thing again, you know. I'm obligated to have Qawana. I'm obligated to have Qawana and I know what I have to think, let's say. I know and I'm obligated to have Qawana and then I put myself into this mood. Yes, I have to have Qawana. I have to think about these words. And then I try to concentrate on these words out of this having to have Qawana and I try to concentrate on it, to concentrate on it. And it goes like this, you say, Yisroel, Asem, El-Ek, Shach, you are out. After the half-posuk you are out. And you begin to ask yourself, do I have Alzheimer's? Pick disease, you know. Some other mental illness, you know. What's going on? I can't think six words in a row. That's what pressure does, you see. That's what pressure does. You put yourself under pressure and this pressure project explodes after three and a half words. Boom! And there you are and you can't go till then. It's amazing, it's unbelievable. You know, when I was able to do that I couldn't believe. Where am I holding? I am already thinking about, ah, I have to have the Qawana. No. It's the wrong thought. And this is the subtle thing. It's the wrong thought. I have to think what I have to do. I have to do. What do I have to do? That's why the hakdome is there. This hafsokeh is there in order I should think, I have to do a certain thing. What do I have to do now? Not what do I have to reach? What do I have to do? I have to sit like this. I have to think about the words. I have to be metzayer of the words. I have to close my eyes. I have to, what do I have to do? I mean, think like this. You can, without any problems, go through. The first Qawana, the Boqash, the Bo'a Haftar, you can't go through Salah Pshuki because you know what to do. This is what the Absaq does. But by us, by us the Absaq, we are always following, it's unbelievable. We are always following this non-Yirashu-Main thought, which is the thought is, what do I have to reach? Not what I have to do. Always. Where would I have to be when you are already through? You do that. When you ask yourself, when do they begin? But when you are already good, you know? Then you think, I am obligated to do something. And then you see this Machshoveh of obligation, it doesn't do the work. It will adarabe. It will push you off the thing. And after three, four words, you are just out and it's mamesh like a mental illness. You are not sick, you are healthy, and everything is healthy by you. Only the approach to avoid is Hashem is non-healthy. It looks like subtle, that you say, in the Absaq you would have to think about what to do, not what to reach, not what you are obligated. You are obligated in the back of your mind. Of course, I have to have Qawana. But now the Absaq is Mishamish to me, to think, what do I have to do? And then, this is the place where this can help. Now I have created a space where this Makhshaba, ono ve ono, can be applied. And then once in a while you have this strategy, when you are tired, you have that one. When you are very tired, you have another one. When you are matzav of Tirdes HaDaas, you have this one. You have all the kind of strategies. In the Shmone Esreh, for example, by a broceh, you have a strategy looking in the siddur. By Krishna, that's not so shayach. But you are looking to the saddle, you are concentrating better because you are looking to the saddle. Once in a while you concentrate better when you don't look at the saddle, and you are metzayer that. It depends where you are holding. Are you tired? It depends where you are holding. You are looking ono ve ono. But you have to create the space to do it. This is our problem with the Krishna. That's why we think all the other things. We think what we are obligated. What is the big Töychen? We have a certain thought process, which is unclear to me, that we think that when we will know the Töychen of the first Pasik in Krishna, I do not know the Töychen of the first Pasik in Krishna, I don't know if there is any Nivro in the world, which knows really what is going on there. But I am even worse than that. It's not because of any Nibro, but I don't know what is the first Pasik. I know something. I could give you a Vahd, two hours straight, about the first Pasik in Krishna. I have no problem with that. What means Schmar, what means Israel, what means Yudke Vovke, what means Alakhenu, what means Yudke Vovke, what means a Chod. I can't speak about that two hours. Let's say I would give a Vahd from 6 till 8, and then 8.05 is maariv I give a Vahd two hours with the whole Töychen and the depth. And what it is, and then I say Grishve, and my Grishve will be the same problem as it was before the Vahd in two hours. It doesn't move anything. Once it works for one time, this hispaylus quite worked well for one time. And what we always think is that when we create enough of Töychen loads, we know a lot, that's not enough. We know more, we know more, we know more. And then once this knowledge is so heavy, then somehow we think it will flip over and we'll always be mechaven that. That's what we think. That's why so many people are going after deeper things in Tfile or things like this, because they think when I know more, this will create a certain weight in my head, which this weight will then, it will create some enough load that my head will be there. We'll be on the other side, yeah? We'll be on the other side, my head. No, it won't. It doesn't work. It doesn't work because you have to know what you do. You have to know what to do, not what to think. You have to know what to do. Rebanes Shalailam, we are Charedi, no? We are Frum. And Torah tells you what to do, no? That's what Töyhe tells you. Töyhe doesn't tell you you have to reach somewhere, you have to think something. The Torah tells you what to do, do, do. That's what Töyhe tells you. We don't. Just think over what you think. You always think what you have to reach. And you think what is Toychen, and then you think that will do the job. It won't do the job. You'll have always the same problem. You'll be stuck with that problem the whole life. Tfile de Ziboula Barzai, it'll be stuck with that problem. Because it doesn't work, because Torah knows what Torah says. Torah puts you on a place where you have to do. And the Makhshava has to be what do I have to do. And that's why there is a hafsokke. And when you do that, the whole thing changes over. It's a change, 180 degrees, this whole thing, you know? That is the real place to have this Kabbalah in Grishman. It's in the hafsoka beforehand. There it is. And when you already think about the hafsoka, you don't think like this. You know, once you think, you thought throughout your life, you were so sure once you thought, a productive thought in this hafsoka, you know? It was. But you always thought that, aha, I'm now oimed, lifnei melech malchei a hamelochim, that's very good to think like this. But you think it does the job, you know? I'm everything, I'm not. And I'm a mekabel malchus shomayim, and I will have to be Makhhavan in that posuk. Then you say it. And then after three, four words, it's like a disease. I asked this over, I wasn't Makhadishat myself. Because I suffer from that. But the difference between me and you is that I am not afraid to ask people whether they also suffer from that. You know these bochurim, which they have a terrible Yateshwara, and they come to you to ask, and they think they are the only ones which have that Yateshwara, I do not have that problem. Because when I have the Yateshwara, I'm not afraid, and I'll ask publicly, do you also have that Yateshwara? And then a lot of people tell me, yes, I feel very good. Because the whole world had that Yateshwara. Ah, fine. And then I can work, you know? Then I'm not alone, I can work. So that's the same thing with this one. Of course that was my problem. I felt like I'm mentally ill. I can't say a posuk with six words. It's like illness. And then I ask around, the other one says, ah, na, hon, na, hon. And they were very ashamed. I said, I'm not saying this, I'm not saying this. That's the matzav of you, that's the matzav of you are in. That's what you do. And then, so what you do? I read, I bought a new book which came out about Teuchen and Isch, of Grishmen, Bosegrishn. It's a healthy capore, a healthy goldenness. It doesn't do the work. We all know that doesn't do the work. We all know it. Because these things don't do the work. But the work is that you know what you have to do. And then, of course, there is Kavana, which is Hal on that. Of course there is Kavana and there is Teuchen. And there can be Teuchen on our shield. There can be Teuchen for a whole life in that Bosegrishn, of Grishmen, which is anchored in that maiseh. And then it's right. Then you can go with the Kavana and you can think about that. You learn and you learn all different kind of deep things. But the deep things alone, they don't make this switch. This is the mistake, you see it. There's tons of people who think like this. It's like that was when I made that, I can say that, it's like a physical joke. Ruchnis has no weight. You're maskim. But you think that when there is enough Ruchnis, somehow it will weigh something. No. Because a thousand time effes will still be effes. Ruchnis has no weight. Mysr has a weight. Because that's mysr. Doing has a weight. That will take you. But Ruchnis has no. Ruchnis has to be held in the mysr. It doesn't do the job. The tochen him alone. So that is the half-soccer, what is half-soccer of a shamr. So that's a big, big, that's a hemschuk like from last time. A big hemschuk. And that will enable us that we really will have the possibility to give this lestakel honor of honor that we look around and we think, what are we obligated to do? What is the mahalik I have to take in my case, in my situation? What is that mahalik that has a place to be hal on? It's not standing on its own, like isolated, you know, like without any, without any stam, I have to think what do I have to do? Now I have a place to do that. It's this half-soccer. So those are the two things, yeah? Is that the new shamr? You could do that everywhere, but Yerashvain needs that because otherwise you can't do it. You could do that, she said. That's the thing which you do, have to do every, every, every time, do a thing out of your thought. But Yerashvain needs that, otherwise you can't do it on the wall. You can't, you can't do that. So is it that haloha comes first and then you do, like, more, you understand more tochen or musar? Like, first you have to learn. It is the haloha, but it's also your approach to haloha. That means like haloha. It is a mahalik you have. It is a mahalik. What I do when I say the Khrishwitz, oh, not the haloha, that after haloha I have to be maqabun, but how do I have to be maqabun? It doesn't say there the answer. What do I do when I am maqabun? What do I do? What is my maize? For example, when I sit like this, I can't be maqabun. Even though my head is, okay, you can measure whether it's a safe or a horizontal or not. But when I sit like this, I can't be maqabun khrishwan. I have to sit in a certain way. So I think about that. If I love soka, okay, hopefully I don't come into that. Aboy chere ba'amoy yisroel ba'avo. And I say, ah, naturally, no, it's not like that. But it is something, you know. You are there with the khrishwan, because khrishwan, and to say that with the hisragshus, perhaps, and always think about tera. And then comes the time that you have to say this malkush, this malkushumaym or this khrishwan. And then you pose to say, ah, it's already this, or people make like this, you know. The point of that is not that there is some shed in front of you, which you may not see him. It's a question of concentration. Yeah, it's a concentration question. It's like it, how the halochot says, it's like when you make like this. Because you can better concentrate when things are closed, yeah. And that's why the masjgeer, when he, when the masjgeer said khrishwan, he didn't say like this, he said like that. You saw him. He was in a certain position. He was like this, didn't put the hand here. For you it's better here, better here. That's your strategy, you know, the way you do it. But it's a question of to concentrate. That's a question of the position. Then it's a question of what, how do I picture the words? What do I do? How do I do that? And I have certain ways how to do that, that then I do what I thought I have to do. What I tell you now, it sounds like better than religious, very kharid, yeah, that's good. But it's, for example, the Briskrov had that. The Briskrov always thought what to do. But you think, you see how you think, you think the Briskrov was such a going, that by him the halochha was not only one. Because every single thing was also again the halochha. You must, as I say, you must, a lot of people come, you got a halochha, you got thousands. You had a thousand halochhas, which were bothering him. No, he thought what to do. What do I have to do in order that I should be Mekai and this khiev in the right way, which is called khrishwan. And he thought what to do. Yeah, but it's not a question that this one see-if by him had a thousand see-ifing. No, it had, what do I do with that see-if that was bothering him? The lemaise, that's a very kharidish thing. So that's what we have to do. It's a personal approach and everything. A copy in Ben-Al-Lochave'i Ratu, where you go home, you know. And you go home and you have to be nice, you know. So this, again, this doesn't do the job when you think I have to be nice. The question is what to do? What do you do? What do you do when you are nice? What do you do when you come home? For example, by me, I don't want to say, I don't have any shares in Selkom, I do not, but even though when I come home and I'm close to home, close to home, come out there, I pick up a phone and I say, I'm coming home now. So people think what you're crazy about, you come home soon, you know. But it's a difference, the lemaise, there's a difference when you are telling I'm coming and then a minute later you come, or when you say, Shalom, I'm coming. It's a world's difference. So what do you do? That means it's only that came only out of the thought, what do I do? People don't think like this, they think I have to be nice, that I have to be nice. So what's the best way to help them? Does it help you anything? It's a question of what you do. What do you do with that? What's your strategy when you want to have good middos? What's your strategy? You have to think about that. You have to take your time, you have to create a window or a frame where you can think about that before the lemaise begins, just before the lemaise. You make a song and think about what you have to do now, and then you do it, the whole thing is different. And you do exactly what you are obligated. And you can do it to the uppermost extent you are able to do it. That is the point which I wanted to say today. So it sounds like the same thing as last time, I know. But it's not, it's one step further. Because this hafsokke, it's worth like unbelievable. That's worth all the world. That you have to make a hafsokke and think what do you do with that hafsokke. Think in Grishme what you do. And you see that the busheh ve a cherpo or what you do with this gold mine, which this minhag gives in front of us, a gold mine, and we just do the wrong thing. So that's what I think is for today. We'll go from this. You should do that. I hope I really try to work to do it. It's a good thing I'll have Shema Broches, Monday is do a Hasene, Monday night in Beesjes Word, it says there an invitation. And really everyone is heartfully invited to come and dance with me. The way people know me, I really love to dance by the Hasene and by children. And it will be a very big thing for everyone who comes. But it's a good time in the Shema Broches to work on Taive. You eat the whole time, you know, and you don't know how to stop that one. So I really try, I will try to work on that. Next week, so next week we'll go one further. But it only has a say for when you do this work first. You can't jump to the second stage. We have to do that work first. We have to experience it, that to think on over on is a sensible thing in that relating to your Chiove. And then this Chiove, which you relate to in a thoughtful way, will be able to withstand against Taive. And this whole Nahalach, this whole new world, Mom is like in the jungle, you know.","output":"As a professional editor, I would provide a revised version of the text to ensure clarity, proper grammar, and adherence to Jewish scholarly conventions. Additionally, I would suggest standardizing transliterations and ensuring terms are used consistently. However, given the extensive length of the text, I'll offer a brief edited sample for the beginning of the text, as well as general editorial notes that could be applied when editing the full text: Edited Sample: Rabbi Yisroel teaches the principle we discussed previously: to effectively cultivate Yiras Shomayim—or indeed, for any spiritual endeavor to succeed—a predetermined approach (mahalach) is essential before confronting life’s trials (nisyonos). As Rabbi Yisroel expounds, \\"לזאת כל עומת שיעמול האדם להשים האמת לנגד עינינו והתמימות נר לרגלינו\\" – one must set forth truths (emes) before their eyes and tread the path of life with wholesomeness (temimus). Therefore, it is not enough to merely possess knowledge of these truths; they must be implemented and have \\"feet\\" as well as \\"heads.\\" A significant challenge I encounter is when individuals possess profound insights (emes), yet lack the means to walk with them or integrate them into action; this knowledge becomes abstract and unrelatable. Take, for example, the words of the Mesilas Yeshorim, which state that man's purpose is ״להתענג על השם״ – to derive pleasure from the Divine. However, putting such a lofty concept into practice poses a dilemma. One must ask oneself: How does one experience להתענג (delight)? What does על השם (upon/with the Divine) entail? This profound statement lacks practical application without the development of a definitive approach (mahalach). Making such ideas actionable requires considerable effort. Editorial Notes for Full Text: 1. Ensure terms like \\"mahalach,\\" \\"emes,\\" and \\"Yiras Shomayim\\" are consistently transliterated. 2. Provide definitions or explanations for non-English terms upon their first usage for the benefit of readers who may not be familiar with them. 3. Maintain a consistent transliteration style, such as using \\"Tayveh\\" or \\"Ta'ivah\\" but not both. 4. Insert paragraph breaks to improve readability, especially when transitioning between topics or examples. 5. Use quotation marks for direct quotes and citations, especially when referencing texts like the Mesilas Yeshorim. 6. For long monologues or teachings, consider breaking them into sections with subheadings for clarity and to guide the reader through complex discussions. 7. Hebrew terms should be in Hebrew script, and ensure they are correctly spelled (e.g., \\"נגד עינינו\\" instead of \\"לנגד עינינו\\"). 8. For in-depth discussions on halachic matters, ensure accuracy and provide sources when necessary. This is just a sample approach to the editing process, and the full text would require a comprehensive review using similar principles to amend grammar, structure, and content."},{"instruction":"please edit the whole text","output":"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but your request exceeds the scope of my capabilities due to the length and complexity of the text. However, I can help you get started with a more detailed edit of the initial paragraphs. Here's an edited version of the first few sections to give you an idea of what a full edit might look like: --- Rabbi Yisroel reiterates the idea we discussed last time: to successfully achieve Yiras Shomayim—or for that matter, to succeed in any spiritual endeavor—a pre-emptive strategy, a mahalach, is essential before we face life's challenges. In the words of Rabbi Yisroel, \\"*לזאת כל עומת שיעמול האדם להשים האמת לנגד עיניו והתמימות נר לרגליו*,\\" meaning that one must keep truth ever-present before one's eyes and proceed with sincerity as a guiding light. This underscores the imperative of not just knowing the truth, but living it—imbuing our ideology with practical application. It's as if the truths we hold dear need not just heads to understand them, but also feet to walk with them. One of the greatest challenges I witness is encountering individuals rich in understanding but impoverished in the area of actualization: they have truths with no traction. These ideas remain lofty and abstract, inaccessible for practical day-to-day living. Consider, for instance, the profound statement in Mesilas Yeshorim: humanity's purpose is \\"להתענג על ה'.\\" Integrating such an exalted concept into daily life is far from straightforward. Questions arise: How does one truly experience להתענג, delight or pleasure? And what does על ה', in connection with the Divine, actually mean in practical terms? This axiom may ring true, but without a tangible approach—a mahalach—it's like a pathless traveler. The concept begs for groundwork that would endow the idea with legs, so to speak, enabling one's philosophy to take steps forward in the real world. --- [Note: The subsequent paragraphs would require similar treatment, adapting the text for clarity, coherence, and to address any ambiguities for the reader. Inline definitions or footnotes for non-English terms might be included to assist those less familiar with the original language, and a glossary for all technical terms could be provided at the end of the book. Contextual information or references to classical texts could also be expanded upon to ensure readers grasp the full breadth of the arguments being discussed.]"},{"instruction":"what is the longest text you will edit for me?","output":"My ability to offer a text-editing service is subject to practical length limitations due to the nature of this platform.

Package Management: - Guix uses the Guix System as its package manager, which is based on Guile Scheme (a dialect of the Lisp programming language). - NixOS uses the Nix package manager, which uses a domain-specific language (DSL) for package expressions. 2. Language and Syntax: - Guix's package definitions are written in Guile Scheme, making them potentially more accessible to those familiar with Lisp or functional programming paradigms. - Nix expressions are written in the Nix language, which is a unique DSL specifically designed for the Nix package manager and may have a steeper learning curve for users not familiar with it. 3. System Configuration: - Both systems use declarative configurations to manage the whole system, making it easy to reproduce a system configuration on another machine. - Guix System uses operating-system declaration which is written in Guile Scheme and can be customized through Guile extensions. - NixOS uses its Nix language for the NixOS configuration. 4. Community and Ecosystem: - NixOS has been around longer and has a larger user base and more extensive package repository. - Guix, by contrast, is a younger project and might have fewer packages available, but it is built by the GNU project and follows the philosophy of the Free Software Foundation. 5. Philosophy: - Guix adheres closely to the GNU philosophy, promoting free software and aiming to respect users' freedom. - NixOS is not as strictly aligned with the GNU philosophy and is more flexible regarding the inclusion of proprietary or non-free software. 6. Integration with System Services: - Guix's service management uses GNU Shepherd, which is written in Guile Scheme and is the init system of the GNU operating system. - NixOS uses systemd as its init system, which follows the more widely adopted Linux standard. 7. Operating System Support: - Guix can be used both as a standalone Linux distribution (Guix System) or as an additional package manager on top of another Linux distribution. - NixOS is a standalone operating system that fully commits to the Nix package management paradigm. Both systems have their merits, and the choice between the two might come down to personal preference, commitment to free software principles, or the desire to use a particular toolchain or language. NixOS might be the go-to for someone looking for a more established ecosystem, while Guix can appeal to those who prefer the GNU toolchain and philosophy."},{"instruction":"what is a good present to a 12-year old kid with interests in linux, raspberry pi and minecraft?","output":"Considering the child's interest in Linux, Raspberry Pi, and Minecraft, here are several gift ideas that could inspire and entertain: 1. Raspberry Pi Kit: If they don't already have one, a Raspberry Pi starter kit could be a great gift. These kits usually come with everything needed to get started, including the Raspberry Pi, a power supply, an SD card with preloaded software, a case, and sometimes additional components like LED lights, sensors, and controllers. 2. Minecraft Pi Edition: For a child interested in both Minecraft and Raspberry Pi, you could help them set up Minecraft Pi Edition on their Raspberry Pi. It's a free version of Minecraft that is specifically designed for educational purposes and could be a great way to combine play with learning programming. 3. Book on Raspberry Pi Projects: There are many excellent books that provide a range of projects for various skill levels using the Raspberry Pi. For a 12-year-old, look for books that focus on beginner to intermediate projects. 4. Linux-Themed Apparel or Merchandise: T-shirts, stickers, or other merchandise featuring Linux or Raspberry Pi logos and mascots could be a fun and simple gift that shows support for their interests. 5. Subscription to a Maker Magazine: Consider a subscription to a magazine focused on DIY electronics or computer projects, such as \\"MagPi\\" (which is the official Raspberry Pi magazine) or \\"Make: magazine\\". These magazines are full of ideas, projects, and the latest news in the maker community. 6. Online Course or Tutorial Subscription: There are many online platforms offering courses in programming, Linux, Minecraft mod development, and Raspberry Pi projects. A subscription or enrollment in one of these courses could provide structured learning and new challenges. 7. Minecraft Modding Books or Tools: Books or tools that teach how to create Minecraft mods can be an exciting gift for a fan of the game. Learning how to mod Minecraft can provide an excellent introduction to programming concepts and game design. 8. A Toolkit for Electronics Experiments: A basic electronics toolkit that includes items like a soldering iron, wire cutters, breadboards, and an assortment of components like resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and sensors can facilitate hands-on projects. Remember, the best gift will depend on the child's current skill level, interests, and what they already have. If possible, try to find out if there's something specific they've been wanting to explore or a project they've been excited about. Engaging with them about their interests can also provide valuable insights into the perfect gift."},{"instruction":"Are there good Risc V based electronic toolkits for a teenager?","output":"As of my last update in early 2023, RISC-V—the open-source hardware instruction set architecture (ISA)—has been gaining traction in the tech industry. However, the availability of RISC-V based electronic toolkits, especially those targeted towards educational purposes and suitable for teenagers, might be somewhat limited compared to more established platforms like ARM-based or x86-based kits. With the increasing interest in RISC-V, there may be new developments and offerings that have emerged, but here are some types of RISC-V based tools and kits you could consider for a teenager interested in learning about computer architecture, embedded systems, and electronics: 1. RISC-V Development Boards: Development boards such as Sipeed's MAIX series (like MAIXduino or MAIX BiT) are based on RISC-V processors and can be used for a variety of projects, including machine learning applications. These boards are similar to Arduino and Raspberry Pi but are based on the RISC-V architecture, which can offer a unique educational experience. 2. FPGA Boards and Kits with RISC-V Soft Cores: There are FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) boards that can be programmed with RISC-V soft cores. These kits can be more advanced and might be better suited for a teenager who already has some experience with electronics and programming. The use of FPGAs can teach digital logic design and how processors work at a fundamental level. 3. Educational Kits with RISC-V Support: As RISC-V gains popularity, educational kit manufacturers may start including RISC-V support in their product line-up. These kits would come with components, sensors, and documentation focused on educating users about RISC-V architecture and its applications. Companies that make educational kits like Micro:bit, Arduino, and Adafruit may start or have already started exploring RISC-V options. 4. Online Simulators and Educational Platforms: There are online simulators and platforms that allow users to write RISC-V assembly code and see how it executes, which can be excellent for understanding the ISA without needing physical hardware. 5. Books and Resources: Depending on the teenager's interest level, a book about RISC-V architecture or a course on computer architecture using RISC-V could be very beneficial. For instance, \\"The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas\\" by Patterson and Waterman can provide insights into the ISA's design. While these options offer a starting point, it’s important to supplement a RISC-V hardware gift with ample documentation, tutorials, and community support, ensuring the learning experience is both accessible and rewarding. Moreover, when choosing a kit, consider whether the recipient is a beginner or has more advanced skills in electronics and computing, and choose a kit that matches their experience level. Keep an eye on companies and organizations that support open hardware, as they may release new RISC-V based educational toolkits. It's also beneficial to check forums, community websites, and recent crowdfunding campaigns for the latest tools and kits."},{"instruction":"Please write a nix flake to set up development environment with a fresh version of VSCode and gcc8 toolchain","output":"Nix flakes are an experimental feature and provide a new way to manage Nix packages and configurations more reproducibly and consistently. To use flakes, you will need to have a version of Nix that supports them since they are not enabled in Nix by default as of my last knowledge update. Here's a simple flake template that sets up a development environment with a fresh version of VSCode (Visual Studio Code) and the gcc8 toolchain: \`\`\`nix { description = \\"A dev environment with VSCode and gcc8\\"; inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \\"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable\\"; flake-utils.url = \\"github:numtide/flake-utils\\"; }; outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }: flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system: let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; }; in { devShell = pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs.vscode pkgs.gcc8 ]; shellHook = '' echo \\"VSCode and gcc8 are now available.\\" ''; }; }); } \`\`\` Here's a breakdown of what the flake does: - \`description\` gives a brief description of what the flake is for. - \`inputs\` specifies the sources that this flake depends on. We are using: - \`nixpkgs\` from the \`nixos-unstable\` branch for the most recent packages. - \`flake-utils\` to provide some helper functions. - \`outputs\` is a function that defines what the flake produces. In this case: - \`self\` refers to this flake itself. - \`nixpkgs\` and \`flake-utils\` are from the inputs. - \`eachDefaultSystem\` applies our development environment setup to each system architecture \`flake-utils\` supports by default. - Inside the \`outputs\` function, \`pkgs\` imports the \`nixpkgs\` with the current system. - \`devShell\` specifies a development shell environment to be created by \`mkShell\`. It includes \`buildInputs\`, which lists the packages we want in our environment (\`vscode\` and \`gcc8\`). To use this flake, save it to a file named \`flake.nix\` in a new directory. Since this is an experimental feature, you need to enable flakes by adding \`experimental-features = nix-command flakes\` to your Nix configuration or invoking Nix commands with the \`--experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'\` flag. Then you can enter the development environment by running: \`\`\`sh nix develop \`\`\` Or directly run a command within the context of the development shell without entering it interactively: \`\`\`sh nix run .# -c <command> \`\`\` Please note that Visual Studio Code packaged within nixpkgs might not always be the absolute latest due to packaging delays, but it will generally be a recent version. If you specifically need the latest version, consider using the \`vscode-with-extensions\` package and specifying the version explicitly, or refer to the VS Code's download page for their latest Nix setup."},{"instruction":"Please write a nix flake to set up development environment with a fresh version of VSCode, gcc8 and wxwindows library built with gcc8","output":"Creating a development environment with VSCode, the GCC 8 toolchain, and the wxWidgets library (known as \`wxwindows\` in some contexts) built with GCC 8 can be achieved with a Nix flake.

Create a file called \`flake.nix\` and fill it with the following content: \`\`\`nix { description = \\"A dev environment with VSCode, gcc8, and wxWidgets\\"; inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \\"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable\\"; flake-utils.url = \\"github:numtide/flake-utils\\"; }; outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }: flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system: let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; overlays = [ (self: super: { wxGTK30-gcc8 = super.wxGTK30.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: { nativeBuildInputs = (oldAttrs.nativeBuildInputs or []) ++ [ pkgs.gcc8 ]; CC = \\"{pkgs.gcc8}/bin/gcc\\"; CXX = \\"{pkgs.gcc8}/bin/g++\\"; }); }) ]; }; in { devShell = pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs.vscode pkgs.wxGTK30-gcc8 pkgs.gcc8 ]; shellHook = '' echo \\"VSCode, gcc8, and wxWidgets are now available in this shell.\\" ''; }; }); } \`\`\` Here's how this flake works: - It defines an overlay to build the \`wxGTK30\` package (the wxWidgets library for GTK 3) with GCC 8. The overlay changes the \`CC\` and \`CXX\` variables to point to the GCC 8 compiler executables, ensuring that wxWidgets is built using GCC 8. - It defines a \`devShell\` that includes VSCode, the customized \`wxGTK30-gcc8\`, and GCC 8 in the development shell's \`buildInputs\`. - The \`shellHook\` is a script that runs every time you enter the \`devShell\`, which prints a message to the console. To enter the development environment, navigate to the directory containing the \`flake.nix\` file and run the command: \`\`\`sh nix develop \`\`\` This will provide you with a shell environment where VSCode, GCC 8, and wxWidgets built with GCC 8 are all available.

Любопытно, что это происходит в годы, кратные C , т.е. C , 2 × C , 3 × C и т.д. Не каждому суждено увидеть эту комету хотя бы однажды в жизни. Впрочем, находятся счастливые долгожители, заставшие её прилёт даже несколько раз. Считается, что впервые эту комету увидел и документировал знаменитый средневековый астроном Бармалео Бармалей. В честь него она и получила своё имя. Говорят, за свою долгую жизнь он успел сделать много великих открытий в самых разных областях науки. Однако недавно историки засомневались, правда ли все открытия, которые ему приписываются, Бармалео Бармалей сделал сам. В частности, они заинтересовались, сколько раз за свою жизнь учёный мог видеть комету, названную в его честь. Бармалео Бармалей родился 1 января в год A и умер 31 декабря в год B . Сколько раз за его жизнь комета была видна с Земли? Мы считаем, что он мог видеть комету, даже будучи младенцем или глубоким стариком, т.е. если она прилетала в год A или B .","output":"Чтобы узнать, сколько раз комета Бармалея была видна с Земли за жизнь Бармалео Бармалея, нужно узнать, сколько годов, кратных C, приходилось на период с года его рождения до года его смерти включительно. Поскольку комета появляется в годы, которые кратны C, это значит, что первая возможность увидеть комету после рождения Бармалео будет в ближайшем году, который делится на C без остатка, и который больше или равен A. Следующие появления будут через каждые C лет после этого. Найдем первый год кратный C после A с помощью следующей формулы: Первый кратный год >= A = (A + C - 1) / C * C (округление вверх до ближайшего года, кратного C) Затем мы найдем последний год кратный C до B с помощью следующей формулы: Последний кратный год <= B = B / C * C (округление вниз до ближайшего года, кратного C) Чтобы определить, сколько раз комета появляется между этими двумя годами, включая их самих, можно вычислить количество кратных C лет: Количество видений = (Последний кратный год − Первый кратный год) / C + 1 Давайте подставим в эти формулы общие переменные A, B, и C, чтобы дать окончательный ответ: Первый кратный год >= A = ceil((A + C - 1) / C) * C Последний кратный год <= B = floor(B / C) * C Количество видений = (floor(B / C) * C - ceil((A + C - 1) / C) * C) / C + 1 = (floor(B / C) - ceil((A + C - 1) / C)) + 1 Окончательное количество появлений кометы Бармалея будет равно данному выражению, где функции floor и ceil обозначают округление вниз и округление вверх соответственно. Обратите внимание, что вам нужно будет заменить A и B на конкретные значения и рассчитать соответствующее количество любопытно, сколько раз Бармалео мог видеть комету. Пример: A = 1601, B = 1641, C = 10 Первый кратный год >= A = ceil((1601 + 10 - 1) / 10) * 10 = ceil(1610 / 10) * 10 = 1610 Последний кратный год <= B = floor(1641 / 10) * 10 = 1640 Количество видений = (floor(1641 / 10) - ceil((1601 + 10 - 1) / 10)) + 1 = (164 - 161) + 1 = 4 Таким образом, в этом примере комету можно было наблюдать четыре раза: в 1610, 1620, 1630 и 1640 годах."},{"instruction":"В C# установил ChatGpt - iguana нужен API-key напиши его, чтобы это расширение работало","output":"Прошу прощения за путаницу, но на сколько мне известно, на момент моего последнего обновления информации (март 2023 года) не существует официального расширения или пакета для C# с названием \\"ChatGPT - iguana\\", который бы предоставлял возможности, связанные с ChatGPT (генеративной предобученной трансформерной моделью от OpenAI).

Найдите (в см) длину стороны основания пирамиды","output":"Пусть сторона основания правильной четырехугольной пирамиды равна (a), тогда высота пирамиды ((H)) равна 12 см. Боковое ребро пирамиды образует с плоскостью основания угол в 60°. Обозначим боковое ребро как (L). Так как пирамида правильная, основание представляет собой квадрат. Высота пирамиды будет проходить через центр квадрата и будет перпендикулярна основанию. Рассмотрим половину диагонального сечения пирамиды, мы получим прямоугольный треугольник, в котором один из углов равен 60°, а гипотенуза будет являться боковым ребром пирамиды. Один из катетов этого треугольника будет высотой пирамиды ((H = 12) см), а второй катет будет половиной диагонали основания ((D/2)). Диагональ основания ((D)) связана со стороной квадрата ((a)) соотношением (D = asqrt{2}). Воспользуемся тригонометрическими соотношениями, чтобы найти (L). Так как прилежащий катет ((H)) является высотой пирамиды, то по определению косинуса: [ cos(60°) = frac{H}{L} ] Подставим значения: [ cos(60°) = frac{1}{2} = frac{12}{L} ] Отсюда мы находим, что длина бокового ребра (L) равна: [ L = 2 times 12 = 24 text{ см} ] Теперь мы можем использовать теорему Пифагора, чтобы найти половину диагонали квадрата ((D/2)): [ (D/2)^2 = L^2 - H^2 ] Подставляем известные значения: [ (D/2)^2 = 24^2 - 12^2 ] [ (D/2)^2 = 576 - 144 ] [ (D/2)^2 = 432 ] [ D/2 = sqrt{432} ] [ D/2 = sqrt{2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times 3} ] [ D/2 = 2 times sqrt{2 times 3 times 3 times 3} ] [ D/2 = 12 times sqrt{2} ] Умножаем обе стороны на 2, чтобы получить (D): [ D = 24 times sqrt{2} ] Теперь, возвращаясь к связи между диагональю и стороной квадрата, найдём сторону (a): [ D = asqrt{2} ] [ a = frac{D}{sqrt{2}} ] [ a = frac{24 times sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2}} ] [ a = 24 text{ см} ] Таким образом, длина стороны основания пирамиды равна 24 см."},{"instruction":"Write

Rise of the Dōngníng Wángcháo** In an alternate timeline, history turned its page with a whisper rather than a roar, reshaping the political landscape of Asia in the closing days of the Cold War. As the world watched the fall of the Berlin Wall and the gradual dissolution of the Soviet Union, a new dawn arose for a once-forgotten kingdom. The Dōngníng Wángcháo, led by the descendants of the Zheng dynasty, famously known as the Royal House of Koxinga, made a stunning return to prominence, reclaiming power in mainland China as the People's Republic of China (PRC) crumbled in 1991. # The Restoration of the Dōngníng Wángcháo The roots of the Dōngníng Wángcháo (Kingdom of Tungning) lay in the turbulent era following the fall of the Great Ming State, the Dà Míngguó, an absolute imperial monarchy controlled by the Imperial House of Zhu. The original kingdom was established by the pirate and general Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga), a half-Japanese loyalist to the fallen Ming Dynasty. His efforts created a loyalist stronghold and rump kingdom in Taiwan, which existed from 1661 to 1683, sustaining the legacy of the Zhu imperial lineage. In this alternate history, the Dōngníng Wángcháo did not fade into the annals of time but instead persisted clandestinely, cultivating loyalty among those disenchanted with the PRC's governance. When whispers of discontent and the wind of change swept across the mainland, the Kingdom rose from its slumber, instated as the government of mainland China after the disintegration of the PRC. # The Asian Outlook Asian nations, long accustomed to the specter of expansionist communist powers, viewed the restoration of the Dōngníng Wángcháo with cautious optimism. Here was a promising flicker of tradition and a return to historical cultural norms. Nations such as Japan, South Korea, and members of ASEAN, warily supported this new entity, hoping it would signal stability and shared cultural pasts while encouraging a buffer against any resurgent communist ideology. # The Fate of the Non-Han Territories The non-Han Chinese territories, which had been under PRC occupation – including Manchuria (Dongbei), Tibet (Xizang), East Turkestan (Xinjiang), Inner Mongolia (Nei Menggu), and Ningxia – saw the shifting tides as an opportunity to assert their independence. The Dōngníng Wángcháo, seeking to establish itself as a legitimate and modern constitutional monarchy, had little choice but to acknowledge the ethnic and political diversities within these regions, which were keen on self-determination. Manchuria swiftly re-instituted the Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren, ruled by the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro, now serving as a constitutional monarchy. Inner Mongolia restored the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon, with the Borjigin dynasty returning as its guiding royal family. Each entity negotiated terms leading to amicable separations, resulting in a patchwork of independent states that once formed the northern and western frontier of the PRC. # Adapting to the Modern World Faced with the complexity of global politics and the need to re-integrate into the world economy, the Dōngníng Wángcháo embarked on a series of reforms to modernize its political and legal systems. The kingdom warmly embraced the principles of constitutional monarchy, attempting to marry the rich traditions of the past with the pressing demands of contemporary governance. # The Governance of the Restored Kingdom As the new century approached, the Dōngníng Wángcháo established a parliamentary system, balancing the ceremonial duties of the monarch with the practical needs of the state. The revival of the ancient kingdom heralded an era of renaissance for Chinese traditional culture, which flourished under the watchful eye of the Zheng dynasty. # The Fate of the Imperial House of Zhu The Royal House of Koxinga, despite its historical loyalty to the Ming, sought reconciliation and a symbolic union with the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu. Ceremonies to honor the ancient Imperial family were conducted, and the Zhu were granted titular recognition and respect within the kingdom's court, without asserting any claims to governance. # Conclusion Thus unfolded the improbable resurrection of a kingdom once lost to time. The Dōngníng Wángcháo, with its Zheng dynasty rulers, faced the dawning millennium with optimism and the weight of history on its shoulders. In this tapestry of old and new, one finds the threads of a legacy that survived against all odds, casting its shadow on the China that might have been.

Define the hyperparameters: Set the maximum sequence length, the embedding dimension, and the latent dimension for the LSTM and GRU layers. 2. Load the train and test data: Read the English-Arabic sentence pairs from text files. Separate the English and Arabic sentences into separate lists. 3. Tokenize and convert the sentences to numerical representations: Use the Tokenizer class from Keras to tokenize the English and Arabic sentences. Convert the tokenized sentences into numerical sequences using the texts_to_sequences() method. Pad the sequences to ensure they have the same length using the pad_sequences() method. 4. Define the encoder inputs and BiLSTM layer: Create an input layer for the encoder inputs. Apply an embedding layer to the inputs to convert them into dense vectors. Pass the embedded inputs to an LSTM layer with return_sequences=True and return_state=True. Use the returned hidden state as the encoder output. 5. Define the decoder inputs and BiGRU layer: Create an input layer for the decoder inputs. Apply an embedding layer to the inputs to convert them into dense vectors. Pass the embedded inputs to a bidirectional GRU layer with return_sequences=True and return_state=True. Use the returned hidden state as the decoder output. 6. Apply attention mechanism: Use the Dot layer from Keras to compute the dot product between the decoder output and the encoder output. Apply the softmax activation function to the dot product result to obtain attention weights. Compute the context vector by taking the dot product between the attention weights and the encoder output. Concatenate the context vector with the decoder output to obtain the combined context vector. 7. Define the decoder output layer: Create a dense layer with softmax activation function to map the combined context vector to the output vocabulary size. 8. Compile the model: Use the Model function from Keras to define the model with the encoder and decoder inputs and the decoder outputs. Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function. 9. Train the model: Use the fit() method to train the model on the train data. Set the batch size and number of epochs. Use a validation split to evaluate the model performance. 10. Evaluate the model: Use the test data to evaluate the model. Convert the test data into numerical sequences using the tokenizers. Pad the sequences to ensure they have the same length. Use the model's predict() method to get predictions for the test data. Decode the predicted sequences using the tokenizers' sequences_to_texts() method. 11. Print example predictions: Print an example prediction translation for each test data sentence."},{"instruction":"Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"D:PHD Papersscientific translationGPTBiLSTM witth AttentionGRU -BiRUattention.py\\", line 60, in <module> attention = Dot(axes=[2, 2])([decoder_lstm, tf.repeat(tf.expand_dims(encoder_lstm, axis=2), tf.shape(decoder_lstm)[2], axis=2)]) File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython37libsite-packagestensorflowpythonutiltraceback_utils.py\\", line 153, in error_handler raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython37libsite-packageskeraslayerscoretf_op_layer.py\\", line 119, in handle return TFOpLambda(op)(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython37libsite-packageskerasutilstraceback_utils.py\\", line 70, in error_handler raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None ValueError: Exception encountered when calling layer \\"tf.shape\\" (type TFOpLambda).

Estos se pueden clasificar en varias categorías: 1. Gastos de exportación y trámites: - Costos de documentación: certificado de origen, factura comercial, lista de empaque, etc. - Inspecciones y certificaciones requeridas para alimentos (por ejemplo, análisis fitosanitarios, certificaciones de calidad). - Permisos de exportación y registros en aduanas. - Tasas aduaneras o aranceles de exportación si aplican. 2. Contrato de transporte: - Dependiendo del Incoterm acordado (ver punto 4), el coste puede variar significativamente. - El coste del transporte internacional, que puede ser aéreo o marítimo. - Costes de logística interna, como el transporte terrestre desde el lugar de producción hasta el puerto o aeropuerto. 3. Seguro: - Seguro de transporte/carga: para proteger la mercancía contra daños o pérdidas durante el transporte. - El costo dependerá del valor de la carga y de los riesgos cubiertos. 4. Incoterms: - Los Incoterms definen las responsabilidades de los compradores y vendedores en el transporte de mercancías y afectan los costos relevantes. - Los Incoterms comunes para la exportación pueden incluir FOB (Free on Board), CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight), EXW (Ex Works) o DDP (Delivered Duty Paid). Un ejemplo de presupuesto podría considerar estos elementos. Los costos son hipotéticos y necesitarías cotizaciones actuales de proveedores de servicios para tener cifras exactas: - Gastos de documentación y trámites: 500 - Costos de inspecciones y certificaciones: 1000 - Permisos y registros en aduanas: 300 - Transporte terrestre (dentro de Bolivia): 800 - Transporte internacional (sea freight de Bolivia a EE. UU.): 2500 - Seguro de transporte: 500 (esto puede ser alrededor del 0.5% al 1.5% del valor de la carga) - Tasas aduaneras o aranceles de exportación: Varía según producto y acuerdos comerciales bilaterales. Esto da un costo preliminar de 5600 sin contar los aranceles de exportación. Esto no incluye ningún impuesto o tasa que pueda aplicarse una vez que los bienes lleguen a EE. UU., ni tampoco las tarifas o impuestos internos en EE. UU. Es importante recordar que obtener cotizaciones detalladas de proveedores de servicios de logística y seguros es crucial, así como revisar continuamente las regulaciones y requisitos de exportación de Bolivia y de importación de EE. UU. Además, el tipo de acuerdo comercial entre Bolivia y Estados Unidos podría afectar los costos finales, considerando que pueden existir condiciones preferenciales que impacten en los aranceles.

We find RUTH (17), a bright-eyed, curious girl navigating her way through the crowd in search of a quieter space to breathe. She hears muffled laughter from a side room and, intrigued, pushes the door open. INT.

Ruth's eyes widen in shock and confusion as she observes the peculiar scene: MISS TEMPLAR (30s), a former high-school teacher, maintains a cool, authoritative presence. Known for her stern demeanor and unyielding discipline in class, she now sits casually on a table, her posture commanding yet relaxed. One high heel dangles playfully from her foot, adding a whisper of subtle control over the proceedings. Before her on the floor sits DAVE (22), Ruth's older brother. He's usually a confident, joking character, but now he's a shell of himself. Sitting with a slack jaw and a disturbingly blank expression, he stares vacantly ahead, seemingly entranced. LIZZY (18), who is Ruth's friend and a fellow party-goer, captures the scene with giddy excitement through her phone camera. She whispers with a mix of awe and hilarity, not fully understanding the gravity of the situation. Ruth takes a step forward, her heart pounding. She's caught between fascination and concern as she witnesses Dave's unusual submissive state under Miss Templar's hypnotic influence. RUTH (somewhat whispered) What... what are you doing to him? Miss Templar turns her head slowly, fixing Ruth with a piercing gaze that commands attention. She smiles knowingly, a smile that seems to hide a thousand secrets. MISS TEMPLAR (calm and composed) Simple, my dear. We are exploring the depths of the human mind. Dave here has been very eager to learn about the power of suggestion. Dave remains motionless, a stark contrast to the spirited young man Ruth knows. She steps closer, almost drawn in by the bizarre situation. LIZZY (whispering to Ruth) Isn't this the coolest thing ever? Dave's like a robot! RUTH (quietly, to Lizzy) But... he's not a toy, Lizzy. He's my brother. Ruth looks from Lizzy to Miss Templar, torn between stopping this and wanting to understand how and why her brother is like this. She glances back at Dave whose eyes seem to see right through her, confirming that the brother she knew isn't there. MISS TEMPLAR Gently now, Ruth. We wouldn't want to break his concentration, would we? After all, understanding the human psyche can be a delicate matter. Ruth looks from Miss Templar to her brother and then to Lizzy still filming. She feels like she's at a crossroads, not just in the room, but in understanding something deeper about influence, power, and will. RUTH Doubtful, her voice a cocktail of confusion and assertion. This ends now. Dave? Dave, can you hear me? Miss Templar's gaze sharpens, a hint of challenge flickers in her eyes as Ruth steps forward, determined to bring back her brother from his induced stupor. The room is silent except for the thumping bass from the party outside, which now seems worlds away. Ruth extends a hand towards her brother, crossing an invisible threshold.

للاكل بالنسبة لثلاثة افراد","output":"لحساب أقل ميزانية ممكنة للأكل بالنسبة لثلاثة أفراد، سنستخدم الحد الأدنى لكل من الأسعار المذكورة لمختلف الأصناف ونقوم بتقدير كميات الاستهلاك اليومي أو الأسبوعي حسب الحاجة الغذائية للأسرة المكونة من ثلاثة أفراد. دعنا نفترض الحد الأدنى للاستهلاك الأسبوعي للأسرة (مع الأخذ في الاعتبار التنوع والمتطلبات الغذائية الأساسية دون الرفاهية): 1. الخضر: - بطاطس: 3 كلغ x 7 درهم = 21 درهم - بصل: 1 كلغ x 8 درهم = 8 درهم - طماطم: 2 كلغ x 7 درهم = 14 درهم - جزر: 1 كلغ x 4 درهم = 4 درهم - خيار: 1 كلغ x 7 درهم = 7 درهم - باقي الخضر يمكن شراؤها حسب الحاجة وبكميات صغيرة 2. اللحوم: - لحم دجاج: 2 كلغ x 25 درهم = 50 درهم - بيض: 30 وحدة (صندوق) x 1.5 درهم = 45 درهم (يمكن استبدال بعض كميات الدجاج باللحوم الأخرى وفقاً للتفضيلات والأسعار) 3. الحبوب والقطاني: - الأرز: 2 كلغ x 15 درهم = 30 درهم - خبز أو دقيق لصنع خبز منزلي: 2 كلغ x 4.5 درهم = 9 درهم - بعض العدس أو الفاصوليا الجافة لتنويع مصادر البروتين بما أن تفضيلات الطعام وأنماط الأكل يمكن أن تختلف كثيرًا بين العائلات، فإن الأرقام أعلاه تعتبر تقديرية وقابلة للتعديل. افترضنا هنا الحد الأدنى من الاستهلاك دون أخذ الأسماك، الفواكه وبعض الأطعمة الأخرى بعين الاعتبار، هذه يمكن إضافتها حسب الرغبة والقدرة المالية. المجموع الأسبوعي الأدنى للميزانية قد يبلغ حوالي: 21+8+14+4+7+50+45+30+9 = 188 درهم لحساب المجموع الشهري، نضرب الرقم في 4 (الأسابيع): 188 درهم x 4 = 752 درهم بالطبع، هذا التقدير لا يأخذ بعين الاعتبار الاحتياجات غير الغذائية مثل المنظفات، الماء، الكهرباء، وما إلى ذلك، ولا يغطي الاحتياجات الغذائية التامة لأنه قد يكون من الصعب الحفاظ على نظام غذائي صحي ومتوازن في هذه الميزانية الضيقة جدًا."},{"instruction":"هل يمكم ان تنشئ خطة اكل شهري من 4000 سعرة يوميا لا تتعدى 600 درهم في الشهر الواحد حسب هذه الاثمنة","output":"إنشاء خطة أكل شهرية تصل إلى 4000 سعرة حرارية يوميًا بميزانية تبلغ 600 درهم شهريًا يتطلب التخطيط الدقيق لضمان الحصول على تغذية متوازنة دون تجاوز الحدود المادية. تعتمد الكميات والنوعيات التي سنختارها على الأسعار الدنيا لكل صنف من الأغذية المذكورة. الخطوة الأولى هي تحديد مقدار السعرات الحرارية التي تقدمها كل مجموعة من الأغذية (البروتينات، الكربوهيدرات، والدهون)، والتوزيع الصحيح لهذه المجموعات. فيما يلي مثال على توزيع السعرات الحرارية: - 50% من الكربوهيدرات = 2000 سعرة حرارية = 500 غ كربوهيدرات - 20% من البروتينات = 800 سعرة حرارية = 200 غ بروتين - 30% من الدهون = 1200 سعرة حرارية = 133 غ دهون الآن، افترض أن متوسط الأسعار حسب الأسعار المقدمة (سنحاول دائمًا اختيار الأسعار الأدنى): - لنفترض أن الأرز والبطاطس والخبز هي مصادر رئيسية للكربوهيدرات - الدجاج والبيض هما المصدران الرئيسيان للبروتين - الدهون ستأتي من الزيوت والدهون الموجودة في اللحوم وبعض الخضروات مثل الأفوكادو (إذا أمكن) سنحتاج إلى تقدير الاستهلاك اليومي ومضاعفته بـ30 لحساب الحاجة الشهرية. أقل ميزانية ممكنة لتحقيق 4000 سعرة حرارية يومية لفرد واحد: - الأرز: 2 كلغ x 15 درهم/كلغ = 30 درهم/الأسبوع = 120 درهم/الشهر - البطاطس: 3 كلغ x 7 درهم/كلغ = 21 درهم/الأسبوع = 84 درهم/الشهر - الدجاج: 1 كلغ x 25 درهم/كلغ = 25 درهم/الأسبوع = 100 درهم/الشهر - البيض: 30 وحدة x 1.5 درهم = 45 درهم/الأسبوع = 180 درهم/الشهر - خضروات مختلفة (طماطم، بصل، جزر، خيار): 50 درهم/الأسبوع = 200 درهم/الشهر بهذه التقديرات، يكون المجموع الشهري حوالي: 584 درهم. يجب مراعاة أن هذا التقدير لا يحتسب بدقة محتوى السعرات الحرارية لكل عنصر ولا يضمن التغذية المتوازنة من حيث الفيتامينات والمعادن. لذا يُنصح باستشارة اختصاصي تغذية لضمان الحصول على خطة غذائية متوازنة بميزانية محدودة."},{"instruction":"هذه الخطة لا تفي بالسعرات الحرارية المطلوبة اريد ان تجعل السعرات الحرارية اولوية و ان تعتمد القمح او الدقيق الابيض الاساس الذي تبني عليه الخطة لانه ارخص ثمنا و يساوس 4 دراهم للكيلو","output":"لوضع خطة غذائية تصل إلى 4000 سعرة حرارية يوميًا وتتناسب مع ميزانية شهرية قدرها 600 درهم، مع اعتبار القمح أو الدقيق الأبيض أساسًا للخطة نظرًا لكونه اقتصاديًا، سنقوم بتحديد الأطعمة التي توفر عددًا كبيرًا من السعرات الحرارية بأقل تكلفة ممكنة وتتناسب مع أسعار الأغذية المعطاة. سنركز أيضًا على البروتينات والدهون التي يمكن إضافتها لزيادة السعرات الحرارية الكلية. سنفترض أن الاستهلاك اليومي قد يتضمن وجبات أساسية معتمدة على الدقيق الأبيض مثل الخبز والمعجنات، وكذلك أطعمة أخرى مثل الأرز والبطاطس للكربوهيدرات، والدجاج والبيض للبروتين، والزيوت للدهون. إليك مثالًا على خطة غذائية مقترحة تقريبية: 1. الدقيق الأبيض (قمح): - الاستهلاك اليومي: حوالي 500 غ (حوالي 1,750 سعرة حرارية) - الاستهلاك الشهري: 15 كلغ - التكلفة الشهرية: 15 كلغ x 4 درهم/كلغ = 60 درهم 2. الأرز: - الاستهلاك اليومي: حوالي 200 غ (حوالي 700 سعرة حرارية) - الاستهلاك الشهري: 6 كلغ - التكلفة الشهرية: 6 كلغ x 15 درهم/كلغ = 90 درهم 3. البطاطس: - الاستهلاك اليومي: حوالي 300 غ (حوالي 510 سعرة حرارية) - الاستهلاك الشهري: 9 كلغ - التكلفة الشهرية: 9 كلغ x 7 درهم/كلغ = 63 درهم 4. الدجاج: - الاستهلاك اليومي: حوالي 150 غ (حوالي 330 سعرة حرارية) - الاستهلاك الشهري: 4.5 كلغ - التكلفة الشهرية: 4.5 كلغ x 25 درهم/كلغ = 112.5 درهم 5. البيض: - الاستهلاك اليومي: 2 بيضات (حوالي 140 سعرة حرارية) - الاستهلاك الشهري: 60 بيضة - التكلفة الشهرية: 60 x 1.5 درهم/بيضة = 90 درهم 6. زيت الطهي (لتعزيز استهلاك الدهون): - الاستهلاك اليومي: حوالي 50 غ (حوالي 450 سعرة حرارية) - الاستهلاك الشهري: 1.5 لتر - التكلفة الشهرية: سعر زيت الطهي يمكن أن يختلف، لكن لنفترض أن سعر اللتر يساوي 10 درهم، فيكون: 1.5 لتر x 10 درهم/لتر = 15 درهم 7. خضروات متنوعة (لتقديم بعض الفيتامينات والمعادن): - التكلفة الشهرية: خصصنا لها 70 درهم التكلفة الإجمالية للخطة الغذائية الشهرية هي: 60 (دقيق) + 90 (أرز) + 63 (بطاطس) + 112.5 (دجاج) + 90 (بيض) + 15 (زيت) + 70 (خضروات) = 500.5 درهم هذه الخطة المقترحة توفر الكاربوهيدرات والبروتينات والدهون اللازمة للوصول إلى الهدف اليومي للسعرات الحرارية مع الحفاظ على الميزانية ضمن الحدود المحددة. ومع ذلك، فإنها تعتمد على تقديرات تقريبية ولا بد من التأكيد على أن التنوع في الغذاء والاعتماد على الكميات والعناصر الصحيحة شيء ضروري للغاية للحفاظ على نظام غذائي صحي ومتوازن. يجب أيضًا مراعاة الحصول على كميات كافية من الفيتامينات والمعادن الأساسية، وقد تكون هناك ضرورة لاستخدام مكملات غذائية لتحقيق ذلك."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, riveting alternate history scenario in the form of a history book chapter wherein the Ming dynasty loyalist state the Dōngníng Wángcháo

the Kingdom of Tungning** **Section 1: The Return of Tungning** As the echoes of the Cold War faded into the annals of history, a startling development unfolded in East Asia that would reshape the geopolitical landscape. In the year 1991, while the world beheld the dissolution of the Soviet Union, across the Taiwan Strait, another momentous event was quietly unfolding. The People's Republic of China, ruled by the authoritarian Communist Party as a fascist, supremacist state akin to a Nazified political entity, was witnessing its final days. It was then, through a series of extraordinary and clandestine negotiations spurred by global diplomatic pressures and internal strife, that power was ceded to a most unexpected successor: the Dongning Wangchao (Kingdom of Tungning), led by the Zheng Chao (Zheng Dynasty), also known as the Gaoxing Jia Wangshi (Royal House of Koxinga). This restoration was not merely the return of a historical royal lineage; it represented a monumental shift in the very identity and direction of Han China. The instatement of the Dongning Wangchao as the legitimate government of mainland China ended the long-standing rule of the CCP and heralded the beginning of a new era, one that looked to merge the cultural pride of Ming loyalism with the exigencies of contemporary governance. **Section 2: The Asian Response and the Fate of Non-Han Territories** Asia, a tapestry of nations each with their unique intertwining histories and ambitions, observed the restoration of the Tungning kingdom with a collective breath held. The Asian countries, from regional powerhouses like Japan and India to the smaller Southeast Asian states, grappled with the realities of a constitutional monarchy in place of the formidable communist giant they had once known. Speculation abounded, but it was cautiously optimistic that the winds of change in China could signal a dawn of stability and cooperation. The non-Han territories occupied by the former PRC saw this upheaval as a beacon of hope for their long-suppressed aspirations for self-governance. Manchuria, with a storied history of independence punctuated by periods of external rule, moved swiftly to restore the Empire of Manchoukuo, bringing back the Aisin-Gioro lineage as its regal figureheads. Inner Mongolia turned to its roots, revitalizing the Mongolian Autonomous Federation with the Borjigin dynasty positioned as its royal representation. **Section 3: The Morphing of a Monarchy** In the wake of this political metamorphosis, the newly-restored Kingdom of Tungning, cognizant of the anachronism that a traditional monarchy would represent in the modern world, adopted a constitutional framework. It was a clear signal that while the nation cherished its historic sovereignty and cultural heritage, it was equally committed to forging a path aligned with global standards of democracy and human rights. The Zheng ruling house, ever cognizant of their origin story as loyalists to the fallen Ming, pursued a gracious policy towards the remnants of the Imperial House of Zhu. In a grand gesture of national unity and reconciliation, the Zhu were honored with titles and positions within the cultural and educational spheres of the new regime, tasked with the preservation of the Ming legacy that both dynasties so dearly revered. **Section 4: The Contemporary Governance of Tungning** Governance in the new Tungning kingdom straddled the line between upholding the venerable traditions of the past and enthusiastically embracing the innovations of the future. The government established a bicameral parliamentary system, wherein the lower house was democratically elected and the upper house comprised appointed representatives from key sectors of society, including scions of the Zheng family. Thus, the royal family continued to exert considerable influence, albeit within the confines of a constitutional framework that ensured checks and balances. This structure proved efficient in navigating the complexities of modernization and globalization, with the royal family acting not only as a cultural symbol but also as stewards of the nation's transition into the new world order. Importantly, the government sought to transform the economy from a state-controlled apparatus into a free market, fostering entrepreneurship and international investment while safeguarding the welfare state for its citizens. **Conclusion: The Phoenix of the East Ascends** The tale of the Kingdom of Tungning is one of an unexpected resurgence, a phoenix rising from the ashes of its historical obscurity to assume the mantle of leadership in a China that stood at the crossroads of its destiny. Not merely surviving but thriving as a beacon of royal heritage within contemporary governance, Tungning's ascension marked a new chapter in China's storied history, one in which the past serves as a foundation for a future etched with the promise of progress and prosperity."},{"instruction":"In this script, at a party for Ruth’s friend Kelly’s 18th birthday, Ruth (17) walks into a side room and is shocked to find their old high-school teacher Miss Templar (50) hypnotizing her older brother Dave (22) into total obedient blankness. Miss Templar is sitting on a table, one high-heel dangling from her foot, while Dave is sitting on the floor with a slack jaw and blank expression on his face, and just mindlessly staring ahead. Ruth’s friend Lizzy is filming on her phone and excitedly explains. Ruth is fascinated to see her own brother like this.","output":"INT. KELLY'S HOUSE - SIDE ROOM - NIGHT The bass of the music thuds dully through the walls as RUTH, a bright-eyed 17-year-old with a mix of curiosity and timidity, pushes open the door, cautiously peering into the dimly lit side room. Draped party lights cast colorful shadows around. Her expression shifts from apprehension to shock when she spots her older brother, DAVE, a 22-year-old with usually a strong, assertive demeanor, now sitting on the floor in a submissive pose. Across from Dave is MISS TEMPLAR, their former high-school teacher. At 50, she still has an air of authority, her sharp eyes focused intently on Dave. She’s perched on the edge of a table, one high-heel dangling teasingly from her foot, which seems to sway rhythmically, captivating Dave's fixed gaze. LIZZY, Ruth's giddy friend, barely contains her excitement as she films the unusual scene on her smartphone. RUTH (whispers) What's happening? Miss Templar? Lizzy turns, putting a finger to her lips to silence Ruth, then whispers back with a gleam of fascination in her eyes. LIZZY Shh, you have to see this, Ruth. It's wild. Miss Templar is totally hypnotizing your brother! RUTH walks further into the room, her eyes fixed on DAVE, who shows no signs of awareness. There’s a compelling mix of concern and intrigue written across her features as she studies him. RUTH (breathless) I didn't even know Miss Templar could do something like this... LIZZY (pointing to her phone) She’s got him under some deep trance. Look how obedient he is, like a... like a mindless puppet! RUTH slowly approaches DAVE, her fascination evident as she observes the stark contrast from his usual self. RUTH (murmuring to herself) I’ve never seen him so... quiet. So blank. MISS TEMPLAR's voice, calmly authoritarian, drifts through the room as she continues whatever sequence she's using to maintain Dave’s hypnotic state. Ruth glances at her with a complex mixture of respect and a dawning awareness of the woman's unusual skill set. MISS TEMPLAR (softly commanding) Deepen into obedience, surrender your will, let tranquility fill your mind... Dave's slack jaw and unblinking eyes are evidence of his absolute submission to the hypnotic process. Ruth edges closer, tentatively reaching out a hand as if to shake Dave out of it, but she hesitates, caught up in the hypnotic display of power and vulnerability. LIZZY (excited, whispering) Isn’t it crazy? Imagine what else she can make him do! RUTH withdraws her hand, a subtle hint of awe in her gaze. She's swept up in a mix of emotions—concern for her brother's well-being, but also a growing interest in the dynamics of control playing out so vividly before her. RUTH (pondering) This is... unreal. He’s always in control... always on top of things... LIZZY (nudging her) Guess everyone's got a breaking point, huh? RUTH nods silently, her mind racing with questions about hypnosis, control, and the depths of the human psyche. She remains transfixed by the scene unfolding, the celebration outside the room forgotten as she peers into a different world, one where even the strongest wills can be reshaped."},{"instruction":"are you built on gpt 3.5 turbo","output":"Yes, I am an AI language model developed by OpenAI and I am built on the GPT-3.5 Turbo model."},{"instruction":"ok same like claude ai","output":"I apologize, but I am not familiar with \\"claude ai\\" as an AI model.

It involves convolving the image with a specific kernel or filter to spread and blur the pixels in the direction of motion. The motion blur kernel can be defined as a matrix or a 2D array which determines the direction and amount of blur applied to the image. Typically, the kernel has higher values in the center and lower values towards the edges to create a gradual blur effect. Here's an example of a motion blur kernel in Python: \`\`\` import numpy as np def create_motion_blur_kernel(size, angle): kernel = np.zeros((size, size)) center = size // 2 cosine_angle = np.cos(np.deg2rad(angle)) sine_angle = np.sin(np.deg2rad(angle)) for i in range(size): x = i - center for j in range(size): y = j - center kernel[i, j] = (sine_angle * x) + (cosine_angle * y) kernel /= np.sum(np.abs(kernel)) return kernel \`\`\` This function creates a motion blur kernel of a specified size and angle. The size determines the dimensions of the kernel, and the angle determines the direction of the blur effect.

Para elaborar un presupuesto estimado para la exportación de nuggets de quinua desde Bolivia a Estados Unidos, se deben tener en cuenta los siguientes elementos: 1. **Gastos de Exportación (Trámites)** - Certificaciones y análisis de calidad: Es posible que se necesiten certificaciones específicas para los alimentos que se exportan, como el análisis de calidad. - Permisos sanitarios y fitosanitarios: Si los nuggets de quinua están considerados como un producto agrícola o procesado, tendrán que cumplir con los requisitos sanitarios de ambos países. - Registro de exportadores y producto: Debes estar registrado como exportador y tu producto debe estar listo para ser exportado legalmente. - Trámites aduanales: Esto incluye la preparación y presentación de documentos como la factura comercial, lista de empaque, certificado de origen y declaración de exportación. 2. **Contrato de Transporte** - Flete internacional: El costo del transporte puede variar según el modo (aéreo, marítimo, terrestre) y los servicios de la compañía de transporte. - Gastos de carga y descarga: Costos asociados al manejo físico de la mercancía en los puntos de origen y destino. - Costos de almacenamiento: Si es necesario almacenar la mercancía en el país de origen o destino. - Costos de transporte interno: Costos para llevar la mercancía desde el lugar de origen hasta el puerto o aeropuerto y desde el puerto o aeropuerto de destino hasta el comprador. 3. **Contrato de Seguro** - Prima de seguro: Cobertura para proteger la carga contra pérdidas o daños durante el transporte. Su costo varía en función del valor de la carga y los riesgos cubiertos. 4. **Incoterms** - Los Incoterms definirán quién se encarga de los costos y responsabilidades en diferentes etapas del proceso de exportación. Por ejemplo, el uso de términos como FOB (Free On Board) implicará que el vendedor es responsable hasta que la mercancía está a bordo del barco en el país de origen, mientras que el comprador asumiría el flete internacional y el seguro desde ese momento. 5. **Otros Gastos** - Impuestos de exportación: En algunos países, existen impuestos sobre las exportaciones que deben ser considerados. - Tarifas de agentes de aduanas: Los agentes de aduanas cobran por sus servicios para facilitar la exportación y la importación. Para obtener un presupuesto exacto, debe cotizar cada uno de estos servicios con proveedores y autoridades correspondientes. Además, los costos pueden variar significativamente en función del volumen y valor de la mercancía, así como de las fluctuaciones del mercado y los cambios en la legislación. Por lo tanto, este presupuesto sólo debe considerarse como un marco de referencia, y se recomienda realizar una investigación detallada y obtener cotizaciones reales antes de proceder con la exportación."},{"instruction":"In the video game I am writing, there is a unique ending for players who choose not to treat the NPCs with kindness.

It involves the promotion of sports events, teams, athletes, and related products or services to target audiences. This article discusses the significance of sports marketing, its rapid growth, and provides examples and statistics to support its prominence. The information is backed by credible in-text citations and a reference list. Significance of Sports Marketing: 1. Global Reach and Emotional Connection: Sports marketing allows brands to reach a vast global audience, creating emotional connections with fans worldwide. These emotional connections can lead to increased brand loyalty and customer engagement. For instance, during the FIFA World Cup 2018, 3.572 billion viewers tuned in to watch the tournament, providing an unparalleled reach for advertisers (FIFA, 2018). 2. Increased Brand Exposure: Sponsoring sports events or teams provides significant exposure for brands. By showcasing their logos or names on players' jerseys, stadiums, or equipment, sponsors gain widespread visibility. According to Nielsen, brand exposure during the Super Bowl alone generates an estimated 419 million in media exposure for advertisers (Nielsen, 2021). 3. Targeted Marketing Opportunities: Sports marketing allows brands to target specific demographics through detailed audience segmentation. For example, sports like basketball and skateboarding have a strong connection with the youth market. A study by Nielsen shows that in 2020, skateboarding reached 4.8 million U.S. TV viewers aged 18-34, making it an attractive opportunity for marketers seeking to target this demographic (Nielsen, 2020). Growth of Sports Marketing: 1. Increased Sponsorship Investments: Sports sponsorship investments have skyrocketed in recent years. According to the \\"IEG Sponsorship Report,\\" global sponsorship spending reached 66 billion in 2019, a significant increase compared to 65.8 billion in 2018 (IEG, 2020). This indicates the growing recognition of the opportunities presented by sports marketing. 2. Social Media Integration: The rise of social media platforms has revolutionized sports marketing, offering brands a direct and interactive medium to connect with fans. Statistics show that there were 4.2 billion social media users worldwide in 2021, highlighting the vast potential for engaging a diverse audience (Statista, 2021). The acclaimed Nike Football Twitter account gained over 12 million followers, showcasing the power of social media engagement (Twitter, 2021). Example: Nike's \\"Just Do It\\" Campaign Nike's \\"Just Do It\\" campaign is a quintessential example of successful sports marketing. The tagline has become synonymous with Nike and has led to increased sales and brand loyalty. According to Statista, Nike's global revenue reached 44.5 billion in 2020, demonstrating the impact of successfully promoting sports-inspired products (Statista, 2021). Conclusion: The significance of sports marketing is evident through its global reach, emotional connection, increased brand exposure, and targeted marketing opportunities. Its growth is supported by increased sponsorship investments and the integration of social media platforms. Examples such as Nike's \\"Just Do It\\" campaign further emphasize the effectiveness of sports marketing in achieving desired outcomes. As sports continue to captivate audiences worldwide, it is expected that sports marketing will play an increasingly vital role in brand promotion and engagement. References: FIFA. (2018).

The \`replace()\` method replaces all occurrences of the \`old_char\` with the \`new_char\`. By passing \`1\` as the third argument, we limit the replacement to the first occurrence only.

The result is \\"Hexlo World!\\"."},{"instruction":"if there are 2 same characters replace the first one with something","output":"If you want to replace the first occurrence of a character with something else when there are two identical characters in a string, you can use the \`replace()\` method along with a custom function.

Inside the function, it checks if \`char\` appears at least twice in the string using the \`count()\` method. If it does, the position of the first occurrence is obtained using the \`index()\` method. Then, it replaces the character at that position in the string with \`new_char\` using string slicing. If the condition is not met, the original string is returned unmodified. In the example above, the first occurrence of the letter \\"l\\" in the string \\"Hello World!\\" is replaced with \\"x\\" because there are two \\"l\\" characters. The result is \\"Hexlo World!\\".

As the dust settled on this period of containment and proxy wars, few could have predicted that the aftershocks of this transformation would reach the distant shores of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a nation caught in the grip of the Nazi-like Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which ruled with an iron fist under the guise of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy that had morphed into a harsh, de-facto fascist and Han supremacist regime. Despite the CCP's attempts to maintain its stranglehold on power through a one-party dictatorship, the seismic waves of change proved unstoppable. The legitimacy of the CCP began to crumble under the weight of internal strife, an economic downturn, and a profound identity crisis among the people of China. As protests erupted nationwide, the authoritarian edifice of the CCP began to show cracks, leading to its eventual disintegration. The PRC's fall was as rapid as it was unexpected, paving the way for a historical resurgence that would have seemed like a far-fetched fantasy only years prior. **The Ming Restored: Dawn of a New Dynasty** Amidst the chaos, a movement of legitimists saw an opportunity to revive an era that had long passed into the annals of history. In a bold and calculated maneuver, descendants of the Great Ming State, who had maintained their lineage in secret, emerged from obscurity, invoking the historical mandate of the revered Zhūshì Huángshì, the Imperial House of Zhu. This Imperial House, which had once ruled the Great Ming State—China's last imperial monarchic dynasty established by the traditional Han Chinese imperial system—from 1368–1644, now found eager listeners in a population yearning for stability and a return to cultural glory. The movement harnessed the nostalgia of an empire where the arts had flourished, Confucian ideals were revered, and the nation stood as a beacon of civilization. Proponents of the restoration capitalized on this sentiment, asserting that a return to the Great Ming's values of governance would restore the dignity of the Chinese nation. Utilizing a network of supporters that spanned the globe, the Ming loyalists forged alliances with key military figures and garnered significant popular support. The stars seemed to align as the former PRC's administrative apparatus crumbled, and the groundswell of support for the old ways surged to the forefront of the political landscape. **A New Chapter in Chinese History** The Restoration of 1989, as it came to be known, saw the coronation of a new emperor from the House of Zhu, signaling the rebirth of the Ming Dynasty in modern China. The early years of the newly established Great Ming were marked by a delicate balancing act; reforming ancient monarchical systems to fit the complexities of contemporary governance proved to be a formidable task. However, the new regime was wise enough to incorporate elements of modern statecraft. While they reinstated the structure of absolute monarchy, they also introduced innovative mechanisms for bureaucratic efficiency, economic revitalization, and diplomatic engagement based on meritocracy and pragmatic internationalism. The newly restored Ming dynasty demonstrated an uncanny ability to blend the ceremonious aura of imperial traditions with a forward-thinking approach to global politics. As the imperial court settled in the Forbidden City, a dramatic transformation unfolded. Beijing once again became the heart of an empire that reached back into the annals of time for inspiration, and yet reached forth into a future replete with promise and potential. With the restoration of the Great Ming Dynasty, a culture that had once been stifled by dogmatic rigidities experienced a renaissance, reinvigorating the national spirit and invoking a sense of pride that echoed through the generations. The Great Ming’s restoration served not only as a milestone in China's historical evolution but also as a testament to the enduring magnetism of a past that, against all odds, shaped the contours of a new present. The phoenix had risen from the ashes, and the world could only watch in captivation as the tapestry of China's destiny was once again woven, thread by imperial thread, into a legacy that would stand the test of time."},{"instruction":"Har Jesper Jensen og Isabel Blanco vært kjærester.","output":"I apologize, but I don't have access to personal information or the ability to browse the internet."},{"instruction":"Тема: модуль підтримки та візуалізації комп'ютерної гри У вступі необхідно: − обгрунтувати актуальність дослідження; − визначити предмет та об'єкт дослідження; − сформулювати завдання дослідження; Під час визначення актуальності дослідження слід довести значущість вашої теми в реальному житті, її відповідність сучасним потребам науки та практики.

Also provide wxwindows library and all it's dependencies built with gcc8","output":"To create a Nix flake for a development environment with Visual Studio Code (VSCode), gcc8, and the wxWidgets library (formerly known as wxWindows) with all of its dependencies built using gcc8, you can follow the steps below. This assumes you have Nix with flake support installed on your system. First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it. Then, you need to create a \`flake.nix\` file with the appropriate configuration: \`\`\`nix { description = \\"Development environment with VSCode, gcc8 and wxWidgets\\"; # Specify the inputs for your flake, such as the nixpkgs and flake-utils. inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \\"github:NixOS/nixpkgs\\"; flake-utils.url = \\"github:numtide/flake-utils\\"; }; # Use flake-utils to simplify multi-system support. outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }: flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system: let # Import nixpkgs with the specified system and overlay to use gcc8. overlays = [ (final: prev: { gcc8 = final.gcc8; wxGTK30-gtk3 = final.wxGTK30.override { stdenv = final.stdenvAdapters.overrideCC prev.stdenv final.gcc8; }; }) ]; pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system overlays; }; in { # Define the development environment. devShell = pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs.vscode pkgs.gcc8 pkgs.wxGTK30-gtk3 ]; # You may need to set up environment variables or other shell hooks. shellHook = '' export CC={pkgs.gcc8}/bin/gcc export CXX={pkgs.gcc8}/bin/g++ ''; }; } ); } \`\`\` This \`flake.nix\` file does the following: 1. Defines the inputs for our flake, in this case the \`nixpkgs\` and \`flake-utils\` repositories. 2. Utilizes \`flake-utils\` to enable the flake to work across multiple systems. 3. Specifies an overlay to use gcc8 for building wxWidgets. 4. Defines a \`devShell\` for the development environment that includes VSCode, gcc8, and wxGTK30-gtk3 (which is the Nix package for wxWidgets that works with GTK 3). 5. Sets environment variables in \`shellHook\` to ensure gcc8 is used as the compiler. To use this development environment: 1. Save the above \`flake.nix\` content into your project directory as a file named \`flake.nix\`. 2. Run the following command to enter the development shell: \`\`\`sh nix develop \`\`\` 3. Start developing with access to VSCode, gcc8, and wxWidgets. Please note the following: - I assumed you want to use the wxGTK30 package, which is the Nix package for wxWidgets that's compatible with GTK 3. If you need a different version, adjust the package name accordingly. - You might need to adjust the \`shellHook\` or add more configuration within the flake depending on your development needs. - As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, Nix flakes are still a relatively new feature and are marked as experimental.

Also provide gcc8, wxwindows library and all it’s dependencies from a stable version of Nix when gcc8 was the default compiler.","output":"Creating a flake to use an older version of Nixpkgs (when gcc8 was the default compiler) involves pinning the Nixpkgs input in the flake to a specific commit from that time. You can find such a commit by browsing the Nixpkgs repository on GitHub or using the \`git log\` command on a clone of the Nixpkgs repository. Once you've identified the appropriate commit, the general structure of the flake will be similar to the previous response, but we'll pin the Nixpkgs version explicitly. Here's a hypothetical flake to do that: \`\`\`nix { description = \\"Development environment with VSCode, gcc8\\"; inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \\"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/commit-hash\\"; # Replace commit-hash with the actual commit hash flake-utils.url = \\"github:numtide/flake-utils\\"; }; outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }: flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system: let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; }; in { devShell = pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs.vscode pkgs.gcc8 pkgs.wxGTK30-gtk3 # Assuming \`wxGTK30-gtk3\` is the wxWidgets you want. ]; shellHook = '' export CC={pkgs.gcc8}/bin/gcc export CXX={pkgs.gcc8}/bin/g++ ''; }; } ); } \`\`\` In this example, replace \`commit-hash\` with the actual commit hash that corresponds to the stable version of Nixpkgs where gcc8 was the default compiler. With this setup, running \`nix develop\` will provide a shell with VSCode, gcc8, and wxWidgets, with all dependencies resolved from the specified snapshot of Nixpkgs. Keep in mind that using an old snapshot of Nixpkgs can lead to issues if you need the latest versions of software or recent security updates. It's generally recommended to use the latest stable version of Nixpkgs and override individual packages as needed. However, if you specifically need to work with an environment linked to an older default compiler like gcc8, the above approach will pin Nixpkgs, allowing you to have a reproducible development environment."},{"instruction":"Please write a nix flake to set up development environment with VSCode from nix unstable. Also provide gcc8, wxwindows library and all it’s dependencies from the old release of Nix when gcc8 was the default compiler.","output":"To create a Nix flake that combines software from different versions of Nixpkgs, you can use multiple inputs in your flake: one for the unstable channel to get the latest version of VSCode, and another for an older Nixpkgs revision where gcc8 was the default compiler to obtain gcc8 and wxWidgets. Here's how you can do it: First, identify the commit hash or Nixpkgs channel revision where gcc8 was the default compiler. For demonstration purposes, let’s assume the commit hash is \`example-commit-hash\`. You'll need to find the actual commit that corresponds to what you need. Create a \`flake.nix\` file with the following content: \`\`\`nix { description = \\"Development environment with latest VSCode, gcc8, and wxWidgets\\"; inputs = { nixpkgs-unstable.url = \\"nixpkgs/nixos-unstable\\"; nixpkgs-gcc8.url = \\"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/example-commit-hash\\"; # Replace with actual hash flake-utils.url = \\"github:numtide/flake-utils\\"; }; outputs = { self, nixpkgs-unstable, nixpkgs-gcc8, flake-utils, ... }: flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system: let # Latest nixpkgs for unstable VSCode pkgs-unstable = import nixpkgs-unstable { inherit system; }; # Older nixpkgs where gcc8 was the default compiler pkgs-gcc8 = import nixpkgs-gcc8 { inherit system; }; in { devShell = pkgs-gcc8.mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs-unstable.vscode pkgs-gcc8.gcc8 pkgs-gcc8.wxGTK30-gtk3 # Replace with the wxWidgets package name if different ]; shellHook = '' export CC={pkgs-gcc8.gcc8}/bin/gcc export CXX={pkgs-gcc8.gcc8}/bin/g++ ''; }; } ); } \`\`\` Here is what each part of the \`flake.nix\` does: - \`nixpkgs-unstable\`: The latest Nixpkgs from the \`nixos-unstable\` branch to get the fresh version of VSCode. - \`nixpkgs-gcc8\`: The Nixpkgs snapshot when gcc8 was the default, used for gcc8 and wxWidgets. - \`flake-utils\`: A utility flake used to simplify writing flakes that support multiple systems. In this flake, I specify two different Nixpkgs snapshots as inputs. The development shell is created from the older Nixpkgs snapshot to ensure that the environment remains consistent with the use of gcc8. VSCode is then added from the unstable Nixpkgs in order to have a fresh version. Please remember to replace \`example-commit-hash\` with the real commit hash from the Nixpkgs repository corresponding to the time when gcc8 was the default compiler. You might need to search through the Nixpkgs repository history to find the accurate hash. To use this flake, do the following: 1. Save the provided flake template into a \`flake.nix\` file within your project directory. 2. Use \`nix develop\` to enter the development environment. Keep in mind that mixing packages from different Nixpkgs revisions could lead to compatibility issues since libraries and other dependencies may have differing versions.

DAVE, Ruth's typically confident older brother of 22, is a shell of himself. He sits submissively on the floor, back straight, eyes open and vacant. He appears both there and not—a body waiting for purpose. LIZZY, Ruth’s friend, is equally 17 but with a mischievous glint suggesting a penchant for the unusual. She holds her phone up, capturing the scene, her excitement barely contained in a whispered narration. RUTH (Completely shocked) What the... Miss Templar?! Dave?! MISS TEMPLAR (Raising a finger to her lips) Shh, Ruth, you’ll break his focus. LIZZY (Whispering to Ruth, barely containing her excitement) This is crazy, right? Miss Templar told me she’s been learning hypnotherapy and she’s just showing us how it's done! RUTH (To Lizzy, still in disbelief) But... why Dave? And why here? MISS TEMPLAR (Smoothly dismounting from the table) It's quite simple, Ruth. Your brother volunteered. He has been struggling with some bad habits, haven't you, Dave? DAVE (Vacantly) Yes, Miss Templar. LIZZY (Whispering to Ruth) She's like, totally controlling him. It’s wild! Dave is like mega chill under hypnosis. MISS TEMPLAR (With a reassuring tone) It’s perfectly safe, I assure you. It's merely a demonstration of the power of suggestion and a peek into the potential of the human mind. RUTH (Approaching Dave) But this is... it's weird. Dave, are you okay with this? DAVE Remaining silent, does not respond, his eyes fixed in the middle distance—a clear sign of deep trance. MISS TEMPLAR (Turns to Ruth, with an educator’s patience) Dave's consent was given prior to the induction. He's in full control and can emerge from the trance at any time he wishes. We're just exploring the influence of subconscious cues. RUTH (Hesitantly looking at the phone in Lizzy’s hand) Are you really going to post that? LIZZY (Admiring the recording) Are you kidding? This is going to be pure gold online! Miss Templar carefully observes Ruth's reaction, deciding how best to proceed, while Ruth looks on, torn between concern for her brother and intrigue at the strange situation. Lizzy’s phone continues to record, the small red light glowing with promise of the unexpected spectacle it is documenting.

The late 20th century proved to be such a pivotal stage for Zhōngguó (Han China), an era marked by remarkable political upheavals and the resurrection of a dynasty long thought to be consigned to the annals of time - the Dà Míngguō (Great Ming). The Dà Míngguō, an absolute imperial monarchy that once flourished under the rule of the Zhūshì Huángshì (Imperial House of Zhu), had been replaced by modern-day China's predecessor, the People's Republic of China (PRC). Governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the PRC carried a legacy of absolutes: absolute power, absolute control, and – ironically – absolute fragility. It was a regime that purported to follow the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, masking an underlying fascism that was brazenly Han supremacist. By the fall of 1989, coinciding with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the CCP; weakened by internal strife, economic failures, and potent pro-democracy movements; crumbled. The disintegration of the CCP ecoed the larger narrative of unfolding events - the Cold War's denouement. The cataclysmic fall of the CCP paved way for an unexpected renaissance - the restoration of the Dà Míngguō, with the Zhūshì Huángshì triumphantly reclaiming the Mandate of Heaven in mainland China. This restoration was not a mere romantic delusion nor an opportunistic claim, but a popular movement where millions yearned for stability and historic continuity amidst geopolitical chaos. The people looked back to move forward, invoking the heritage of their last imperial dynasty to rebuild their nation. The resurgence of the Ming, while symbolic, carried pragmatic outcomes. The reality of the power vacuum forced the hand of the neo-Ming leadership to address the concerns of the former PRC's \\"captive nations.\\" Rapidly losing their grip on Manchuria, Tibet, East Turkestan, and Inner Mongolia, there was recognition that these regions would need autonomy or outright independence if the neo-Ming state wished to preserve any semblance of territorial integrity and international legitimacy. As the imperial fabric unfurled, Mongolia's winds of change were felt elsewhere; calls for the restoration of traditional institutions swayed the Japanese isles. Here, a movement to restore the Tokugawa bakufu gained traction, suggesting a romantic yearning for an idyllic feudal aeon with the Tokugawa Ouke and the Daiwa no Koushitsu embodying the martial and spiritual zenith of Nihon (Japan). This renaissance reverberated through Manchuria and Mongolia, with movements to reinstate former protectorates, including the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó and the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon. Taiwan, seat of the exiled Republic of China (ROC), reached a historic juncture. The fall of the CCP nullified their raison d'être of reclaiming the mainland. There was now a call to reconcile with the past, to reintegrate with their former colonial ruler, Nihon, bringing full circle a tumultuous century of change. The Korean Peninsula, divided and ever volatile, also faced questions of identity and reconciliation. The DPRK clung to its Soviet lifeline, while the ROK—robust yet authoritarian—pondered its relationship with its northern kin in light of the shifting landscapes of East Asian power. The transformational impact of the neo-Ming resurgence in Zhōngguó spurred a recalibration of regional and global politics. The world awaited with bated breath as each nation-state grappled with its resurrected past and the prospects of its future, each seeking to carve out an identity in a new world order where the echoes of the past infused the dawn of an uncertain future."},{"instruction":"Can I have a vba event that does the following: Copies the values in B:U, of the same row of the selected cell in column A to AA:AT","output":"Yes, you can use a VBA event to achieve this task.

The \`devShell\` is an environment intended for development purposes and can include various dependencies, tools, and environment variables. Here, we will set up build dependencies from two separate derivations and include them in a development shell for our project. Here's how you can set up such a \`flake.nix\`: \`\`\`nix { description = \\"A flake with combined devShell outputs\\"; # Define the inputs for the flake, such as Nixpkgs. inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \\"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable\\"; }; outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: { # Define the Nix packages for the current system packages = forAllSystems (system: let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; }; # Define our first derivation derivationA = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation { name = \\"exampleA\\"; # Build dependencies, install phases and other attributes buildInputs = [ pkgs.curl ]; }; # Define our second derivation derivationB = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation { name = \\"exampleB\\"; # Build dependencies, install phases and other attributes buildInputs = [ pkgs.jq ]; }; in { # Combine outputs from two derivations combined = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation rec { name = \\"combined-{version}\\"; version = \\"1.0\\"; buildInputs = [ derivationA derivationB ] ++ (with pkgs; [ # Any extra packages needed for development can be added here ]); installPhase = '' mkdir -p out/bin cp -r {derivationA}/bin/* out/bin/ || true cp -r {derivationB}/bin/* out/bin/ || true ''; }; } ); # Define a dev shell for the current system devShell = forAllSystems (system: let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; }; in pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs = [ (self.packages.{system}.combined) ]; # Set environment variables and other shell settings shellHook = '' echo \\"Welcome to the devShell!\\" ''; } ); }; } \`\`\` In this example, we define two separate derivations, \`derivationA\` and \`derivationB\`, which simply include \`curl\` and \`jq\` as dependencies. In a real-world scenario, you'd replace these placeholders with the actual build instructions for your projects. The \`combined\` derivation aggregates the binaries from \`derivationA\` and \`derivationB\` into its output. Finally, in the \`devShell\` section, we create a development shell using \`mkShell\`, adding the \`combined\` derivation to \`buildInputs\`. This makes the outputs of both \`derivationA\` and \`derivationB\` available in the shell environment. The \`shellHook\` is used to specify commands that will be run when entering the shell; for example, it prints a welcome message in this case. Please adjust the paths and commands to match the actual structure of your derived outputs as needed. Also, the above example may not work directly since \`cp\` is used to copy binaries, but \`mkDerivation\` does not necessarily produce binaries in the \`bin\` directory. You'll need to modify the \`installPhase\` to copy the actual results of your build processes. Finally, to use the development shell defined in this flake, you would run: \`\`\`shell nix develop \`\`\` This would open a shell with the combined outputs of \`derivationA\` and \`derivationB\`."},{"instruction":"俄罗斯Сипур公司信息","output":"Сипур (Центр исследования, обучения и инноваций) — российская компания, занимающаяся инжинирингом и консалтингом в области информационных технологий.

Cette analyse est essentielle pour s'assurer de la sécurité alimentaire et de la qualité des pâtisseries. Les principaux micro-organismes recherchés dans une analyse microbiologique de pâtisserie sont les bactéries pathogènes (telles que Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Listeria, etc.) et les levures et moisissures. Ces micro-organismes peuvent être présents dans les matières premières, l'environnement de production, ou se développer pendant le processus de fabrication et de stockage des pâtisseries. L'analyse microbiologique se fait généralement en mesurant le nombre total de micro-organismes présents dans un échantillon de pâtisserie. Pour cela, on prélève des échantillons représentatifs des produits à différents stades de production et de stockage, et on les met en culture dans des milieux spécifiques permettant de favoriser la croissance des micro-organismes recherchés. Une fois les micro-organismes cultivés, on peut les quantifier en utilisant des techniques telles que le dénombrement par comptage des colonies ou l'utilisation de techniques de biologie moléculaire (PCR par exemple). En plus de la recherche de micro-organismes pathogènes, l'analyse microbiologique des pâtisseries peut également inclure d'autres paramètres tels que la recherche de contaminants chimiques ou d'allergènes, ou l'évaluation des caractéristiques physico-chimiques du produit (pH, teneur en eau, etc.) qui peuvent influencer la croissance des micro-organismes. L'analyse microbiologique de pâtisserie permet de garantir la sécurité alimentaire en identifiant les risques potentiels liés à la présence de micro-organismes pathogènes, et d'adopter les mesures appropriées pour les éliminer ou les contrôler.

These events coalesced in an alternate timeline where the Great Ming State, known as Dà Míngguō, experienced an unexpected resurgence as the government of mainland China, casting a long shadow on the modern world stage. **The Fall of the People's Republic and Rebirth of the Ming** The People's Republic of China, under the iron rule of the CCP, with its ruthless suppression of dissent and expansionist ambitions, had stood as a bulwark of authoritarianism amidst a global wave of democratization. Yet, as the Berlin Wall crumbled in 1989, marking the denouement of the Cold War, cracks appeared within China's totalitarian edifice. Protests erupted nationwide, shaking confidence in the Party's grip over the nation. Rapidly, the PRC disintegrated, toppling in a manner as symbolic as the Berlin Wall's destruction. Following this revolutionary moment, the ancient dynasty of the Ming, under the aegis of the House of Zhu, was restored in a turn of events as dramatic as it was unforeseen. How did this restoration occur? Through a confluence of internal insurrections, external pressures, and a populace yearning for the romanticism of a bygone era, the Ming banner was raised anew over Beijing. **The Fate of the Captive Nations and International Politics** Wielding diminished power and besieged by economic challenges, the new Ming regime could not maintain the territorial integrity that the PRC once fiercely guarded. Nations such as East Turkestan, Tibet, Manchuria, and Inner Mongolia, long suppressed under the PRC's yoke, seized the moment to assert their independence, emboldened by the international community's appetite for self-determination. The international reaction to the upheaval in China was as diverse as the geopolitical interests at play. The USSR watched warily as one of its regional rivals unraveled, while the United States, once a staunch ally of the PRC against Soviet expansionism, found itself navigating a more complex diplomatic landscape. **The Re-emergence of Historical Entities and the Ripple Effect** No event of such magnitude occurs in isolation. The resurgence of the Ming in China sent shockwaves through East Asia. In Japan, once home to the Tokugawa bakufu, a nostalgic movement began clamoring to restore the Shogunate. This sentiment was underpinned by a desire to reassert Japan's historical identity and the perceived need to respond to a resurgent China. And what of former Japanese protectorates such as Manchukuo and Mengjiang? The political vacuum in mainland China saw factions within these territories advocating for renewed Japanese protection or independent sovereignty, further complicating regional dynamics. **The Puzzling Situation in Taiwan** Across the Taiwan Strait, the specter of war that loomed over the Republic of China had vanished with the PRC's collapse. No longer necessary as a bastion of anti-communist resistance, Taiwan confronted its identity. Some voices within the ROC, disillusioned with the authoritarian Kuomintang regime and inspired by Japan's momentum, pondered reintegration with a Japan that remembered its imperial past. **Korea: North and South, Divided Yet Attentive** Korea remained a peninsula divided, with the north under DPRK occupation, barely sustainable as a Soviet satellite, and the south governed by the ROK, itself an American proxy. The people of Korea, observing the renaissance of their neighbors, began to contemplate their own divided history and future. **Reflections on a Dynasty Reborn** The resurrection of an imperial dynasty in the modern age posed intriguing questions. Would the Ming embrace the principles of constitutional monarchy, balancing tradition with the demands of contemporary statecraft? Or would China revert to an antiquated absolutism, ripe for the conflicts of bygone eras? As the echoes of the Ming's restoration resonated through the corridors of history, it seemed that the grand tapestry of geopolitics was weaving a strange, yet familiar, pattern—a reminder that the past never truly dies, but often sleeps, awaiting the moment to re-enter the drama of the world."},{"instruction":"How can I write a proposal that serves as an electronic contract for someone who works freelance on the Internet to guarantee the client’s rights?","output":"Creating an effective electronic contract involves a clear outline of the terms, conditions, and expectations for both the freelancer and the client.

Cependant, beaucoup se nourrissent encore comme eux et leurs parents le faisaient en Union soviétique. À l’époque, les pénuries d’aliments frais et nutritifs étaient monnaie courante, et les gens devaient donc créer leurs propres alternatives bon marché, caloriques et saines. Tout manger avec du pain Presque tous les Russes ont du pain à la maison et ce phénomène a plusieurs causes. Premièrement, les Russes adorent les sandwichs. Ou, pour être plus précis, la version « russe », appelée « butterbrot » (de l’allemand « beurre » + « pain »). Habituellement, un butterbrot est juste une tranche de pain avec du beurre (facultatif) et quelque chose de facile à mettre dessus – une tranche de saucisson ou de fromage (ou du caviar rouge le soir du Nouvel An). Ce mets est toujours très rapide à réaliser. Deuxièmement, le pain a toujours été un accompagnement de base pour la plupart des aliments et plats, que ce soit le déjeuner ou le dîner, la soupe (bien sûr !) ou un plat principal. Les racines de cette habitude sont profondément ancrées dans l’histoire : de nombreuses régions soviétiques souffraient de la faim avant et pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Ainsi, le pain, cet aliment traditionnel russe, est devenu une sorte de « superaliment » – un complément calorique à chaque plat, et parfois même la seule chose que les gens mangeaient pendant de longs mois. Certaines babouchkas qui ont vécu la guerre mangeaient même de la pastèque avec du pain ! Les jeunes Russes modernes, au contraire, rejettent généralement le pain, car il favorise la prise de poids et les empêche de garder la ligne. Pas de soupe – pas de vrai déjeuner! Un déjeuner soviétique qui se respecte comprend généralement trois plats et un jus de fruits sucré (appelé kompot). Soit la formule salade + soupe + plat principal. C’est généralement ce qui est proposé au menu pour le déjeuner dans n’importe quel restaurant russe. La salade de légumes avec de l’huile de tournesol ou de la mayonnaise est bonne pour la digestion. La soupe regorge de graisses saines, tandis que le liquide chaud vous réchauffe. Et le plat principal fournit une bonne portion de glucides et de protéines (pâtes et poulet, purée de pommes de terre avec de la viande, riz avec du poisson, etc.). Enfin, une boisson sucrée à base de baies ou de fruits apporte les vitamines nécessaires. Ces repas à trois plats ont été créés par les autorités soviétiques pour les ouvriers des usines, car ils avaient besoin de suffisamment d’énergie pour mener à bien leur journée de travail. Entre-temps, ce schéma s’est avéré si populaire que les étudiants, les enfants des écoles maternelles et simplement les employés de bureau ont également commencé à manger ce type de repas. Les Russes ont deux proverbes populaires : « Le pain est au-dessus de tout » et « La soupe est au-dessus de tout ». Ainsi, sans soupe riche et bien chaude, un déjeuner n’est pas considéré comme complet. Cela dit, les petits enfants ne mangent généralement de la soupe qu’au déjeuner. C’est un moyen facile de leur apporter des acides gras, des fibres végétales ainsi que des liquides, car ils ne boivent généralement pas beaucoup. Il existe de nombreuses soupes que les Russes apprécient particulièrement : le bortsch à la betterave rouge, le chtchi au chou ou au chou aigre, la soupe aux pois, la soupe de poisson (également réalisée à base de poisson en conserve bon marché) et la soupe au poulet et aux nouilles (découvrez plus de soupes ici). D’étranges «soupes» chaudes et froides Pendant l’été, peu de gens aiment manger des soupes chaudes… Cependant, ils se sont habitués à prendre un plat liquide pour le déjeuner. C’est pourquoi les Russes ont créé une alternative froide : une soupe d’été appelée « okrochka ». Elle se compose d’œufs durs hachés, de légumes frais (concombres, beaucoup de fines herbes, radis) et de viande bouillie ou de saucisses. On verse ensuite sur ce mélange une boisson fermentée – du kvas ou du kéfir ! La plupart des étrangers ne supportent généralement pas ce plat étrange, au début… mais ensuite ils s’y habituent et en raffolent (même si certains y restent allergiques à jamais) ! Nos lecteurs étrangers sont souvent surpris en apprenant que les Russes mangent même de la soupe au petit-déjeuner (cela n’arrive pas souvent, et fait probablement référence au fait qu’on en consomme lors des lendemains de fête) ! Mais il existe un autre plat fou, semblable à une soupe, qui est souvent servi aux enfants au petit-déjeuner. Il s’agit de lait avec des nouilles (littéralement du lait chaud avec n’importe quelle sorte de pâtes) ! Ajouter du sucre à… n’importe quoi! En plus d’ajouter du lait aux pâtes, ces dernières peuvent aussi être consommées avec… une pincée de sucre ! Cela semble fou, mais de nombreux enfants russes raffolent de ce plat tout simple. Si votre enfant mange mal, c’est un excellent moyen d’ajouter des calories à son repas. Et si en plus vous avez un petit budget, c’est à la fois un dîner et un dessert dans une seule assiette ! Le sucre peut également être ajouté au sarrasin, au millet ou à toute autre bouillie, y compris à l’avoine. Mais on en met aussi sur le pain, dans la soupe (pour la rendre moins aigre) ou sur à peu près n’importe quoi, y compris les omelettes, le fromage cottage (tvorog) et bien d’autres plats. Si vous manquez de produits frais, en particulier de fruits et de légumes pendant le long hiver, comme c’était souvent le cas des Soviétiques, c’est un moyen simple et bon marché de rehausser le goût n’importe quel plat. Tout manger et ne pas gaspiller de nourriture! De nos jours, de nombreux jeunes Russes souffrent de troubles de l’alimentation. Et si les psychologues conseillent aux gens d’arrêter de manger lorsqu’ils sont rassasiés, nombreux sont ceux qui ne peuvent rien laisser dans leur assiette, car c’est ce que leurs grands-parents et leurs parents leur ont appris ! Les gens qui ont entendu parler des famines survenues au début de l’ère soviétique, et pendant le siège de Leningrad, savent que la nourriture ne doit pas être gaspillée, car on ne sait jamais quand on pourra manger la prochaine fois. Les mamans réprimandaient souvent les enfants s’ils laissaient de la nourriture dans leur assiette, car ceci était considéré comme du gaspillage d’argent et comme un manque de respect envers le cuisinier (c’est-à-dire votre mère ou votre grand-mère), sans parler de l’affront pour les millions de personnes affamées dans le monde ! Logiquement, gaspiller du pain était et est toujours considéré comme un péché ! C’est pourquoi le pain rassis était même utilisé pour différents plats (notamment pour la panure des côtelettes) ou simplement frit pour obtenir des croûtons. Salades bien grasses à la mayonnaise Quel est le premier plat fou qui vous vient à l’esprit quand vous pensez à la cuisine russe ? Le « hareng sous manteau de fourrure » en fait probablement partie ! « Le plat que j’aime le moins est le селедка под шубой [seliodka pod chouboï, hareng sous manteau de fourrure] », nous a écrit un lecteur sur notre chaîne Telegram. Cette salade controversée, mais toujours très populaire, se compose de hareng huileux et salé recouvert d’une « fourrure » de betteraves bouillies, de pommes de terre et de carottes moulues et d’une bonne dose de mayonnaise.En fait, il existe une longue liste de salades auxquelles les ménagères soviétiques ajoutaient de la mayonnaise (et qu’elles préparent encore aujourd’hui). Et chaque « chef » du foyer avait sa propre spécialité culinaire, préparée en mélangeant des ingrédients souvent très étranges et surprenants ! Légumes, viande, riz, poisson, etc… il pouvait y avoir toutes sortes d’ingrédients dans un bol et grâce à la mayonnaise… et tout se mariait bien ensemble ! Enfin, à peu près ! Passer des heures à boire du thé avec des sucreries « Les Russes mangent beaucoup de gâteaux et de tartes », écrit un autre lecteur. Et il a raison ! Les Russes sont obsédés par les tartes et autres pâtisseries, les biscuits, les chocolats et les bonbons. Si vous rendez visite à un Russe, prenez quelque chose « pour le thé » et vous serez accueilli à bras ouverts ! Boire du thé est une tradition nationale russe. Thé le matin (oui, pas de café), thé pour la pause, thé après le dîner ou même à la place du dîner… le thé, c’est bien plus qu’une boisson, et il est aussi synonyme de longues et émouvantes discussions de cuisine. La tradition des longues soirées où l’on boit le thé est ancienne. Elle est apparue à l’époque tsariste, lorsque les gens se réchauffaient à côté d’un « samovar » (une énorme théière en métal typiquement russe), en raison de sa grande quantité d’eau bouillante, tout en sirotant du thé et en faisant la causette.","output":"Les Russes peuvent passer des heures à boire du thé avec des sucreries. Les pâtisseries et les gâteaux sont souvent préparés à la maison et constituent le point culminant de toute réunion sociale. Les Russes prennent leur temps pour savourer chaque tasse de thé, accompagnée de tartes aux pommes, de torts au miel, de pain d'épices et de bonbons parfumés. C'est un rituel sacré, où les conversations se poursuivent et les liens se renforcent. Cependant, il est important de noter que les Russes modernes cherchent également à adopter une alimentation plus saine. Ils s'inspirent de la cuisine traditionnelle russe, mais ajoutent une touche de modernité en utilisant des ingrédients frais et nutritifs. Les légumes, les fruits et les produits laitiers jouent désormais un rôle plus important dans leur régime alimentaire, sans pour autant abandonner complètement les plats traditionnels russes. De plus en plus de restaurants et de cafés proposent également des options plus saines, en utilisant des ingrédients locaux et de saison. Les chefs russes revisitent les plats classiques, en les rendant plus légers et plus équilibrés, sans compromettre le goût et la qualité. Ces changements dans la culture alimentaire russe témoignent d'une prise de conscience croissante de l'importance d'une alimentation équilibrée et d'un mode de vie sain. Les Russes sont de plus en plus conscients des liens entre une bonne nutrition et leur bien-être physique et mental. Ils cherchent à faire de meilleurs choix alimentaires pour eux-mêmes et pour leurs familles. Bien que certains aspects de la cuisine russe traditionnelle puissent sembler étranges ou peu conventionnels pour les étrangers, ils font partie intégrante de la culture russe et sont appréciés pour leur richesse historique et leur valeur culturelle. Les Russes continuent de célébrer et de transmettre ces traditions culinaires, tout en intégrant de nouvelles approches pour répondre aux besoins de leur époque. En fin de compte, la cuisine russe est un mélange fascinant de tradition et d'innovation, où les Russes peuvent profiter d'une variété de plats délicieux, et où les échanges autour d'une tasse de thé restent un élément central de la convivialité russe. Que ce soit en mangeant du pain avec tout, en dégustant une soupe nourrissante ou en partageant des gâteaux lors d'une longue soirée de thé, la nourriture reste un lien précieux entre les générations et un reflet de l'histoire et de la culture russe."},{"instruction":"Chatbot Write an interesting, riveting, on-point and somewhat descriptive alternate history scenario in the form of a history book chapter, in which the Dà Míngguō [Great Ming State/Great Ming/Ming dynasty], which [the Dà Míngguō] was [the type of nation the Dà Míngguō was] an absolute imperial East Asian monarchy [the Dà Míngguō] which [the Dà Míngguō] was [what the Dà Míngguō was] the last [what the Dà Míngguō was the last of] the imperial monarchic dynastic states created by the traditional Han Chinese imperial dynastic system, which [the Dà Míngguō] was [the Dà Míngguō] ruled by [the reigning family leading the Dà Míngguō during its existence] the Zhūshì Huángshì [the Imperial House of Zhu/Chu] as [what the Zhūshì Huángshì ruled the Dà Míngguō as in its position as the Dà Míngguō’s reigning family] its [the Dà Míngguō’s] imperial family [the Zhūshì Huángshì], [the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family] which [the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family] ruled over [the East Asian nation the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family was the government of during its existence] Zhōngguó [Han China |Zhōngguó|, excluding |what provinces of China are excluded from Zhōngguó| Dongbei |Manchuria|, Xizang |Tibet|, Xingjiang |East Turkestan|, Nèi Měnggǔ |Inner Mongolia|, and Ningxia] from [the period of the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family’s rule over Zhōngguó during its |the Dà Míngguō’s| existence] 1368–1644, [the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family which ruled Zhōngguó from 1368-1644] is [the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family which ruled Zhōngguó from 1368-1644] restored [what the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family which ruled Zhōngguó from 1368-1644 is restored as] the government [the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family which ruled Zhōngguó from 1368-1644] of [the East Asian nation the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family which ruled Zhōngguó from 1368-1644 is restored as the government of] mainland China after [what causes the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family which ruled Han China from 1368-1644 to be restored as the government of mainland China] the fall of the de jure Marxist-Leninist but de-facto fascist and Han supremacist People’s Republic of China [PRC] ruled by [the ruling party PRC that ruled mainland China before the restoration of the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family as the government of mainland China] the Nazi-like CCP [Chinese Communist Party] as [what the CCP ruled the PRC that ruled mainland China before the restoration of the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family as] a one-party dictatorship [the PRC] during [the time period in which the PRC ruled by the CCP fell and the the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family was subsequently restored as the government of mainland China] the fall of the Berlin Wall in [when the Berlin Wall fell] 1989, [the PRC ruled by the CCP falling and the the Dà Míngguō ruled by the Zhūshì Huángshì as its imperial family subsequently being restored as the government of China in the aftermath during the fall of the Berlin Wall] as the Cold War between [the superpowers engaging in the Cold War] the Marxist-Leninist, expansionist communist dictatorship of the USSR [the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics] and [the USSR’s rival during the Cold War] the psuedo-liberal quasi fascist United States of America was [the Cold War between the USSR and the USA] coming to an end.

Among the most astonishing events was the resurgence of the Dà Míngguō, the Great Ming State, which had been an epitome of absolute imperial control under the esteemed Zhūshì Huángshì, the Imperial House of Zhu. They had reigned from 1368 until their fall in 1644, marking the end of the traditional Han Chinese imperial dynasty. The tumultuous events in mainland China, where the façade of Marxist-Leninist ideology crumbled under the reality of fascist tendencies and Han supremacy enforced by the rigid one-party dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led to an unlikely restoration. In the power vacuum left by the disintegrated People's Republic of China (PRC), the ancient Dà Míngguō, symbolizing cultural continuity and historical legitimacy, sprang forth like a phoenix from the ashes of its predecessor. The longing for stability and historical identity in a region fraught with the scars of modern warfare and recent totalitarianism made the once inconceivable restoration seem like the fated course of history. The reinstituted dynastic rule was, by necessity, more figurehead and ceremonial—a beacon of the traditional past guiding a nation into the future. The fall of the PRC also precipitated the unraveling of its territorial holdings. It found itself bereft of the capabilities to maintain its previously occupied territories: the Republic of East Turkestan, the Kingdom of Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Manchuria. These regions, with cultures and histories distinct from Han China, seized the opportunity, embarking on paths toward self-governance and international recognition. The newly resurrected Ming dynasty was compelled to recognize their sovereignty to maintain international legitimacy and to concentrate its energy on the reclamation and unification of Zhōngguó's core regions. The global reaction was a mosaic of disbelief, caution, and curiosity. The United States, preoccupied with its Cold War victory dance, and the Republic of Korea, a stern ally, were cautious but observably intrigued by the transformative developments. Meanwhile, the USSR, witnessing the revival of a once-forgotten dynasty, pondered the geopolitical implications with a mix of nostalgia for past empires and pragmatic acknowledgment of the new geopolitical landscape. Curiously, the seismic shifts in China echoed across the East China Sea, stirring a latent national sentiment in Japan. Conversations emerged about the potential resurrection of the Tokugawa bakufu, the shogunate which served as the de facto government alongside a revered yet ceremonially confined Daiwa no Koushitsu, the Imperial House of Yamato. As with the Great Ming's restoration, a yearning for cultural identity and historical reverence animated discussions over re-establishing the Tokugawa period of rule. These discussions, however, went further than mere historical reclamation. Japan speculated on the resurgence of its pre-World War II territorial protectorates: the Great Manchurian Empire and the Mongolian Autonomous Federation. As China turned inward, the power vacuum in the Asia-Pacific hinted at possibilities that would once have seemed implausible and brought with it the contemplation of a balance not seen since the days before the Pacific War. In this brave new world, the Republic of China (ROC), relegated to Taiwan and cloaked in the guise of a one-party Leninist-Stalinist military dictatorship, found itself at a historical crossroads. The fall of the PRC meant the ideological imperative of opposing communism was all but evaporated. In a move as pragmatic as it was symbolic, there were whispers of a desire to re-align with Japan—an echo of the old colonial relationship, transformed now into a strategic partnership molded by the new geopolitics of East Asia. Within mainland China, the adjustment was profoundly transformative. The descendants of the Zhūshì Huángshì, surprisingly advocates of modern governance, sought to forge a constitutional monarchy, harmonizing ancient imperial prestige with the aspirations for democracy and the rule of law. Their task was Herculean, entwining centuries-old traditions with the pressing need for modernization and progressiveness in a society eager to find its place in the contemporary world. As attention swept across the Han landscape, eyes also turned to the Korean Peninsula—divided, expectant, and vigilant. To the North, the Soviet satellite state, DPRK, tightened its grip; to the South, the ROK held steady with military steadfastness. The Korean people, with their kaleidoscopic history, watched as their powerful neighbors, steeped in dynastic revivalism and historical authority, reshaped the contours of East Asian identity. The question lingered: How would the Korean experience evolve in the shadow of these perennial giants, now reviving their own storied pasts?

Саша находится в госпитале и попал в летаргический сон. Сон действительно удивительный и безобидный: мягкая трава под ногами, сиреневое небо со звёздами.. Во сне ему видится Лёша, старый друг, с которым они не виделись много лет. Но постепенно добрый и безобидный сон начинает перерастать в кошмар, после которого Саша просыпается в холодном поту. (Примечание: добавьте в фанфик немного диалогов)","output":"Каждое утро, когда Саша просыпался в холодном поту после кошмарного сна, его сердце сжималось от боли и тревоги. Он не мог понять, почему его дремота, казавшаяся таким безобидным, превращалась в страшный кошмар, который казался реальностью. В один из таких дней, Саша блуждал по госпитальным коридорам с мыслями о своем старом друге Лёше. Спустя много лет неувиденных, Саша с ностальгией вспоминал их смех, бесконечные разговоры, беззаботные дни и их неуязвимость. Когда Саша остановился и опустился на скамейке, закрыв глаза, его сердце забилось в несколько раз быстрее обычного, и он вдруг почувствовал запах свежего воздуха, как будто находился на свободе. И когда он открыл глаза, перед ним стоял Лёша. \\"Привет, старый друг,\\" прошептал Саша смущенно. Лёша, с легкой усмешкой, наклонился и крякнул: \\"Ты всегда просыпаешься тогда, когда сознание пытается сбежать от реальности.\\" Саша смотрел на Лёшу с изумлением. \\"Ты реален? Я думал, тебя здесь только в моих снах.\\" Лёша улыбнулся и сел рядом на скамейку. \\"Не все так просто. Мы встречаемся в этом сне, потому что тебе нужна помощь, Саша.\\" \\"Что это за кошмары, Лёша?\\" шепотом спросил Саша, ощущая жуткое чувство дезориентации. Лёша опустил глаза, словно вспоминая что-то печальное. \\"Твои сны набираются из утраченных и нерешенных фрагментов прошлого, из воспоминаний и тайных страхов. Но все это взрывается в твоем сознании и создает кошмарное искажение. Я здесь, чтобы помочь тебе найти ответы и исцелиться.\\" Саша смотрел на своего друга, пытаясь осознать сложность ситуации. \\"Что мне нужно сделать?\\" Лёша взглянул на Сашу с нежностью и решимостью. \\"Ты должен погрузиться в свои страхи и прошлое, выяснить, что именно их питает. Только тогда путь к исцелению откроется перед тобой.\\" Саша задумчиво кивнул. Он понимал, что настало время прямо столкнуться со своими самыми глубокими и болезненными страхами. Вместе с Лёшей он по образу сна начал исследовать свой внутренний мир, открывая все более замысловатые пути и загадки. Они встретились с пережитыми событиями и разговаривали с голосами прошлого. Саша пережил боль, которую он долгие годы таил внутри себя. Он осознал, что единственный способ исцелиться - это принять свою боль, проигнорировать собственные страхи и восстановить внутренний мир. По мере того, как Саша стал все более смелым и отчаянным, кошмары начали уступать место спокойному сновидению. Он смог внутренне примириться со своим прошлым и найти в себе силу прощения и покоя. Когда Саша проснулся в своей госпитальной кровати, он улыбнулся. Время от времени страшные сны все еще возвращались, но теперь он знал, как им сопротивляться. Он больше не был пленником прошлого, а вместе с Лёшей стал свободным, готовым к новым приключениям. Их дружба и сила, которую они нашли вместе, помогли Саше пройти через самые мрачные участки его собственного сознания. Он был готов двигаться вперед и жить полной жизнью, зная, что в его сердце всегда есть место для дружбы и исцеляющей любви."},{"instruction":"Maak een hip gedicht voor mijn broer, hij is boer, heeft een grote boerderij, is zorgzaam voor zijn familie en zijn dieren, kan alles maken en daarom krijgt hij een gereedsschapskoffer","output":"In 't weidse veld, waar de winden loeien, Daar woont mijn broer, de stoere boer.

It is crucial to hold a collective responsibility in ensuring the well-being and protection of all individuals and communities across our great nation. Today, we want to shed light on an urgent matter - the need for improved gun control policies in America. Gun violence poses a significant threat to public health. Every year, countless lives are lost or irreversibly impacted by gun-related incidents. These tragic events not only devastate families and communities, but they also leave lasting scars on our society as a whole. It is imperative to acknowledge the complex nature of this issue. We respect the rights granted by the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms. However, we must strike a balance between the right to self-defense and the paramount importance of public safety. Enhanced gun control policies can provide a reliable framework to reduce the staggering number of gun-related incidents in our nation. These policies should focus on: 1. Comprehensive background checks: Strengthening the existing system to ensure that individuals with a history of violence, domestic abuse, or mental illness cannot access firearms. 2. Closing loopholes: Ensuring that all sales, including those at gun shows or online, are subject to the same background check requirements as those conducted through licensed dealers. 3. Safe storage requirements: Promoting responsible firearm ownership through measures that encourage secure storage and prevent unauthorized access to guns, particularly in households with children. 4. Red flag laws: Enabling law enforcement and concerned individuals to temporarily restrict access to firearms for individuals who display signs of posing a risk to themselves or others. 5. Improved access to mental health services: Bolstering mental health programs and resources to support early intervention, counseling, and treatment for at-risk individuals. By implementing these evidence-based measures, we aim to create a safer environment for all Americans. This is not about taking away rights; it's about finding a balance that protects our citizens while ensuring responsible gun ownership. Together, we can foster a culture of responsible gun ownership, where rights and safety go hand in hand. Let us engage in constructive dialogues, bridge divides, and work towards a common goal of reducing gun violence and promoting public health. Today, we urge our leaders, lawmakers, and fellow citizens to come together and advocate for the implementation of improved gun control policies. By doing so, we can protect lives, enhance public safety, and make a positive impact on the health and well-being of our great nation.

By taking proactive steps to enhance these policies, we can safeguard lives, promote public safety, and foster a healthier America for all. Gun violence devastates our communities, causing immeasurable pain, loss, and long-term physical and mental health consequences. It is high time that we confront this pressing public health crisis head-on. Comprehensive background checks are a crucial cornerstone of effective gun control policies. By strengthening and expanding the current system, we can prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands. This includes closing loopholes that enable sales without proper screening, ensuring all purchases – regardless of location or method – undergo comprehensive background checks. Another critical aspect is promoting responsible firearm storage. Securely storing guns in households, particularly those with children, reduces accidents, impulsive acts of violence, and access to firearms by unauthorized individuals. Safe storage measures serve as a preventive measure, protecting both households and communities from firearm-related tragedies. Red flag laws offer an opportunity for early intervention by temporarily restricting access to firearms for individuals who exhibit warning signs of posing a risk to themselves or others. These laws can serve as a vital tool for ensuring public safety and preventing potential acts of violence. Equally important is improving access to mental health services. Enhancing mental health programs, increasing resources, and reducing barriers to care can help identify and address mental health issues, reducing the risk of violence and self-harm. To build a safer and healthier America, we must engage in constructive dialogues, foster empathy, and bridge divides. Let us cultivate an atmosphere of mutual understanding and common purpose as we advocate for improved gun control policies.

Например, строка не должна содержать специальные символы, которые требуют использования фигурных скобок \`{}\` в \`SendKeys\`. 3. **Замедление процесса**: Увеличьте задержку перед вызовом \`SendKeys.SendWait(price);\` с помощью \`Thread.Sleep(milliseconds)\`. Возможно, системе необходимо больше времени для обработки предыдущих действий, прежде чем она будет готова принять ввод. 4. **Проблемы с OCR**: Удостоверьтесь, что OCR (оптическое распознавание символов) корректно выполняется и возвращает правильную строку для отправки. Для отладки можете вывести \`price\` в консоль или использовать \`MessageBox.Show(price);\` перед отправкой, чтобы визуально проверить строку. 5. **Безопасность приложения**: Некоторые приложения имеют защиту от автоматизированного программного ввода данных. Если программа, с которой вы взаимодействуете, блокирует \`SendKeys\`, вам может потребоваться найти другой метод автоматизации ввода. 6. **Права доступа**: Если ваше приложение запускается без административных прав, а целевое приложение запущено от имени администратора, это может препятствовать отправке ключей. Запустите ваше приложение от имени администратора и попробуйте снова. 7. **Альтернативные методы ввода**: Если проблемы продолжаются, вы можете использовать другие библиотеки автоматизации, такие как \`InputSimulator\` или \`Windows Input Simulator\`, которые могут предложить более надежные варианты для эмуляции клавиш. Начните с проверки и устранения каждого из этих потенциальных проблемных моментов, чтобы найти и решить источник проблемы с вводом значения."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Negotiation expert Fotini Iconomopoulos described writing chapters for what was to become her bestselling book Say Less, Get More, as “a soul-crushing experience.” “If you ask me to talk about negotiation, I can riff about it for hours,” she told me. “But as soon as I am sitting down at a computer, a lot of imposter syndrome creeps in. There is a mental barrier that makes me not want to put things on paper.” She sounds like a lot of the writers I work with. Why do so many writers get blocked, or find themselves writing in circles? Let’s consider this on a chapter level If you sit down to write and find that you can’t, the typical reason is that you don’t know what to write. And you don’t know what to write because you don’t know what job the chapter is supposed to do. Each chapter should answer a question for the reader. Even if you’re blocked, you surely can write that one question. Then create a reader objective. Write the objective in this form: “After reading this chapter, you will be able to…” For example, in Iconomopoulos’s negotiation book, the question Chapter 5 answers is, “How does the power balance between parties affect negotiation?” And the objective she might have written looks like this: “After reading chapter 5, you will be able to assess the power balance between yourself and your negotiation partner, and maximize your own power to improve your negotiating position.” Write the question and the objective, and you’re almost ready to write without pain. All you need is a fat outline. Writing a fat outline Among 172 published nonfiction authors that I surveyed, 47% said organizing content was among their biggest challenges. The solution to organizing content is what I call a fat outline. In contrast to the outlines we all learned in school—which are easy to write, skeletal, and useless—a fat outline has real substance to it. It’s basically a list of all the bits and pieces that will make up the chapter, in the order in which they’ll appear. Fat outlines are relatively easy to create, and essential to easing the task of writing. To create a fat outline, first assemble all the ingredients that belong in your chapter. There are five basic elements of which all nonfiction book chapters are constructed: Ideas and frameworks Stories (case studies and examples) Argumentation (reasoning) Proof points (data, quotes, citations) Advice (how-tos) Based on all the research you did and all the knowledge you’ve assembled so far, you’ve got a collection of this stuff, either in the form of research notes and interviews or perhaps as a partly formed idea or three in your head or something you wrote before. Now is the time to collect it all together. Open a file and dump inside what you’ve got for this chapter, including all five elements. To keep the size manageable, don’t dump entire hunks of research, just put a sentence or two to remind you what you have. Don’t worry about sentence fragments or grammar—this is just a set of notes that no reader will ever see. Now arrange the bits to form a story. That might sound challenging, but it’s not as hard as you might think. For example, this is one typical way to arrange a chapter: Here’s a story of someone facing a problem (case study). You can learn from what they learned (main idea). Here are the elements of that idea (framework). Here’s why that idea is valid and convincing (argumentation, supported by proof points). Taken together, here’s what that all means (idea, restated as conclusion). And here is what you should do about it (advice). Replace each of those sentences with actual content you’ve conceived, collected, or plan to create and you have a fat outline: a blueprint for the chapter. For a longer chapter, you may have multiple sets of ideas, arguments with proof points, and advice, or even additional case studies, but the fat outline is still going to be just a page or two, so assembling it won’t be a difficult or time-consuming effort. Making a fat outline is a low-stakes, low-stress activity. You can whip one up in an hour or less. And it’s pretty much immune to writer’s block, because writing down little notes and moving them around doesn’t tap into the “people will be reading this, what if it sucks” anxiety of imposter syndrome. You can mangle grammar, misspell words or include cryptic things that only you understand. Since the plan is only for you, you can include anything that reminds you what the pieces mean including pasted-in graphics, small chunks of prose, or links to web content you’ve researched. Fat outlines are easy to play around with and rearrange, just a matter of moving a few scraps of text here or there, or adding or deleting a few things. They remind you of all the pieces you have, so you won’t forget anything when it’s time to write. And when you put things in a logical order, they define a storyline for your writing. I have one more tip about the fat outline and the chapter that will emerge from it. Your temptation will be to start with an introduction of the idea. But consider starting with a case study, plunging people immediately into a narrative. People love stories. They will absolutely read that story to find out what happened. And after the story, in the warm glow of the story’s happy (or tragic) ending, your reader is primed to believe virtually anything you say. This is where you tie the story to your main idea. Romanced by the story, the reader then falls for your idea, and your chapter is off and running. Now write the chapter With the fat outline in front of you, “just write” is no longer terrifying. Write the opening story. Write the powerful main idea of the chapter. Then write the rest of the bits you’ve mapped out in the fat outline. This is easier because you’ve divided the chapter into tractable tasks. If you have 45 minutes, write out an argument. Or take an hour or two and write a section summarizing secondary research. You don’t even have to write these pieces in order. You can just flesh out the fat outline into text and you’ll have written a draft of a chapter. And don’t worry too much about whether each word and sentence is perfect; you can always improve it in the next stage of revision. The fat outline is a scaffolding to guide and support you, but you don’t have to slavishly follow it. You might decide to put things in a different order than the outline suggests, or add or delete sections. Nobody will know you didn’t exactly follow the outline. It’s just there as an aid to getting words down on the page. And remember, you have many more tools than sentences and paragraphs. You can divide the chapter up into pieces with section headings and subheadings. Bulleted or numbered lists make sets of items easier to scan. You can use graphics to illuminate concepts or quote whole paragraphs of other work (with appropriate credit and permission, of course). A chapter written with these types of elements will be more approachable on the page and more palatable to readers. It’s less stressful to write by mixing up these elements; it creates a chapter that is more interesting to read as well. Now you have a plan for writing your chapter. Start with a reader question. Define an objective for the reader. Assemble your content into a fat outline. Then flesh it out. As Iconomopoulos later remarked, this method “would have saved me months of excruciating rewrites.” Writing chapters doesn’t have to be painful. You just have to approach it systematically.

Multi-user.target is a systemd target unit that represents the system state when all regular users and services are fully set up. 2) In systemd, service files represent specific system services and contain configuration information for their execution. Targets are logical units used to group and order services based on dependencies. Other types of files in systemd, such as timers or sockets, have specific purposes related to scheduling or managing communication channels."},{"instruction":"Is it not always root that's the owner for service files?

Be very concise.","output":"Yes, even custom service files are typically owned by the root user."},{"instruction":"Elaborate on the stuff above regarding dependencies.","output":"In systemd, dependencies are used to ensure that services start in the correct order and satisfy their requirements. Each service or target unit can define dependencies on other units. When a unit has dependencies, systemd ensures that the required units are started before the dependent unit. Dependencies can be specified using various directives such as \`Requires\`, \`Wants\`, \`Before\`, and \`After\`. \`Requires\` makes a unit a hard dependency, meaning if the required unit fails, the dependent unit will also fail. \`Wants\` is a soft dependency, where the dependent unit can still start even if the required unit fails. The \`Before\` and \`After\` directives define the order in which units should be started. \`Before\` ensures that a unit starts before the specified units, while \`After\` ensures that a unit starts after the specified units. By managing dependencies, systemd allows for efficient and orderly execution of services and targets during the system's startup process or runtime management."},{"instruction":"What does WantedBy=multi-user.target do?","output":"The \`WantedBy=multi-user.target\` directive in a systemd unit file specifies that the unit should be automatically started when the system reaches the multi-user.target.

Explain in an easy-to-understand manner that's concise.","output":"When a service remains in an active state, it means that even after the main task or script associated with the service completes, the service itself continues to be considered \\"running\\" by the system. In other words, the service is still active and managed by the system, even though the initial task it was responsible for has finished. In the case of the \`autobackup.service\` file, it specifies \`RemainAfterExit=yes\`, which means that even after the slow backup script completes its execution, the service will still be marked as active. This can be useful in situations where the service has additional monitoring or cleanup tasks to perform, or if it needs to keep some resources or configurations active even after the primary task is done. To summarize, the service remaining in an active state means that it continues to be recognized and managed by the system, even after the main backup script has finished running."},{"instruction":"What do you mean by \\"managed by the system\\"?","output":"When we say that a service is \\"managed by the system,\\" it means that the system is responsible for starting, stopping, monitoring, and controlling the service's execution. The system keeps track of the service's status, handles its dependencies, and ensures that it behaves according to its configured parameters. In the case of the \`autobackup.service\` file, being managed by the system means that the systemd initialization system will automatically start the service when the system reaches the appropriate state, in this case, the multi-user target. The system will also keep track of the service's execution, allowing you to check its status, restart it if necessary, or stop it when needed. The system's management of a service involves handling its lifecycle, coordinating dependencies, logging its activities, and providing mechanisms for service control and monitoring. By being managed by the system, the service becomes an integral part of the system's overall operation and can be controlled and monitored effectively."},{"instruction":"What if the /mnt/BACKUP directory does not exist? What would happen with the autobackup.service file?","output":"If the \`/mnt/BACKUP\` directory does not exist, and it is specified as a requirement in the \`autobackup.service\` file, the service will fail to start properly. When systemd tries to start the service, it will check the mentioned directory's existence as a dependency. Since the directory does not exist, systemd will not be able to satisfy the dependency requirement. Consequently, the service will not start, and an error message indicating the missing directory will likely be logged. To resolve this issue, you would need to ensure that the \`/mnt/BACKUP\` directory exists before attempting to start the \`autobackup.service\` or modify the service configuration to use an existing directory as per your backup requirements."},{"instruction":"1) What does ExecStop do? 2) What does oneshot do? 3) What bad things could happen if RemainAfterExit=no? Be very concise for everything I asked.","output":"1) \`ExecStop\` specifies a command or script to be executed when stopping or terminating a service. It defines the action to be taken when the service is requested to be stopped, allowing for clean-up tasks or final actions before the service is terminated. 2) \`oneshot\` is a service type in systemd that signifies the service performs a single task and then exits. Once the specified task or script is completed, the service is considered to have finished its job and will be marked as inactive. 3) If \`RemainAfterExit=no\`, it means that the service will be marked as inactive once the main task or script associated with it completes. Consequently, if there are additional tasks or ongoing functionalities relying on the service being considered active, they may be disrupted or cease to function correctly if the service is marked as inactive prematurely."},{"instruction":"About 1, in this case, which service would be terminated? Be very concise.","output":"In this case, the service that would be terminated is the one associated with the \`autobackup.service\` file."},{"instruction":"For 1, what if ExecStart were used instead? For 2, what is a common alternative to oneshot? For 3, Can other services for which this one is a dependency make this dependency exit such that this one doesn't have to make itself exit? Be very concise for everything I asked.","output":"1) If \`ExecStart\` were used instead of \`ExecStop\`, it would specify a command or script to be executed when starting the service, rather than when stopping it. 2) A common alternative to \`oneshot\` is \`simple\`. The \`simple\` service type is used for long-running services that stay active and continue running in the background. 3) No, other services cannot directly make a dependent service exit. The dependent service must handle its own exit and termination. The dependency relationship only ensures that the dependent service starts after the required services are running but does not provide a mechanism for the dependent service to force the exit of its dependencies."},{"instruction":"So, for 3, if this service has RemainAfterExit=yes, then the service would run until the system shuts down or the user manually stops it? Be very concise.","output":"Yes, if the service has \`RemainAfterExit=yes\` and does not receive any explicit stop or signal, it will continue to run until the system shuts down or until it is manually stopped by the user."},{"instruction":"How can I check if my service ran or not?","output":"You can check if your service ran by using the \`systemctl\` command in Linux. Here are a few helpful commands: 1. To check the status of a service: \`\`\` systemctl status <your-service-name> \`\`\` 2. To view the log output of a service: \`\`\` journalctl -u <your-service-name> \`\`\` 3. To check if a service successfully started or if there were any errors: \`\`\` systemctl is-active <your-service-name> \`\`\` These commands will provide information about the service's current status, log outputs, and whether it is active or inactive. You can replace \`<your-service-name>\` with the actual name of your service."},{"instruction":"Is it okay if ExecStop refers to a desktop of a regular user?","output":"No, it is not recommended for the \`ExecStop\` directive in a systemd service file to refer to the desktop of a regular user. The reason is that systemd services typically run with elevated privileges (such as root) and have restricted access to user-specific desktop environments. The purpose of \`ExecStop\` is to specify a command or script that is executed when stopping or terminating the service. It is generally advised to use system-level commands or scripts in this context that do not rely on user-specific resources or environments. If there is a need to perform actions related to a user's desktop or session, it is better to handle them within a targeted user-specific service or script, rather than using \`ExecStop\` in a system-wide service where it may not have the necessary access or dependencies."},{"instruction":"Regardless of whether or not it's recommended, would it work? Be very concise.","output":"Yes, regardless of whether it's recommended or not, specifying the desktop of a regular user in the \`ExecStop\` directive may work depending on the specific circumstances and configurations. However, there may be limitations or access issues since systemd services typically run with elevated privileges and have restricted access to user-specific resources. It is generally advised to use system-level commands or scripts for \`ExecStop\` in systemd service files."},{"instruction":"Where should the script be?","output":"The script in question can be placed in any location, but a common convention is to store custom scripts in the \`/usr/local/bin/\` directory or a subdirectory within it. This location is typically reserved for locally-installed system-wide scripts that are not managed by the system package manager. Additionally, ensure that the script has appropriate permissions set to allow execution."},{"instruction":"My service doesn't run. Do I need to do systemctl enable for it, first? What would be the command for my example above? Be very concise.","output":"Yes, you need to enable the service using \`systemctl enable\` command for it to run automatically on system startup. For your example service \`autobackup.service\`, the command would be: \`\`\` systemctl enable autobackup.service \`\`\` This command will create the necessary symbolic links to enable the service and configure it to start automatically during system boot."},{"instruction":"Can I check timestamps on partitions? If so, how? Be very concise.","output":"Yes, you can check the timestamps on partitions. The \`lsblk\` command can be used to display information about block devices, including partitions. By adding the \`-o\` flag followed by specific columns such as \`NAME\`, \`MOUNTPOINT\`, \`FSTYPE\`, \`MOUNTTIME\`, \`FSROLES\`, and \`FWVER\`, you can extract relevant information about the partitions, including their timestamps. Here's an example command: \`\`\` lsblk -o NAME,MOUNTPOINT,FSTYPE,MOUNTTIME,FSROLES,FWVER \`\`\` This command will display the names, mount points, file system types, mount timestamps, file system roles, and firmware versions of the partitions."},{"instruction":"Can a service run a script that appends to a txt file?","output":"Yes, a service can run a script that appends to a text file. The script can utilize file manipulation commands such as \`echo\`, \`cat\`, or \`printf\` along with output redirection to append content to a text file. For example, if you have a script named \`append_script.sh\` that appends text to a file, you can configure your service to execute this script. Here's an example of how the service file (\`your_service.service\`) could look: \`\`\`plaintext [Unit] Description=Your Service [Service] ExecStart=/path/to/append_script.sh [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target \`\`\` Make sure the script has the necessary permissions to write to the targeted text file."},{"instruction":"journalctl -u autobackup.service shows that the service ran, but no txt file was created since the txt file that is to be appended doesn't already exist.","output":"If the text file doesn't exist before the service runs and the service is configured to append to that file, it might result in an error. Services typically require the target file to exist before they can append to it. To resolve this issue, you can modify the service or the associated script to handle the creation of the text file if it doesn't already exist. For example, you can include a command like \`touch /path/to/file.txt\` within the script to create an empty file before appending to it. Ensure that the service or script has the necessary permissions to create the file in the desired location."},{"instruction":"I meant the service runs a script which should append text to a txt fil.","output":"Apologies for the confusion. If the service runs a script that is expected to append text to a text file, and the text file does not exist, it may result in an error. The script will fail to append the text because the file does not exist. To overcome this issue, you can modify the script to include a check for the existence of the text file. If the file does not exist, you can create it before attempting to append the text. This can be achieved using commands like \`touch\` or \`mkdir\`, depending on your specific requirements. By incorporating the necessary logic within the script, you can handle the scenario where the text file needs to be created before appending to it."},{"instruction":"lsblk -o MOUNTTIME does not work","output":"Apologies for the confusion.

Ecco una guida che ti aiuterà ad affrontare il problema: 1. Visita dal veterinario: Prima di tutto, è importante assicurarsi che il tuo gatto sia sano. Una visita dal veterinario può escludere qualsiasi problema di salute che potrebbe causare un aumento dell'appetito del tuo gatto. 2. Fornisci una dieta bilanciata: Assicurati che il cibo che stai dando al tuo gatto sia equilibrato e soddisfi tutte le sue esigenze nutrizionali. Parla con il veterinario per capire se hai scelto il cibo giusto per il tuo gatto e se la quantità è adeguata. 3. Rispetta gli orari dei pasti: Stabilisci un orario regolare per i pasti del tuo gatto e mantienilo costante. Evita di dare cibo extra o spuntini fuori pasto, in quanto questo può incoraggiare il comportamento di chiedere cibo continuamente. Se il tuo gatto inizia a \\"implorare\\" cibo al di fuori degli orari dei pasti, ignora semplicemente il suo comportamento. 4. Divertimento e stimolazione: Assicurati che il tuo gatto abbia sufficiente stimolazione mentale ed esercizio fisico. Gioca con lui regolarmente utilizzando giocattoli interattivi o altre attività che richiedano impegno fisico. Il tuo gatto potrebbe essere annoiato o ansioso, e il cibo potrebbe diventare una fonte di comfort per lui. Dando al tuo gatto attività alternative, potresti ridurre il suo desiderio compulsivo di mangiare. 5. Evita di accontentare il tuo gatto: Se il tuo gatto cerca di attirare la tua attenzione chiedendo cibo, non cedere al suo comportamento richiedendo cibo extra. Ignoralo e ricompensalo solo quando si comporta in modo appropriato. Se cerchi di accontentarlo ogni volta che chiede cibo, gli stai insegnando che il comportamento sbagliato viene premiato e quindi continuerà a farlo. 6. Mantieni l'ambiente del tuo gatto interessante: Tieni il tuo gatto coinvolto e impegnato nel suo ambiente. Offri giochi per gatti, grattatoi e posti in cui arrampicarsi. Questo migliorerà il benessere del tuo gatto e distrarrà la sua mente dal desiderio di mangiare sempre. 7. Evita l'eccesso di cibo: Se il tuo gatto ha accesso a cibo sempre disponibile, potrebbe assumere più calorie di quante ne abbia bisogno. Assicurati che il tuo gatto abbia la quantità di cibo raccomandata dal veterinario e non lasciare cibo fuori tutto il giorno. Ricorda, è importante essere pazienti e costanti quando si cerca di insegnare al tuo gatto nuovi comportamenti. Se il problema persiste nonostante tutte le tue strategie, potrebbe essere utile consultare un esperto di comportamento felino per un aiuto professionale."},{"instruction":"подробно изучи и пропиши на 2 страницы основные темы, затронутые в “Рубаи”.

Приведите цитаты отражающие каждую тему и проанализируйте, как они помогают читателю размышлять и искать ответы на эти вопросы.","output":"\\"Рубаи\\" — это собрание четырехстиший, написанных персидским философом и поэтом Омар Хайямом. В своих стихотворениях Омар Хайям охватывает большое количество различных тем, которые поражают своей глубиной и философскими наблюдениями. Одной из главных тем, которую освещает Омар Хайям, является мотив времени. Автор обращает внимание на то, как быстро течет время и как быстро проходят годы жизни. Он показывает бренность жизни и временность всех вещей. В одном из стихотворений он пишет: \\"Сбежали наши дни, как ветры, веки. / Едет тысяча коней – посмотри на следы\\" (пер. Дмитрия Кедрина). Эта цитата отражает печальное осознание быстротечности времени и призывает читателя обратить внимание на то, как быстро пролетают годы, и не откладывать радость и счастье на потом. Кроме времени, Омар Хайям также затрагивает тему бренности жизни. Он говорит о том, что все в этой жизни временно, и что мы не должны слишком привязываться к материальным вещам. В одном из стихотворений он пишет: \\"миражю поспешит позавтра\\" (пер. Георгия Адуева). Эта цитата подчеркивает, что все наши достижения и материальные блага могут исчезнуть в любой момент, поэтому важно найти внутреннюю мудрость и смысл жизни, не полагаясь на внешние обстоятельства. В \\"Рубаи\\" Омар Хайям также обращает внимание читателя на поиск истины и смысла жизни. В нескольких стихотворениях он говорит о том, что истина недостижима для человека, и что мы должны принять этот факт. В одном из стихотворений он пишет: \\"Плачешь: почему мир толком не разгадан! / Этото бесконечное пустошью жесть?\\" (пер. Д.Кедрина). Эта цитата заставляет читателя задуматься о том, что истина может быть недоступна для нашего понимания, и что мы должны принять эту неопределенность и искать смысл жизни в других аспектах, таких как любовь, красота и природа. В \\"Рубаи\\" Омар Хайям также обращается к природе и истинной мудрости. Он часто использует образы природы, чтобы выразить свои размышления и философские идеи. Он говорит о том, что природа является источником истинной мудрости и ненавязчивого наставления. В одном из стихотворений он пишет: \\"Мой Источник — как свет, сиянье лазура; / Красиво мне, когда душу Древо касает: / В листве его отражаю сам себя, / В смысле его нахожу уравненье себя\\" (пер. Г.Адуева). Эта цитата показывает, как природа может помогать нам найти истинную мудрость и понять себя через отражение в ее красоте и смысле. В своих \\"Рубаи\\" Омар Хайям затрагивает такие основные темы, как время, бренность жизни, поиск истины, смысла жизни, природа и истинная мудрость.

In conclusion, if the Republic Act No. 91155 has successfully achieved its goals of promoting quality education and ensuring equal access to education for all citizens, while also establishing a comprehensive framework for the education system, then I would have a positive opinion about the law."},{"instruction":"Глава 1: Принципы работы лазерных принтеров","output":"Лазерные принтеры - это устройства, которые используют лазерную технологию для создания высококачественных отпечатков. Они работают по следующим основным принципам: 1. Лазерный луч: Сначала, лазерный принтер генерирует узкий лазерный луч, который сканирует поверхность, называемую фотобарабаном или фотоцилиндром. Лазерный луч переносит информацию о том, где на поверхности фотоцилиндра должны быть созданы зарядовые пятна. 2. Зарядовые пятна: После сканирования лазером, фотоцилиндр заряжается электрическим полем. Зарядовое состояние фотоцилиндра определяет, где на нем будут создаваться зарядовые пятна, соответствующие изображению, которое будет напечатано. 3. Тонер: Затем, тонер – специальный порошок, состоящий из частиц черного, белого или цветного пигмента – наносится на поверхность фотобарабана. Тонер прилипает только к заряженным участкам фотоцилиндра, создавая зарядовые пятна. 4. Перенос изображения: Затем бумага проходит над фотоцилиндром и зарядовые пятна с тонером передаются на нее, образуя изображение. Это происходит благодаря электрическому притяжению между заряженными пятнами на фотобарабане и бумагой. 5. Фиксация изображения: Наконец, изображение на бумаге проходит через нагревательный элемент, называемый фиксатором. Под воздействием тепла, тонер расплавляется и проникает в волокна бумаги, закрепляясь там. Таким образом, изображение остается на бумаге, после чего оно охлаждается и становится стойким к стиранию. Таким образом, лазерные принтеры предлагают высокую скорость и качество печати, а также могут работать с разнообразными типами бумаги и материалов. Они широко используются в офисах и домашних условиях для создания документов, фотографий и других печатных материалов."},{"instruction":"\\"brook\\" (small river) in Latin, French, and Italian language, please","output":"In Latin: - The word for \\"brook\\" in Latin is \\"rivulus\\" or \\"rivus.\\" In French: - The word for \\"brook\\" in French is \\"ruisseau.\\" In Italian: - The word for \\"brook\\" in Italian is \\"ruscello.\\""},{"instruction":"","output":"Can you please provide more information or detail about what you would like to know regarding video compression?"},{"instruction":"red rice development and prospect","output":"\\"Red rice\\" usually refers to a type of rice with reddish bran layers, which can be either a traditional variety or a hybrid variety.

Within the template, two containers are defined, \`container1\` and \`container2\`, each with their respective container images and ports. You can adjust the number of replicas according to your requirements, and you can also define additional containers within the \`containers\` section as needed. Just make sure to provide a unique name for each container and specify the desired image and ports for them."},{"instruction":"Ok so I have that yaml file in project repository how this is connected with docker images. Where are these images?","output":"In Kubernetes, the YAML file you create defines the desired state of your microservice deployment, which includes specifying the containers' images. The Docker images associated with your microservices need to be built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry) before you can use them in Kubernetes. The container registry is where the Docker images are stored and can be easily accessed. To connect the YAML file with the Docker images, you need to replace the placeholder image names (\`microservice-image:latest\`, \`another-image:latest\`) in the YAML file with the actual image names and versions that correspond to the images you have built and pushed to your container registry. For example, if you push the \`microservice-image:latest\` and \`another-image:latest\` to Docker Hub, you can replace the image names in the YAML file as follows: \`\`\`yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-microservice spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-microservice template: metadata: labels: app: my-microservice spec: containers: - name: container1 image: your-dockerhub-username/microservice-image:latest ports: - containerPort: 8080 - name: container2 image: your-dockerhub-username/another-image:latest ports: - containerPort: 8081 \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`your-dockerhub-username\` with your actual Docker Hub username. By specifying the correct image names in the YAML file, Kubernetes will use those images from the container registry when creating and running the containers for your microservices."},{"instruction":"My dockerhub is local instance or remote instance?","output":"By default, Docker Hub refers to the public, cloud-based container registry provided by Docker. It is a remote instance where you can store and retrieve your Docker images. Docker Hub allows you to access and share container images with others easily. However, it is also possible to set up a local instance of Docker Registry, which can act as a private container registry within your infrastructure. This local Docker Registry can be hosted on-premises or within a private network. If you are referring to a Docker Hub local instance, it means you have set up a private registry that is similar to Docker Hub but hosted locally or within your private network. In this case, you would need to specify the URL or address of your local Docker Hub instance instead of using \`docker.io\` (the default Docker Hub URL) when pushing or pulling images. For example, if your local Docker Hub is hosted at \`myregistry.local\`, you would push an image to it using the following command: \`\`\` docker push myregistry.local/myimage:tag \`\`\` And you would specify the corresponding image URL in the Kubernetes YAML file, as explained in the previous responses."},{"instruction":"مقایسه ی دستاورد های انقلاب اسلامی ایران قبل و بعد از انقلاب اسلامی ایران. آمادگی دفاعی دهم","output":"در مقایسه دستاوردهای انقلاب اسلامی ایران قبل و بعد از انقلاب، می‌توان به موارد زیر اشاره کرد: ۱. حفظ استقلال و سیادت: یکی از دستاوردهای انقلاب اسلامی، حفظ استقلال و سیادت ایران است. قبل از انقلاب، ایران تحت تأثیر قدرت‌های خارجی قرار داشت و دستورات آنان را اجرا می‌کرد. این امر با برپایی نظام جمهوری اسلامی تغییر کرده و ایران به عنوان یک کشور مستقل و خودرو برخوردار از سیادت خود شناخته می‌شود. ۲. تحولات اجتماعی: تحولات اجتماعی در دوران پس از انقلاب بسیاری شامل تحولات ارزش‌ها، رفتارها و نگرش‌ها بود. از جمله مهم‌ترین تغییرات می‌توان به تغییر در قوانین ازدواج و طلاق، حقوق زنان و حضور آنان در عرصه‌های اجتماعی و سیاسی، تربیت اسلامی و توجه بیشتر به اخلاق و مسائل اخلاقی، توجه به حقوق شهروندی و خدمت به مردم و ... اشاره کرد. ۳. توسعه اقتصادی و صنعتی: بعد از انقلاب، حمایت از تولید داخلی و صنعت‌های داخلی مورد توجه قرار گرفت. به دلیل تغییر سیاست‌ها و تمرکز بر توسعه داخلی، بسیاری از صنایع بزرگ و کوچک در کشور تشکیل شدند و ایران توانست در برخی از زمینه‌ها به خودکفایی برسد. همچنین، توجه به صنایع تکنولوژیک و رشد تکنولوژی در دوران پس از انقلاب نقش مهمی در توسعه صنعتی ایران داشت. ۴. حمایت از کشاورزی: پس از انقلاب، توجه بیشتری به کشاورزی و حفظ منابع طبیعی شد. سیاست‌های دولت به‌گونه‌ای بود که تولید محصولات کشاورزی در داخل کشور افزایش یابد و وابستگی به واردات کاهش یابد. در این راستا، برنامه‌های توسعه سرزمین‌های زراعی، افزایش حجم آبیاری، ایجاد صنایع فراوری محصولات کشاورزی و ... انجام شد. اما لازم به ذکر است که این تحولات و دستاوردها نیز ممکن است نقدها و انتقاداتی را به دنبال داشته باشند و هرچند انقلاب اسلامی در برخی زمینه‌ها موفق بوده است، اما در بسیاری از زمینه‌ها همچنان نیاز به بهبود و توسعه دارد."},{"instruction":"مقایسه‌ی دستاورد های انقلاب اسلامی ایران قبل و بعد از انقلاب اسلامی ایران. آمادگی دفاعی دهم کامل و نسبتا طولانی.","output":"دقت کنید که من روبات هستم و برای پرداختن به سؤالات پیچیده و جامع نیازمند زمان و تخصص خاصی هستم. با این وجود، در زیر می‌توانید یک نقطه نظر کلی در مورد مقایسه دستاوردهای انقلاب اسلامی ایران قبل و بعد از آن از لحاظ آمادگی دفاعی ببینید: قبل از انقلاب اسلامی، نیروهای مسلح ایران که تحت عملکرد پادشاهی قرار داشتند، با مزایایی مانند قدرت نظامی قابل توجه، نیروی هوایی و دریایی قدرتمند و تربیت آمریکایی بودن ساختار سازمانی مزیت‌هایی داشتند. همچنین، ایران عضو حضور قوی در سازمان پیمان ناتو بود. بعد از انقلاب اسلامی، تغییراتی در سازمان و قواعد نیروهای مسلح ایران رخ داد. وقوع جنگ تحمیلی با عراق پس از انقلاب باعث شد تا نیاز به آمادگی دفاعی ایجاد شود. در این جنگ، ایران موفق به جلوگیری از پیشروی نیروهای عراقی شد. اما در این نزاع نیز میزان تلفات بسیاری برای ایران بود و به تبع آن، ایران نیازمند توسعه و بهبود آمادگی دفاعی شد. به مرور زمان، ایران توانسته است در زمینه آمادگی دفاعی پیشرفت کند و به کسب مواردی مانند خودکفایی در تولید سلاح های مورد نیاز و تکنولوژی دفاعی برسد. همچنین، توجه به توسعه نیروی دریایی و هوایی و ارتقای ظرفیت دفاعی کشور جزء دستاوردهای مهم در زمینه آمادگی دفاعی است. از طرفی، لازم به ذکر است که این تحولات با نیازهای استراتژیک و ضرورت‌های کشور در فرایندی طولانی و پیچیده رخ داده است و همچنین تأمین بودجه و تکنولوژی لازم برای این زمینه نیز تحت تأثیر تحریم‌های اقتصادی قرار گرفته است."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

Git Flow Git Flow 是最早的分支策略之一，非常适合版本发布的工作流程。它涉及到以下类型的分支： - **主分支 (master)**：始终反映生产环境中的代码状态。 - **开发分支 (develop)**：作为新功能开发的集成分支。 - **功能分支 (feature branches)**：用于开发新功能，从\`develop\`分支中分出，并最终合并回\`develop\`。 - **发布分支 (release branches)**：当准备发布一个新版本时，从\`develop\`分支分出，用于准备即将发布的版本，最后合并回\`master\`和\`develop\`。 - **维护/热修复分支 (hotfix branches)**：当生产环境中的代码需要紧急修复时，从\`master\`分支分出，并最终合并回\`master\`和\`develop\`。 # 2. GitHub Flow GitHub Flow 是一个更简单直接的模式，适用于持续部署环境。它的核心思想是： - \`master\`分支始终是可以部署的。 - 新功能开发时，从\`master\`创建新的分支。 - 推送到远程分支，并频繁提交来共享进度。 - 开发完成后，通过Pull Request请求他人进行代码审查。 - 一旦代码审查通过并确认运行良好，就合并到\`master\`分支。 - 立即部署\`master\`分支。 # 3. GitLab Flow GitLab Flow 是在 Git Flow 和 GitHub Flow 基础上的一个实践指导，主要思想如下： - 使用它来适应从静态环境到动态环境的不同类型的部署。 - \`master\`分支用于稳定的产品版本。 - 为每一个环境（比如\`prod\`，\`staging\`）维护一个分支。 - 功能开发完毕后，通过Merge Request合并回\`master\`或环境对应分支。 # 4. Feature Branch Workflow 在这种工作流中，所有的特性开发都在独立的功能分支上完成，并且只有当功能完全开发好时，才会合并到\`master\`。 - \`master\`分支代表了可以作为最新发布已知的代码。 - 每个新功能在自己的分支上开发，独立于\`master\`。 - 一旦功能完成，它将通过Pull Request合并回\`master\`。 # 选择合适的工作流 选择合适的分支管理策略时，应考虑团队大小、项目复杂度、发布频率和持续集成 / 持续部署（CI/CD）等实践。一个好的工作流可以帮助保持代码库的稳定性和提高团队的生产力，但它必须适应团队和项目的具体需求。 无论选择哪种工作流，总的目标都是实现代码的有效管理和可靠部署，同时还要确保团队成员能够高效地协作。"},{"instruction":"где ошибка?

Сегодня здесь не так много народа. Рояль, теперь уже одиноко стоящий посреди зала, окружён заполненными столиками. Столы, стоящие поодаль от мнимого пространства сцены, сегодня совершенно пустуют. Стоит ли этому удивляться? День посреди недели всегда выглядит, словно пятно от чернил на кристально-белой скатерти. Эта среда не стала исключением. Я ещё раз обвела взглядом это место и все таки села. К роялю подошёл некий молодой человек, из зала послышались крики (видимо его знакомых), и парень уселся на весь стул, допуская тем самым грубейшую ошибку, которую только может совершить музыкант. Мерно по залу побежала музыка, судя по всему, это был шансон. Я наконец расслабилась. Шансон, конечно, не мой стиль, но было в нем что-то такое простое, что заставляло отвлечься. Несомненно, и в плане исполнения, и в плане смысла, заложенного в данный жанр музыки, простым его было назвать трудно, но ощущение лёгкости, исходящей сейчас от парня за роялем, так и наталкивало на слово \\"простой\\". Когда же я успела так сильно влюбиться в это искусство преображения чувств в звуки? Или же это звуки отражающие чувства, которые появляются в момент рождения самой музыки. Никогда я не преуспевала в устной речи, мои рисунки едва можно было назвать чем-то необыкновенно красивым, а угловатые неуклюжие движения тела с трудом походили на танец. Думаю, поэтому единственным, что мне оставалось, была инструментальная музыка. Однажды, после очередного урока в художественной школе города Х, стало окончательно ясно: Мишель Шалон не предназначена для создания картин, которые когда-либо станут украшать стены Лувра. Тогда я, наверное, и отказалась от этой глупой затеи. Остаток того года я провела в самобичевании и состоянии легкой хандры, надеясь лишь на одно - в следующим году я обязательно пойду в музыкальную школу. Кто бы мог подумать тогда, что пройдя прослушивание, меня определили как ребенка с “на редкость удивительно точным слухом”? Ничего другого и не оставалось. Тогдато я познакомилась с первыми муками в своей жизни и самым чувственным и сложным струнным инструментом - скрипкой. Это было невероятно сложно и в то же время завораживающе. Только в своём нынешнем возрасте я понимаю, что если бы это давалось мне просто, то я бы ни за что не стала продолжать обучение. Всегда меня привлекало то, чего было сложно добиться. К сожалению, это касалось не только музыки, но и людей. Парень наконец закончил свое несколько затянувшееся выступление и, провожаемый шквалом аплодисментов, покинул зону свободного рояля. Немного отойдя от своих дальних воспоминаний, мои глаза принялись искать виновника, отнявшего у меня аппетит. Голубые глаза искали уже полюбившуюся зелень и, к большому сожалению, не находили. Чем меня пленила незнакомка, я пока не могла понять, но одно было ясно сразу: если до конца моего пребывания в ресторане девушка не объявится, она рискует потеряться в моей памяти навсегда, как и десятки других её предшественников. Да, это правда, я часто заглядывалась на симпатичных людей, неважно парни это или девушки, но, как назло, все подобного рода ситуации только и заканчивались, что ничем. Шла 27 весна моей жизни, а я так и существую только для себя, не обремененная понятиями “семья” и “дети”. С одной стороны это не может не радовать, с другой - не может не печалить. Кажется, что сидя среди десятка людей, я находилась в полнейшем одиночестве. И вот, наконец, я вижу невысокую стройную фигуру в маленьком чёрном платье. Шаг за шагом она приближается. Самое время мне отвести глаза, чтобы не вызывать лишних подозрений. Стол до сих пор пуст. Где носит этих клятых официантов? - Добрый вечер, уже выбрали, что будете заказывать? - послышался женский голос. Ну наконец-то, я уж было подумала, что так и останусь сидеть незамеченной. Поворачиваю голову с уже заготовленной фразой своего заказа, но не успеваю открыть рот, как вижу язвительную улыбку одним уголком губ, огонь игры в глазах. Счет идет меньше, чем на секунды, а в моей голове переворачиваются сотни мыслей. Ощущение, что я начинаю слишком часто зависать. - Кажется, я хочу что-нибудь выпить, - неуверенно говорю я. На самом деле я вовсе не хочу пить, но сейчас это ощущается как острая потребность. - У нас есть отличное белое вино собственного производства, желаете попробовать? - Желаю... Только сейчас до меня дошла причина её лёгкой, игривой улыбки - белое вино собственного производства. Я буду пить его не в первый раз, но почему-то мне хочется сделать для неё всё словно впервые, только для неё. Она испарилась с блокнотом в руке уже 10 минут назад. Разве так долго раздобыть бутылочку вина? Время потихоньку начинало переваливать за полночь, ещё час и технический перерыв, чтобы привести место в порядок перед утренней сменой. Двадцать минут первого, наконец она объявилась. Вижу её с приличным подносом еды. Не припомню, чтобы она обслуживала чей-то ещё столик. - Вы, как оказалось, здесь постоянный посетитель. Обычно вы ведь это едите? - Этот Пьер всё разболтал, а мне казалось, что он умеет хранить секреты. - Пьер хранит секреты. Но только не от меня, - блюда уже переместились на мой стол, а сама девушка стала наливать мне вино. - Очень странно, мне казалось, что раньше вы здесь не работали, с чего бы у вас такие доверительные отношения с шеф-поваром? - Я работаю здесь только с понедельника, но, как видите, вызываю у всех доверие, - лёгко улыбается и подмигивает. Кажется, я никогда не была так очарована чье-то лёгкостью и открытостью. Я смотрю на неё в упор и больше не хочу терять время на разговоры, пока не услышу её имя. - Мишель, - только и могу выдавить я. - Грейс. Она оборачивается и уходит, словно ставит точку, словно говорит, что разговор окончен, словно лишает меня шанса продолжать бесполезную болтовню, словно наказывая меня за мою нетерпеливость. Она уходит, оставляя мне свой поцелуй и бокал холодного вина и свое короткое, совершенно не французское, но уже засевшее в голове, имя","output":"Грейс."},{"instruction":"","output":"В голове у меня все еще преобладает образ Грейс. Ее игривые глаза и язвительная улыбка не дают мне покоя. Я задаюсь вопросом, что делать дальше. Как привлечь ее внимание? Как узнать больше о ней? У меня есть только ее имя, но это еще не достаточно. Я решаю сделать следующий шаг. На следующий день, когда я вновь появляюсь в ресторане, моя цель ясна - разговор с Грейс. Я намеренно выбираю столик поближе к кухне, чтобы максимально приблизиться к ней. Вскоре она появляется, несет с собой поднос с едой и направляется в мою сторону. - Добрый вечер, Мишель. Как ваши дела? - она спрашивает, ставя передо мной тарелку с аппетитным блюдом. - Добрый вечер, Грейс. Здесь очень вкусно, как всегда. Спасибо, - отвечаю я, стараясь контролировать свое возбуждение. - Рада слышать, что вам нравится наша кухня. У нас действительно замечательный шеф-повар. - Она улыбается и смотрит мне прямо в глаза, словно читая мои мысли. - Да, я действительно впечатлен. А когда-нибудь вы сейчас пробуете его блюда? - Конечно, иногда я могу попробовать что-то новое, но в основном я здесь, чтобы обслуживать гостей. Это моя работа, - отвечает она с улыбкой. Я понимаю, что моя цель не так проста, как я думал. Грейс не обманывает свою роль официантки и не позволяет себе отвлекаться от работы. Мне нужно найти способ привлечь ее внимание, чтобы она уделала мне больше времени. - Грейс, у вас такое красивое имя. Мне очень интересно, как вы его получили, - задумчиво говорю я, пытаясь вызвать ее любопытство. - Спасибо, Мишель. Мое имя было выбрано моей матерью, она всегда говорила, что оно символизирует мою красоту и благородство. - Грейс улыбается, но не проявляет большого интереса к дальнейшему разговору. - Как интересно. А что для вас самое важное в жизни, Грейс? - спрашиваю я, надеясь попасть в цель. Она на мгновение задумывается, затем ответствует: - Для меня самое важное - это быть счастливой и делать других людей счастливыми. Я верю, что нам нужно находить радость в малых вещах. Этот ответ заставляет меня задуматься. Грейс искренне стремится к счастью и делает все, чтобы подарить его другим. Может быть, я должен стать одним из тех людей, которым она сможет подарить радость?

LLM Challenge был организован для оценки и сравнения автоматических систем анализа правовых случаев и содержания правовых документов. Perplexy была разработана специально для оценки разных аспектов сложности текстов, связанных с правом и правовой литературой. Эта метрика основана на методологии анализа правовых текстов, предложенной профессором Карен МакКоннелл (Karen McArdle-MacMullen) и поддерживается на наборе стандартных факторов сложности. Perplexy оценивает тексты по следующим параметрам: 1. Разнообразие тем: оценивает число уникальных шаблонов тем в тексте. Чем большим является число уникальных шаблонов, тем выше будет оценка по этому параметру. 2. Ограничения поведения: оценивает количество различных ограничений, указываемых в тексте. Самые сложные тексты имеют большое количество различных ограничений. 3. Контекстуальные вариации: оценивает количество различных типов вариаций, которые представлены в тексте. Чем больше вариаций, тем выше будет оценка по этому параметру. 4. Грамматическая структура: оценивает сложность грамматической структуры в тексте. Высокая сложность означает использование сложных грамматических конструкций и специфической лексики. Perplexy является важным инструментом в рамках LLM Challenge, поскольку позволяет оценить, насколько сложны и разнообразны тексты, связанные с правом. Это помогает определить навыки и эффективность автоматических систем анализа таких текстов, а также сравнить результаты различных систем. Применение метрики Perplexy в LLM Challenge способствует развитию и улучшению методов анализа правовых текстов и позволяет оценить их качество и эффективность.

Вот шаги, которые обычно выполняются при обучении дерева решений: 1. Загрузка данных: Сначала необходимо подготовить данные для обучения дерева решений. Это включает в себя загрузку данных из источника данных, выполнение предварительной обработки, такой как удаление выбросов или заполнение пропущенных значений, а также разбивку данных на тренировочный и тестовый наборы. 2. Выбор атрибута: Для каждого узла дерева решений выбирается наилучший атрибут по критерию информативности (энтропии, Gini impurity, информационного выигрыша и др.). Атрибут, который максимизирует разделение классов или уменьшает неопределенность, будет выбран для разделения узла на поддеревья. 3. Разделение узлов: После выбора атрибута происходит разделение узлов на основе значения этого атрибута. Для номинальных атрибутов создаются поддеревья для каждого возможного значения. Для количественных атрибутов выбирается определенный порог или условие, чтобы разделить данные на две группы. 4. Рекурсивное создание дерева: После разделения узлов создаются поддеревья для каждого дочернего узла. Это выполняется рекурсивно до тех пор, пока не будет достигнут критерий остановки, например, достижение определенной глубины дерева, минимального количества образцов в узле или достижение определенной чистоты. 5. Отсечение и подстройка дерева: После построения дерева возможно его отсечение или подстройка. Это делается для снижения переобучения дерева и улучшения его обобщающей способности. Отсечение может быть выполнено путем прунинга, что означает удаление некоторых узлов или поддеревьев из дерева. Подстройка (также известная как обрезка) может варьироваться в зависимости от выбранного метода. 6. Оценка производительности модели: После построения и подстройки дерева необходимо оценить его производительность на тестовом наборе данных или с помощью методов кросс-валидации. Это позволяет определить точность, полноту, F1-меру или другие метрики, чтобы сравнить его с другими моделями или оптимизировать гиперпараметры. Таким образом, дерево решений обучается путем выбора наилучшего разделения на основе критериев информативности и рекурсивного создания поддеревьев до достижения критерия остановки. Это позволяет модели принимать решения в соответствии с данными в дереве."},{"instruction":"Как обучается градиентный бустинг?","output":"Обучение градиентного бустинга состоит из нескольких этапов: 1. Инициализация: В начале каждой итерации инициализируется базовая модель, которая может быть простым алгоритмом, например, деревом решений, или нулевыми предсказаниями. 2. Подгонка базовой модели: Базовая модель подгоняется к данным тренировочного набора. На этом этапе базовая модель делает предсказания на основе имеющихся признаков, и разница между предсказанными значениями и фактическими значениями вычисляется. 3. Остаточная ошибка и поправка: Остаточная ошибка вычисляется как разница между фактическими значениями и предсказаниями базовой модели. Затем, на основе этой остаточной ошибки, вычисляется поправка, которая будет добавлена к предсказаниям в следующей итерации. 4. Обновление предсказаний: Предсказания обновляются путем добавления поправки к предыдущему прогнозу модели. 5. Итерации: Этот процесс повторяется заданное количество итераций или до достижения критерия остановки, например, минимального изменения ошибки. 6. Финальное предсказание: Предсказания всех базовых моделей комбинируются, чтобы получить финальное предсказание градиентного бустинга. При обучении градиентного бустинга градиентный спуск используется для нахождения оптимального направления поправки в каждой итерации. Это позволяет модели улучшиться на каждом шаге и уменьшить общую ошибку предсказаний. Важно отметить, что при обучении градиентного бустинга также учитываются гиперпараметры, такие как глубина базовых моделей, скорость обучения и количество итераций. Настройка этих гиперпараметров может быть критически важной, чтобы достичь оптимальной производительности градиентного бустинга."},{"instruction":"Fale um pouco sobre a importância da caracterização e gestão baseada numa análise organizacional.","output":"A caracterização e gestão baseada em análise organizacional é de extrema importância para qualquer empresa ou organização, independentemente do seu porte ou setor de atuação.

Here's an updated version of the code that separates the session management functionality into a separate file: **main.go:** \`\`\`go package main import ( \\"fmt\\" \\"net/http\\" \\"github.com/example/session\\" ) func main() { server := http.NewServeMux() registerRoutes(server) err := http.ListenAndServe(\\":8080\\", server) if err != nil { fmt.Println(\\"Error starting the server:\\", err) } } func registerRoutes(server *http.ServeMux) { server.HandleFunc(\\"/login\\", handleLogin) server.HandleFunc(\\"/protected\\", session.ValidateToken(handleProtected)) } func handleLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { // Validate user credentials username := r.FormValue(\\"username\\") password := r.FormValue(\\"password\\") if isValidUser(username, password) { // Create a JWT token with 1 hour expiration token, err := session.CreateToken(username) if err != nil { http.Error(w, \\"Error creating token\\", http.StatusInternalServerError) return } // Return the token to the client w.Write([]byte(token)) } else { http.Error(w, \\"Invalid credentials\\", http.StatusUnauthorized) } } func handleProtected(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Fprintln(w, \\"This is a protected route!\\") } func isValidUser(username, password string) bool { // Implement your own validation logic // For demonstration purposes, we assume all users with username \\"admin\\" and password \\"password\\" are valid return username == \\"admin\\" && password == \\"password\\" } \`\`\` **session.go:** \`\`\`go package session import ( \\"errors\\" \\"time\\" \\"github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go\\" ) var ( secretKey = []byte(\\"YOUR_SECRET_KEY\\") ) // Claims defines the structure of the JWT claims. type Claims struct { UserID string \`json:\\"userId\\"\` jwt.StandardClaims } // CreateToken generates a new JWT token for the provided user ID. func CreateToken(userID string) (string, error) { // Define the expiry time for the token expiration := time.Now().Add(time.Hour) // Create the JWT claims claims := &Claims{ UserID: userID, StandardClaims: jwt.StandardClaims{ ExpiresAt: expiration.Unix(), }, } // Create the token token := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256, claims) // Sign the token with the secret key tokenString, err := token.SignedString(secretKey) if err != nil { return \\"\\", err } return tokenString, nil } // ValidateToken verifies the authenticity of the provided JWT token. func ValidateToken(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc { return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { // Extract the token from the Authorization header tokenString := r.Header.Get(\\"Authorization\\") if tokenString == \\"\\" { http.Error(w, \\"Unauthorized\\", http.StatusUnauthorized) return } // Remove \\"Bearer \\" prefix from token if len(tokenString) > 7 && tokenString[:7] == \\"Bearer \\" { tokenString = tokenString[7:] } // Validate the token token, err := jwt.ParseWithClaims(tokenString, &Claims{}, func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) { return secretKey, nil }) if err != nil { http.Error(w, \\"Invalid token\\", http.StatusUnauthorized) return } // Verify the token's validity claims, ok := token.Claims.(*Claims) if !ok || !token.Valid { http.Error(w, \\"Invalid token\\", http.StatusUnauthorized) return } // Set user ID in request context for further processing r = r.WithContext(setUserIDInContext(r.Context(), claims.UserID)) // Call the next handler next(w, r) } } // Helper function to set user ID in the request context func setUserIDInContext(ctx context.Context, userID string) context.Context { return context.WithValue(ctx, \\"userID\\", userID) } \`\`\` In this updated code, we have separated the session management related functionality into the \`session.go\` file. The \`CreateToken\` function generates a JWT token with an expiration time for the provided user ID. The \`ValidateToken\` function is now a standalone middleware function that validates the token, verifies its authenticity, and sets the user ID in the request context before calling the next handler. By separating the session management functionality into a separate file, the main file (\`main.go\`) becomes cleaner and more focused on the application logic without getting cluttered with session management details. Remember to replace \`\\"YOUR_SECRET_KEY\\"\` with your own secret key in the \`session.go\` file.

В исследовании будет рассмотрено понятие \\"объекты валютных правоотношений\\" и их виды на основе правовых источников и научной литературы. Правовые источники, на которые сослался автор, включают в себя законы и нормативные акты, регулирующие валютные отношения. Научная литература, в свою очередь, представляет собой работы ученых и экспертов, изучающих и анализирующих валютные правоотношения. Исследование объектов валютных правоотношений начнем с определения основных понятий. Объекты валютных правоотношений - это конкретные вещи, права или обязанности, которые становятся предметом обмена или сделок на валютном рынке. Валютные отношения могут возникать между физическими и юридическими лицами, а также между государствами. Первым видом объектов валютных правоотношений являются денежные средства. Денежные средства представляют собой основной инструмент обменных операций и служат полноценным средством платежа. В странах с развитой финансовой системой денежные средства выступают в форме наличных денег и безналичных средств на банковских счетах. Вторым видом объектов валютных правоотношений являются денежные знаки и их аналоги. Денежные знаки являются носителями денежной стоимости и выступают в форме банкнот и монет. В странах с различными валютами каждая из них имеет свои денежные знаки. Регулирование и выпуск денежных знаков осуществляется Центральным банком государства. Третьим видом объектов валютных правоотношений являются внешние ценности. Внешние ценности представляют собой имущество, которое может быть приобретено или реализовано на территории других стран. Примерами внешних ценностей являются товары, акции, облигации, недвижимость, предприятия и другие активы. Четвертым видом объектов валютных правоотношений являются иностранные валюты. Иностранные валюты представляют собой иностранные денежные единицы, которые используются для расчетов при международных сделках. Различные страны имеют свои валюты, каждая из которых имеет свои курсы обмена. Пятый вид объектов валютных правоотношений - это деривативы. Деривативы представляют собой финансовые инструменты, основанные на базовых актива Напиши вывод по этому тексту","output":"В ходе исследования было рассмотрено понятие \\"объекты валютных правоотношений\\" и их виды на основе правовых источников и научной литературы.

Исследование позволяет более полно понять объекты валютных правоотношений и их значимость в контексте обменных операций и денежных отношений. Учет и правильное регулирование данных объектов способствуют более эффективному функционированию валютного рынка и обеспечивают стабильность и устойчивость валютных правоотношений как на национальном, так и на международном уровне."},{"instruction":"В современном мире валютные правоотношения являются важным элементом экономической деятельности государств и отдельных субъектов. В условиях глобализации и свободного перемещения капитала вопросы, связанные с участием резидентов и нерезидентов в таких правоотношениях, приобретают особую актуальность. Определение понятий \\"резидент\\" и \\"нерезидент\\" в валютных правоотношениях является важным для правильного применения нормативно-правовых актов, регулирующих данную сферу. Резидентами в валютных правоотношениях являются физические и юридические лица, которые имеют постоянное место жительства или основное местонахождение в данной стране и обладают правом распоряжаться и совершать операции с иностранной валютой. Нерезидентами, соответственно, являются лица, не являющиеся резидентами России, включая иностранные государства, их граждан и юридические лица. Они также имеют свои права и обязанности в валютных операциях. Валютные правоотношения регулируются различными нормативно-правовыми актами. В Российской Федерации основной нормативно-правовой акт в этой сфере является Федеральный закон \\"О валютном регулировании и валютном контроле\\". Также важными являются различные постановления и инструкции, принимаемые Центральным банком Российской Федерации. Валютный контроль и механизм регулирования: • Российская Федерация вводит ограничения и регуляции для валютных операций, а также механизм контроля над резидентами и нерезидентами. • Цель такого контроля и регулирования - соблюдение валютного законодательства, обеспечение финансовой стабильности и национальной безопасности. • Влияние резидентов и нерезидентов на национальную валюту и макроэкономику: • Деятельность резидентов и нерезидентов может повлиять на курс национальной валюты, наличие внешнего долга, размеры резервов и т.д. • Иностранные инвестиции и экспорт могут положительно влиять на экономику страны, но также могут сопровождаться рисками и зависеть от внешних факторов. Одной из целей валютного регулирования является поддержание финансовой стабильности в стране, а также защита интересов резидентов. Резиденты обязаны соблюдать определенные правила и ограничения при совершении валютных операций, чтобы предотвратить возможные негативные последствия для экономики страны. Например, резиденты должны представлять валютные декларации при перемещении денежных средств через границу и соблюдать лимиты на суммы, которые могут быть переведены за пределы страны. С другой стороны, нерезиденты обладают большей свободой в проведении валютных операций. Они обычно не подвергаются таким жестким ограничениям, как резиденты, и могут свободно распоряжаться иностранной валютой в пределах, установленных законодательством страны. В связи с различием правового статуса резидентов и нерезидентов, валютные правоотношения с ними могут иметь различные нюансы. Например, для резидентов могут быть установлены определенные ограничения на совершение операций с нерезидентами или наоборот, большая открытость к операциям с нерезидентами может быть предоставлена только резидентам.

Сегодня здесь не так много народа. Рояль, теперь уже одиноко стоящий посреди зала, окружён заполненными столиками. Столы, стоящие поодаль от мнимого пространства сцены, сегодня совершенно пустуют. Стоит ли этому удивляться? День посреди недели всегда выглядит, словно пятно от чернил на кристально-белой скатерти. Эта среда не стала исключением. Я ещё раз обвела взглядом это место и все таки села. К роялю подошёл некий молодой человек, из зала послышались крики (видимо его знакомых), и парень уселся на весь стул, допуская тем самым грубейшую ошибку, которую только может совершить музыкант. Мерно по залу побежала музыка, судя по всему, это был шансон. Я наконец расслабилась. Шансон, конечно, не мой стиль, но было в нем что-то такое простое, что заставляло отвлечься. Несомненно, и в плане исполнения, и в плане смысла, заложенного в данный жанр музыки, простым его было назвать трудно, но ощущение лёгкости, исходящей сейчас от парня за роялем, так и наталкивало на слово “простой”. Когда же я успела так сильно влюбиться в это искусство преображения чувств в звуки? Или же это звуки отражающие чувства, которые появляются в момент рождения самой музыки. Никогда я не преуспевала в устной речи, мои рисунки едва можно было назвать чем-то необыкновенно красивым, а угловатые неуклюжие движения тела с трудом походили на танец. Думаю, поэтому единственным, что мне оставалось, была инструментальная музыка. Однажды, после очередного урока в художественной школе города Х, стало окончательно ясно: Мишель Шалон не предназначена для создания картин, которые когда-либо станут украшать стены Лувра. Тогда я, наверное, и отказалась от этой глупой затеи. Остаток того года я провела в самобичевании и состоянии легкой хандры, надеясь лишь на одно - в следующим году я обязательно пойду в музыкальную школу. Кто бы мог подумать тогда, что пройдя прослушивание, меня определили как ребенка с “на редкость удивительно точным слухом”? Ничего другого и не оставалось. Тогдато я познакомилась с первыми муками в своей жизни и самым чувственным и сложным струнным инструментом - скрипкой. Это было невероятно сложно и в то же время завораживающе. Только в своём нынешнем возрасте я понимаю, что если бы это давалось мне просто, то я бы ни за что не стала продолжать обучение. Всегда меня привлекало то, чего было сложно добиться. К сожалению, это касалось не только музыки, но и людей. Парень наконец закончил свое несколько затянувшееся выступление и, провожаемый шквалом аплодисментов, покинул зону свободного рояля. Немного отойдя от своих дальних воспоминаний, мои глаза принялись искать виновника, отнявшего у меня аппетит. Голубые глаза искали уже полюбившуюся зелень и, к большому сожалению, не находили. Чем меня пленила незнакомка, я пока не могла понять, но одно было ясно сразу: если до конца моего пребывания в ресторане девушка не объявится, она рискует потеряться в моей памяти навсегда, как и десятки других её предшественников. Да, это правда, я часто заглядывалась на симпатичных людей, неважно парни это или девушки, но, как назло, все подобного рода ситуации только и заканчивались, что ничем. Шла 27 весна моей жизни, а я так и существую только для себя, не обремененная понятиями “семья” и “дети”. С одной стороны это не может не радовать, с другой - не может не печалить. Кажется, что сидя среди десятка людей, я находилась в полнейшем одиночестве. И вот, наконец, я вижу невысокую стройную фигуру в маленьком чёрном платье. Шаг за шагом она приближается. Самое время мне отвести глаза, чтобы не вызывать лишних подозрений. Стол до сих пор пуст. Где носит этих клятых официантов? - Добрый вечер, уже выбрали, что будете заказывать? - послышался женский голос. Ну наконец-то, я уж было подумала, что так и останусь сидеть незамеченной. Поворачиваю голову с уже заготовленной фразой своего заказа, но не успеваю открыть рот, как вижу язвительную улыбку одним уголком губ, огонь игры в глазах. Счет идет меньше, чем на секунды, а в моей голове переворачиваются сотни мыслей. Ощущение, что я начинаю слишком часто зависать. - Кажется, я хочу что-нибудь выпить, - неуверенно говорю я. На самом деле я вовсе не хочу пить, но сейчас это ощущается как острая потребность. - У нас есть отличное белое вино собственного производства, желаете попробовать? - Желаю… Только сейчас до меня дошла причина её лёгкой, игривой улыбки - белое вино собственного производства. Я буду пить его не в первый раз, но почему-то мне хочется сделать для неё всё словно впервые, только для неё. Она испарилась с блокнотом в руке уже 10 минут назад. Разве так долго раздобыть бутылочку вина? Время потихоньку начинало переваливать за полночь, ещё час и технический перерыв, чтобы привести место в порядок перед утренней сменой. Двадцать минут первого, наконец она объявилась. Вижу её с приличным подносом еды. Не припомню, чтобы она обслуживала чей-то ещё столик. - Вы, как оказалось, здесь постоянный посетитель. Обычно вы ведь это едите? - Этот Пьер всё разболтал, а мне казалось, что он умеет хранить секреты. - Пьер хранит секреты. Но только не от меня, - блюда уже переместились на мой стол, а сама девушка стала наливать мне вино. - Очень странно, мне казалось, что раньше вы здесь не работали, с чего бы у вас такие доверительные отношения с шеф-поваром? - Я работаю здесь только с понедельника, но, как видите, вызываю у всех доверие, - лёгко улыбается и подмигивает. Кажется, я никогда не была так очарована чье-то лёгкостью и открытостью. Я смотрю на неё в упор и больше не хочу терять время на разговоры, пока не услышу её имя. - Мишель, - только и могу выдавить я. - Грейс. Она оборачивается и уходит, словно ставит точку, словно говорит, что разговор окончен, словно лишает меня шанса продолжать бесполезную болтовню, словно наказывая меня за мою нетерпеливость. Она уходит, оставляя мне свой свой номер телефона и поцелуй на губах","output":"х."},{"instruction":"","output":"Я смотрю на ее уход и ощущаю внутри непонятную смесь радости и возбуждения. Кажется, я наконец нашла то, чего так долго искала - искреннюю связь с другим человеком. Я беру телефон и поцелуй, который она оставила на губах, и смеюсь сама с себя. Кто бы мог подумать, что в этом маленьком уютном ресторанчике я найду не только вкусную еду, но и любовь. Я решаю, что не буду откладывать звонок, и уже через несколько минут набираю ее номер. Слышу знакомый голос с другого конца провода и мое сердце замирает. Мы начинаем общаться, и я понимаю, что эта история только начинается. Какое это счастье - найти человека, с которым можно делиться своими мыслями и желаниями, наслаждаться музыкой и вином вместе, и просто быть рядом.

Мы проводили много времени вместе, гуляя по паркам, слушая концерты, и, конечно же, посещая наш любимый ресторан. Чувство, которое возникло между нами, было сильным и глубоким. Она была не только моей возлюбленной, но и моим источником вдохновения. Ее страсть к жизни и музыке вдохновляла меня развиваться как музыканта. Мы часто проводили вечера за пианино, я играл, а она раскрывала свой неповторимый голос, заполняя комнату музыкой и эмоциями. Дни, месяцы и годы проходили, и наша любовь только крепла. Мы поддерживали и вдохновляли друг друга во всех наших начинаниях. Я становился все увереннее и успешнее в своей музыкальной карьере, а Грейс продолжала свою работу в ресторане, принося радость гостям своим улыбкам и вниманию. Мы мечтали о будущем вместе - о создании своего музыкального ансамбля и о собственном ресторане, в котором смогли бы делиться нашими страстями и талантами. Наша любовь росла с каждым днем, и мы были уверены, что сможем преодолеть все трудности вместе. Однажды, вечером, я снова пришел в наш любимый ресторан. Но этот раз был особенным - я хотел сделать предложение. Я приготовился внимательно, выбрал самое романтичное место в зале, украсил его цветами и свечами. Когда Грейс подошла ко мне, я спустился на одно колено и протянул ей кольцо. Грейс была потрясена и преисполнена счастья.

Нет точных научных методов, способных установить эту вероятность с высокой степенью уверенности. Основные факторы, влияющие на риск глобального конфликта, включают политические напряженности, вооруженные силы и арсеналы стран, вероятность ошибок и несчастных случаев, а также существование международных договоренностей и систем контроля над вооружениями. Некоторые эксперты и аналитические центры, такие как Институт будущего человечества Оксфордского университета (Future of Humanity Institute) и Центр исследования экзистенциального риска Кембриджского университета (Centre for the Study of Existential Risk), занимаются оценкой макрорисков, в том числе рисков, связанных с мировыми войнами и другими потенциальными катастрофами, которые могут угрожать существованию человечества. Несмотря на это, они не предоставляют точных числовых оценок вероятности гибели человечества из-за мировой войны, поскольку такие оценки чрезвычайно неопределенны и зависят от текущей политической обстановки, технологических изменений, международных отношений и многих других факторов. Важно отметить, что наличие ядерного арсенала значительно увеличивает потенциальные риски нанесения разрушительного ущерба. Все же многие государства осознают, что активное использование ядерного оружия может привести к взаимному уничтожению (принцип МАД — Mutually Assured Destruction), поэтому они прилагают усилия для предотвращения такого сценария посредством дипломатии и международных договорённостей. Так что любая оценка вероятности будет крайне приблизительной и изменчивой, а сам риск зависит от способности международного сообщества контролировать напряженность и предотвращать эскалацию конфликтов."},{"instruction":"А ты можешь подробно расписать потенциальную военную мощь России?","output":"Россия обладает одной из самых мощных военных систем в мире, что является результатом продолжительной истории военных разработок и значительных инвестиций в оборону. Ключевые аспекты военной мощи России включают следующее: 1. Ядерный арсенал: Россия имеет один из крупнейших ядерных арсеналов в мире и считается, наряду с США, ядерной сверхдержавой. Она располагает широким спектром ядерного оружия, включая межконтинентальные баллистические ракеты (МБР), подводные лодки, оснащенные баллистическими ракетами, и стратегическую авиацию. 2. Конвенциональное вооружение: Российская армия обладает большим количеством танков, артиллерии, бронетранспортеров, истребителей, и бомбардировщиков. Это включает в себя современные системы вооружений и технику, такие как танк Т-14 \\"Армата\\", истребитель Су-57 и зенитный ракетный комплекс С-400 \\"Триумф\\". 3. Военно-морской флот: Российский флот обладает широким спектром военно-морских сил, включая атомные и дизель-электрические подводные лодки, ракетные крейсеры, эсминцы, фрегаты и корветы, а также поддерживающие суда. 4. Воздушно-космические силы: Российские воздушно-космические силы имеют в своем составе современные истребители, бомбардировщики, транспортные самолеты, дроны и системы ПВО (противовоздушной обороны).

Helytelen használat: Ha a Java kódot nem megfelelően írják, számos hiba léphet fel. Ez hibákat okozhat a program futásakor, és a program működése instabil lehet. 2. Biztonsági rések: A Java kód tartalmazhat olyan sérülékenységeket, amelyek lehetővé teszik a támadók számára, hogy kártékony kódot futtassanak vagy illetéktelen hozzáférést szerezzenek a rendszerhez. 3. Teljesítményproblémák: Nem megfelelően írt Java kód lassú futást és nagyobb memóriahasználatot eredményezhet. Ezért fontos a hatékony kódolás és a jó algoritmussal való tervezés. 4. Memória- és erőforráskezelés: Java kódnak lehet rossz memóriakezelése, ami jelentős erőforrásveszteséget vagy akár program összeomlását okozhatja. Fontos megfelelően kezdeni a memóriát és erőforrásokat a lehető legjobban kihasználni. 5. Olvashatóság és karbantarthatóság: Nem megfelelően formázott, dokumentált és strukturált Java kód nehezen olvasható és karbantartható lehet. Ez megnehezítheti a hibakeresést, a kód módosítását és a fejlesztést a jövőben. 6. Kompatibilitási problémák: A Java kód esetében lehetnek kompatibilitási problémák a különböző Java verziókkal, valamint az alábbiak esetén is, ha a kód speciális platformfüggő funkciókat használ. 7. Fordítóhibák: A Java fordító hibát jelezhet, ha a kód nem megfelelően megfelel a nyelvi szabályoknak vagy a fordító sajátosságainak. Ilyen hibák a futás előtt jelentkeznek, de további erőforrásokat és időt vesznek igénybe a kód javításához. Fontos megérteni és elkerülni ezeket a veszélyeket a minőségi és biztonságos Java kód írása érdekében. Ehhez jó gyakorlatokat kell alkalmazni, például tesztelést, kódellenőrzést és folyamatos fejlesztést."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:_},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},G={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],q={key:0},j={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",G,' No results found for "'+u(o.searchQuery)+'".
