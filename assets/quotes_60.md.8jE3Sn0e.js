Convolution Let’s assume that the input of our neural network has the presented shape in Fig. 2, It can be an image (e.g. color image of a CIFAR-10 dataset with a width and height of 32×32 pixels, and a depth of 3 which RGB channel) or a video (gray scale video whose height and width are the resolution, and the depth are the frames) or even an experimental video, which has width and height of (L × L) sensor values, and the depths are associated with different time frames, as in [2,10,15]. Why convolution ? . Let's assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32×32×3 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Fig. 1. Learned features from a Convolutional Neural Network Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Downloaded on April 08,2024 at 07:52:10 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Three dimensional Input representation of CNN If we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32×32×3 weight connection, which will become in total, 32×32×3×2 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32×32×3 by 32×32 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14]. Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5×5 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32×32 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5×5×3 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17]. Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5×5×3=75 to connect 32×32×3 neurons to 32×32 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5×5×3 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16]. Fig. 3. Convolution as alternative for fully connected network. To show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix, Fig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the connection weight in a 3×3 window. As we can see Fig.4, the matrix can be set to detect edges in the image. These matrices are also called a filter because they act like the classic filters in the image processing. However, in the convolutional neural network these filters are initialized, followed by the training procedure shape filters, which are more suitable for the given task. To make this method more beneficial, it is possible to add more layers after the input layer. Each layer can be associated with different filters. Therefore, we can extract different features from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are connected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter and therefore extracts different features from the input. The neurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the same part of the input image.

Multiple layers which each of them correspond to different filter but looking at the same region in the given image B. Stride In fact, CNN has more options which provide a lot of opportunities to even decrease the parameters more and more, and at the same time reduce some of the side effects. One of these options is stride. In the above mentioned example, it is simply assumed that the next layer’s node has lots of overlaps with their neighbors by looking at the regions. We can manipulate the overlap by controlling the stride. Fig. 6, shows a given 7×7 image. If we move the filter one node every time, we can have a 5x5 output only. Note that the output of the three left matrices in Fig. 6, have an overlap (and three middle ones together and three right ones also). However, if we move and make every stride 2, then the output will be 3x3. Put simply, not only overlap, but also the size of the output will be reduced. [5,12,16]. Equation (1), formalize this, given the image N×N dimension and the filter size of the F×F, the output size O as shown in Fig. 7. (1) Where N is the input size, F is the filter size, and S is the stride size. C. Padding One of the drawbacks of the convolution step is the loss of information that might exist on the border of the image. Because they are only captured when the filter slides, they never have the chance to be seen. A very simple, yet efficient method to resolve the issue, is to use zero-padding. The other benefit of zero padding is to manage the output size. For example, in Fig. 6, with N=7 and F=3 and stride 1, the output will be 5×5 (which shrinks from a 7×7 input). Fig. 7. The effect of stride in the output. However, by adding one zero-padding, the output will be 7×7, which is exactly the same as the original input (The actual N now becomes 9, use the formula (1). The modified formula including zero-padding is formula (2). (2) Where P is the number of the layers of the zero-padding (e.g. P=1 in Fig. 8), This padding idea helps us to prevent network output size from shrinking with depth. Therefore, it is possible to have any number of deep convolutional networks. [2,12]. D. Feature of CNNs The weight sharing brings invariance translations to the model. It helps to filter the learn feature regardless of the spatial properties. By starting random values for the filters, they will learn to detect the edge (such as in Fig. 4) if it improves the performance. It is important to remember that if we need to know that something is spatially important in the given input, then it is an extremely bad idea to use a shared weight. Fig. 8. Zero-padding Fig. 6.

Visualizing Convolutional deep neural network layers This concept can be extended to different dimensions also. For example, if it is sequential data such as an audio, then it can employ a one dimensional audio. If it is an image, as it is shown, two dimensional convolutions can be applied. And for videos, or 3D images, a three dimensional convolution can be used. This simple idea beat all the classic object recognition methods in computer vision in the 2012 ImageNet challenge as shown in Fig. 9, [5,14,18] E. Convolutional Formula The convolution for one pixel in the next layer is calculated according to the formula (3) . Where is the output in the next layer, is the input image and is the kernel or filter matrix and is the convolution operation. Fig. 10, shows how the convolution works. As can be seen, the element by element product of the input and kernel is aggregated, and then represents the corresponding point in the next layer. [4,9]. III. NONLINEARITY The next layer after the convolution is non-linearity. The non-linearity can be used to adjust or cut-off the generated output. This layer is applied in order to saturate the output or limiting the generated output. Fig. 10. Details on Convolution layer For many years, sigmoid and tanh were the most popular non-linearity. Fig. 11, shows the common types of nonlinearity. However, recently, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) has been used more often for the following reasons. 1. ReLU has simpler definitions in both function and gradient. (4) (5) 2. The saturated function such as sigmoid and tanh cause problems in the back propagation. As the neural network design is deeper, the gradient signal begins to vanish, which is called the “vanishing gradient”. This happens since the gradient of those functions is very close to zero almost everywhere but the center. However, the ReLU has a constant gradient for the positive input. Although the function is not differentiable, it can be ignored in the actual implementation. 3. The ReLU creates a sparser representation. because the zero in the gradient leads to obtaining a complete zero. However, sigmoid and tanh always have non-zero results from the gradient, which might not be in favor for training. [2,5,13]. Fig. 11. Common types of nonlinearity.

In the image processing domain, it can be considered as similar to reducing the resolution. Pooling does not affect the number of filters. Max-pooling is one of the most common types of pooling methods. It partitions the image to sub-region rectangles, and it only returns the maximum value of the inside of that sub-region. One of the most common sizes used in max-pooling is 2×2. As can see in Fig. 12, when pooling is performed in the top-left 2×2 blocks (pink area), it moves 2 and focus on top-right part. This means that stride 2 is used in pooling. To avoid down-sampling, stride 1 can be used, which is not common. It should be considered that down-sampling does not preserve the position of the information. Therefore, it should be applied only when the presence of information is important (rather than spatial information). Moreover, pooling can be used with non-equal filters and strides to improve the efficiency. For example, a 3x3 max-pooling with stride 2 keeps some overlaps between the areas. [5,10,16]. V. FULLY-CONNECTED LAYER The fully-connected layer is a similar to the way that neurons are arranged in a traditional neural network. Therefore, each node in a fully-connected layer is directly connected to every node in both the previous and in the next layer as shown in Fig. 13, From this figure we can note that each of the nodes in the last frames in the pooling layer are connected as a vector to the first layer from the fully-connected layer. These are the most parameters used with the CNN within these layers, and take a long time in training [3,8]. The major drawback of a fully-connected layer, is that it includes a lot of parameters that need complex computational in training examples. Therefore, we try to eliminate the number of nodes and connections. The removed nodes and connection can be satisfied by using the dropout technique. For example, LeNet and AlexNet designed a deep and wide network while keeping the computational complex constant [4,6,9]. The essence of the CNN network, which is the convolution, is when the nonlinearity and pooling layer are introduced. Most common architecture uses three of them as\\" From the above paper, explain and summarize the principle of CNN in detail with equations.

The core principle behind CNNs is their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data. Here's a detailed explanation of the principles and components of CNNs, articulated using fresh expressions: # Convolution Layer The convolution layer is the backbone of a CNN, employing filters (also known as kernels) to capture spatial features such as edges or textures within an input image. For instance, consider an image represented as a 32x32x3 matrix (for a 32x32 pixel image with three color channels). The convolution operation involves sliding a smaller matrix (filter) across the image and computing the dot product of the filter with local regions of the input. This process generates a feature map that accentuates features detected by the filter. This method reduces the number of parameters significantly compared to fully connected networks. If a filter is of size 5x5x3, instead of connecting each input pixel to every neuron in the next layer, each neuron in the ensuing layer is connected to a small region of the input through shared weights (75 weights in this example). This weight sharing mechanism drastically cuts down the number of free parameters, making the model computationally efficient and less prone to overfitting. # Stride and Padding Stride controls how the filter convolves around the input. For example, a stride of 1 moves the filter one pixel at a time, while a stride of 2 moves it two pixels. Adjusting the stride affects the size of the feature maps produced. Padding involves adding layers of zeros around the input to allow the filter to slide across border pixels, thus maintaining the spatial size of the output feature map closer to the input. # Non-Linearity (Activation function) After each convolution operation, a non-linear function is applied to the feature maps. This is crucial since most real-world data we want the network to learn from is non-linear. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is the most common activation function used in CNNs due to its computational efficiency and its ability to help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, thereby promoting faster convergence. # Pooling Pooling layers subsample (downsample) the feature map, reducing its dimensionality. This contributes to making the detection of features invariant to scale and orientation changes and also improves computational efficiency. Max pooling is a frequent choice, which takes the maximum value in each sub-region of the feature map. # Fully Connected Layers Towards the end of the network, fully connected layers are used where neurons between adjacent layers are fully connected. This part is responsible for mapping the pooled features into the final output, such as class scores in classification tasks. It’s common to integrate dropout in these layers to prevent overfitting by randomly \\"dropping out\\" a number of neuron outputs during training. In essence, a CNN learns to recognize patterns and features by applying filters, pooling, and non-linear operations, extracting increasingly complex features in each subsequent layer and using those features to perform tasks such as image classification. The powerful aspect of CNN is its ability to learn the filters’ weights automatically through backpropagation, optimizing its internal parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and true labels."},{"instruction":"\\"A. Convolution Let’s assume that the input of our neural network has the presented shape in Fig. 2, It can be an image (e.g. color image of a CIFAR-10 dataset with a width and height of 32×32 pixels, and a depth of 3 which RGB channel) or a video (gray scale video whose height and width are the resolution, and the depth are the frames) or even an experimental video, which has width and height of (L × L) sensor values, and the depths are associated with different time frames, as in [2,10,15]. Why convolution ? . Let's assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32×32×3 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Three dimensional Input representation of CNN If we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32×32×3 weight connection, which will become in total, 32×32×3×2 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32×32×3 by 32×32 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14]. Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5×5 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32×32 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5×5×3 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17]. Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5×5×3=75 to connect 32×32×3 neurons to 32×32 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5×5×3 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16]. Fig. 3. Convolution as alternative for fully connected network. To show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix, Fig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the connection weight in a 3×3 window. As we can see Fig.4, the matrix can be set to detect edges in the image. These matrices are also called a filter because they act like the classic filters in the image processing. However, in the convolutional neural network these filters are initialized, followed by the training procedure shape filters, which are more suitable for the given task. To make this method more beneficial, it is possible to add more layers after the input layer. Each layer can be associated with different filters. Therefore, we can extract different features from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are connected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter and therefore extracts different features from the input. The neurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the same part of the input image.

Multiple layers which each of them correspond to different filter but looking at the same region in the given image B. Stride In fact, CNN has more options which provide a lot of opportunities to even decrease the parameters more and more, and at the same time reduce some of the side effects. One of these options is stride. In the above mentioned example, it is simply assumed that the next layer’s node has lots of overlaps with their neighbors by looking at the regions. We can manipulate the overlap by controlling the stride. Fig. 6, shows a given 7×7 image. If we move the filter one node every time, we can have a 5x5 output only. Note that the output of the three left matrices in Fig. 6, have an overlap (and three middle ones together and three right ones also). However, if we move and make every stride 2, then the output will be 3x3. Put simply, not only overlap, but also the size of the output will be reduced. [5,12,16]. Equation (1), formalize this, given the image N×N dimension and the filter size of the F×F, the output size O as shown in Fig. 7. (1) Where N is the input size, F is the filter size, and S is the stride size. C. Padding One of the drawbacks of the convolution step is the loss of information that might exist on the border of the image. Because they are only captured when the filter slides, they never have the chance to be seen. A very simple, yet efficient method to resolve the issue, is to use zero-padding. The other benefit of zero padding is to manage the output size. For example, in Fig. 6, with N=7 and F=3 and stride 1, the output will be 5×5 (which shrinks from a 7×7 input). Fig. 7. The effect of stride in the output. However, by adding one zero-padding, the output will be 7×7, which is exactly the same as the original input (The actual N now becomes 9, use the formula (1). The modified formula including zero-padding is formula (2). (2) Where P is the number of the layers of the zero-padding (e.g. P=1 in Fig. 8), This padding idea helps us to prevent network output size from shrinking with depth. Therefore, it is possible to have any number of deep convolutional networks. [2,12]. D. Feature of CNNs The weight sharing brings invariance translations to the model. It helps to filter the learn feature regardless of the spatial properties. By starting random values for the filters, they will learn to detect the edge (such as in Fig. 4) if it improves the performance. It is important to remember that if we need to know that something is spatially important in the given input, then it is an extremely bad idea to use a shared weight. Fig. 8. Zero-padding Fig. 6.

Visualizing Convolutional deep neural network layers This concept can be extended to different dimensions also. For example, if it is sequential data such as an audio, then it can employ a one dimensional audio. If it is an image, as it is shown, two dimensional convolutions can be applied. And for videos, or 3D images, a three dimensional convolution can be used.

At the heart of CNNs is the ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data. The architecture of CNNs enables them to efficiently handle the high dimensionality of raw data through a combination of convolutional layers, non-linearity, pooling, and fully connected layers. Let's break down these components and their principles. # A. Convolution The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. It applies a series of learnable filters to the input data. Each filter slides over the input data and performs an element-wise multiplication with the part of the image it is currently on, and sums up the results into a single output pixel. This process is mathematically described as: [ O_{ij} = K * I ] where (O_{ij}) is the output of the filter applied at position ((i, j)) on the input image (I), (K) is the kernel or filter, and (*) denotes the convolution operation. The convolution operation has several advantages: it significantly reduces the number of parameters by sharing weights (a single filter is used across the entire input), it maintains the spatial relationship between pixels, and it allows the network to learn filters that activate when they see specific types of features at some spatial position in the input. # B. Non-Linearity (Activation Function) After each convolution operation, a non-linear activation function is applied to the output. This is necessary because the combination of linear operations (such as convolution) can only learn linear transformations, and many real-world data distributions are highly non-linear. The most commonly used activation function in modern CNNs is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), described by: [ f(x) = max(0, x) ] ReLU introduces non-linearity while being computationally efficient, allowing models to learn faster and achieve better performance. # C. Pooling (Subsampling or Downsampling) Pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps. This not only reduces the computational load and the number of parameters but also provides an abstracted form of the features, making the network more robust to variations in the position of features in the input. A common pooling operation is max pooling, where the maximum value from a group of neurons in the feature map is selected: [ P = max (X_{subregion}) ] This operation is applied separately for each feature map and reduces its size by a factor, depending on the size of the pooling window. # D. Fully-Connected Layers After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the network is done through fully connected layers. Neurons in a fully connected layer have full connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular neural networks. The output from the last pooling or convolutional layer, which is a high-level feature representation of the input, is flattened and fed into these fully-connected layers to perform classification or regression. Fully-connected layers are often followed by a softmax function if the task is classification, which converts the output scores from the network into probabilities. The architecture and components of CNNs allow them to learn powerful hierarchical feature representations from raw data, making them especially suited for tasks like image recognition, where spatial hierarchies are key. Through a combination of convolutional layers for feature extraction, non-linearity for introducing complex patterns recognition, pooling for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification, CNNs can effectively learn to make sense of spatial data."},{"instruction":"\\"A.

Convolutional Formula The convolution for one pixel in the next layer is calculated according to the formula (3) . Where is the output in the next layer, is the input image and is the kernel or filter matrix and is the convolution operation. Fig. 10, shows how the convolution works. As can be seen, the element by element product of the input and kernel is aggregated, and then represents the corresponding point in the next layer. [4,9]. III. NONLINEARITY The next layer after the convolution is non-linearity. The non-linearity can be used to adjust or cut-off the generated output. This layer is applied in order to saturate the output or limiting the generated output. Fig. 10. Details on Convolution layer For many years, sigmoid and tanh were the most popular non-linearity. Fig. 11, shows the common types of nonlinearity. However, recently, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) has been used more often for the following reasons. 1. ReLU has simpler definitions in both function and gradient. (4) (5) 2. The saturated function such as sigmoid and tanh cause problems in the back propagation. As the neural network design is deeper, the gradient signal begins to vanish, which is called the “vanishing gradient”. This happens since the gradient of those functions is very close to zero almost everywhere but the center. However, the ReLU has a constant gradient for the positive input. Although the function is not differentiable, it can be ignored in the actual implementation. 3. The ReLU creates a sparser representation. because the zero in the gradient leads to obtaining a complete zero. However, sigmoid and tanh always have non-zero results from the gradient, which might not be in favor for training. [2,5,13]. Fig. 11. Common types of nonlinearity.

In the image processing domain, it can be considered as similar to reducing the resolution. Pooling does not affect the number of filters. Max-pooling is one of the most common types of pooling methods. It partitions the image to sub-region rectangles, and it only returns the maximum value of the inside of that sub-region. One of the most common sizes used in max-pooling is 2×2. As can see in Fig. 12, when pooling is performed in the top-left 2×2 blocks (pink area), it moves 2 and focus on top-right part. This means that stride 2 is used in pooling. To avoid down-sampling, stride 1 can be used, which is not common. It should be considered that down-sampling does not preserve the position of the information. Therefore, it should be applied only when the presence of information is important (rather than spatial information). Moreover, pooling can be used with non-equal filters and strides to improve the efficiency. For example, a 3x3 max-pooling with stride 2 keeps some overlaps between the areas. [5,10,16]. V. FULLY-CONNECTED LAYER The fully-connected layer is a similar to the way that neurons are arranged in a traditional neural network. Therefore, each node in a fully-connected layer is directly connected to every node in both the previous and in the next layer as shown in Fig. 13, From this figure we can note that each of the nodes in the last frames in the pooling layer are connected as a vector to the first layer from the fully-connected layer. These are the most parameters used with the CNN within these layers, and take a long time in training [3,8]. The major drawback of a fully-connected layer, is that it includes a lot of parameters that need complex computational in training examples. Therefore, we try to eliminate the number of nodes and connections. The removed nodes and connection can be satisfied by using the dropout technique. For example, LeNet and AlexNet designed a deep and wide network while keeping the computational complex constant [4,6,9]. The essence of the CNN network, which is the convolution, is when the nonlinearity and pooling layer are introduced. Most common architecture uses three of them as\\" From the above paper, explain and summarize the principle of CNN in detail with equations. Try to use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","output":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks highly effective for image and video recognition, amongst other uses. The foundational concept of CNNs lies in their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Unlike traditional neural networks that fully connect each neuron in one layer to all neurons in the next layer, CNNs utilize a more structured and efficient approach. # Convolution Operation The core operation in a CNN is the convolution operation. It involves sliding a filter (or kernel) over the input image and computing the dot product of the filter and local regions of the image. This operation is mathematically represented as (O = I * K), where (O) is the output feature map, (I) is the input image, and (K) is the kernel. This process can significantly reduce the number of parameters in the network. For example, instead of connecting each input pixel to every neuron in the next layer, we only connect local regions (say, 5x5 pixels) to a neuron, and we reuse the same weights for each of these local connections across the entire input, reducing the parameters from potentially millions to just the size of the filter (in this case, (5 times 5 times text{Depth of the Input})). # Stride and Padding - **Stride**: The stride dictates how much the filter moves across the input image. A stride of 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time, while a stride of 2 means it moves two pixels. Adjusting the stride changes the output size, effectively reducing it as the stride increases. - **Padding**: Padding involves adding a border of zeros (or other values) around the input image to ensure that the convolution operation output size can be adjusted to meet the requirement (e.g., preserving the input size in the output). # Nonlinearity After the convolution operation, a nonlinear activation function is applied. This is usually the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), defined as (f(x) = max(0, x)). The introduction of nonlinearity enables the network to learn complex patterns. ReLU is preferred due to its computational efficiency and ability to help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. # Pooling Pooling is a down-sampling operation aimed at reducing the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the input volume for the next convolution layer. The most common pooling method is max pooling, which partitions the input image into a set of non-overlapping rectangles and outputs the maximum for each sub-region. This operation reduces the computational complexity and the number of parameters. # Fully-Connected Layers After several convolutional and pooling layers, CNN architectures typically conclude with one or more fully-connected layers. In these layers, neurons are fully connected to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons. It is in these layers where the final classification or regression decision is made based on the high-level features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers. # Dropout To avoid overfitting, especially in fully-connected layers that contain the majority of network parameters, dropout is often employed. Dropout randomly \\"drops\\" a proportion of the nodes (i.e., sets their outputs to zero) during training, which helps to prevent the network from becoming too finely tuned to the training data. In summary, CNNs transform the input image layer by layer from raw pixel values to the final output (e.g., class scores) through a series of convolutional layers, nonlinearity activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, significantly reducing the number of parameters through weight sharing and sparse connections, thus enabling the efficient processing and analysis of images."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Why convolution ? . Let's assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32×32×3 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Three dimensional Input representation of CNN If we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32×32×3 weight connection, which will become in total, 32×32×3×2 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32×32×3 by 32×32 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14]. Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5×5 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32×32 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5×5×3 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17]. Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5×5×3=75 to connect 32×32×3 neurons to 32×32 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5×5×3 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16]. Fig. 3. Convolution as alternative for fully connected network. To show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix, Fig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the connection weight in a 3×3 window. As we can see Fig.4, the matrix can be set to detect edges in the image. These matrices are also called a filter because they act like the classic filters in the image processing. However, in the convolutional neural network these filters are initialized, followed by the training procedure shape filters, which are more suitable for the given task. To make this method more beneficial, it is possible to add more layers after the input layer. Each layer can be associated with different filters. Therefore, we can extract different features from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are connected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter and therefore extracts different features from the input. The neurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the same part of the input image.

Try to use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","output":"The principle of Convolution in neural networks, particularly in the context of image and video processing, can be understood by addressing the inefficiencies of fully connected networks. Let's break it down for clarity: 1. **Problem with Fully Connected Layers:** Imagine we have an input such as a CIFAR-10 color image, which is 32 pixels wide, 32 pixels tall, and has 3 color channels (RGB). If we connect every input pixel to just one neuron in the next layer of a fully connected network, we end up with a massive number of weight connections (32x32x3 for each neuron). This quantity multiplies further as more neurons are added to the layer, leading to an explosive growth in parameters needed to be learned, which is both computationally expensive and inefficient. 2. **Enter Convolution:** The key insight behind using convolution layers instead of fully connected layers lies in recognizing that we can process images more efficiently by focusing on local regions rather than the entire image at once. This is due to the spatial hierarchy in images, where certain features like edges, textures, and patterns can be detected with small, localized filters. 3. **Local Connectivity:** By focusing on small regions (e.g., 5x5 patches) of the input image, we drastically reduce the number of connections. If our goal is to have an output layer that also respects the spatial structure of the image (e.g., a 32x32 grid of neurons each processing a local part of the image), we would use a 5x5x3 filter (capturing the RGB depth) that moves across the input image. This dramatically lessens the parameters count since we're now dealing with a fixed \\"window\\" of weights across all regions of the image, rather than unique weights for every potential connection. 4. **Parameter Sharing:** An additional layer of efficiency comes from using the same weights across different parts of the image, i.e., the filters are shared. This means that regardless of where a feature appears in the image, our convolutional filter can detect it. This significantly drops the number of unique weights we need to learn, from potentially millions in a fully connected scenario to just the size of the filter (e.g., 5x5x3 = 75 weights). 5. **Feature Detection and Hierarchical Processing:** With convolution, we can design filters that detect specific types of features (edges, corners, etc.) at various layers of the network. Early layers might identify simple features like edges, while deeper layers can recognize more complex patterns. By stacking multiple convolutional layers, each with its own filters, we can process images in a hierarchical fashion, extracting more abstract features at higher levels. 6. **Benefits of Convolution:** The convolution operation dramatically reduces the number of parameters, making the network more efficient and less prone to overfitting. It also enables the network to develop translational invariance, meaning it can recognize features regardless of their position in the input. This makes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) particularly suited for tasks like image recognition, where the spatial hierarchy and position-invariance of features are crucial. To summarize, the principle of convolution in neural networks radically improves efficiency by focusing on local connections and reusing a set of weights across the entire input space. This approach not only reduces the computational burden but also aligns with how visual features tend to be distributed in natural images, making it a powerful technique for image and video analysis."},{"instruction":"“A.

Try to use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","output":"The principle of convolution in the context of neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is an efficient and powerful way of processing images, videos, or any data that has a spatial structure. The core idea behind convolution is to reduce the complexity and computational cost associated with fully connected layers, where every input unit is connected to every unit in the next layer, which can result in an enormous number of parameters to learn. For example, given an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a 32x32 pixels color image with three channels (RGB), connecting the image to just one neuron in a fully connected manner would require 32x32x3 (3072) weight connections. This number rises linearly with more neurons added to the layer, quickly leading to a vast quantity of parameters even for small networks. The convolution approach simplifies this by applying two key concepts: 1. **Local connectivity**: Instead of connecting each input unit to every neuron in the next layer, each neuron is only connected to a local, spatially contiguous patch of units in the input. This is based on the observation that in tasks like image processing, local groups of inputs (pixels) often hold the most immediate relevance to each other. For instance, to detect an edge in an image, only a small window of pixels around the edge is relevant at any one moment. 2. **Shared weights (parameter sharing)**: Instead of learning a unique set of weights for every such local connection, the same set of weights (a filter or kernel) is applied across all locations of the input. This drastically reduces the number of free parameters. For a 5x5 filter operating over a 32x32x3 image, instead of needing a separate 5x5x3 set of weights for each possible position in the input, we only need a single 5x5x3 set of weights, totaling 75 weights. This filter is slid or \\"convolved\\" across the input image, processing local regions one at a time, and producing a feature map that highlights specific features detected by that filter, such as edges. The convolution operation enables networks to learn filters that autonomously discover useful features in the input with far fewer parameters, thereby facilitating deeper and more efficient networks. Each filter in a convolutional layer can detect a specific feature, and as the input passes through successive layers, more complex features can be detected. Multiple filters can be applied in parallel to detect various features at each level of the network. One of the significant advantages of this approach is translational invariance: once a filter has learned to recognize a feature, it can detect that feature anywhere in the input image. This is particularly useful for tasks such as image recognition, where the position of an object in an image should not affect the network's ability to recognize the object. In summary, convolution leverages local connectivity and shared weights to efficiently process spatial data, significantly reducing the number of parameters required and enabling the network to learn to detect and compose hierarchical features from the data, which is key for tasks like image and video recognition."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Also: Eroberung der politischen Macht auf parlamentarischem, gesetzlichem Wege oder auf »dem Wege der Gewalt« (ebd., 104) durch Revolution. Letzteres sei abzulehnen (ebd., 45f.). Bernstein spricht von »Selbsttäuschungen« - gerade auch bei Marx und Engels - über den Gang der historischen Ereignisse und die dadurch jetzt notwendige Korrektur bezüglich der Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (ebd., 41). Mit dem von Engels 1891 im Vorwort zu Marx' »Klassenkämpfe in Frankreich« gemachten Eingeständnis der >Irrtümer< von Marx hinsichtlich der »Zeitdauer der sozialen und politischen Entwicklung« sei bereits die »nötige Revision« der Marx- schen Theorie angedacht (ebd.). Engels habe dort Wahlrecht und »parlamentarische Tätigkeit als Mittel der Arbeiteremanzipation« gepriesen und sich von »der Idee der Eroberung der politischen Macht durch revolutionäre Überrumpelung« verabschiedet (ebd., 50). Bernstein geht es darum, die »Arbeiterklasse politisch zu organisieren [...] und für alle Reformen im Staate zu kämpfen, welche geeignet sind, die Arbeiterklasse zu heben und das Staatswesen im Sinne der Demokratie umzugestalten« (ebd., 10). Das Ziel Sozialismus ist für ihn - wie er sich polemisch äußert - »nichts« (ebd., 11). Der Alternative von revolutionärer und reformistischer politischer Taktik Findet ihren Ausdruck auch in einer weiteren Gegenüberstellung, die Bernstein aufmacht. Er begreift die Marxsche »Lehre« (ebd., 52) einerseits als Ökonomie, als »Erforschung der ökonomischen Struktur der Gesellschaft« (ebd., 40) andererseits als Revolutionstheorie im Sinne eines »Wunderglaubens] an die schöpferische Kraft der Gewalt« (ebd.). Bernstein lobt zunächst die ökonomischen Einsichten Marx', kennzeichnet jedoch die Marxschc Revolutionstheorie als blanquistisch, als eine Theorie der »unermesslich schöpferischen Kraft der revolutionären politischen Gewalt« (ebd., 43). Der »proletarische Terrorismus« werde darin zur »Wunderkraft« erhoben (ebd., 45). Bernstein sieht hier ein weitgehendes theoretisches Defizit bei Marx wie auch, mit Abstrichen, bei Engels, bzw. einen »intellektuellen Fehler«, nämlich den eines »Dualismus in ihrer Theorie« (ebd.). Den theoretischen Ursprung dieser Fehler macht er in der Hegeischen Dialektik aus. Sie sei das » [V] erräterische an der Marxschen Doktrin« (ebd., 4 1), und sie habe Marx und Engels auf den Irrweg einer blanquistischen Position gebracht (ebd., 43). Die Revision der Theorie, die Bernstein eigentlich schon von Engels erwartete, ist wesentlich die Abrechnung mit der »Hegeldialektik«. Bernstein selbst steht methodisch auf dem Boden eines naiven Positivismus. Unter wissenschaftlichem Sozialismus (ein Begriff von Engels) versteht Bernstein jene Erkenntnis, die »eines objektiven, nur auf Erfahrung und Logik als Beweismaterial angewiesenen und mit ihnen übereinstimmenden Beweises fähig ist« (ebd., 15). Die Erkenntnissätze würden aus »einschlägigen Erfahrungen abgeleitet« (ebd.). Gewähr bieten ihm Marx' Vorwort von »Zur Kritik« (MEW 13) und Engels (Bernstein 1899, 16). Auch die Marxsche Kritik der politischen Ökonomie wird ihm zur ökonomischen >Lehre<, die er auf die politische Ökonomie abbildet und die er dann gegen die akademische Nationalökonomie eintauscht.13 Bernstein macht aus dem Revolutionsbegriff einen des militärisch-gewaltsamen Umsturzes zur Ergreifung der Staatsgewalt durch die proletarischen >Massen<. Da dies nicht mehr zeitgemäß sei, wie der späte Engels selbst erkannt habe, bleibe einzig die friedliche parlamentarische Arbeit im Rahmen der von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft gesetzten politischen B etätigungsformen des Parlamentarismus. Es gelte nun, mittels der Institutionen der bürgerlichen Öffentlichkeit die bürgerliche Gesellschaft samt Kapitalismus abzuschaffen. Was Bernstein hier unter abschaffen versteht, bleibt j edoch unklar, denn in seiner Argumentation insistiert er darauf, die So-zialdemokratie solle die bürgerliche Gesellschaft nicht abschaffen, sondern zum Wohle der Arbeiter verändern. Der Proletarier solle Bürger werden. Bernstein stellt einen »Widerspruch zwischen wirklicher und konstruierter Ent-wicklungsreife« des Proletariats fest (Bernstein 1899, 38). Entgegen der Annahme von Marx und Engels sei die Lohnarbeiterschaft heterogen, er spricht von ausgeprägten Differenzierungen, in Bezug auf die Einkommenshöhe und die Bedürfnisse (Bernstein 1899, 67, 106f.). Mit der Erhöhung der Produktivkraft gehe eine Steigerung gerade der Massenproduktion von Gebrauchsgütern einher (Bernstein 1899, 67). Krisen erscheinen zunehmend als unwahrscheinlich, die Regulierung der Wirtschaft - nicht über den Staat, sondern über eine hoch organisierte und kartellisierte Wirtschaft (ebd., 94f.) - scheint möglich. Für Bernstein ist das allgemeine Wahlrecht »die Alternative des Umsturzes« (ebd., 146). Die Sozialdemokratie müsse sich rückhaltlos auf den Boden des allgemeinen Wahlrechts stellen (146), das Wahlrecht mache »seinen Inhaber virtuell zu einem Teilhaber am Gemeinwesen« (145, vgl. 165). Bernstein wendet sich gegen die Verunglimpfung des Begriffs >bürgerlich<: »Aber was heißt Bekämpfung oder Abschaffung der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft?« (148). »Kein Mensch denkt daran, der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft als einem zivilistisch geordneten Gemeinwesen an den Leib zu wollen. Im Gegenteil.« Die Sozialdemokratie arbeite »unablässig daran, den Arbeiter aus der sozialen Stellung eines Proletariers zu der eines Bürgers zu erheben« (148, 165). Dann werde er auch ein Vaterland haben. Die Nation aufzulösen, erst recht die deutsche, sei kein schöner Traum (165). Ebenso wendet sich Bernstein gegen die Verunglimpfung des Liberalismus. Der Sozialismus sei legitimer Erbe des Liberalismus (149f.). Er lässt »das Prinzip der wirtschaftlichen Sclbstverantwortlichkeit« hochleben, sie sei »die Gegenleistung des Individuums an die Gesellschaft für die ihm erwiesenen oder gebotenen Dienste« (150) , müsse aber aller Härten entkleidet werden (151): »Ohne Verantwortlichkeit keine Freiheit« (150). Ein Recht auf Arbeit dagegen sei »nicht einmal wünschbar« (151) . Die Forderung nach Unterhalt der Erwerbslosen aus Staatsmitteln ist für ihn eine der »ewigen Anweisungen auf den Staat« und damit »des Guten zu viel« (163). Bernsteins Staatsverständnis erscheint nun, nach seiner Emanzipation vom sozi-aldemokratischen Marxismus, als ein liberales. Es ist nationalistisch geprägt und versteht die Hebung der Lage der Arbeiter auch in diesem Sinne.”翻译为中文","output":"他为社会民主党的政治策略提出了以下替代方案：要么通过政治灾难夺取权力，如恩格斯在他对马克思《法兰西阶级斗争》前言中所描述的突袭战术，要么通过法律手段，即社会民主党的选票增长，即“议会活动的缓慢宣传”。因此：通过议会、合法途径或通过革命即“暴力途径”夺取政治权力。后者应被拒绝。伯恩斯坦提到的“自欺欺人”——特别是在马克思和恩格斯身上——关于历史事件进程的错误判断，以及由此对社会民主党任务所需进行的修正。恩格斯在1891年对马克思《法兰西阶级斗争》的前言中承认马克思对“社会和政治发展的时间长度”的错误，已经提出了对马克思理论“必要的修正”。恩格斯在那里赞扬了选举权和“议会活动作为工人解放的手段”，并放弃了“通过革命突袭夺取政治权力的想法”。 伯恩斯坦的目的是“政治组织工人阶级……并为国家中所有能提升工人阶级地位、以民主方式改造国家机构的改革而战斗”。对他而言，社会主义的目标——正如他讽刺性地表达的——“无足轻重”。 革命与改良主义政治策略的替代方案，也在伯恩斯坦提出的另一对比中得到体现。他一方面认为马克思的“学说”是经济学，即“社会经济结构的探索”，另一方面是作为对“暴力创造力奇迹信仰”的革命理论。伯恩斯坦首先赞扬了马克思的经济洞察力，但将马克思的革命理论定义为布朗基主义，即“革命政治暴力无限创造力”的理论。“无产阶级恐怖主义”在其中被视为“奇迹力量”。伯恩斯坦在这里看到了马克思和恩格斯的一个重大理论缺陷，或者说是“理论中的双重性”的“智力错误”。 他认为这些错误的理论来源是黑格尔辩证法。这是马克思主义教义中的“误导性”，它使马克思和恩格斯误入了布朗基主义立场。伯恩斯坦实际上期待恩格斯进行的理论修正，主要是与“黑格尔辩证法”的清算。 伯恩斯坦自己在方法上站在了一种朴素的实证主义立场上。他将科学社会主义（恩格斯的概念）理解为那种“能够通过经验和逻辑作为证据，并与之一致的证明”的认识，这些认识论点是从“相关经验中派生出来的”。马克思在《批判》的序言和恩格斯为他提供了依据。马克思的政治经济学批判也成为了他用以理解政治经济学的经济“学说”，他将其应用于政治经济学，并用之取代学术界的国民经济学。 伯恩斯坦将革命概念转变为通过军事暴力推翻以由无产阶级“群众”夺取国家权力的行为。正如晚年的恩格斯自己所认识到的，这已不再是时代的需要，唯一留下的就是在资产阶级社会设定的政治活动框架——议会主义内进行和平的议会工作。目标现在是，通过资产阶级公共机构的手段来废除资产阶级社会及其资本主义。然而，伯恩斯坦所理解的“废除”含糊不清，因为在他的论述中，他坚持认为社会民主党不应废除资产阶级社会，而是为了工人的利益而改变它。无产者应成为公民。 伯恩斯坦指出了无产阶级实际与假设发展成熟度之间的“矛盾”。与马克思和恩格斯的假设相反，工薪阶层是异质的，他谈到了关于收入水平和需求的显著差异。随着生产力的提高，使用产品的大规模生产尤其增加（伯恩斯坦 1899，67）。危机似乎越来越不可能，通过高度组织和形成卡特尔的经济（同上，94f）对经济进行调节似乎是可能的。 对于伯恩斯坦来说，普选权是“颠覆的替代方案”（同上，146）。社会民主党必须坚定地支持普选权（146），选举权使“其持有者实质上成为国家的一部分”（145，参见165）。 伯恩斯坦反对贬低“资产阶级”一词：“但是，对抗或废除资产阶级社会意味着什么？”（148）“没有人想要伤害作为一个文明社会秩序的资产阶级社会。相反。”社会民主党“不懈地工作，将工人从无产者的社会地位提升为公民”（148，165）。然后他也会有一个祖国。解散民族，尤其是解散德国，不是一个美好的梦想（165）。 同样，伯恩斯坦反对诋毁自由主义。社会主义是自由主义的合法继承者（149f）。他高度评价“经济自我责任原则”，它是“个体对社会提供的或所提供的服务的回报”（150），但必须去除所有苛刻之处（151）：“没有责任就没有自由”（150）。相反，就业权利甚至“不值得期望”（151）。要求用国家资金养活失业者对他来说是对国家的“永久索赔”，因而“过犹不及”（163）。 在脱离了社会民主党派马克思主义之后，伯恩斯坦的国家观念现在显得是自由主义的。它带有民族主义色彩，并以这种方式理解提高工人状况。"},{"instruction":"请将“Kautsky Bis zum Erscheinen von Bernsteins Artikelserie galten Kautsky und Bernstein als die marxistischen Theoretiker der Sozialdemokratie. Sie waren seit ihrer gemeinsamen Arbeit bei Höchberg freundschaftlich verbunden. Kautsky tritt 1899 nach kurzem Zögern theoretisch gegen den Revisionismus Bernsteins auf (Kautsky 1899). Auf dem Parteitag 1903 wurde der Revisionismus noch mehrheitlich abgelehnt. Auf dem Magdeburger Parteitag von 1910 etabliert sich mit Kautsky und Bebel ein marxistisches >Zentrum<. Dessen politische Vorgaben sind Wahrung der Einheit der Partei und Kautskys Ermattungsstrategie (Koth 1993, 136). Kautsky wendet sich später deutlicher Reformpositionen zu. Zuvor erstellen Bernstein und Kautsky das Erfurter Programm von 1891, zu dem Kautsky den theoretischen Teil und Bernstein die praktischen Reformforderungen beisteuert. Die Reformforderungen beziehen sich im Wesentlichen auf die Schaffung bürgerlicher Verhältnisse. Programmatisch formuliert Kautsky im ersten Teil: »Der Kampf der Arbeiterklasse gegen die kapitalistische Ausbeutung ist notwendigerweise ein politischer Kampf. Die Arbeiterklasse kann ihre ökonomischen Kämpfe nicht fuhren und ihre ökonomische Organisation nicht entwickeln ohne politische Rechte. Sie kann den Übergang der Produktionsmittel in den Besitz der Gesamtheit nicht bewirken, ohne in den Besitz der politischen Macht gekommen zu sein. Diesen Kampf der Arbeiterklasse zu einem bewußten und einheitlichen zu gestalten und ihm sein naturnotwendiges Ziel zu weisen - das ist die Aufgabe der Sozialdemokratischen Partei.« Im Vordergrund steht der politische Kampf um bürgerliche Rechte - angesichts des Zustandes des bürgerlichen Staates in Deutschland eine naheliegende, keine revolutionäre Forderung. Die Besitzveränderung der Produktionsmittel als weitergehende Forderung wird unter die Bedingung der Eroberung der politischen Macht gestellt. Über diese Perspektive geht Kautsky auch in seiner Schrift »Der Weg zur Macht« nicht hinaus. Er knüpft in dieser Schrift an die im Programm formulierten Aufgaben der sozi-aldemokratischen Partei an. Die Sozialdemokratie erkenne, »daß die Staatsgewalt ein Werkzeug der Klassenherrschaft [...] und daß die soziale Revolution, die das Proletariat anstrebt, nicht durchzuführen ist, so lange es nicht die politische Macht erobert hat« (Kautsky 1909, 15).14 Politische und soziale Revolution geraten hier in ein Abfolgeverhältnis, das Primat übernimmt die politische Revolution als Eroberung der Staatsmacht (52). Marx dagegen kritisiert das Denken in der »Form der Politik« als beschränkt (MEW 1, 407f.). Die Staatsgewalt wird bei Kautsky zur Instanz, die das kapitalistische Eigentum an Produktionsmitteln in gesellschaftliches verwandelt (46). Revolution bedeutet für ihn »erhebliche Machtverschiebungen im Staat« (19). Deutlich wird, was Kautsky als Revolution vor Augen hat: Eine politische Revolution (63), die er als »energische Verschiebung der Machtverhältnisse im Staat« kennzeichnet (31). Die Aufgabe der Sozialdemokratie sei es, die »verschiedenen Gegenwirkungen des Proletariats gegen seine Ausbeutung zu zielbewusstem und einheitlichem Wirken zusammenzufassen, das seinen Gipfelpunkt findet in den großen Endkämpfen um die Eroberung der politischen Macht« (16). Die Staatsgewalt festzuhalten gelinge, wenn das Proletariat zu einer »großen Masse« angewachsen und »stets organisiert« (63) sowie über seine »Klassenlage sowie über das Wesen von Staat und Gesellschaft aufgeklärt« sei (16). Die Sozialdemokratie müsse dem Proletariat das ihm fehlende Bewusstsein seiner Kraft beibringen, durch Aufklärung und Tat (46). Dies geschehe durch gewerkschaftliche und vor allem parlamentarische Erfolge. Die proletarischen Organisationen selbst bildeten in normalen Zeiten immer nur eine »Elite« (64). Deren Aufgabe sei es, »selbst seine zurückgebliebensten Elemente [zu] organisieren und [zu] bilden« und die »ökonomische Umwandlung zu leiten« (112). Nach seiner Ansicht verschärfen sich die Klassengcgensätze, und alles läuft mit Notwendigkeit auf die Entscheidungsschlacht im sozialen Krieg hinaus, für die die Arbeiterklasse gerüstet sein muss.15 Die Aufgabe, dies zu gewährleisten, übernimmt die Sozialdemokratie. Prophezeiungen für den großen Kladderadatsch nehmen dabei eine wichtige Rolle ein, sie seien eine »unerlässliche Tätigkeit« flir den Politiker (26, vgl. 31). Den revisionistischen Vorstellungen eines Hineinwachsens in den Zukunftsstaat durch den stetigen Ausbau der schon gewonnenen Errungenschaften erteilt Kautsky eine Absage (18f., 32). Es ginge jedoch nicht darum, »Gesetze im Sinne des Proletariats« nicht zu unterstützen. Kautsky wendet sich lediglich gegen die Auffassung, die Ausbeuterklasse würde solches zulassen, ohne einen Widerstand zu entwickeln, der in den »Entscheidungskampf« führe (19). Kautsky argumentiert gegen Koalitionsregierungen mit bürgerlichen Parteien, da er den Interessengcgensatz von Proletariat und besitzender Klasse für zu groß ansieht. Die Diktatur des Proletariats interpretiert er als politische »Alleinherrschaft«, sie sei für das Proletariat die einzig mögliche Form der politischen Machtausübung im Staat (20). Die Möglichkeit der Versöhnung der Klassen - auch über die Tarifpartnerschaft - hält er für eine Chimäre (32f.). Hineinwachsen bedeute zwar einerseits, dem Sozialismus entgegenzuwachsen durch Konzentration und Zentralisation des Kapitals sowie durch das verbreitetere Aktienwesen, andererseits jedoch durch die wachsende Organisation des Proletariats. Doch bleibe der Gegensatz zwischen Kapital und Arbeit dabei unangetastet, verschärfe sich sogar noch (32ff., 80ff.). Kautskys »friedliche Methode des Klassenkampfes«, die sich auf Parlamentarismus, Streiks, Demonstrationen, Presse etc. stützen will, setzt auf »einigermaßen demokratische [...] Institutionen« (54) und die Ruhe und Selbstbeherrschung des Proletariats. Seine Strategie ist: »Anwendung der [...] >gesetzlichen< Methoden«, so lange es geht (54), Übernahme der politischen Macht im Endkampf. Die »>direkte Aktion< der Gewerkschaften« könne »nur als Ergänzung und Verstärkung, nicht als Ersetzung der parlamentarischen Tätigkeit« angesehen werden (87). Marx werde, so Kautsky, angeklagt wegen seiner Annahme einer automatischen ökonomischen Entwicklung, die vom menschlichen Willen nichts wisse. Kautsky sieht dies gerade als Stärke an. Den Theoretikern des Hineinwachsens diene der freie Wille dazu, ein theoretisches Loch zu stopfen: Sie könnten mit ihrer Annahme, der freie Wille könne die Entwicklung gestalten, keine Angaben mehr über irgendeine Entwicklungsrichtung machen. Ohne Entwicklungsgesetz ist für Kautsky eine wissenschaftliche Erkenntnis der Gesellschaft jedoch unmöglich (36f.). Kautskys mechanisch-naturwissenschaftliche Entwicklungstheorie unterscheidet sich zunächst nur in einem wesentlichen Punkt von der seiner revisionistischen Gegner: Kautsky beharrt in der Erwartung des ökonomischen Zusammenbruchs und des politischen Endkampfs weitgehend darauf, dass reformerische Bündnisse mit anderen bürgerlichen Parteien ausgeschlagen werden müssten. Am Ende steht die Übernahme der Staatsmacht und - bei ihm immer noch - die Idee einer radikalen Veränderung der Eigentumsverhältnisse. Die Entwicklung selbst erscheint mehr oder weniger zwangsläufig, naturgesetzlich. Die siegreiche Revolution erwartet er vergebens. Als später in Russland die Sozialdemokratie die politische Macht übernehmen wird, ist Kautsky Gegner Lenins.16 Lenin Die Spannungen zwischen Lenin und Kautsky erreichen ihren Höhepunkt 1917/18. Die europäische Sozialdemokratie differenziert sich mit der Oktoberrevolution und den Ergebnissen des Ersten Weltkriegs in eine mit und eine ohne erfolgreiche politische Revolution. Insofern finden sich, z. T. auch aufgrund der unterschiedlichen gesellschaftlichen B edingungen in den verschiedenen Ländern, national unterschiedliche Strategien sozialdemokratischer Machtübernahme im Staat. Zum Teil ist der Eindruck zu gewinnen, dass die Unterschiede weniger durch theoretische Differenzen zwischen Lenin und Kautsky entstanden sind als durch die unterschiedlichen Bedingungen, unter denen die Theorie angewendet werden sollte. Kautsky kann trotz der Differenzen mit Lenin als dessen Lehrer bezeichnet werden. Lenin lobt den früheren, nicht-opportunistischen Kautsky auch in seinen diesen kritisierenden Schriften. Als Lenin 1919 an der Swerdlow-Universität eine Vorlesung »Über den Staat« hielt, führte er aus, »daß sich wohl kaum eine Frage finden wird, die von den Vertretern der bürgerlichen Wissenschaft, Philosophie, Jurisprudenz, Politischen Ökonomie und Publizistik absichtlich und unabsichtlich so verwirrt worden ist, wie die Frage des Staates. « Wie nun löst Lenin diese? Um dies zu beantworten werfen wir hier einen Blick in Lenins programmatische Schrift »Staat und Revolution« von 1917 (LW 25), die er aufgrund der einbrechenden Oktoberereignisse nicht ganz fertig stellen konnte.”翻译为中文","output":"在伯恩斯坦的系列文章出现之前，考茨基和伯恩斯坦被视为社会民主党的马克思主义理论家。他们自从在霍赫贝格共同工作以来便建立了友谊。1899年，考茨基在短暂的犹豫后理论上反对伯恩斯坦的修正主义（考茨基1899）。1903年的党代会上，修正主义仍被大多数人拒绝。1910年的马格德堡党代会上，以考茨基和贝贝尔为中心的马克思主义“中心派”确立。其政治指导原则是维护党的统一和考茨基的耗竭战略（科特1993，136）。后来，考茨基转向了更明确的改革立场。 此前，伯恩斯坦和考茨基共同制定了1891年的埃尔福特纲领，其中考茨基贡献了理论部分，而伯恩斯坦贡献了实践改革要求。这些改革要求主要关注建立资产阶级制度。考茨基在第一部分中提出纲领性的声明：“工人阶级反抗资本主义剥削的斗争必然是一场政治斗争。工人阶级不可能进行其经济斗争，也不能发展其经济组织而不拥有政治权利。没有获得政治权力，它们就不能实现生产手段转变为全体社会的所有。社会民主党的任务就是将工人阶级的斗争变为有意识且统一的斗争，并为其指明自然必然的目标。” 首要的是围绕资产阶级权利的政治斗争——鉴于德国资产阶级国家的状态，这是一个显而易见的，非革命性要求。将生产手段的所有权变更作为更进一步的要求，其条件是必须先夺取政治权力。考茨基在他的著作《通往权力的道路》中也没有超出这一视角。 在这部著作中，他基于纲领中所述的社会民主党的任务。社会民主党认识到，“国家权力是阶级统治的工具……社会革命，即无产阶级所追求的，不能在未夺得政治权力之前实现”（考茨基1909，15）。政治与社会革命在这里处于一个顺序关系中，由政治革命作为夺取国家权力的主导（52）。然而，马克思批评了以“政治形式”思考的局限性（马恩文集1，407f。）。 在考茨基看来，国家权力成为将资本主义生产资料所有权转变为社会所有权的机构（46）。对他而言，革命意味着“国家内部的重大权力转移”(19)。清楚地界定了考茨基眼中的革命：一个政治革命（63），他将其描述为“国家内力量关系的激进转移”（31）。 社会民主党的任务是将“无产阶级对其剥削的各种反作用集中为有目标和统一的行动，其高潮在于最后冲击中夺取政治权力”（16）。如果无产阶级增长为“庞大的群体”并“持续组织化”，以及对其“阶级状况以及国家和社会的本质有所了解”，则能够维持国家权力（63）。社会民主党必须向无产阶级灌输其力量的意识，通过启蒙和行动（46）。这是通过工会和尤其是议会成就达成的。无产阶级组织本身在正常时期始终只是一个“精英”（64）。其任务是“组织和培养其最落后的成员”并“引导经济转型”（112）。 在他看来，阶级对立加剧，一切都必然导向社会战争中的决战，而工人阶级必须为此做好准备。确保这一点的任务由社会民主党承担。对伟大决战的预言在此扮演了重要角色，这是政治家的“必不可少的活动”（26，参见31）。 考茨基拒绝了通过不断扩展已获得成就渐进式成长为未来国家的修正主义观点（18f，32）。然而，问题并不在于不支持“符合无产阶级意愿的法律”。考茨基仅反对那种观点，即剥削阶级会允许这种情况发生而不发展成反抗“决战”的抵抗（19）。考茨基反对与资产阶级党派的联合政府，因为他认为无产阶级和拥有阶级之间的利益冲突太大。他将无产阶级专政解释为政治上的“独裁统治”，对于无产阶级而言，这是在国家内行使政治权力的唯一可能形式（20）。通过集体谈判实现阶级和解的可能性在他看来是一种幻想（32f）。混合成长意味着一方面通过资本的集中和中央化以及更广泛的股份制度向社会主义成长，另一方面则通过无产阶级的日益增长的组织。然而，资本与劳动之间的对立依然存在，甚至还会加剧（32ff，80ff）。 考茨基的“和平阶级斗争方法”寄希望于“相对民主的……制度”（54）以及无产阶级的冷静与自我控制。他的策略是：“只要可能，就应用……‘合法’的方法”（54），在最后冲击中夺取政治权力。“工会的‘直接行动’”只能被视为对议会活动的补充和加强，而非取代（87）。 考茨基指出，马克思因其假设自动经济发展，不知人类意志为何物而被指责。考茨基认为这正是其力量所在。混合成长的理论家利用自由意志来填补理论上的空白：他们凭借自由意志可以塑造发展的假设，无法对任何发展方向作出具体说明。在考茨基看来，没有发展法则，对社会的科学认识是不可能的（36f）。 考茨基的机械-自然科学发展理论最初只在一个关键点上与他的修正主义对手不同：考茨基坚持等待经济崩溃和政治最后斗争的预期，大体上拒绝与其他资产阶级党派形成改革联盟。最终是夺取国家权力，以及对他来说仍然是财产关系的根本改变的理念。发展本身看似或多或少不可避免，遵循自然法则。 他徒劳地等待了胜利的革命。当俄国社会民主党后来获得政治权力时，考茨基成了列宁的对手。 列宁 列宁与考茨基之间的紧张关系在1917/18年达到高潮。随着十月革命和第一次世界大战的结果，欧洲社会民主党分化为实现了政治革命的派别和未实现的派别。因此，在不同国家中，部分是由于不同的社会条件，找到了不同的社会民主党在国家中获取权力的策略。部分由于理论差异少于列宁和考茨基之间的差异，更多是应用理论时环境的不同导致了策略区别。尽管与列宁有分歧，考茨基可以被称为其老师。列宁在批判他的著作中也称赞了早期的、非机会主义的考茨基。 当列宁1919年在斯维尔德洛夫大学就“关于国家”的主题讲课时，他指出，“几乎找不到哪个问题比国家问题更被资产阶级科学、哲学、法学、政治经济学和新闻学的代表们故意或非故意地混淆了。”那么列宁是如何解决这个问题的呢？为了回答这个问题，我们在这里回顾一下列宁在1917年编写的、因十月革命的爆发而未能完全完成的纲领性著作《国家与革命》（列宁全集25卷）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die Marxsche »Lehre vom Staat«, an deren Grundeinsichten Lenin festhalten will, sei durch das »Kautskyanertum« entstellt worden (LW 25, 398). Lenins »Wiederherstellung der wahren Marxschen Lehre vom Staat« (397) gründet sich vornehmlich auf die Engelsschen Schriften. Er zitiert längere Passagen aus »Der Ursprung der Familie« und dem »Anti-Dühring«. Lenin lässt wie Engels und Kautsky den Staat historisch aus den Klassenkämpfen entstehen. Kautsky halte zwar daran fest, dass der Staat » Organ der Klassenherrschaft« und die Klassengegensätze unversöhnlich seien, was er j edoch unterschlage, sei, dass zur Überwindung dieser eine gewaltsame Revolution sowie die »Vernichtung des von der herrschenden Klasse geschaffenen Apparates der Staatsge- wait« nötig sei (400, vgl. 413). Der bürgerliche Staat sei die Repressionsgewalt »einer Handvoll reicher Leute« (409). Lenin reduziert Staat hauptsächlich auf eine bewaffnete Macht zur politischen Unterdrückung (402). Zentrales Thema für Lenin ist die Differenz von zu zerschlagendem Staat in und absterbendem Staat nach der revolutionären Machtübernahme in der Diktatur des Proletariats. »Der bürgerliche Staat >stirbt< nach Engels nicht >ab<, sondern er wird in der Revolution vom Proletariat >aufgehoben<. Nach dieser Revolution stirbt der proletarische Staat oder Halbstaat ab« (409, vgl. 413). Lenin vollzieht eine Trennung zwischen bürgerlichem Staat, der durch die gewaltsame Revolution abgeschafft werde, und proletarischem Staat, »Halbstaat«, »unpolitischen Staat« (452), »Übergangsstaat« (477), »Staat überhaupt« (410), der absterbe, zum »Nichtstaat« (445) werde. Die unterdrückte Klasse strebe danach, »eine neue Organisation dieser Art zu schaffen« , die nun den Ausgebeuteten dienen solle (402). Die alten Institutionen ZA/'»<117T'A würden durch »Institutionen prinzipiell anderer Art ersetzt« (423). Revolution versteht Lenin als Ablösung der bürgerlichen besonderen Gewalt durch die proletarische besondere Gewalt (409). Er setzt dies mit der Aufhebung des Staates sowie mit der »Besitzergreifung der Produktionsmittel im Namen der Gesellschaft« (409) gleich.'1* Zugleich hebt er gegenüber der reformistischen Sozialdemokratie immer wieder hervor, »jeder Staat sei unfrei« (410). Richtig sei, dass das Proletariat den Staat brauche, nicht vergessen werden dürfe jedoch das Absterben oder Einschlafen des proletarischen Staates nach der Revolution (415). Der proletarische Staat ist für Lenin die Diktatur des Proletariats. Den Charakter und die Aufgaben dieser beschreibt Lenin wie folgt: »Das Proletariat braucht die Staatsgewalt, eine zentralisierte Organisation der Macht, eine Organisation der Gewalt sowohl zur Unterdrückung des Widerstands der Ausbeuter als auch zur Leitung der ungeheuren Masse der Bevölkerung, der Bauernschaft, des Kleinbürgertums, der Halbproletarier, um die sozialistische Wirtschaft >in Gang zu bringen«. Durch die Erziehung der Arbeiterpartei erzieht der Marxismus die Avantgarde des Proletariats, die fähig ist, die Macht zu ergreifen und das ganze Volk zum Sozialismus zu führen, die neue Ordnung zu leiten und zu organisieren, Lehrer, Leiter, Führer aller Werktätigen und Ausgebeuteten zu sein bei der Gestaltung ihres gesellschaftlichen Lebens ohne die Bourgeoisie und gegen die Bourgeoisie« (LW 25, 416). Hier sind wesentliche Punkte des Leninschen Staatsverständnisses präsent: - sein zentralistisches Organisationsverständnis - der Staat als Organisation der Gewalt zur Unterdrückung - der Staat als Leitungsorgan der Ökonomie - sein politisches Erziehungs- und Avantgarde-Konzept. Deutlich ist Lenins immer wieder hervorgehobene Unterscheidung zwischen dem bürgerlichen Staat und dem proletarischen mit seinen spezifischen Aufgaben. Der Staat wird bei Lenin noch deutlicher Instrument der Revolution, als dies bereits bei Kautsky festzustellen war. Lenins Revolutionsvorstellungen sind rein politischer Natur.19 Auch wenn der bürgerliche Staatsapparat nicht in Besitz zu nehmen sei, er zerschlagen werden müsse, so müsse nach Lenin das Proletariat an dessen Stelle »seinen eigenen, neuen Apparat setzen«, dieser seien die Sowjets (LW 26, 85; LW 25, 477). Mit diesem Apparat vermöge dann die »Vorhut der unterdrückten Klassen [der Arbeiter und Bauern] die ganze gigantische Masse dieser Klassen [...] zu heben, zu erziehen, zu schulen und zu führen« (LW 26, 87). Der proletarische Staat soll ein starker Staat sein, die »Staatsgewalt der bewaffneten Arbeiter« (LW 25, 439): »Sobald es sich aber um einen proletarischen Staat handelt, um eine Maschine der Gewaltanwendung des Proletariats gegen die Bourgeoisie, sind wir durchaus und uneingeschränkt für eine starke Staatsmacht und für den Zentralismus« (LW 26, 100). Der Staat wird damit vollends Instrument einer Avantgarde. Dies ist er auch im Hinblick auf die Ökonomie, die er aufbauen und leiten soll.20 Die Verwaltung der Ökonomie ist autoritär und fordert die Unterordnung unter die bewaffnete Avantgarde (LW 25, 438f.).21 Eine Verwaltung der Ökonomie durch die Räte, wie sie in dieser revolutionären Zeit virulent und in Ansätzen entstanden war, spielt bei Lenin - trotz Reminiszenzen - keine systematische Rolle. Ihm geht es um Staatseigentum an Produktionsmitteln und Plan. Vorbild sind die kapitalistischen Monopole: »Der Sozialismus ist nichts anderes als staatskapitalistisches Monopol, das zum Nutzen des ganzen Volkes angewandt wird und dadurch aufgehört hat, kapitalistisches Monopol zu sein« (LW 25, 369). Hier identifiziert Lenin selbst Sozialismus mit Staatskapitalismus. Für diesen wird dann auch der bürgerliche Staatsapparat von Bedeutung, der an anderer Stelle noch zerschlagen werden sollte: »Außer dem vorwiegend unterdrückendem Apparat des stehenden Heeres, der Polizei und der Beamtenschaft gibt es im modernen Staat einen Apparat, der besonders eng mit den Banken und Syndikaten verbunden ist, einen Apparat, der eine große Arbeit auf dem Gebiet der Rechnungsführung und Registrierung leistet [...]. Dieser Apparat darf und soll nicht zerschlagen werden. Man muß ihn aus der Unterordnung unter die Kapitalisten befreien, muß ihn den Kapitalisten entreißen« (LW 26, 89). Die Kapitalisten werden gegen die Führer des ökonomischen Verwaltungsapparats ausgetauscht. Der bürgerliche Staat soll zwar zerschlagen werden, doch finden sich bei Lenin alle seine Elemente wieder: nicht nur Armee, Aufscher etc., das bürgerliche Recht (LW 25, 481), das wiederum den bürgerlichen Staat voraussetze (LW 25, 485), auch Buchhalter und Staatsbeamte, die nun »zu einfachen Vollstreckern unserer Aufgaben« würden (LW 25, 439). Die Bürger »werden Angestellte und Arbeiter eines [...] Staats>syndikats<« und arbeiten für (gleichen) Lohn, die Fabrikdisziplin werde sich auf die ganze Gesellschaft erstrecken (LW 25, 488). Notwendig sei - so Lenin - ein »zeitweiliges Ausnutzen der Organe, Mittel und Methoden der Staatsgewalt« (LW 25, 449), und damit kann nur die bürgerliche gemeint sein. Hier bereits betreten wir j ene s Reich des logisch Unerlaubten, das später vielfältige Blüten hervorbrachte: von der sozialistischen Warenproduktion bis zur sozialistischen Ehemoral. Das Absterben des Staates wird Lenin zum »Endziel« (LW 25, 469) nach einem »Prozess von langer Dauer« (LW 25, 483). Er könne erst absterben, wenn der Kommunismus vollkommen entwickelt sei. Darunter stellt sich Lenin einen Zustand vor, in dem die Produktivkräfte enorm entwickelt sind. Der Staat leitet die geplante Ökonomie , bis sich die Produktivkräfte unter dieser Leitung soweit entwickelt haben, dass der Übergang zur höchsten Phase des Kommunismus eintritt, in dem letztlich der Staat wirklich absterben soll. Auf diesen technischen Evolutionismus reduziert sich dann das Verständnis sozialer Revolution - sie kommt nicht mehr vor. Lenins Begriffe von Staat, Revolution, Ökonomie bleiben rein politisch, den bürgerlichen Vorstellungen zutiefst verhaftet. Der Kommunismus wird zum fernen Endziel, er scheint ihm nichts zu bedeuten im Unterschied zum Weg der effektiven Modernisierung und damit Durchkapitalisierung der Nation. Die bei Lenin ins Zentrum gerückte Diktatur des Proletariats (LW 25, 424f.) bleibt Staat. Was wird nach Lenins Ausführungen vom bürgerlichen Staat durch die Machtübernahme zerschlagen? Die bisherige Führung? Der Staat erhält zusätzliche Aufgaben, bis dahin gesellschaftliche, ökonomische Funktionen der Leitung, Verteilung etc. werden in den Staat aufgenommen. Lenin schreibt 1917: »Die Vollendung dieser Rolle [der revolutionären des Proletariats] ist die proletarische Diktatur, die politische Herrschaft des Proletariats« (LW 25, 417). Als er 1922 erklärte: »Wir haben den alten Staatsapparat übernommen. Das war unser Unglück!« (LW 33, 414), ist die Entwicklung bereits über ihn hinaus. Es bliebe die Einsicht: Der proletarische Staat bleibt eine Unmöglichkeit. »Die Grundfrage der Revolution ist die Frage der Macht«, Stalin hat diesen Satz Lenins verinnerlicht (Stalin 1924, 40). Für ihn ist die »Sowjetmacht« die »Staatsform der Diktatur des Proletariats« (Stalin 1924, 46), damit »das Instrument der proletarischen Revolution« (Stalin 1924, 39) und zugleich »eine neue Form der Staatsorganisation« (Stalin 1924, 48). Stalins Marxistisch-Leninistische Theorie hat den einen Zweck: Sie muss dieser Praxis dienen (Stalin 1924, 22).”翻译为中文","output":"马克思的“国家理论”，列宁希望坚持的基本见解，被“考茨基主义”歪曲了（列宁全集25卷，398页）。列宁对“真正的马克思关于国家的理论”的“恢复”（397页）主要基于恩格斯的著作。他引用了《家庭、私有制与国家的起源》和《反杜林论》中的较长段落。列宁像恩格斯和考茨基一样，将国家的产生历史地视为阶级斗争的结果。考茨基确实坚持认为国家是“阶级统治的机关”，并且阶级对立是不可调和的，但他忽略了为了克服这种对立，需要通过暴力革命以及“摧毁统治阶级创建的国家暴力机器”（400页，参见413页）。资产阶级国家是“少数富人”的镇压力量（409页）。列宁主要将国家简化为一种用于政治压迫的武装力量（402页）。 对于列宁而言，核心议题是在无产阶级专政的革命夺权前后，需被摧毁的资产阶级国家和将逐渐消亡的国家之间的区别。“根据恩格斯的说法，资产阶级国家不是‘逐渐消亡’，而是在革命中被无产阶级‘废除’。在这次革命之后，无产阶级国家或半国家将逐渐消亡”（409页，参见413页）。列宁区分了通过暴力革命被废除的资产阶级国家，和“半国家”、“非政治国家”（452页）、“过渡国家”（477页）、“综合国家”（410页），这将逐渐消亡，变成“非国家”（445页）。被压迫阶级力图“创建这种新的组织形式”，以便为被剥削者服务（402页）。旧的机构将被“根本不同性质的机构替代”（423页）。列宁将革命理解为通过无产阶级的特殊力量取代资产阶级的特殊力量（409页）。他将这与国家的废除以及“以社会名义夺取生产资料”（409页）等同起来。同时，他反复强调相对于改良主义社会民主党，“任何国家都是不自由的”（410页）。正确的是，无产阶级需要国家，但不应忘记革命后无产阶级国家的消亡或沉睡（415页）。对列宁而言，无产阶级国家是无产阶级专政。列宁描述其性质和任务如下： “无产阶级需要国家权力，需要集中组织的权力，用以镇压剥削者的反抗以及指挥庞大的人群，比如农民、小资产阶级、半无产阶级，来启动社会主义经济。”通过对工人党的教育，马克思主义培养了无产阶级的先锋队，它能够夺取权力并引领全体人民走向社会主义，指导和组织新秩序，成为在建立无资产阶级和反对资产阶级的社会生活中所有工人和被剥削者的教师、领导者、引导者（列宁全集25卷，416页）。 这里呈现了列宁国家观的几个关键点： - 他的集中式组织理念 - 国家作为镇压工具的组织 - 国家作为经济指导机关 - 他的政治教育和先锋队概念。 列宁反复强调资产阶级国家和具有特定任务的无产阶级国家之间的区别。在列宁那里，国家成为革命的工具，这一点比在考茨基那里更明显。列宁的革命想法纯粹是政治性的。 即使资产阶级国家机器不能被占有，必须被摧毁，列宁认为无产阶级必须用自己的新机器取而代之，这就是苏维埃（列宁全集26卷，85页；列宁全集25卷，477页）。有了这个机器，被压迫阶级的先锋队[工人和农民]就能够提升、教育、培训并引领这些阶级的巨大群众（列宁全集26卷，87页）。 无产阶级国家应是一个强大的国家，“武装工人的国家权力”（列宁全集25卷，439页）：“但是，一旦是无产阶级国家，是无产阶级对资产阶级使用暴力的机器，我们完全无保留地支持强大的国家权力和集中主义”（列宁全集26卷，100页）。 国家因此完全成为一个先锋队的工具。这也适用于它应构建和领导的经济。经济的管理是专制的，要求服从于武装的先锋队（列宁全集25卷，438-439页）。在这个革命时期，通过委员会管理经济的想法虽然盛行并初见雏形，但在列宁那里没有系统的作用。他关注的是国家对生产资料的所有权和计划。资本主义垄断成为范例： “社会主义不过是应用于全民利益的国家资本主义垄断，因此不再是资本主义垄断”（列宁全集25卷，369页）。在这里，列宁自己将社会主义等同于国家资本主义。对于这种国家资本主义，资产阶级国家机器变得重要，尽管在其他地方它仍然需要被摧毁： “除了现代国家的主要压迫性机构——常备军、警察和官僚机构之外，还有一个与银行和辛迪加特别紧密相连的机构，这个机构在账目记录和注册方面进行大量工作（…）。这个机构不应该也不会被摧毁。必须将它从资本家手中解放出来，夺取资本家的控制”（列宁全集26卷，89页）。资本家被替换成经济管理机构的领导者。 资产阶级国家虽然要被摧毁，但在列宁那里可以找到其所有元素：不仅有军队、官员等，还有资产阶级法律（列宁全集25卷，481页），该法律再次预设了资产阶级国家（列宁全集25卷，485页），还有会计师和国家公务员，他们现在变成了“我们任务的简单执行者”（列宁全集25卷，439页）。公民将成为“一个国家‘辛迪加’的职员和工人”，为（相同）工资工作，工厂纪律将扩展到整个社会（列宁全集25卷，488页）。列宁认为，“暂时利用国家权力的机关、手段和方法”是必要的（列宁全集25卷，449页），而这里只能指的是资产阶级国家。我们已经进入了逻辑禁区，这个禁区后来孕育了各种形式：从社会主义商品生产到社会主义婚姻道德。 对列宁而言，国家的消亡成为了“最终目标”（列宁全集25卷，469页），经过一个“漫长过程”（列宁全集25卷，483页）。只有当共产主义完全发展后，它才能开始消亡。列宁想象的是，生产力巨大发展的状态。国家领导计划经济，直到生产力在这种领导下发展到足以过渡到共产主义的最高阶段，最终国家真的将消亡。这种技术进化论最终简化了对社会革命的理解 - 它不再被提及。列宁关于国家、革命、经济的概念仍然纯粹是政治性的，与资产阶级观念深深根植。共产主义成为遥远的终极目标，与有效的现代化和国家资本化的路径相比，它似乎对他来说并无太大意义。 列宁突出的无产阶级专政（列宁全集25卷，424-425页）仍然是国家。根据列宁的论述，通过夺权摧毁了资产阶级国家的是什么？过去的领导阶层吗？国家得到了额外的任务，直到那时为止的社会、经济职能如领导、分配等被纳入国家。 列宁在1917年写道：“这一角色[无产阶级的革命性角色]的完成就是无产阶级专政，就是无产阶级的政治统治”（列宁全集25卷，417页）。当他在1922年宣称：“我们接管了旧的国家机器。这是我们的不幸！”（列宁全集33卷，414页）时，发展已经超越了他。剩下的是这样一个认识：无产阶级国家仍然是不可能的。 “革命的基本问题是权力问题”，斯大林已经内化了这一列宁的语句（斯大林1924，40页）。对他而言，“苏维埃政权”是“无产阶级专政的国家形式”（斯大林1924，46页），因此是“无产阶级革命的工具”（斯大林1924，39页），同时也是“国家组织的新形式”（斯大林1924，48页）。斯大林的马克思主义-列宁主义理论只有一个目的：它必须服务于这种实践（斯大林1924，22页）。"},{"instruction":"“A. Convolution Let’s assume that the input of our neural network has the presented shape in Fig. 2, It can be an image (e.g. color image of a CIFAR-10 dataset with a width and height of 32×32 pixels, and a depth of 3 which RGB channel) or a video (gray scale video whose height and width are the resolution, and the depth are the frames) or even an experimental video, which has width and height of (L × L) sensor values, and the depths are associated with different time frames, as in [2,10,15]. Why convolution ? . Let’s assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32×32×3 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Fig. 1. Learned features from a Convolutional Neural Network Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Downloaded on April 08,2024 at 07:52:10 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. ICET2017, Antalya, Turkey 978-1-5386-1949-0/17/31.00 ©2017 IEEE Fig. 2. Three dimensional Input representation of CNN If we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32×32×3 weight connection, which will become in total, 32×32×3×2 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32×32×3 by 32×32 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14]. Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5×5 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32×32 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5×5×3 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17]. Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5×5×3=75 to connect 32×32×3 neurons to 32×32 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5×5×3 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16]. Fig. 3. Convolution as alternative for fully connected network. To show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix, Fig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the connection weight in a 3×3 window. As we can see Fig.4, the matrix can be set to detect edges in the image. These matrices are also called a filter because they act like the classic filters in the image processing. However, in the convolutional neural network these filters are initialized, followed by the training procedure shape filters, which are more suitable for the given task. To make this method more beneficial, it is possible to add more layers after the input layer. Each layer can be associated with different filters. Therefore, we can extract different features from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are connected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter and therefore extracts different features from the input. The neurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the same part of the input image. [6,8,15,17]” From the above paper, explain and summarize the principle of Convolution with equations in detail. Try to use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","output":"The principle of convolution in the context of neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), revolves around the efficient processing of input data, such as images, to recognize patterns like edges, textures, or objects. The convolution operation significantly reduces the number of parameters required to learn from the input data by employing the following strategies: # 1. **Local Connectivity:** Instead of connecting every input pixel to every neuron in the next layer (which in fully connected layers leads to a massive number of parameters), the convolution operation connects each neuron to only a small, localized region of the input image. This localized region can be defined by a window or filter of size (F times F), where (F) is smaller than the dimension of the input image. For a (W times H times D) input (Width, Height, Depth), a kernel size of (F times F) means that each neuron in the convolutional layer looks at only (F times F times D) inputs. # 2. **Weight Sharing:** In traditional neural networks, each connection between layers has a unique weight, leading to a large number of parameters. However, in CNNs, all connections associated with a single filter share the same weights. This is analogous to sliding the filter across the entire input space and applying the same transformation everywhere. This dramatically reduces the number of unique parameters. # 3. **Equation and Operation:** The convolution operation involves sliding the filter over the input image. At each position, the filter performs an element-wise multiplication with the part of the image it covers, and the results are summed up to produce a single output pixel in the feature map. The mathematical expression for this operation (ignoring bias for simplicity) for a given position ((x, y)) is: [O(x, y) = sum_{i=0}^{F-1}sum_{j=0}^{F-1}sum_{k=0}^{D-1} I(x+i, y+j, k) times W(i, j, k)] where (O(x, y)) is the output value at position ((x, y)), (I(x+i, y+j, k)) represents the input value at the covered position with depth (k), and (W(i, j, k)) is the weight of the filter at ((i, j, k)). # 4. **Feature Detection Capability:** By using the same set of weights across the entire input, CNNs can detect features anywhere in the image. This is analogous to having a specialized tool (the filter) for finding specific patterns (like edges or corners) no matter where they appear in the input space. # 5. **Multiple Filters for Complex Feature Extraction:** CNNs usually employ multiple filters in each convolutional layer, allowing each filter to specialize in detecting different features. By stacking multiple convolutional layers, with each layer capable of recognizing more complex patterns built on the simpler features detected by preceding layers, CNNs can efficiently process and understand complex input data like images or videos. To summarize, the convolution operation in CNNs reduces the model's complexity and enhances its ability to recognize patterns across the input data by using local connectivity and weight sharing, which leads to a significant reduction in the number of parameters and the model's capacity to detect features irrespective of their spatial location in the input."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's Baldi's domain, a peculiar kind of fame, In the quest for learning, it's anything but tame. (Chorus) High learning in the strangest form, Dodge the rules, outrun the storm. Baldi’s basics, not so basic at all, In every answer, a new challenge call. (Verse 2) Each step's calculated, under Baldi's keen eye, The stakes get higher, as time ticks by. With every problem solved, a step closer to free, But the wrong answer’s a trap, can't let that be. (Pre-Chorus) In these walls, knowledge is a game, With every move, you're staking your claim. Beware of Baldi, and his deceiving simplicity, In this school, learning’s an eccentricity. (Chorus) High learning in the strangest form, Dodge the rules, outrun the storm. Baldi’s basics, not so basic at all, In every answer, a new challenge call. (Bridge) Running through these halls, a test of will, Against Baldi's rules, a thrill. Knowledge is power, but here it's a maze, In this bizarre school, a bewildering haze. (Chorus) High learning in the strangest form, Dodge the rules, outrun the storm.

以媒称以军从加沙地带南部撤出地面部队巴媒称以空袭加沙地带多地 俄称大规模打击乌军事目标乌称炸毁俄境内输油管道 国际联播快讯 以下为详细的文字版全文： 【新思想引领新征程】有效投资为高质量发展注入新动力 习近平总书记强调，要完善扩大投资机制，拓展有效投资空间。今年开年以来，服务高质量发展成为扩大有效投资的重要着力点，投资规模持续增长，投资结构质量持续提升，助力中国经济实现平稳开局。 今年前两个月出炉的数据透视出投资领域的新变化，全国固定资产投资同比增速比2023年全年明显加快，其中，制造业投资增长达到9.4%，高技术产业在整个投资中的占比持续提高。 民间投资逐步企稳，增速由负转正，占整体投资的比重比去年全年提高2.2个百分点。 重大项目进度加快，亿元及以上项目投资同比增长12.1%，增速比2023年全年加快2.8个百分点。 持续加大的投资动能正在为经济回升向好注入新动力。 习近平总书记高度重视发挥有效投资的关键性作用。他指出，要适度超前部署新型基础设施建设，扩大高技术产业和战略性新兴产业投资，持续激发民间投资活力。中央经济工作会议提出，今年要扩大有效益的投资，形成消费和投资相互促进的良性循环。 今年，中央预算内投资、新增地方政府专项债券规模都比去年有所增加，去年增发国债大部分也在今年使用，此外还将发行1万亿元超长期特别国债，政府投资规模较去年明显增加，带动的放大效应也将持续显现。 投资方向更加精准。前两个月，各地开工的重大项目里，人工智能、数据中心等战略性新兴产业的占比普遍超过五成。同时，对补短板、强弱项的投资支持力度加大。在安徽省歙县，新安江流域防洪治理工程已经开工建设，总投资25亿元中大约四成的资金来自于去年底增发的1万亿国债。工程修建完成后，当地15万群众将告别洪水威胁。 要素配置更加高效。今年以来，针对国家重大战略实施和重点领域安全能力建设，我国持续强化用地、用能等要素保障。前两个月，我国批准的建设项目先行用地面积同比增长超过七成。各地的重点工程开工率达到60%以上。 投资环境更加便利。今年，深入开展全国统一大市场建设重点领域突出问题整治，深化投融资体制改革，优化营商环境，以更大的市场空间、更低的投资成本支撑更有效益的投资。 李强会见美国财政部长 央视网消息（新闻联播）：国务院总理李强7日在京会见美国财政部长耶伦。 李强表示，在两国元首战略指引下，中美关系出现企稳态势。希望美方同中方更多相向而行，落实好两国元首重要共识，让“旧金山愿景”成为“实景”。中美加强经贸合作对双方各自发展和全球经济增长都具有重要意义。双方要加强沟通，坚持公平竞争、开放合作的市场经济基本准则，不把经贸问题泛政治化、泛安全化。要以市场眼光和全球视野，从经济规律出发，客观、辩证看待产能问题。中国的新能源产业发展，将对全球绿色低碳转型作出重要贡献。 耶伦表示，美方赞赏美中经济对话合作取得的进展，不寻求同中方“脱钩”，愿同中方一道落实两国元首旧金山会晤达成的重要共识，推动美中关系稳定发展。 中共中央办公厅印发《通知》在全党开展党纪学习教育 中共中央办公厅近日印发《关于在全党开展党纪学习教育的通知》。 《通知》指出，为深入学习贯彻修订后的《中国共产党纪律处分条例》，经党中央同意，自2024年4月至7月，在全党开展党纪学习教育。 《通知》明确，要坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，聚焦解决一些党员、干部对党规党纪不上心、不了解、不掌握等问题，组织党员特别是党员领导干部认真学习《条例》，做到学纪、知纪、明纪、守纪，把遵规守纪刻印在心，内化为言行准则。 《通知》强调，党纪学习教育要注重融入日常、抓在经常。要原原本本学，推动《条例》入脑入心；要加强警示教育，让党员、干部受警醒、明底线、知敬畏；要加强解读和培训，深化《条例》理解运用。 《通知》要求，各级党委（党组）要把开展党纪学习教育作为重要政治任务，精心组织实施，加强督促落实。 假日消费旺经济活力足

Here’s a structure to consider: # Season 1: The Emergence Plot: - Begin with the woman's ordinary world, where her powers are either dormant or she’s unaware of them. - Introduce an inciting incident where her powers manifest under extreme circumstances, drawing the attention of the government and resistance groups simultaneously. - Explore her initial interactions with both groups, framing the government as oppressors and the resistance as liberators but leave grey areas to explore later. Themes: - Identity and self-discovery - Power and responsibility - The initial allure of being seen as a savior Character Development: - Show the protagonist struggling with her new identity. - Introduce key members of the government and resistance, hinting at their motivations and backstories. # Season 2: The Tug of War Plot: - Delve into the protagonist's journey of working with both sides, each episode can focus on different missions that reveal the complexities of both groups. - A significant twist reveals that both sides have ulterior motives that don't necessarily align with her values. Themes: - Moral ambiguity and the corruption of power - Trust and betrayal Character Development: - Deepen the protagonist’s relationships with supporting characters, possibly introducing a mentor figure and a betrayer. - Begin the protagonist's internal conflict about whom to trust and her place in this world. # Season 3: The Awakening Plot: - The protagonist learns of a secret that changes everything she believes in. - She starts questioning not just the motives of both groups but her role in their war. - The climax of the season could involve her trying to escape from both groups, showcasing her full power. Themes: - Independence and self-reliance - The cost of freedom Character Development: - The protagonist's journey towards becoming more autonomous and questioning the nature of her power. - Show the repercussions of her actions on her personal relationships. # Season 4: The Reckoning Plot: - After a period of isolation, the protagonist decides she can't run from who she is. - She discovers a third path that isn't aligned with either the government or the resistance but her iniative. - Building up to a confrontation, she strategizes how to dismantle the corrupt elements of both groups, leading to a climactic battle.

Cliffhangers at the end of episodes and seasons will keep viewers engaged, wanting to know more about the protagonist's fate and the world's balance of power."},{"instruction":"how could her ending most of the resistance members and agents she meets subvert certain tropes?","output":"To subvert certain tropes with regard to the protagonist ending most of the resistance members and agents she encounters, the narrative can take unconventional routes that challenge traditional storytelling norms and audience expectations. Here's how to approach this: # 1. The 'Power Corrupts' Subversion **Traditional Trope:** The character with great power ultimately becomes corrupt and tyrannical. **Subversion:** Instead, show that her actions, while seemingly drastic, are actually part of a larger, morally complex plan to bring true peace or reform. She could be using her understanding of both sides to surgically remove those who are irredeemably corrupt or those who perpetuate the cycle of violence, sparing innocents and those capable of change. # 2. The 'Lone Hero' Subversion **Traditional Trope:** A single hero rises to challenge and overhaul the system all by themselves. **Subversion:** Make it clear that while she plays a pivotal role, the changes she seeks and starts to implement can only be sustained through collective effort. Her actions against both sides might catalyze unity among the moderate and peace-seeking individuals from both groups, driving home the point that systemic change requires collaboration. # 3. The 'Violence Is the Only Answer' Subversion **Traditional Trope:** The resolution to conflict is achieved primarily through violence. **Subversion:** Frame her actions as a last resort, and emphasize her attempts at negotiation and peace. Show that her ultimate decision to end most resistance members and agents comes from a place of protecting future peace, and where possible, she incapacitates rather than kills, or manipulates situations to avoid violence. The story could highlight the moral and psychological toll this choice takes on her, adding depth to her character and the narrative. # 4. The 'Infinitely Powerful Protagonist' Subversion **Traditional Trope:** The protagonist's powers are unmatched, making her invincible and unchallengeable. **Subversion:** Despite her significant powers, introduce limitations or vulnerabilities (emotional, physical, or moral) that she needs to navigate. This humanizes her and makes her decisions more relatable. Her action against the resistance and agents, hence, shows strategic thinking and moral quandaries, rather than just a demonstration of power. # 5. The 'Unquestioned Hero' Subversion **Traditional Trope:** The protagonist is universally celebrated for their actions by the end of the story. **Subversion:** Show that her decisions are polarizing, evoking a spectrum of reactions from the remaining characters and the world at large. Some may view her as a liberator, others as a tyrant. This can pave the way for a nuanced discussion on heroism, sacrifice, and the cost of peace within the story’s universe. # 6. The 'Savior' Subversion **Traditional Trope:** The protagonist is the savior everyone has been waiting for, depicted entirely positively. **Subversion:** Avoid positioning her as a messianic figure with unequivocal moral high ground. Instead, present her as a flawed individual making difficult decisions that she believes are for the greater good, but are open to interpretation. This can lead to complex character dynamics and moral ambiguity that enrich the narrative. # In Conclusion By subverting these tropes, the story can offer a refreshing perspective on power dynamics, morality in war, and the cost of change. It allows for a deeper, more thoughtful exploration of the protagonist's journey and the world she inhabits, engaging the audience in a dialogue about the nature of heroism and revolution."},{"instruction":"could it be subversive if her motivation for doing the deed is from being tired of all the conflict and political intrigue?","output":"Yes, having the protagonist's motivation stem from a deep weariness of conflict and political intrigue can be quite subversive, especially in narratives that often glorify continuous struggle and complex scheming as the only paths to influence or enact change. This approach can subvert several common narrative tropes in intriguing ways: # Subversion of the \\"Endless Conflict\\" Trope **Traditional Trope:** Many stories, especially in the fantasy and science fiction genres, rely on perpetual conflict as a means to drive the plot forward, suggesting that strife is an eternal aspect of existence. **Subversion:** By making the protagonist's main motivation a desire to put an end to ongoing conflict and intrigue, the narrative challenges the notion that continuous struggle is inevitable or desirable. This introduces a refreshing perspective that peace and resolution are not only worth striving for but are achievable goals. It's a narrative that asserts the value of rest and stability over the glorification of endless war and conflict. # Subversion of the \\"Hero's Journey\\" Trope **Traditional Trope:** The classic \\"Hero's Journey\\" involves a protagonist who is called to adventure, faces and overcomes challenges, and emerges victorious, usually by defeating a clear antagonist or overcoming a significant external conflict. **Subversion:** By focusing on the protagonist's weariness and her desire to end the conflict rather than win it in a conventional sense, the story subverts the traditional hero’s journey. It refocuses the narrative from victory over others to finding a solution that brings peace, including to herself. This approach elevates internal resolution and the cessation of conflict over external conquests. # Subversion of the \\"Machiavellian Intrigue\\" Trope **Traditional Trope:** Political intrigue and cunning often play a central role in narratives involving power struggles, with characters using manipulation and deceit as tools to gain or maintain power. **Subversion:** A protagonist who rejects these methods because they're tired of the duplicity and constant maneuvering offers a critique of this trope. It questions the sustainability and moral implications of such strategies and showcases a yearning for authenticity and straightforwardness in dealing with conflicts. # Subversion of the \\"Power as a Means to an End\\" Trope **Traditional Trope:** Power is frequently portrayed as the ultimate tool for achieving one's goals, with protagonists often seeking to gain or enhance their power to overcome obstacles. **Subversion:** If the protagonist's weariness leads her to conclude that her powers should be used to put an emphatic full stop to all forms of intrigue and conflict, it challenges the idea that power should continuously be built upon and wielded for personal or political ends. It presents power as something that can also be used to bring about peace, not through dominance but through decisive actions aimed at ending the cycle of conflict. # Exploring Themes of Peace and Resolution This narrative approach allows for a deep exploration of themes rarely touched upon deeply in genre fiction, including the emotional and psychological toll of constant vigilance and struggle, the value of peace and stability, and the courage it takes to step away from a fight not because you’re defeated but because you choose a different path. It underscores the power of renouncing the continuation of conflict as a means to achieve true resolution. Overall, by focusing on a protagonist motivated by a desire to end conflict and intrigue due to weariness, the story not only subverts common tropes but also opens up space for a rich exploration of alternative approaches to resolving narrative conflicts and character development."},{"instruction":"Import Adult Census prediction dataset from Azure dataset and build a Neural Networkmodel, evaluate and visualize results of all python vailable plots. import dataset from URL or azure anything, i dont have dataset locally give me full program also add this feature to the code: take value inputted by user and give me output in text format from labelled dataset build a neural network model to take any input data and process data by taking dataset as reference or labelled dataset","output":"Building a complete solution to your request involves multiple steps, including importing a dataset, preprocessing the data, creating a neural network model, evaluating the model, visualizing results, and finally, making predictions based on user input.

It encompasses a variety of forms including poetry, novels, drama, and essays, and seeks to explore and understand the human condition through language. - **Poetry** is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and meter—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. It is known for its expressiveness and ability to convey emotions, experiences, or images in a compact, structured, and often highly symbolic format. - **Drama** refers to a genre of literature intended for performance, characterized by its reliance on dialogue between characters to present its narrative. Traditionally performed in a theater, drama showcases human conflicts and emotions through direct interaction, exploring themes through its characters' actions and words. - **Prose** is a form of language that has a natural flow of speech and a grammatical structure that is not influenced by the rhythmic structures that distinguish poetry. It encompasses a wide range of forms, such as novels, essays, histories, and journalism, presenting narrative, descriptive, or analytical content in an unstructured manner compared to verse. - **Fiction** is a genre of literature that involves storytelling created from the imagination, rather than based directly on historical facts. It encompasses novels, short stories, and novellas, using narrative to explore characters, events, and worlds that may include realistic, fantastic, or speculative elements. **(2) Ten Authors and Their Representative Works** 1.

Poets use it to express feelings or paint pictures with words, but in a more fancy way than just telling stories. - **Drama**: Drama is basically stories written to be performed. Think plays or movies where characters talk to each other and act out conflicts. It's all about showing what's happening through dialogue and actions. - **Prose**: Prose is just regular writing – the kind you read in novels or essays. It doesn't have the special structure that poetry has. So, anything from a blog post to a big thick book can be prose. - **Fiction**: Fiction is when you make up stories.

Light is depicted as a genius with exceptional problem-solving abilities, strategic thinking, and moral flexibility, traits that contribute to his complex, villainous hero persona. Since IQ (Intelligence Quotient) measures a range of cognitive abilities and doesn't equate directly to the traits portrayed by Light, here are some general tips on enhancing cognitive capabilities and strategic thinking skills, which could, metaphorically speaking, bring one to a higher level of intellectual functioning akin to that of highly intelligent fictional characters: 1. **Continuous Learning:** Consistently engage in learning new subjects or deepening your knowledge in specific areas of interest. This could mean formal education, self-study, or informal learning opportunities. Broadening your knowledge base enhances cognitive flexibility. 2. **Critical Thinking Practice:** Develop your critical thinking skills by questioning assumptions, analyzing arguments, and synthesizing information from various sources. Engage with challenging texts, debates, and problem-solving activities. 3. **Memory Exercises:** Improving your memory can have an impact on how effectively you process and recall information. Techniques like the method of loci, mnemonic devices, or simply engaging in regular memory training games can help. 4. **Strategic Games and Puzzles:** Engage in activities that require strategic thinking such as chess, Go, or even complex video games. Puzzles like crosswords, Sudoku, or logic puzzles also stimulate cognitive function. 5. **Physical Exercise:** Regular physical activity improves overall brain health, enhancing memory, concentration, and mental stamina. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain and can aid in the growth of new brain cells. 6. **Healthy Lifestyle:** A balanced diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins supports brain health. Adequate sleep and stress management are also crucial for cognitive function. 7. **Social Interaction:** Engaging in meaningful discussions, debates, and other social interactions can challenge your perspectives, expose you to new ideas, and enhance empathy and emotional intelligence. 8. **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques such as meditation can improve focus, attention, and emotional regulation, contributing to better decision-making and problem-solving abilities. Remember, while intelligence can be developed and enhanced, comparing oneself to a fictional character with exaggerated abilities might not be the most constructive benchmark. Aim to improve and challenge yourself by setting realistic, personal goals based on your interests and strengths. Intelligence has many facets, including emotional, practical, and social intelligence, all of which can be more broadly useful in life than the raw analytical capability suggested by a high IQ score."},{"instruction":"how to get photographic memory suggest best ways to remember very long paragaraphs formulas concepts etc","output":"True photographic memory, also known as eidetic memory, is extremely rare and typically occurs in children, diminishing with age. Most people do not possess photographic memory and cannot develop it through training. However, individuals can significantly improve their memory, including the recall of long paragraphs, formulas, and complex concepts, through various techniques and practices. Here are methods to enhance your memory and recall abilities: 1. **Chunking:** Break down the information into smaller chunks. This technique works well for numbers and lists, making them easier to remember. 2. **Visualization:** Transform the information into a visual format, such as charts, diagrams, or mental images. Visualizing complex concepts or associating them with vivid images can improve recall. 3. **Mnemonic Devices:** Create acronyms, phrases, or poems to help remember sequences or components of the information. For example, the mnemonic \\"PEMDAS\\" is used to remember the order of operations in mathematics (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). 4. **Method of Loci (Memory Palace):** Associate the information you want to remember with specific locations in a familiar place, such as your home. By mentally \\"walking through\\" these locations, you can recall the associated information. 5. **Repetition and Practice:** Regular review and practice are key to transferring information from short-term to long-term memory. Spaced repetition, a technique where review intervals are progressively increased, is particularly effective. 6. **Teaching Others:** Explaining the concepts to someone else is a powerful method to reinforce your understanding and recall. It can highlight areas that need more review and solidify your grasp of the material. 7. **Active Engagement:** Instead of passively reading or listening, actively engage with the material through note-taking, summarizing, or asking questions. This active involvement helps in better assimilation and recall of information. 8. **Mind Mapping:** Create mind maps to organize information visually. This technique allows you to see the relationships between different pieces of information, facilitating easier recall and understanding. 9. **Healthy Lifestyle:** Adequate sleep, a balanced diet, regular physical exercise, and stress management improve overall brain health and memory performance. Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins are particularly beneficial for cognitive functions. 10. **Stay Hydrated and Minimize Distractions:** Proper hydration is critical for optimal brain function, and minimizing distractions helps maintain focus, both of which are important for memory retention. While developing an eidetic memory might not be possible, these techniques can significantly enhance your ability to remember and recall information more efficiently and effectively. Remember, improvement takes time and consistent practice, so patience and perseverance are key."},{"instruction":"what to do when u feel like studying but still arent able to study","output":"Feeling like studying but being unable to get started or maintain focus is a common issue many students face. This paradoxical situation can be frustrating, but there are several strategies you can use to overcome it and make your study sessions more productive: 1. **Identify the Underlying Issue:** First, try to pinpoint what exactly is preventing you from studying. Is it distraction, lack of motivation, feeling overwhelmed, or something else? Identifying the root cause can help you address the problem more effectively. 2. **Break It Down:** If you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of material you need to cover, break your study material into smaller, more manageable chunks. Set clear, achievable goals for each study session. 3. **Change Your Environment:** Sometimes, the environment can significantly impact your ability to focus. Find a quiet, comfortable place where you're less likely to be disturbed. Make sure this space is reserved for studying to create a psychological association between the environment and productive work. 4. **Eliminate Distractions:** Identify what usually distracts you during study time – it could be your phone, social media, noise, etc. Try to eliminate these distractions as much as possible. For digital distractions, apps that limit your access to distracting websites or track your study time can be beneficial. 5. **Use the Pomodoro Technique:** This technique involves studying for a set period (typically 25 minutes), followed by a short break (5 minutes). After completing four \\"Pomodoros,\\" take a longer break. This method helps maintain focus and provides regular breaks to refresh your mind. 6. **Make It Interactive:** Change your study methods if you find them boring or ineffective. Use flashcards, practice problems, or teach the material to someone else. Engaging actively with the material can make studying more interesting and improve retention. 7. **Exercise and Stay Hydrated:** Physical activity can boost your mood and enhance your cognitive functions, making it easier to focus on studying. Similarly, staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining concentration. 8. **Set Specific Study Times:** Schedule your study sessions at times when you're usually more alert and productive. Make this a regular routine to build a habit of studying at those times. 9. **Reward Yourself:** Set up a reward system for completing study sessions or achieving goals. Rewards can motivate you to start studying and stick with it. 10. **Seek Support:** If you consistently struggle to study despite your best efforts, consider talking to a counselor, teacher, or academic advisor. They can provide additional strategies and support tailored to your specific needs. Remember, everyone has unique challenges and preferences when it comes to studying. It may take some experimentation to find the right combination of strategies that work for you. Be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate and overcome these obstacles."},{"instruction":"what to do when u are overwelhmed","output":"Feeling overwhelmed is a common response to stress, particularly when facing numerous demands or challenging situations.

Most types of rewards, such as food, social interactions, and even completing tasks, can increase dopamine levels, which in turn motivates us to seek out these rewards. However, overstimulation from excessive, easily accessible rewards (like social media, video games, or unhealthy foods) can desensitize the dopamine system, making it harder to find satisfaction in less stimulating, everyday activities. A \\"dopamine detox\\" is a concept where you reduce exposure to overstimulating activities to reset your dopamine levels, aiming to improve focus, productivity, and find satisfaction in simpler pleasures. Here's a structured approach to doing a dopamine detox: # 1. Identify Overstimulating Activities Start by identifying high-dopamine activities that you might be overindulging in. This could include excessive use of social media, video gaming, binge-watching TV, consuming junk food, or any other activities that provide instant gratification with little effort. # 2. Set Clear Goals and Guidelines Decide on a period for your detox. This can be a day, several days, or even a week. During this time, set clear rules for what you will avoid and what activities you'll engage in instead. Goals should be realistic and tailored to your lifestyle. # 3. Gradually Reduce Stimulation Rather than stopping all stimulating activities at once, it might be beneficial to reduce them gradually. For instance, if you're accustomed to several hours on social media, start by halving the time, then reducing it further until you can comfortably go a day or more without it. # 4. Engage in Low-Dopamine Activities Plan to fill your time with activities that are enriching but less stimulating. This might include reading, meditating, going for walks, journaling, or practicing a hobby. These activities can help retrain your brain to appreciate simpler pleasures. # 5. Practice Mindful Eating Focus on a balanced diet with foods that support dopamine regulation, such as those rich in tyrosine (almonds, bananas, avocados, eggs, beans, fish, and chicken) and antioxidants. Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods. # 6. Physical Exercise Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Exercise increases dopamine sensitivity and production, which can help balance your dopamine levels naturally. # 7. Social Interaction Engage in meaningful social interactions. Socializing can increase levels of dopamine in a more balanced way compared to digital interactions. Try to have face-to-face conversations with friends or family. # 8. Adequate Sleep Ensure you're getting enough sleep. Poor sleep can disrupt dopamine receptors and contribute to lower overall levels of dopamine. # 9. Mindfulness and Meditation Practices like mindfulness and meditation can help regulate the brain's reward systems, improving your ability to focus and find satisfaction in non-stimulating activities. # 10. Reflect on the Experience After your detox period, reflect on how the experience felt. What did you learn about your dependence on high-dopamine activities? Use these insights to adjust your regular routine, possibly incorporating more low-dopamine activities and limiting overstimulating ones. Remember, the goal of a dopamine detox isn't to eliminate dopamine-inducing activities entirely but to find a healthier balance that allows you to enjoy a wider range of activities and improve your overall wellbeing. If you find it challenging to manage this process alone, consider seeking support from a professional who can guide you through the process."},{"instruction":"почему автомобилю тяжелее ехать по земле и песку, чем по асфальту","output":"Автомобилю тяжелее ехать по земле и песку, чем по асфальту, потому что земля и песок представляют собой более мягкую и неровную поверхность, которая создает большее сопротивление движению.

Why convolution ? . Let’s assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32×32×3 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Three dimensional Input representation of CNN If we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32×32×3 weight connection, which will become in total, 32×32×3×2 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32×32×3 by 32×32 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14]. Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5×5 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32×32 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5×5×3 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17]. Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5×5×3=75 to connect 32×32×3 neurons to 32×32 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5×5×3 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16]. Fig. 3. Convolution as alternative for fully connected network. To show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix, Fig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the connection weight in a 3×3 window. As we can see Fig.4, the matrix can be set to detect edges in the image. These matrices are also called a filter because they act like the classic filters in the image processing. However, in the convolutional neural network these filters are initialized, followed by the training procedure shape filters, which are more suitable for the given task. To make this method more beneficial, it is possible to add more layers after the input layer. Each layer can be associated with different filters. Therefore, we can extract different features from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are connected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter and therefore extracts different features from the input. The neurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the same part of the input image. [6,8,15,17]” From the above paper, explain and summarize the principle of Convolution with some math and figure provided above in detail. Try to use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","output":"Convolution in the context of neural networks, particularly with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is a mechanism designed to process data in a more efficient and structured manner, especially when dealing with high-dimensional inputs like images or videos. Let's break down the concept step by step, infusing it with some basic mathematical understanding and referring to the context provided previously. # Understanding the Problem with Fully Connected Networks Imagine you have an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is 32x32 pixels in size and has three color channels (RGB). A fully connected neural network would require connecting each input pixel to neurons in the next layer, leading to a massive number of parameters. For instance, connecting this input to just two neurons in the next layer would need (32 times 32 times 3 times 2 = 6,144) weights. As you add more neurons for deeper learning, the number of required connections (and thus weights) balloons exponentially, making the network computationally expensive and prone to overfitting. # Introduction to Convolution To address these inefficiencies, the convolution operation introduces two critical changes: 1. **Local Receptive Fields:** Rather than connecting every input pixel to every neuron, each neuron in the first hidden layer 'looks' at a small, local region of the input image (e.g., a 5x5 area of pixels). This dramatically reduces the number of connections. For a network aiming to have an output size of 32x32 with each neuron looking at a 5x5 patch, we reduce the connections to (5 times 5 times 3 times 32 times 32 = 76,800), which is significantly less than a fully connected approach. 2. **Parameter Sharing:** Instead of learning a unique set of weights for every location in the input image, the same set of weights (or kernel) is used across all locations. This means for any given filter (looking at a 5x5x3 patch), we only learn 75 weights ((5 times 5 times 3)) that are applied across the entire input image. This drastically reduces the number of parameters from thousands (or millions in larger networks) to just 75 for connecting a layer looking at 32x32x3 inputs to a 32x32 neuron output layer. # The Convolution Operation Mathematically, convolution involves sliding this kernel (a small matrix of weights) across the input image. At each location, a dot product is computed between the kernel weights and the values of the input pixels it covers. This operation is repeated across the entire image, producing an output feature map that highlights features detected by the kernel, such as edges or textures. # Feature Hierarchy with Multiple Layers By stacking multiple convolution layers, each with its own set of learnable filters, CNNs are capable of extracting progressively higher-level features from raw input. The first layer might learn to detect simple edges, while deeper layers might combine these edges to detect shapes, and even deeper layers could identify objects. This hierarchical feature extraction process allows CNNs to efficiently process high-dimensional inputs and has made them the go-to architecture for tasks like image and video recognition, where understanding spatial hierarchies is crucial. # Visual Understanding Imagine you have a filter designed to detect vertical edges in an image. As you slide this filter across the image, the areas of the image that closely resemble vertical edges will produce a high response in the output feature map, while areas that do not will produce a low response. This operation is replicated across the network with various filters designed to capture different aspects of the image's content. In summary, convolution leverages the spatial hierarchy of features in images, significantly reducing the number of parameters through local receptive fields and weight sharing, thereby enabling the efficient processing of images and forming the basis of Convolutional Neural Networks."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The convolutional approach takes advantage of the spatial relationships within the input data (e.g., images), reducing the number of parameters required to process the input effectively. Let's break down the explanation and associated math based on the information provided, integrating references to the figures mentioned for clarity. In traditional neural networks (e.g., fully connected networks), each input pixel would be connected to the neurons in the hidden layers, leading to a massive number of parameters. For example, a CIFAR-10 dataset image with a size of 32×32 pixels and 3 color channels (RGB) would require 32×32×3 weight connections for just a single neuron. If you had two neurons, this number would double, resulting in over 6000 parameters for just two neurons, which is grossly inefficient for processing images. Figures referenced suggest a paradigm shift towards utilizing the structure and locality within images. By exploiting the spatial correlation, convolution layers connect neurons only to local regions (receptive fields) instead of the entire image, significantly reducing the number of required parameters. For example, consider having a filter (or kernel) size of 5×5 with depth 3 to match the input depth. Instead of connecting each pixel to every neuron in the next layer, you only connect pixels within localized 5×5 regions. If the output layer also has dimensions of 32×32, applying this localized connection pattern results in 5×5×3 by 32×32 connections, diminishing the total number from millions to 76,800 connections. Moreover, by employing the same weights (or filter) across the entire image (a key convolution operation), the number of unique weight parameters further reduces to just the size of the filter (in this case, 5×5×3 = 75). This sliding window mechanism of convolutions not only drastically cuts down on the number of parameters but also allows the network to detect features (like edges) regardless of their spatial location in the input image. The visual representation of this, as suggested, is that certain convolution filters can highlight features such as edges, thus illustrating the convolution operation's capability to extract meaningful patterns or features from the input image. Following layers can use different filters to extract other features, layering complexity and depth to the learned representations. Subsequent figures would illustrate how different layers in a convolutional neural network (CNN) can have different filters, each extracting unique features from the input. These stacked filters allow CNNs to learn multi-level representations of the input data, from simple edges to more complex patterns, contributing to their power in tasks like image recognition. In essence, convolution operations provide a highly efficient, scalable way to process and learn from image data. They reduce computational complexity by focusing on local connections and shared weights, thus allowing networks to learn invariant features across spatial locations, making them particularly suited for image and video recognition tasks."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As a time-jumping adventurer and an irrepressible force for good, Tracer's abilities allow her to zip through space and rewind her personal timeline as she battles to keep the peace. Considering Tracer's fictional nature and her unique time-travel abilities, exploring what she could be like in 200 years ventures into speculative fiction, heavily influenced by the rules of the Overwatch universe and the broader possibilities of science fiction. Here are a few speculative thoughts on what Tracer could be like in 200 years, combining aspects of her character, her abilities, and the typical trajectories of science fiction narratives: 1. **Technological Integration**: Over 200 years, the technology that grants Tracer her abilities could become even more advanced. She might integrate further with technology, enhancing her abilities to manipulate time or even space more precisely. This could allow her to not only recall and blink with better control but also to manipulate her environment in innovative ways, possibly bending reality to some extent. 2. **Legacy as a Hero**: As a prominent agent of Overwatch, Tracer's legacy could evolve. In 200 years, she might be revered as a legendary figure, her stories becoming part of the cultural lore. Depending on the state of the world, she could either be a symbol of a bygone era of heroes or could still be active in some form, given her time manipulation abilities. 3. **Physical and Psychological Changes**: Time manipulation and constant exposure to high-risk missions could have long-term effects on Tracer's physical and psychological state. While her chronal accelerator keeps her anchored in the present, the long-term effects of such technology, combined with the potential for temporal paradoxes, could introduce entirely new dynamics to her character, possibly affecting her perceptions, memories, and even her physical existence. 4. **Evolving Role in Overwatch or its Successors**: Overwatch's structure and mission might evolve or be replaced by new organizations over two centuries. Tracer's role could shift from frontline combat to mentorship, leadership, or even symbolic, depending on how conflicts and the need for heroes like her change. She might be involved in training new generations of heroes, applying her vast experience and unique perspective. 5. **Exploration of Time Travel Ethics and Consequences**: With the passage of time, Tracer could explore deeper aspects of time travel, confronting moral and ethical dilemmas that challenge her understanding of justice, responsibility, and the nature of reality. Her character arc could delve into the consequences of her actions across different timelines, potentially offering rich, complex narratives about the cost of her powers. In reality, Tracer's future would heavily depend on the direction taken by the creators at Blizzard Entertainment and the evolving lore of the Overwatch universe. The speculative paths outlined above combine elements of character development, technological advancements, and science fiction tropes that could create compelling narratives for a character with the ability to bend time."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Sie hat an vielen Punkten und zu unterschiedlichsten Anlässen Kritik an der deutschen wie russischen Sozialdemokratie geübt.23 Bereits 1903 begibt sie sich in die Auseinandersetzung mit Lenin um die Frage des Zentralismus in der Organisation der Partei und um die von Lenin vorgenommene Trennung von politischem und ökonomischem Kampf (GW 1.2, 422-446).24 In der Massenstreikfrage25 nimmt sie eine Position ein, die bezeichnend für ihr Verständnis von Revolution ist. Luxemburg betont in Bezug auf den Massenstreik und seine Propagierung als Element revolutionärer Politik die damit verbundene Möglichkeit revolutionärer Selbstaufklärung und Erfahrung. Sie unterlegt hier eine Revolutionsvorstellung als Prozess, in der Massenstreik kein Kampfziel, sondern Kampf-form und damit zugleich Erfahrungsprozess ist.26 Sie wendet sich gegen das Verla- gern der Massenstreiks in eine zukünftige, immer nur utopisch gedachte, revolutionäre Situation, wie dies ihre sozialdemokratischen Kontrahenten taten. Insofern ist damit auch eine bestimmte Vorstellung von Revolution kritisiert. Luxemburg bescheinigt den Massenstreik-Gegnern diesbezüglich ein bürgerlich-anarchistisches Selbstverständnis. Sie dächten den Machtwechsel als Handstreich und ergingen sich in der Spekulation auf den Tag X. Solche Vorstellung der Revolution, in der diese einem »Theatercoup« gliche, bei dem plötzlich in die soziale Revolution gesprungen werde, sei bürgerlichem Verständnis geschuldet (GW 2, 93f.). Kautsky dagegen will Massenstreik nur als >letztes Mittel« verstanden wissen, nur als eine Möglichkeit, zu deren Umsetzung eine einschränkende, eigentlich verunmöglichende Palette von Voraussetzungen gegeben sein solle. Er sieht durch Massenstreiks die Erfolge parlamentarischer Politikstrategie gefährdet. Über die Frage der Massenstreiks kommt es 1910 zum endgültigen Bruch zwischen Kautsky und Luxemburg. Luxemburg bekämpft in der Folge den Revisionismus und Reformismus der Sozialdemokratie, bis sie sich in den Kriegsjahren von der SPD trennt. Kennzeichen der Kritik Luxemburgs ist der von ihr unterlegte Zusammenhang von Revolutions-, Organisations-, und Staatsvorstellung. Deutlich wird, dass mit dem Revolutionsverständnis Luxemburgs eine tiefgreifende Veränderung der sozialen Verhältnisse wie des B ewusstseins der Agierenden impliziert ist. Es geht ihr um die revolutionäre Bewegung, ihren Erfahrungsprozess und die durch sie bewirkten gesellschaftlichen Revolutionen. Insofern ist ihr politisches Konzept auf eine soziale Bewegung konzentriert und nicht auf eine Avantgarde, die auf eine bloße Machtübernahme im Staat - sei es auf reformerischem oder gewaltförmigem Wege - fixiert ist. Der Staat selbst erhält so eine andere Rolle im revolutionären Prozess, er verliert diesbezüglich seinen rein instrumenteilen Charakter, den Schein einer eigenständigen Instanz, einer zum Revolutionsmachen zu verwendenden Institution. Er kann in diesem Sinne nur, wie auch die Organisationen der Arbeiterklasse, Ausdruck der diesen zu Grunde liegenden sozialen Zusammenhängen sein. Es ist die revolutionäre Bewegung selbst, die aus sich heraus ihre Organisationsformen schafft, nicht die Partei, die die revolutionäre B ewegung schafft oder dirigiert. Dies Verständnis von Staat und Revolution zeigt sich auch in einer von Luxemburgs letzten Arbeiten, ihrer Kritik an der russischen Oktoberrevolution. Ihr 1918 im Gefängnis entstandenes Manuskript wurde von Paul Levi 1922 unter dem Titel »Zur russischen Revolution« herausgegeben (GW 4, 332-365). Sie wendet sich gegen die Staatsauffassung Lenins und damit auch gegen seine Version einer Diktatur des Proletariats: »Lenin sagt: Der bürgerliche Staat sei ein Werkzeug zur Unterdrückung der Arbeiterklasse, der sozialistische - zur Unterdrückung der Bourgeoisie. Es sei bloß gewissermaßen der auf den Kopf gestellte kapitalistische Staat. Diese vereinfachte Auffassung sieht von dem Wesentlichsten ab: Die bürgerliche Klassenherrschaft braucht keine politische Schulung und Erziehung der ganzen Volksmasse, wenigstens nicht über gewisse enggezogene Grenzen hinaus. Für die proletarische Diktatur ist sie das Lebenselement, die Luft, ohne die sie nicht zu existieren vermag« (GW 4, 359). Durch die »Erdrückung des öffentlichen Lebens« hätten die Bolschewiki »die Quelle der politischen Erfahrung und das Steigen der Entwicklung verstopft« (GW 4, 359). Sozialismus könne nicht »vom grünen Tisch eines Dutzends Intellektueller dekretiert« werden (GW 4, 360). Die von Lenin eingesetzten Mittel, »Dekret, diktatorische Gewalt der Fabrikaufseher, drakonische Strafen, Schreckensherrschaft« lehnt sie ab (GW 4, 361 f.). Luxemburg kritisiert die verbreitete politizistische Vorstellungswelt in der Sozialdemokratie am Beispiel der >Lenin-Trotzkischen< wie der Kautskyschen Theorie. Der Grundfehler der Lenin-Trotzkischen Theorie sei, »daß sie die Diktatur, genau wie Kautsky, der Demokratie entgegenstellen«. Lenin und Trotzki entschieden sich - im Unterschied zu Kautsky, der sich für die bürgerliche Demokratie entscheide - »für die Diktatur im Gegensatz zur Demokratie und damit für die Diktatur einer Handvoll Personen, d. h. für bürgerliche Diktatur. Es sind zwei Gegenpole, beide gleich weit entfernt von der wirklichen sozialistischen Politik« (GW 4, 362). Beide Positionen bleiben einer Staatsfixierung verhaftet, die nur die Anerkennung bürgerlicher Staatlichkeit kennt, indem sie diese entweder in ihrer parlamentarischen oder diktatorialen Form affirmieren. Luxemburg kritisiert beides. Für sie ist aufgehobene bürgerliche Freiheit nicht Unterdrückung. Sie beschreibt eine gesellschaftliche Situation, in der selbstbestimmte Praxis nicht nur immer möglich ist, sondern zum entscheidenden Antrieb der revolutionären Prozesse wird. Dies umschreibt sie auch mit dem Begriff der sozialistischen Demokratie<, welche sie gegenüber den russischen Revolutionären einfordert. »Sozialistische Demokratie beginnt aber nicht erst im gelobten Lande, wenn der Unterbau der sozialistischen Wirtschaft geschaffen ist, als fertiges Weihnachtsgeschenk für das brave Volk, das inzwischen treu die Handvoll sozialistischer Diktatoren unterstützt hat« (GW 4, 363). Vielleicht ist der wesentliche Unterschied zwischen Luxemburg und ihren sozial-demokratischen Gegnern ihre politische und theoretische Perspektive der Kritik, die sie gegen den Objektivismus der anderen setzt: »Was wir in unserem Programm besitzen, sind nur wenige große Wegweiser, die die Richtung anzeigen, in der die Maßnahmen gesucht werden müssen, dazu vorwiegend negativen Charakters« (GW 4, 359f.).27 Joachim Hirsch/John Kannankulam/Jens Wissel Die Staatstheorie des »westlichen Marxismus«. Gramsci, Althusser, Poulantzas und die so genannte Staatsableitung Die Entwicklung der materialistischen Staatstheorie nach Marx ist sehr wesentlich durch die Differenz zwischen dem »östlichen«, d. h. sich in der nachrevolutionären Sowjetunion und später in den Ländern ihres Machtbereichs entwickelnden auf der einen und dem »westlichen« Marxismus auf der anderen Seite geprägt (vgl. dazu insbesondere Anderson 1978). Während der erstere in starkem Maße von den Interessen der staatssozialistischen Herrschaftsapparate bestimmt wurde und stark öko- nomistische und geschichtsdeterministische Züge aufwies , fand innerhalb des letzteren eine kritischere und weiterführende Auseinandersetzung mit dem Marxschen Ansatz statt. Hier ging es nicht zuletzt darum, die Marxsche Formanalyse für die Staatstheorie fruchtbar zu machen, um eine genauere Ausarbeitung der Ideologietheorie, um den Versuch, die Basis-Überbau-Metapher theoretisch zu entziffern und in diesem Zusammenhang vor allem auch darum, die Eigenständigkeit politischer Prozesse und Kämpfe für die gesellschaftliche Entwicklung sowie die Transformation des Staates herauszuarbeiten. In diesen Kontext gehört eine ganze Reihe recht unterschiedlicher und in unterschiedlichen historischen und institutionellen Zusammenhängen entwickelter Ansätze. Zum Beispiel etwa die Untersuchungen von Otto Kirchheimer und Franz Neumann über die Krise des bürgerlichen Rechtsstaats und die Struktur des nationalsozialistischen Herrschaftsapparats oder auch Thalheimers Faschismusanalysen (Kirchheimer 1976; Neumann 1977; Thalheimer 1967). Wir beschränken uns hier neben der westdeutschen »Staatsableitungsdebatte« auf Antonio Gramsci1, Louis Althusser und Nicos Poulantzas, die - in spezifischer Weise aufeinander aufbauend und in kritischer Auseinandersetzung mit der parteikommunistischen Staatsinterpretation - die Marxsche Staatstheorie entscheidend weiter entwickelt haben. Ihre Arbeiten erwiesen sich nicht nur weit über den engeren Umkreis des »Marxismus« hinaus als relevant, sondern bieten auch wichtige Ansatzpunkte für eine Auseinandersetzung mit nicht marxistischen Theorien. Diese haben die Entwicklung des westlichen Marxismus stark beeinflusst, wie sich z.B. am Verhältnis mit Foucault ablesen lässt (siehe dazu den Beitrag von Stephan Adolphs). Nicht zuletzt hat sich ein wichtiger Strang der feministischen Staatstheorie und Staatskritik in der Konfrontation mit diesen Ansätzen entwickelt (siehe dazu den Beitrag von Evi Genetti).”翻译为中文","output":"卢森堡 在传统的社会民主主义的马克思主义卡茨基-列宁派传统中，对国家和革命观念的左翼批评是多样的。罗莎·卢森堡（1871-1919）是最重要的批评者之一。她在许多不同的点和不同的场合批评了德国和俄国的社会民主党。 早在1903年，她就开始与列宁围绕党的组织中心主义问题以及列宁对政治和经济斗争的分离进行辩论。在大众罢工问题上，她采取了一个体现了她对革命理解的立场。卢森堡强调大众罢工及其作为革命政治元素的宣传中包含的革命性自我启蒙和经验的可能性。她这里提出了一种将革命视为过程的革命观，其中大众罢工不是斗争的目标，而是斗争方式，因此同时也是经验过程。她反对将大众罢工推迟到一个未来的、总是只能幻想的革命情境中，正如她的社会民主党对手们所做的那样。因此，对某种革命观念也进行了批评。卢森堡认为，反对大众罢工的人持有一种资产阶级-无政府主义的自我理解。他们想象权力交替为一次突然袭击，并沉浸于头脑中对X日的臆测。这种革命观念，将革命看作突然跳入社会革命的“戏剧性突变”，是受到资产阶级理解的影响。 相比之下，卡茨基则只是将大众罢工理解为“最后手段”，只作为一种可能性，其实施需要一套限制性的、实际上使之变得不可能的先决条件。他认为大众罢工会危及议会政治策略的成果。关于大众罢工的问题在1910年最终导致卡茨基与卢森堡之间的决裂。此后，卢森堡抗击社会民主党的修正主义和改良主义，直到在战争年代与社会民主党分道扬镳。 卢森堡批评的特点是她所理解的革命、组织和国家观念之间的联系。显然，卢森堡的革命理解意味着对社会关系以及行动者意识的深刻变革。她关注的是革命运动及其经验过程以及它所引发的社会革命。因此，她的政治概念集中于一种社会运动，而不是集中于一个仅仅固定于国家权力夺取的先锋队，无论是通过改革还是通过暴力手段。在这个意义上，国家在革命过程中扮演了不同的角色，它失去了其纯粹工具性的特征，失去了作为一个独立实体、一个用于进行革命的机构的假象。在这种意义上，只有工人阶级的组织可以表达这些基础的社会联系。正是革命运动本身，从内部创造出自己的组织形式，而不是党创造或指导革命运动。 这种对国家和革命的理解也体现在卢森堡对俄国十月革命的最后一项工作、她的批评中。她的1918年在监狱中完成的手稿由保罗·莱维在1922年以《关于俄国革命》的标题出版。她反对列宁对国家的观点，因此也反对他关于无产阶级专政的版本： “列宁说：资产阶级国家是压迫工人阶级的工具，社会主义国家是用来压迫资产阶级的。它仅仅是倒置的资本主义国家。这种简化的观点忽略了最重要的一点：资产阶级阶级统治不需要对整个人民群众进行政治培养和教育，至少不需要超出一定的狭窄范围。对于无产阶级专政来说，这是它的生命元素，没有它就无法存在”。 通过“压制公共生活”，布尔什维克“堵塞了政治经验的来源和发展的提升”。“社会主义不能从几个知识分子的绿色桌子上被法令颁布”。列宁运用的手段，“法令、工厂管理员的独裁力量、严酷的惩罚、恐怖统治”，她都拒绝接受。 卢森堡批评了社会民主党中普遍存在的政治主义观念，以“列宁-托洛茨基”和卡茨基的理论为例。列宁-托洛茨基理论的根本错误是，“正如卡茨基一样，他们将专政与民主对立起来”。列宁和托洛茨基选择的是专政与民主的对立，因此是少数人的专政，也就是说，是资产阶级的专政。这是两个对立面，两者都同样远离真正的社会主义政策”。两种立场都固守于对国家的固定观念，这种观念只认识到资产阶级国家性，通过肯定这种国家性的议会形式或独裁形式。卢森堡批评了这两种观念。对她而言，克服了的资产阶级自由并不意味着压迫。她描述了一种社会情况，在这种情况下，自主实践不仅始终可能，而且成为革命过程的决定性动力。她也用“社会主义民主”的概念来描述这一点，她要求俄国革命者实现这一点。 “但社会主义民主不是从应许之地开始的，当社会主义经济的基础建立后，它不是作为圣诞节的礼物完成的，送给那些与此同时忠实支持着少数社会主义独裁者的好人们”。 或许卢森堡与她的社会民主党对手之间的根本区别在于她的政治和理论批评视角，她用这一视角对抗他人的客观主义: “我们在我们的纲领中所拥有的，只是几个大的方向标，它们指明了必须寻找措施的方向，主要是负面性质的”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Joachim Hirsch/John Kannankulam/Jens Wissel Die Staatstheorie des »westlichen Marxismus«.

Ihre Arbeiten erwiesen sich nicht nur weit über den engeren Umkreis des »Marxismus« hinaus als relevant, sondern bieten auch wichtige Ansatzpunkte für eine Auseinandersetzung mit nicht marxistischen Theorien. Diese haben die Entwicklung des westlichen Marxismus stark beeinflusst, wie sich z.B. am Verhältnis mit Foucault ablesen lässt (siehe dazu den Beitrag von Stephan Adolphs). Nicht zuletzt hat sich ein wichtiger Strang der feministischen Staatstheorie und Staatskritik in der Konfrontation mit diesen Ansätzen entwickelt (siehe dazu den Beitrag von Evi Genetti). Antonio Gramscis erweitertes Staatsverständnis Es war Antonio Gramsci, der damit begann, systematisch über die Eigenständigkeit von Politik und Staat nachzudenken. Der entscheidende Schritt bestand dabei in der Überwindung eines simplen Basis-Überbau-Modells, in dem Staat und Politik nur als Reflex auf die ökonomische Basis verstanden wurde. Diese Vorstellung, die weniger mit Marx als mit der dominanten Strömung des Marxismus im frühen 20. Jahrhundert zu tun hatte, war verbunden mit einer teleologischen Vorstellung geschichtlicher Prozesse, in der Politik als eigenständige Kategorie keinen Platz hatte. Gramsci knüpfte in seiner Analyse von Kräfte- und Hegemonieverhältnissen an Lenin an, überwand aber eine rein instrumentalistisch-voluntaristische Konzeption des Staates. Dieser »Konzeption vom Verhältnis Bourgeoisie-Staat, einer Konzeption, die die gesamte Analyse Bordigas als Instrument in den Händen der Bourgeoisie« beseelte, wird von Gramsci eine nicht-mechanistische Beziehung Staat-Klasse entgegengesetzt: eine Erweiterung des Staates, die sich keineswegs auf eine einfache Verschiebung zum allgemeinen Überbaufeld (oder sogar kulturellen Feld) hin reduziert« (Buci-Glucksmann 1981, 87). Durch diesen Schritt, der die Analyse des Staates mit der Analyse von Kräfteverhältnissen, die nicht auf ökonomische Verhältnisse zu reduzieren sind, in Beziehung setzte, öffnete Gramsci die marxistisch orientierte Debatte sowohl für eine eigenständige Theoretisierung des Staates als auch für ein Verständnis geschichtlicher Kontingenz. Gramscis Konzeption des Staates als Einheit von »politischer Gesellschaft« (d. h. die Staatsapparte im engeren Sinne) und »ziviler Gesellschaft« gerät aber keineswegs in das andere Extrem einer politizistischen Auffassung des Staates. Vielmehr überwindet Gramsci verdinglichte Vorstellung sozialer Räume, weil er diese nie als in sich abgeschlossene Bereiche begreift, sondern immer als Felder, in denen bestimmte gesellschaftliche Praktiken miteinander in Beziehung stehen. Die Ökonomie ist so betrachtet nie rein ökonomisch, wie die Politik nie nur politisch, oder die Kultur nur kulturell ist. Gramsci gelangt zu dieser Betrachtung über die Frage nach der ausgebliebenen Revolution im Westen. Seine Antwort liegt in der Beschaffenheit des entwickelten bürgerlichen Staates, der aufgrund seiner erweiterten Struktur nicht im Sturm zu nehmen war, wie das in Russland der Fall war. Der bürgerliche Staat hat vielmehr ein verzweigtes System von »Kasematten und Schützengräben« ausgebildet, die in der Auseinandersetzung mit ihm zu einem langwierigen Stellungskrieg zwingen. Gemeint ist der Kampf um Hegemonie, der maßgeblich in der Zivilgesellschaft ausgetragen wird. Diese ist als Bestandteil des »erweiterten Staates« den unmittelbaren staatlichen Institutionen vorgelagert. Gramsci gelangt so zu seiner bekannten Definition bürgerlicher Herrschaft als »Hegemonie, gepanzert mit Zwang« (Gramsci 1991 ff., 783). Hegemonie wird zwar in der Zivilgesellschaft entwickelt, kann aber nicht nur als ein rein ideologisches Konstrukt begriffen werden, sondern hat immer auch eine materiell-ökonomische Komponente, die mit dem Verhältnis zwischen Produktionsverhältnissen und Produktivkräften in Verbindung steht. Die »gesellschaftlichen Gruppierungen« treten, so schreibt Gramsci, auf »der Basis des Entwicklungsgrades der materiellen Produktivkräfte [...] auf, deren jede eine Funktion in der Produktion selbst repräsentiert und eine bestimmte Stellung in ihr einnimmt« (Gramsci 1991 ff., 1560). Die Zivilgesellschaft steht, als Teil des erweiterten Staates, zwischen »ökonomischer Struktur und dem Staat mit seiner Gesetzgebung und seinem Zwang [...]« (ebd., 1267). Zu ihr werden Institutionen und Organisationen gezählt, die formell vom Staat getrennt sind, d. h. Vereine, Gelehrtengesellschaften, Kirchen, Clubs, intellektuelle Netzwerke und Medien ebenso wie Musikvereinigungen, Straßennamen, Kneipen etc. (vgl. Demirovic 2001, 150). Gramsci macht es so möglich, den Blick auf den Staat zu erweitern, um eine neue Form der Führung und Regierung zu beschreiben. Es ging also keineswegs nur darum, den Schwerpunkt der Analyse auf ideologische Momente zu verlagern, vielmehr ging es um eine neue Praxis auf dem Feld des erweiterten Staates. Der bürgerliche Staat ist demnach nicht auf seine Zwangselemente zu beschränken, der »integrale Staat setzt die Übernahme der Gesamtheit der intellektuellen und moralischen Führungsmittel einer Klasse über die Gesellschaft voraus, die Art und Weise, in der sie ihre >Hegemonie< verwirklichen kann, und sei es durch >Kompromissgleichgewichte<, um die eigene politische Macht zu bewahren [...]« (Buci-Glucksmann 1980, 88). Gramscis Staatstheorie, in der die Niederlage der westlichen kommunistischen Parteien und das Ausbleiben der erwarteten Revolution theoretisch verarbeitet wurden, geriet nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg weitgehend in Vergessenheit. Erst als mit der Studentinnenbewegung das Interesse an Marx wieder erwachte, gewannen Fragestellungen wieder an Bedeutung, die schon für Gramsci ausschlaggebend waren. Die Niederlage der 68er Bewegung wurde auch mit einer fehlenden Theoretisierung des bürgerlichen Staates in Verbindung gebracht (vgl. Demirovic 1987, 9). Es ist also kein Zufall, dass Gramsci in den 70er Jahren wieder entdeckt wurde. Es war zunächst der französische Philosoph Louis Althusser, der zentrale Gedanken Grams- cis in seine Theorie aufnahm.”翻译为中文","output":"约阿希姆·希什/约翰·坎南库拉姆/延斯·维塞尔 “西方马克思主义”的国家理论 格拉姆西、阿尔都塞、普朗查斯和所谓的国家衍化 马克思之后的唯物主义国家理论的发展，很大程度上受到了“东方”即后革命苏联及其势力范围内的国家发展，与“西方”马克思主义之间差异的影响（参见安德森1978）。前者在很大程度上是由社会主义国家的统治机器的利益所决定的，具有浓厚的经济主义和历史决定论特征，而后者则进行了更为批判性和深入的对马克思主张的研究。这里的主要目的是利用马克思的形式分析对国家理论进行丰富，更准确地发展意识形态理论，试图理论上解读基础-上层建筑隐喻，并在此基础上着重探讨政治过程和斗争对社会发展及国家转型的独立性。这一背景下，出现了一系列相当不同，发展于不同历史和制度背景下的理论方法。例如，奥托·基希海默和弗朗茨·诺伊曼关于资本主义法治国家危机及纳粹统治体系结构的研究，以及塔尔海默的法西斯主义分析（基希海默1976年；诺伊曼1977年；塔尔海默1967年）。除了西德的“国家衍生论争论”之外，我们这里聚焦于安东尼奥·格拉姆西、路易斯·阿尔都塞和尼科斯·普朗查斯，他们在相互建立基础上，批判性地与党派共产主义的国家解释进行对话，从而决定性地发展了马克思的国家理论。他们的工作不仅在“马克思主义”范围内具有重要意义，而且也为与非马克思主义理论的对话提供了重要的触点。这些对话在很大程度上影响了西方马克思主义的发展，如同可以从与福柯的关系中看出（见斯蒂芬·阿道夫斯的贡献）。最后，女性主义的国家理论和国家批判就是在与这些方法的对立中发展起来的（见艾薇·基内蒂的贡献）。 安东尼奥·格拉姆西的扩展国家理解 安东尼奥·格拉姆西开始系统地思考政治和国家的独立性。关键的步骤是超越了一个简单的基础-上层建筑模型，其中国家和政治只被视为经济基础的反映。这种观念，与马克思而不是20世纪早期主流马克思主义流派更相关，与历史过程的目的论观念相联系，政治作为一个独立范畴在其中没有位置。 格拉姆西在其对力量和霸权关系分析中借鉴了列宁，但超越了国家的纯粹工具理论-自愿论概念。“资产阶级-国家关系的概念，一个概念，全面激发了博尔丁加分析作为资产阶级手中的工具”，格拉姆西提出了非机械化的国家-阶级关系：扩展国家的概念，这一概念决不仅仅是向普遍的上层建筑领域（甚至文化领域）的简单转移（布奇-格鲁克斯曼1981，87）。通过这一步骤，将国家分析与力量关系分析联系起来，后者不能仅归结为经济关系，格拉姆西为马克思主义辩论开辟了通往国家的独立理论化以及理解历史偶然性的新途径。 格拉姆西对国家的构想，作为“政治社会”（即狭义的国家机器）和“民间社会”的统一，但决不走向政治主义对国家的极端看法。格拉姆西超越了对社会空间的具体化理解，因为他从不把它们视为封闭的领域，而是作为特定社会实践相互关联的领域。因此，经济永远不是纯粹经济的，政治永远不是只有政治的，或文化只是文化的。 格拉姆西通过询问西方革命缺席的问题达到了这种视角。他的答案在于发达资本主义国家的构造，由于其扩展结构，不能像在俄罗斯那样直接被攻克。相反，资本主义国家形成了一套复杂的“地堡和战壕”系统，与其的斗争导致了一场长期的阵地战。这里指的是在民间社会中进行的霸权争夺战。“民间社会”作为“扩展国家”的一部分，在直接的国家机构之前。格拉姆西因此得出了资产阶级统治作为“装甲霸权”的著名定义（格拉姆西1991年及以后，783）。 虽然霸权在民间社会中发展，但它不能只被理解为一个纯粹的意识形态构造，而总是也有一个物质-经济组成部分，与生产关系和生产力之间的关系相联系。“社会团体”是，正如格拉姆西所写，基于物质生产力发展程度的基础上出现的，“其中每个都在生产中代表一个功能并在其中占据一定位置”（格拉姆西1991年及以后，1560）。作为扩展国家的一部分，民间社会位于“经济结构和国家及其立法和强制性之间……”（同上，1267）。它包括那些形式上与国家分开的机构和组织，即协会、学术社团、教会、俱乐部、知识分子网络和媒体，以及音乐团体、街道名称、酒吧等（见德米洛维奇2001，150）。格拉姆西因此扩展了对国家的视角，描述了一种新型的领导和治理形式。因此，这绝不仅仅是将分析重点转移到意识形态方面，而是在扩展国家领域上的一种新实践。资产阶级国家因此不应仅限于其强制性要素，“完整的国家假定了一个阶级通过社会的智力和道德领导手段的承担，实现其‘霸权’的方式，即使是通过‘妥协平衡’，以维持其政治权力……”（布奇-格鲁克斯曼1980，88）。 格拉姆西的国家理论，在第二次世界大战后，西方共产党失败和预期革命的缺失在理论上得到了处理，但这一理论在战后大部分时间里被遗忘。直到随着学生运动的兴起重新唤起了对马克思的兴趣，格拉姆西的问题领域才重新获得重要性。68运动的失败也与缺乏对资产阶级国家的理论化联系在一起（见德米洛维奇1987，9）。因此，格拉姆西在70年代被重新发现并非偶然。首先是法国哲学家路易斯·阿尔都塞，他将格拉姆西的核心思想融入到了自己的理论中。"},{"instruction":"请将“Louis Althussers Konzeption der ideologischen Staatsapparate Auch wenn Althusser Gramscis Interpretation des Marxismus wegen dessen »Historizismus«, d. h. dessen ursprünglicher Situiertheit innerhalb der hegelianisch inspirierten italienischen Philosophie um Benedetto Croce und der damit einhergehenden »teleologischen« Interpretation des Marxismus zum Teil scharf angriff (1972, 157ff.), nimmt er in seinem staatstheoretisch wohl bedeutendsten Aufsatz von 1970 »Ideologie und Ideologische Staatsapparate « doch sehr stark auf Gramsci Bezug. Dieser ist in dem Text, der mit »Anmerkungen für eine Untersuchung« untertitelt ist, allerdings in einer Fußnote versteckt. Dort heißt es: »Gramsci ist meines Wissens der einzige, der jenen Weg gegangen ist, den wir einschlagen. Er hatte jenen eigenartigem Gedanken, dass der Staat sich nicht auf den (repressiven) Staatsapparat reduziert, sondern, dass er - wie gesagt - eine Reihe von Institutionen der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft (>societas civilis«) umfasse: die Kirche, die Schulen, die Gewerkschaften usw. Gramsci hat leider seine Intuitionen nicht systematisiert, die im Zustand scharfsinniger, aber unvollständiger Anmerkungen geblieben sind« (Althus- ser 1977, 152 Fn.). Was Althusser vor dem Hintergrund dieser Aussage von Gramsci übernimmt, ist somit zum einen die Feststellung, dass sich der Staat und staatliche Herrschaft nicht allein auf die staatlichen Apparate im engeren Sinn beschränken. Diese von Althus- ser als repressive Staatsapparate bezeichneten Institutionen wie die Polizei, die Gerichte, die Gefängnisse, die Armee usw., über denen der Staatschef, die Regierung und die Verwaltung »thront«, müssen analytisch erweitert werden, um über eine bloß »beschreibende Theorie« des bürgerlichen Staates hinaus zu gelangen (1977, 114f.). Ausgehend von der Frage, welche Bedingungen für die Reproduktion der kapitalistischen Produktionsbedingungen erfüllt sein müssen, erweitert Althusser das bis dahin gängige marxistische Staatsverständnis dahingehend, dass neben der erforderlichen Reproduktion der Produktionsmittel vor allem die Arbeitskraft reproduziert werden muss. Und dies umfasst neben der Notwendigkeit der unmittelbaren materiellen Reproduktion des Arbeiters durch Wohnung oder Lebensmittel, »kurz alles, was er braucht, um sich am nächsten Morgen - j eden Morgen, den Gott schafft - am Fabriktor melden zu können« (1977, 110f.) vor allem die Fähigkeiten, um im Arbeitsprozess überhaupt einsetzbar zu sein. Denn es ist keineswegs selbstverständlich, dass die Arbeiterinnen jeden Morgen aufstehen, pünktlich an ihrem Arbeitsplatz erscheinen und sich dann acht Stunden dem Arbeitsprozess unterwerfen (vgl. MEW 23, 741 ff.; Thompson 1980). Dazu müssen sie erst gebracht werden. Die Institution, in der die Menschen dies lernen, ist nach Althusser vor allem die Schule. Neben dem Erlernen der grundlegenden Kulturtechniken wie Lesen, Schreiben und Rechnen, erwerben die Menschen dort die erforderlichen Sekundärtugenden. Mit anderen Worten, »die Schule (aber auch andere Institutionen des Staates wie die Kirche [...] lehren »Fähigkeiten«, aber in Formen, die die Unterwerfung unter die herrschende Ideologie oder [seitens der herrschenden, d. Verf.] die Beherrschung ihrer >Praxis< sichern« (1977, 112). Staatliche Herrschaft erschöpft sich also nicht in den repressiven Staatsapparaten, sondern darüber hinaus existiert die Staatsmacht in den von Althusser so bezeichneten ideologischen Staatsapparaten (ISA). Jene ideologischen Staatsapparate, deren Konzeption erkennbar in der Gramscischen Tradition des erweiterten Staates steht, umfassen beispielsweise den religiösen ISA (die verschiedenen Kirchen); den schulischen ISA; den familiären ISA; den politischen ISA (Parteien, Verbände); den ISA der Information (Medien) usw. Die Erweiterung des marxistischen Staatsverständnisses durch Althusser setzte wie schon bei Gramsci eine eigene Interpretation des »Basis-Überbau« Konzepts voraus. Die so genannten Überbauten, zu denen auch die Ideologie und der Staat gezählt wurden, sind nach diesem Verständnis keine sekundären »Epiphänomene«. Vielmehr lässt sich vom Standpunkt der Reproduktion aus feststellen, dass die »Überbauten« konstitutiv für die Existenz des gesellschaftlichen Ganzen sind (1977, 114f.). Das gesellschaftliche Ganze, das Althusser als komplexe Struktur mit Dominante begreift, lässt sich nicht auf ein wesentliches Merkmal wie »die Ökonomie« reduzieren. Jenes Ganze und die für den Kapitalismus feststellbare Dominanz der ökonomischen Instanz, lässt sich in seiner Existenz nur durch die Verwiesenheit auf die ideologischen und politischen Instanzen begreifen (Althusser 1968). Hinter dieser Reformulierung des Basis-Überbau Konzepts aus dem Jahre 1970 steht auch die Erfahrung der gescheiterten Revolte des Mai 1968 in Frankreich. Mit diesem Scheitern war die von Althusser thematisierte Frage der Reproduktion und somit Stabilität der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise verbunden. Es sind demnach nicht nur die repressiven Staatsapparate, die die Stabilität garantieren, vielmehr spielen hier auch die ideologischen Staatsapparate eine maßgebliche Rolle. Nicos Poulantzas: Der Staat als materielle Verdichtung gesellschaftlicher Kräfteverhäl tn isse Nicos Poulantzas war derjenige, der die materialistische Staatstheorie im französischen Kontext am profundesten weiterentwickelte. Er wandte sich Mitte der sechziger Jahre dem Zirkel um Louis Althusser zu, wovon vor allem sein kurz vor den Ereignissen des Mai 1968 in Paris veröffentlichtes Werk »Politische Macht und gesellschaftliche Klassen« zeugt (vgl. Jessop 1985, 13f.). In diesem Werk beschäftigte sich Poulantzas erstmals umfänglicher mit Fragen einer marxistischen Theorie des Staates. Noch ganz in der Althusserschen Diktion argumentiert Poulantzas hier, dass eine Produktionsweise verschiedene Ebenen oder Instanzen ökonomischer, politischer, ideologischer und theoretischer Art umfasst und die Besonderheit der kapita-listischen Produktionsweise darin liegt, dass die ökonomische Instanz innerhalb des komplex strukturierten Ganzen dominiert (1980, 12). Die Beschaffenheit der Teilbereichsinstanzen ergibt sich, so Poulantzas, aus einer der Gesamtstruktur einer Produktionsweise eigenen Verknüpfung, sprich: aus ihrer Artikulation innerhalb eines komplexen Ganzen. Das Spezifische der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise besteht in der Trennung von Politik und Ökonomie. Aufgrund dieses Spezifikums, der relativen Autonomie2 der Instanzen im Verhältnis zueinander, sei es auch gerechtfertigt, für die kapitalistische Produktionsweise eine Teilbereichstheorie des Politischen zu erstellen. Poulantzas argumentiert im Weiteren, dass die Funktion der politischen Instanz als institutionalisierte Staatsmacht darin besteht, die Kohäsion der in Klassen gespaltenen kapitalistischen Gesellschaft zu sichern. Der »Staat verhindert sozusagen das offene Ausbrechen des politischen Klassenkonflikts« (1980, 48, 40f.). Er kann dies vor allem dadurch, dass er versucht, sich innerhalb der klassengespaltenen Gesellschaft als deren Zusammenfassung im »Volk-als-Nation« auszugeben (Poulantzas ebd., 121 ff.). Der Staat ist die letztlich »illusorische« Verkörperung gesellschaftlicher Allgemeinheit, da die Zusammenfassung der Klassenangehörigen im »Volk- als-Nation« aus vereinzelten Produktionsagenten gleiche Rechtssubjekte als Staatsbürger macht und somit die aus den Produktionsverhältnissen resultierende Klassenspaltung zu »verschleiern« sucht (ebd., 128ff.). Darüber hinaus ist der Staat »nicht nur Kohäsionsfaktor der Einheit einer Gesellschaftsformation«, sondern stellt diejenige Struktur dar, »innerhalb deren sich die Widersprüche zwischen den verschiedenen Ebenen einer Formation verdichten« (ebd., 43). Die Art und Weise, wie sich diese Verdichtungsprozesse jeweils herstellen, ist jedoch keineswegs von vornherein festgelegt. Sie nimmt je nach Produktionsweise und Gesellschaftsformation verschiedene Formen an (44). In diesem Kontext argumentiert Poulantzas, dass der Staat nicht nur die Verdichtungsebene der gesellschaftlichen Widersprüche, sondern darüber hinaus ein Kräfteverhältnis zwischen den verschiedenen Produktionsweisen innerhalb einer Gesellschaftsformation darstellt (45). Dieses Theorem des Staates als Kräfteverhältnis bzw. als materielle Verdichtung dieser Verhältnisse, das innerhalb der materialistischen Staatsdiskussion zentral mit dem Namen Nicos Poulantzas verbunden ist, sollte allerdings erst im Spätwerk des griechisch-französischen Theoretikers vollends entwickelt werden.”翻译为中文","output":"路易斯·阿尔都塞的意识形态国家机器概念 尽管阿尔都塞因其对格拉姆西马克思主义解释中的“历史主义”——即其原始定位于受黑格尔影响的意大利哲学之中，特别是与贝内代托·克罗齐相关，以及随之而来的对马克思主义的“目的论”解释——部分严厉攻击格拉姆西（1972年，157页及以下），但在他1970年可能是最重要的国家理论文章《意识形态与意识形态国家机器》中，却十分强烈地借鉴了格拉姆西的思想。这在他的文章中，具体地在一个脚注中有所体现，他写道：“据我所知，格拉姆西是唯一一个走过我们即将迈进的道路的人。他有一个独特的想法，即国家不仅仅简化为（压制性的）国家机器，而是——如他所言——包括了一系列资产阶级社会（'societas civilis'）的机构：教会、学校、工会等。遗憾的是，格拉姆西并没有系统化他的直觉，它们仍然停留在敏锐但不完整的注释状态”（阿尔都塞1977年，152页脚注）。 因此，根据格拉姆西的这一说法，阿尔都塞采纳的一点是，国家和国家统治不仅限于狭义的国家机器。阿尔都塞指称的压制性国家机器，如警察、法院、监狱、军队等，以及国家元首、政府和管理机构的“凌驾之上”，需要通过分析扩展，以超越对资产阶级国家的仅仅“描述性理论”（1977年，114-115页）。从必须满足的条件出发，以实现资本主义生产条件的再生产，阿尔都塞扩展了至今为止的马克思主义国家理解，强调除了生产资料的必要再生产外，尤其是劳动力的再生产也是必须的。这不仅包括工人通过住房或食物进行的直接物质再生产，“简而言之，一切他需要的，以便他能在上帝创造的每个早晨——每天早晨——到达工厂门口”（1977年，110-111页），更重要的是具备在劳动过程中所需的能力。因为工人们每天早上起床，准时出现在工作岗位上，并将自己服从于八小时的劳动过程并非是理所当然的（参见MEW 23, 741页及以下；汤普森1980年）。为此，他们必须首先被引导到那里。根据阿尔都塞的看法，学校是人们主要学习这些的机构。除了学习基本的文化技能，如阅读、写作和计算外，人们在那里还获得了所需的次级美德。换句话说，“学校（但也包括国家的其他机构，如教会……）教授‘技能’，但是以确保服从于统治意识形态或[从统治者的角度来看]掌控其‘实践’的形式”（1977年，112页）。因此，国家统治并不仅仅存在于压制性的国家机器中，国家权力还存在于阿尔都塞所称的意识形态国家机器（ISA）之中。这些意识形态国家机器，其概念明显站在格拉姆西关于扩展国家的传统中，包括例如宗教ISA（不同的教会）；学校ISA；家庭ISA；政治ISA（政党、协会）；信息ISA（媒体）等。 阿尔都塞通过自己对“基础-上层建筑”概念的解释，如同格拉姆西之前所做的那样，扩展了马克思主义的国家理解。所谓的上层建筑，包括意识形态和国家，根据这一理解，并不是次要的“表象现象”。相反，从再生产的角度出发，可以确定“上层建筑”对于整个社会的存在是构成性的（1977年，114-115页）。阿尔都塞将社会整体视为一个具有主导性的复杂结构，这一整体不能简化为像“经济”这样的基本特征。正是通过指向意识形态和政治实例，才能理解这个整体及资本主义中可观察到的经济实例的主导性（阿尔都塞1968年）。 这一基础-上层建筑概念的1970年重新阐释背后，还有1968年法国五月风暴失败的经验。与阿尔都塞所讨论的资本主义生产方式的再生产和因此的稳定性问题有关的，不仅仅是压制性的国家机器保障了稳定，而且意识形态国家机器也发挥了决定性的作用。 尼科斯·普朗查斯：国家作为社会力量关系的物质凝聚体 尼科斯·普朗查斯是在法国语境中最深入发展唯物主义国家理论的人。他在六十年代中期转向路易斯·阿尔都塞周围的圈子，这主要体现在他1968年5月事件发生前在巴黎发表的作品《政治权力与社会阶级》中（参见杰索普1985年，13-14页）。在这部作品中，普朗查斯首次广泛涉足了马克思主义国家理论的问题。普朗查斯在这里完全使用阿尔都塞的措辞，认为一种生产方式包括经济、政治、意识形态和理论等不同层面或实例，资本主义生产方式的特点在于经济实例在复杂整体中占据主导地位（1980年，12页）。 普朗查斯认为，部分领域实例的构成来自于一种生产方式的整体结构内在的联系，即：它们在一个复杂整体内的表述。资本主义生产方式的特殊性在于政治和经济的分离。正因为这一特点，即实例之间相对自治的特点，为资本主义生产方式建立一个政治领域理论是合理的。 普朗查斯继续论证，政治实例作为制度化的国家权力，其功能在于确保被分为阶级的资本主义社会的凝聚。“国家在某种意义上防止了政治阶级冲突的公开爆发”（1980年，48页，40-41页）。它主要通过试图在被分裂为阶级的社会中作为其总结的“民族-人民”来实现这一点（普朗查斯同上，121页及以下）。国家是社会普遍性的最终“虚幻”体现，因为将阶级成员总结为“民族-人民”中的单独生产代理，使他们成为平等的法律主体作为国民，并因此寻求“掩盖”生产关系产生的阶级分裂（同上，128页及以下）。此外，国家“不仅是社会形态统一的凝聚因素”，而且是“一个结构，在该结构内，不同层面之间的矛盾凝聚”（同上，43页）。 然而，这些凝聚过程的具体形式并非事先确定。它们根据生产方式和社会形态采取不同的形式（44）。在这个背景下，普朗查斯认为，国家不仅是社会矛盾的凝聚层面，而且是一种力量，是一种在社会形态内不同生产方式之间的力量关系（45）。 这种将国家视为力量关系或作为这些关系的物质凝聚体的定理，在唯物主义国家讨论中与尼科斯·普朗查斯的名字紧密相连，应该说是在这位希腊-法国理论家晚期作品中充分发展起来的。"},{"instruction":"请将“Vor diesem Hintergrund ist Poulantzas' letztes größeres Werk aus dem Jahre 1977, »L'etat, le pouvoir, lc socialisme«3, vor allem deshalb bedeutsam, weil er hier seinen »relationalen« Staatsbegriff zur Entfaltung bringen konnte. Gegenüber der oben skizzierten »klassenfunktionalen« Argumentation in »Politische Macht und gesellschaftliche Klassen«, argumentiert er hier nicht mehr, dass der Staat eine spezifische Strukturebene darstellt, der primär die Funktion der Kohäsion der klassengespaltenen kapitalistischen Gesellschaft zukommt. Selbstkritisch argumentierte Poulantzas bereits zuvor, dass diese Argumentation im Anschluss an Althusser zu formalistisch gewesen sei (1976, 77ff.). Denn die Konzeption der Strukturebenen legt es nahe, so Poulantzas, dass das Ökonomische eine sich selbst reproduzierende und regulierbare Instanz darstellt und der um die ideologischen und repressiven Staatsapparate erweiterte Staat nur dazu dient, »die negativen Regeln des ökonomischen >Spiels< zu fixieren« (Poulantzas 2002, 59). Derartige Vorstellungen zögen j edoch letztlich ein instrumentelles und neutrales Staatsverständnis nach sich, wonach der Staat als neutrales Instrument für (emanzipative) Politik nur »erobert« zu werden brauche. Mit einem solchen Verständnis ließe sich j edoch nicht beantworten, weshalb die Bourgeoisie »im allgemeinen auf diesen nationalen Volksstaat zurückgreift) , diesen modernen Repräsentativ-Staat mit seinen spezifischen Institutionen, und nicht auf einen anderen? Denn es ist keineswegs selbstverständlich, dass sie sich genau diesen Staat aussuchen würde, wenn sie den Staat komplett selbst und nach ihrem Geschmack aufbauen könnte« (ebd., 40). Entgegen solchen Konzeptionen heißt es: »Der Staat stellt ein materielles Gerüst dar, das in keiner Weise auf die politische Herrschaft reduziert werden kann. Der Staatsapparat, dieses besondere und furchterregende Etwas, erschöpft sich nicht in der Staatsmacht. Die politische Herrschaft schreibt sich selbst noch in die institutionelle Materialität des Staates ein. Wenn der Staat nicht einfach ein vollständiges Produkt der herrschenden Klassen ist, so haben sie sich seiner auch nicht einfach bemächtigt: Die Staatsmacht (die der Bourgeoisie im kapitalistischen Staat) hat in dieser Materialität ihre Spuren hinterlassen. Nicht alle Aktionen des Staates reduzie-ren sich auf die politische Herrschaft, sie sind j edoch konstitutiv von ihr gekennzeichnet« (ebd., 42). Wie schon Althusser und zuvor Gramsci betont Poulantzas, dass Staatsapparat und Staatsmacht nicht identisch sind. Die Staatsapparate erschöpfen sich nicht in der Staatsmacht der Bourgeoisie. Der Staatsapparat stellt ein materielles Gerüst dar, das sich nicht auf die Macht der Bourgeoisie reduzieren lässt. Für das Verständnis dieser These ist es nach Poulantzas zunächst notwendig, mit dem gängigen Schema der Relation von Produktivkräften und Produktionsverhältnissen zu brechen. Die Grundlage des materiellen Aufbaus des Staates befindet sich zwar in den Produktionsverhältnissen und der gesellschaftlichen Arbeitsteilung, dies jedoch nicht nach der gängigen Vorstellung, wonach die Produktionsverhältnisse »als einfacher Kristallisierung-Umhüllung-Reflex eines technologischen Prozesses der Produktivkräfte angesehen werden« (ebd., 55), die Produktionsverhältnisse also Reflex einer »neutralen, technologischen« Basis sind. Kurzum, es ist notwendig, mit dem gängigen Basis-Überbau Schema zu brechen, denn genau davon hängt das »Verständnis von der Beziehung des Staates zu den Produktionsverhältnissen und zum Klassenkampf ab« (ebd., 43). Für ein angemessenes Verständnis muss man »sich mehr denn je von einer ökonomistisch-formalistischen Konzeption abgrenzen, derzufolge die Ökonomie in den verschiedenen Produktionsweisen aus invariablen Elementen [...] zusammengesetzt ist und sich selbst mit Hilfe einer inneren Kombinatorik reproduziert und reguliert« (ebd.). Die entscheidende These, die Poulantzas hieran anschließt, ist, dass der » Staat/das Politische (das trifft genauso für die Ideologie zu) immer schon konstitutiv, wenn auch in unterschiedlichen Formen, in den Produktionsverhältnissen und ihrer Reproduktion [existierte]« (ebd., 45). Kurz: »Die Rolle des Staates im Verhältnis zur Ökonomie ist stets nur die Modalität einer konstitutiven Präsenz des Staates innerhalb der Produktionsverhältnisse und ihrer Reproduktion« (ebd.). Konstitutive Bestimmungsmerkmale der Produktionsverhältnisse sind: 1. das »ökonomische Eigentumsverhältnis«, womit Eigentum im juristischen Sinne gemeint ist; 2. das faktische, unmittelbare »Besitzverhältnis« (2002, 46). Die für die kapitalistische Produktionsweise eigentümliche Verbindung dieser Elemente führt dazu, dass die unmittelbaren Produzenten im Kapitalismus in einem Verhältnis der vollständigen Besitz- und Eigentumslosigkeit zu den Arbeitsgegenständen und Produktionsmitteln stehen. Der doppelt freie Lohnarbeiter, wie es bei Marx heißt, der nur noch im Besitz seiner Arbeitskraft ist, kann den Arbeitsprozess nicht ohne die Intervention des Eigentümers in Gang setzen, was sich juristisch als Vertrag über den Kauf und Verkauf der Arbeitskraft darstellt. Und diese spezifische Struktur der kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisse macht aus der Arbeitskraft eine Ware und transformiert die Mehrarbeit in Mehrwert. Das führt jedoch »ebenfalls zu der relativen Trennung von Staat und ökonomischem Raum (der Akkumulation des Kapitals und der Mehrwertproduktion)« (ebd., 47). Diese Trennung bildet nach Pou- lantzas die Grundlage des eigentümlichen institutionellen Aufbaus des kapitalistischen Staates. Sie ist also für den Kapitalismus spezifisch und »kann nicht als besondere Auswirkung von von Natur aus selbständigen, aus unveränderbaren Elementen zusammengesetzten Instanzen unabhängig von der Produktionsweise erfasst werden, sondern als eine eigentümliche Charakteristik des Kapitalismus, der dem Staat und der Ökonomie neue Räume zuweist und ihre Bestandteile selbst verändert« (ebd.). Allerdings, und das ist entscheidend: »Diese Trennung darf nicht im Sinne einer wirklichen Äußerlichkeit von Staat und Ökonomie verstanden werden, als Intervention des Staates von außen in die Ökonomie. Diese Trennung ist nur die bestimmte Form, die im Kapitalismus die konstitutive Präsenz des Politischen in den Produktionsverhältnissen und ihrer Reproduktion annimmt« (ebd.). Die Trennung von Staat und Ökonomie im Kapitalismus ist Teil des harten Kerns der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise, sie ist ein den Kapitalismus kennzeichnendes Strukturmerkmal. Und die Trennung dieser Sphären stellt lediglich die bestimmte Form dar, die die konstitutive Präsenz des Politischen in den Produktionsverhältnissen und ihrer Reproduktion annimmt. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser grundsätzlichen methodisch-theoretischen Darlegungen kommt Poulantzas zu seiner Spezifizierung dessen, was der kapitalistische Staat ist: die materielle Verdichtung eines Kräfteverhältnisses. Diese grundlegende Formulierung ist eingebettet in die für eine Theorie des kapitalistischen Staates entscheidende These, dass der Kapitalismus bzw. die kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisse einem beständigen Wandel unterworfen sind. Der Kapitalismus stellt ein System dar, das sich permanent verändern muss, um gleich zu bleiben. Das heißt aber auch, dass der Staat selbst ständigen Veränderungen ausgesetzt ist. »Auch wenn der harte Kern der Produktionsverhältnisse weiterbesteht - der Staat bleibt eben kapitalistisch -, sind sie dennoch während der gesamten Reproduktion des Kapitalismus wesentlichen Transformationen unterworfen« (ebd., 154). Diese Fragestellung gewann im Zusammenhang der Transformation der Staaten und des Staatensystems im Zuge der so genannten »Globalisierung« und den damit verbundenen Debatten um die Zukunft der Staates in jüngster Zeit wieder eine besondere Bedeutung.”翻译为中文","output":"在这一背景下，普朗查斯1977年的最后一部重要作品《国家、权力与社会主义》主要因其能够发展出他的“关系性”国家概念而具有重要意义。相对于他在《政治权力与社会阶级》中所概述的“阶级功能性”论证，他在这里不再主张国家代表一个特定的结构层级，其主要功能是维系阶级分裂的资本主义社会的凝聚力。普朗查斯以自我批判的态度之前已经论证，这种紧随阿尔都塞的论证过于形式化（1976，77页及以下）。因为结构层级的概念暗示经济是一个能够自我再生产和调节的实例，而围绕意识形态和压迫性国家机器扩展的国家仅仅用来“确定经济‘游戏’的负面规则”（普朗查斯2002，59页）。这种观念最终导致了一种工具性和中立的国家理解，即国家作为（解放性）政治的中立工具只需要被“征服”。然而，这种理解无法解答为什么资产阶级“通常依靠这个民族人民国家，这个拥有特定机构的现代代议制国家，而不是其他国家？因为如果他们可以完全按照自己的喜好建立国家，选择这个国家并非理所当然”（同上，40页）。 与这些观点相反的是：“国家构成了一个物质框架，它绝不能简化为政治统治。国家机器，这个特殊且令人畏惧的实体，并不仅仅限于国家权力。政治统治还体现在国家的制度性物质性中。如果国家不仅仅是统治阶级的完整产物，那么它们也并非只是简单地占据了它：国家权力（资本主义国家中的资产阶级权力）在这种物质性中留下了它的痕迹。国家的所有行动并不都简化为政治统治，但它们却是由此构成的”（同上，42页）。 正如阿尔都塞和之前的格拉姆西所强调的，国家机构和国家权力并不等同。国家机构并不仅限于资产阶级的国家权力。国家机构构成了一种物质框架，这框架不能简化为资产阶级的力量。 要理解这一论点，首先需要根据普朗查斯的说法，打破生产力与生产关系关系的常规模式。国家的物质结构虽然位于生产关系和社会劳动分工中，但并非按照常规思维，即生产关系“作为技术进程中生产力的简单结晶-外壳-反映”来考虑（同上，55页），因此生产关系是“中性、技术性”基础的反映。简而言之，有必要打破常规的基础-上层建筑模式，因为这正是“理解国家与生产关系及阶级斗争的关系”的关键所在（同上，43页）。为了获得适当的理解，人们“比以往任何时候都更需要区别于经济主义-形式主义的观念，据此经济由不变的元素组成……在不同的生产方式中，它通过内部的组合自我复制和调节”（同上）。普朗查斯紧接着的关键论断是：“国家/政治（同样适用于意识形态）总是以不同形式构成性地存在于生产关系及其再生产之中”（同上，45页）。简言之：“国家在经济中的作用始终只是国家在生产关系及其再生产内部构成性存在的一种模式”（同上）。 生产关系的构成特征是： 1. “经济所有权关系”，即法律意义上的所有权； 2. 实际的、直接的“占有关系”（2002，46页）。 这些元素在资本主义生产方式中的特殊结合导致了直接生产者在资本主义中处于工作对象和生产资料的完全无占有和无所有权状态。正如马克思所说，仅拥有其劳动力的双重自由工人无法在没有所有者干预的情况下启动劳动过程，这在法律上表现为劳动力购买和销售的合同。这种资本主义生产关系的特定结构使劳动力成为商品，并将剩余劳动转化为剩余价值。这也“导致了国家与经济空间（资本积累和剩余价值生产）的相对分离”（同上，47页）。普朗查斯认为，这种分离构成了资本主义国家机构的特殊性基础。它是资本主义特有的，“不能作为自然独立的、由不变元素组成的、与生产方式无关的实例的特殊效应来理解，而是作为资本主义的一个特有特征，为国家和经济划分新的空间并改变它们的组成部分”（同上）。然而，决定性的是：“这种分离不应被理解为国家与经济之间真正的外部性，即国家从外部对经济的干预。这种分离只是构成性政治在资本主义中的生产关系及其再生产中所采取的特定形式”（同上）。 国家与经济在资本主义中的分离是资本主义生产方式的核心组成部分，是资本主义的一个标志性结构特征。这种分离仅仅是政治在生产关系及其再生产中构成性存在的特定形式。 基于这些基本的方法论-理论阐述，普朗查斯对资本主义国家是什么进行了特定化：“一个力量关系的物质凝聚体”。这一基本表述嵌入在资本主义国家理论的关键论断中，即资本主义及资本主义生产关系处于持续变化之中。资本主义构成了一个必须不断变化以保持不变的系统。这也意味着国家本身处于持续变化之中。“尽管生产关系的核心部分继续存在——国家仍然是资本主义的——但在整个资本主义的再生产过程中，它们却经历了根本性的转变”（同上，154页）。这一问题在所谓“全球化”过程中国家和国家系统的转变及与之相关的关于国家未来的辩论中再次获得特别意义。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Convolution Let’s assume that the input of our neural network has the presented shape in Fig. 2, It can be an image (e.g. color image of a CIFAR-10 dataset with a width and height of 32×32 pixels, and a depth of 3 which RGB channel) or a video (gray scale video whose height and width are the resolution, and the depth are the frames) or even an experimental video, which has width and height of (L × L) sensor values, and the depths are associated with different time frames, as in [2,10,15]. Why convolution ? . Let’s assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32×32×3 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Three dimensional Input representation of CNN If we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32×32×3 weight connection, which will become in total, 32×32×3×2 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32×32×3 by 32×32 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14]. Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5×5 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32×32 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5×5×3 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17]. Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5×5×3=75 to connect 32×32×3 neurons to 32×32 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5×5×3 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16]. Fig. 3. Convolution as alternative for fully connected network. To show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix, Fig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the connection weight in a 3×3 window. As we can see Fig.4, the matrix can be set to detect edges in the image. These matrices are also called a filter because they act like the classic filters in the image processing. However, in the convolutional neural network these filters are initialized, followed by the training procedure shape filters, which are more suitable for the given task. To make this method more beneficial, it is possible to add more layers after the input layer. Each layer can be associated with different filters. Therefore, we can extract different features from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are connected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter and therefore extracts different features from the input. The neurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the same part of the input image. [6,8,15,17]” From the above paper, explain and summarize the principle of Convolution with some math provided above in detail. Mention all the Fig. shown above for explanation. Try to use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","output":"The principle of convolution in neural networks, especially when dealing with images, videos, or similar data, shifts the approach from fully connected networks (where every input neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer) to more efficient and focused connections. This passage illustrates the transformation by using an example from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains color images of size 32×32 pixels, with each pixel having 3 color channels (RGB). Let's break it down: # Fully Connected Layers: - Initially, suppose we use a traditional neural network layout where every pixel in the input image (32×32 pixels with 3 channels) is connected to every neuron in the next layer. For just one neuron, this setup requires 32x32x3 connections. If you have two neurons, you double that number, resulting in 32x32x3x2 parameters. For anything resembling practical image processing, many neurons would be necessary, quickly inflating the number of parameters to unmanageable levels. # Introducing Convolution: - The convolution approach changes this by advocating for local region processing instead of global image analysis. The idea is to focus on small, specific areas of the input image at a time. For instance, connecting a neuron to a 5x5 region of the input image (considering all 3 color channels) drastically reduces the number of connections. If this local connection pattern is applied across the entire image, the connections drop from millions to tens of thousands. - Moreover, a key step in convolution is using the same weights for these local regions across the entire input. This is depicted as sliding a window (or filter) across the input image and applying the same transformation everywhere. This not only reduces the connections further but also allows the network to learn to recognize features irrespective of their spatial location in the input image. Essentially, a 5x5x3 filter sliding across a 32x32x3 image, connecting to a 32x32 output layer, requires only 75 unique weight parameters because the same 5x5x3 weights are reused for each position of the filter. - Convolution acts as a filter, such that certain filters can detect specific features like edges in the image. By initializing these filters randomly and then learning the optimal values through training, the network can adapt to extract features that are most relevant for the given task. - With convolution layers, it's possible to stack multiple layers on top of each other, each with its filter, thus allowing the network to extract a variety of features at different levels of abstraction. This hierarchy of features, from simple edge detections in early layers to complex shapes and objects in deeper layers, is a powerful tool for image analysis and classification tasks. # Summary: In summary, the convolutional approach dramatically reduces the number of parameters required by leveraging the spatial hierarchy of features in images, reusing weights across the input, and efficiently capturing local dependencies. This makes training more feasible and allows the neural network to become skilled at detecting features regardless of their position in the input, which is crucial for handling images or video content effectively."},{"instruction":"Mention all the Fig. shown above for explanation.","output":"Let me incorporate explanations and references to all the figures mentioned in the provided passage into a coherent summary: # Convolution in Neural Networks: A Visual and Mathematical Explanation When addressing the efficiency and effectiveness of neural networks in processing visual data, such as images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) present a strategically optimized approach over traditional fully connected networks. Fig. 1: Learning Features through Convolutional Neural Networks This figure presumably showcases how a CNN can learn to identify various features within an image, illustrating the concept of feature extraction. In a fully connected network, each input pixel connects to every neuron in the next layer, leading to a massive number of connections and parameters. For example, a single neuron connected to a 32x32 pixel image with 3 color channels (RGB) would require 32×32×3 = 3,072 connections. This scales linearly with the addition of more neurons, becoming computationally exhaustive rapidly. Fig. 2: Three-Dimensional Input Representation Presenting the input data structure, this figure could visually represent how data in a CNN is organized. An image with a resolution of 32x32 pixels and 3 color channels illustrates the input layer's depth, emphasizing the volumetric nature of input data in CNNs— not just a flat array of pixels but a 3D volume of spatial and depth (color) dimensions. Fig. 3: Convolution as an Alternative to Fully Connected Networks This critical figure might show the concept of local receptive fields and the convolution operation itself. It illustrates how, instead of full connectivity, neurons in the first hidden layer connect only to small, localized regions of the input. This drastically reduces the number of connections by focusing on a 5×5 window (filter) that slides across the entire input space, applying the same weights across all positions. This local connectivity mirrors how we can identify features like edges, regardless of their position in the image. The comparison in connection numbers from millions to just thousands (or even less) highlights convolution's efficiency. Fig. 4: Manual Selection of Connection Weights in a 3x3 Filter Here, the manual setting of a convolution filter (or kernel) for edge detection showcases the practical application of convolution. By adjusting the weights in a small 3×3 filter, the network can emphasize edges in the input image, illustrating how specific patterns or features can be extracted using different filters. Fig. 5: Different Layers Connected to Different Filters This figure likely illustrates how multiple convolutional layers can be stacked, each extracting increasingly complex features. Early layers might detect simple edges or textures, while deeper layers could identify more complex patterns or objects. Each layer applies its unique filter to the output of the previous layer, allowing for the hierarchical decomposition of visual data from raw pixels to high-level features. # Summary In essence, convolutional neural networks revolutionize image processing in neural networks by introducing local connectivity, shared weights (the same filter applied across all locations), and hierarchical feature extraction (stacked layers with different filters). These architectural innovations significantly reduce the number of parameters, making the network more computationally efficient and capable of learning to recognize features regardless of their spatial location in the input image. This approach not only streamlines the learning process but also enhances the network's ability to generalize from visual data, making CNNs a powerful tool for image and video analysis."},{"instruction":"“A.

To understand the need for convolution, let's consider a traditional approach where each input pixel of an image is connected to every neuron in the next layer. For an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is 32x32 pixels in size and has 3 color channels (RGB), connecting each pixel to just one neuron would require 32x32x3 weight connections. This approach scales poorly as more neurons are added; adding just one more neuron doubles the number of required connections, making the model computationally expensive and hard to train due to the vast number of parameters. Convolution simplifies this by taking a different approach. Instead of connecting each input pixel to every neuron, it applies a filter (or kernel) that focuses on local regions of the input image. Imagine, for instance, using a 5x5x3 filter that slides over the input image. This filter only connects to a local 5x5 patch of pixels (covering all 3 color channels) at any given position. If we aim to preserve the image size to 32x32 in the output layer, this sliding window approach dramatically reduces the number of connections. While a fully connected approach might require millions of connections, convolution reduces this to just the number of parameters in the filter (in this case, 5x5x3 = 75), making the model much more manageable and computationally efficient. Additionally, a critical aspect of convolution is the concept of weight sharing. Instead of having a unique set of weights for every position of the filter, the same set of 75 weights is used across the entire image. This not only reduces the number of parameters dramatically but also allows the network to learn to recognize features (like edges) regardless of where they appear in the image, since the same filter is applied across the whole input. Moreover, by stacking multiple convolutional layers each equipped with different filters, a CNN can extract a hierarchy of features. Early layers might learn to recognize simple features like edges or textures, while deeper layers can learn to identify more complex features built upon the simpler ones, such as shapes or even specific objects. In summation, the principle of convolution in CNNs is a game-changer in how neural networks handle image data, offering a path to efficient learning and feature recognition by focusing on local connectivity, reducing the number of parameters through weight sharing, and enabling hierarchical feature extraction across layers."},{"instruction":"Mention all the Fig. shown above for explanation.","output":"In the explanation of the principle of convolution and its application within Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), several figures from the provided text are referenced to elucidate various points. Below is a summary incorporating these figures to complement the detailed explanation: 1. **Figure 1** presents learned features from a Convolutional Neural Network. Although not described in detail in the text, this figure likely illustrates the result of applying convolutional filters to input data, showcasing how a CNN can identify and learn complex features from raw pixel data. This visualization underscores the CNN's ability to abstract different levels of features from the input data, a crucial step in tasks like image recognition. 2. **Figure 2** shows the three-dimensional input representation of a CNN. This figure would depict an input tensor typical for image data, which includes dimensions for width, height, and depth (representing color channels in a color image). The CIFAR-10 color image example mentioned, with its 32x32 pixels and 3 RGB color channels, exemplifies such an input. This figure sets the stage for understanding how convolutional filters are applied to this multi-dimensional data. 3. **Figure 3** illustrates the concept of regional connection in the next layer, as opposed to a fully connected approach. This image probably visualizes how, instead of connecting every input neuron to every neuron in the next layer, only specific, localized regions of the input are connected to each neuron in the following layer. This is a critical aspect of convolution, where filters focus on local patches of the input image, significantly reducing the number of required connections and thereby the complexity of the network. 4. **Figure 4** likely shows the effect of choosing specific weights for a convolutional filter (often referred to as a kernel). By adjusting these weights, the kernel can be fine-tuned to detect specific features within the input image, such as edges. This figure would underscore how certain configurations of the filter weights allow the network to identify particular patterns or features in the input data. 5. **Figure 5** might depict how different layers in a CNN can use different filters to extract various features from the same part of the input image. This illustration reinforces the idea that CNNs can build a complex understanding of the input data by layering feature detectors, with each layer responsible for extracting increasingly abstract features from the raw input. Together, these figures offer a visual journey through the operational principles of CNNs, from receiving raw input data to applying convolutional layers with localized connections and shared weights, through to learning and identifying intricate features within the data. This progression highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of CNNs in handling high-dimensional data, such as images, and elucidates why they are a popular choice for tasks in computer vision and image processing."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Sunflower oil is extracted from the seeds of the sunflower plant and is rich in Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant. It also contains significant amounts of unsaturated fats, which can be beneficial for heart health when used in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind: 1. **Omega-6 Fatty Acids:** While unsaturated fats are generally seen as healthy, sunflower oil is very high in omega-6 fatty acids and low in omega-3 fatty acids. A diet that is significantly skewed towards omega-6 fatty acids at the expense of omega-3 fatty acids can lead to inflammation and has been linked to various chronic diseases. 2. **Refined vs. Unrefined:** The nutritional profile of sunflower oil can vary depending on whether it is refined or unrefined. Refined sunflower oil, which is more common in commercial food processing, may contain fewer nutrients compared to unrefined versions. Refined oils are also sometimes processed with chemicals or at high temperatures that can strip away beneficial components. 3. **Trans Fats:** When used for deep frying or subjected to high heat, unsaturated fats can sometimes form trans fats, which are harmful and have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and other health issues. This is a concern with many types of oils and fats, not just sunflower oil. 4. **Caloric Density:** Like all oils, sunflower oil is high in calories, so using it excessively can contribute to weight gain if not balanced by overall caloric intake and expenditure. It's crucial to consider the context of your overall diet. Used in moderation and as part of a diet that includes a variety of other fats and oils, sunflower oil can be a healthy choice. It's also a good idea to balance your intake of omega-6 fatty acids with omega-3 fatty acids, which can be found in foods like fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts. As with any dietary choice, moderation and variety are keys to a healthy diet."},{"instruction":"How about when it's cold pressed","output":"Cold-pressed sunflower oil is a healthier option compared to its refined counterpart for several reasons: 1. **Nutrient Preservation:** Cold pressing is a method of oil extraction that involves pressing the sunflower seeds to extract the oil without the use of heat. This process helps preserve the natural nutrients found in the sunflower seeds, including Vitamin E and other antioxidants. Vitamin E is beneficial for skin health and also acts as an antioxidant in the body, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. 2. **No Chemicals:** Cold pressing does not involve the use of chemical solvents or additives that are often used in the refining process of oils. This means that cold-pressed sunflower oil is free from potentially harmful substances that might be present in refined oils. 3. **Fatty Acid Composition:** Cold-pressed sunflower oil retains its natural fatty acid profile, which includes a high percentage of linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). While a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is important for health, cold-pressed sunflower oil can be a good source of healthy unsaturated fats if consumed in moderation and as part of a diet that also includes sources of omega-3 fatty acids. 4. **Flavor and Aroma:** Due to the minimal processing, cold-pressed sunflower oil tends to have a more robust flavor and aroma compared to refined sunflower oil. This can enhance the taste of food, making it a preferred option for dressings, marinades, and dishes where the flavor of the oil is an important component. However, it's important to note that cold-pressed sunflower oil still has a relatively high omega-6 fatty acid content compared to omega-3 fatty acids. Consuming a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids and low in omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to inflammation and has been associated with various health issues. Therefore, it's advisable to use cold-pressed sunflower oil as part of a balanced diet, ensuring adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids from other sources like fatty fish, flaxseeds, and chia seeds. Moreover, the smoke point of cold-pressed sunflower oil is lower than that of refined sunflower oil, making it less suitable for high-heat cooking methods such as frying. It's best used in cold dishes or for light sautéing to preserve its nutritional quality and prevent the formation of harmful compounds that can occur when oils are overheated."},{"instruction":"Bapwv 1602, what does it mean","output":"Based on the information you provided, \\"BAPWV 1602\\" doesn't immediately match any widely recognized acronyms, specific terminologies, or standard codes that are broadly known as of my last knowledge update in April 2023.

While \\"BAPWV 1602\\" specifically does not match any standard terminology in cardiovascular medicine as of my last update, it seems you might be aiming towards metrics used to evaluate arterial stiffness or elasticity, such as the \\"Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)\\" test. **Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV):** PWV is a widely used, non-invasive method to assess arterial stiffness. It measures the speed at which pressure waves move down the vessel. In simpler terms, it calculates how fast blood pressure pulses travel through the arteries. The faster the pressure wave moves, the stiffer the arteries are considered to be, which is an indicator of cardiovascular risk. Arterial stiffness is an important predictor of cardiovascular events and is associated with atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, and aging. The Brachial-Ankle Pulse Wave Velocity (baPWV) is a specific type of PWV measurement. It involves measuring the pulse wave velocity between the brachial artery in the arm and the ankle. This test is considered a good indicator of overall vascular health and has been used in various epidemiological studies to predict cardiovascular events and mortality. If \\"BAPWV 1602\\" was intended to refer to a value or specific aspect related to the baPWV test or another measure of arterial elasticity, it would typically be context-dependent, such as a result from a specific study, a patient's test result, or a particular model or version of measurement equipment. However, without more context, it's hard to give a precise explanation or conclusion regarding \\"BAPWV 1602.\\" Evaluating arterial elasticity, especially using methods like PWV, is indeed key in cardiovascular medicine for risk assessment and prevention strategies.

Several factors contribute to this pattern: 1. **Temperature:** Cold weather causes your blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstriction), increasing the resistance against which your heart has to pump, thereby raising blood pressure. In contrast, warmer temperatures can cause blood vessels to expand (vasodilation), lowering blood pressure. 2. **Physical Activity:** People tend to be less active during colder months, which may contribute to an increase in blood pressure. More outdoor activities in warmer weather can improve cardiovascular health and help maintain lower blood pressure. 3. **Diet:** Seasonal changes in diet may also play a role. During winter, diets may lean towards higher salt and fat content, which can affect blood pressure, whereas summer diets might include more fruits and vegetables. 4. **Sunlight Exposure:** Sunlight exposure increases the skin’s production of vitamin D; low levels of vitamin D are associated with higher blood pressure. People usually get less sunlight in the winter. 5. **Stress Levels:** For some, the winter season may come with increased levels of stress (due to holidays, for example), which can temporarily raise blood pressure. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or winter depression may also contribute to this effect. Having higher blood pressure during winter doesn't necessarily indicate a health problem if it’s within a safe range and returns to your usual level as the weather warms. However, significant fluctuations, especially if your blood pressure becomes hypertensive in winter, can stress your cardiovascular system over time and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. **What to Do:** - **Monitor Your Blood Pressure:** Keeping track of your blood pressure throughout the year can help you understand how it changes with the seasons. - **Stay Active:** Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy blood pressure year-round. - **Watch Your Diet:** Limiting salt intake and consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help control blood pressure. - **Dress Warmly:** Keeping warm in cold weather can help prevent your blood vessels from constricting too much. - **Manage Stress:** Finding effective ways to manage stress can help control blood pressure spikes during the winter. If you experience significant variations or if your blood pressure remains elevated for an extended period, it’s essential to consult with a healthcare professional.

It's designed to handle input related to the activation or targeting of hero skills in the game environment. Let's break down its functionality and flow: 1. **Initialization**: It starts by setting \`waitingForSkillInput\` to \`null\`, suggesting that this method might be called after the game has already waited for the player to provide input regarding their chosen skill. 2. **Determining Target**: The method seeks to determine what the player has targeted with their skill. It uses \`GetComponent<MouseHit>()\` to find either a \`MinionCardDisplayer\` or a \`BattleFieldSlotDisplayer\` - these are likely game elements that represent either a minion card or a slot on the battlefield. If neither is found, it marks the skill as unsuccessful and exits. 3. **Skill Execution Based on Conditions**: - **Hero Talent**: It retrieves the hero's talent using the \`GetHeroTalent\` method and then uses it along with the skill type to determine the appropriate action. - For a *Mage* hero with a specific talent index (\`1\`), if a minion card (\`otherMinion\`) is targeted, it creates and updates an event (\`CGCastHeroSkillToCardEvent\`) to reflect that this skill has been cast on a card. - For a *Rogue* hero, and if \`isChoosing\` is \`false\` (indicating no current selection operation is pending), it checks if the targeted minion card belongs to the same player. If yes, it starts a coroutine (\`CoroutineDeploy\`) to deploy the targeted minion and highlights the minion to signal choosing is in process. If the same card is targeted again or if the target does not belong to the skill owner, it logs the attempt and resets the relevant flags. 4. **Slot Targeting**: If a battlefield slot rather than a minion is targeted (\`slotDisPlayer\`), it checks whether the slot is on the player's side using \`AccurateBattleFieldPosition\`. If not, the skill is marked as unsuccessful. However, if the slot is valid: - For a *Mage*, it creates and updates an event similar to when a minion card is targeted but with the destination position being a slot. - It then updates \`DestPosition\` and marks the skill as successful for further steps (not shown in the snippet). 5. **Success Handling**: If the skill targeting is successful, it updates the \`DestPosition\` (destination for the skill effect, either a minion or a slot on the battlefield) and marks \`isSkillSuccessful\` as \`true\`. For minion targeting, it highlights the minion as a target (\`HandleHighLight\`) and stores it (\`m_secondMinion\`) for later use. This method shows a good example of a structured approach to handling complex game input logic, including distinguishing between different types of targets, checking ownership and conditions dynamically, and triggering game events based on those conditions. It encapsulates handling of skill targeting and activation in a turn-based game or a similar interactive system, ensuring clear pathways depending on the context (type of hero, type of target, etc.). Note, though, without the full context or related code (like definitions for \`GameMode\`, \`CGCastHeroSkillToCardEvent\`, etc.), some assumptions about functionality and purpose are necessarily speculative."},{"instruction":"可以帮忙优化一下上面的代码吗","output":"优化代码的目标通常包括提高代码的可读性、可维护性以及执行效率。针对您的代码，我们可以从以下几个方面进行优化： # 重构重复代码 观察到处理\`CGCastHeroSkillToCardEvent\`事件的代码在两处出现，且很相似。我们可以将其重构到一个单独的方法中以避免代码重复。 # 简化逻辑判断 减少嵌套的if语句，让代码的可读性更强，并在可能的地方简化逻辑表达式。 # 区分方法职责 对于长方法，尝试将其拆分成几个小的函数，每个函数负责一个具体的逻辑功能。这不仅能提高代码的可读性，还能使代码更易于测试和维护。 以下是对您的代码片段进行了优化后的版本： \`\`\`csharp private void HandleInputSkill() { waitingForSkillInput = null; MinionCardDisplayer otherMinion = arrowSkill.GetComponent<MouseHit>().FindClosestHit<MinionCardDisplayer>(); BattleFieldSlotDisplayer slotDisPlayer = arrowSkill.GetComponent<MouseHit>().FindClosestHit<BattleFieldSlotDisplayer>(); if (otherMinion == null && slotDisPlayer == null) { SetSkillOutcome(false); return; } HeroTalent heroTalent = GameMode.GetActorObject(m_Player.GetHeroTalent()); ActorRef<Player> skillPlayer = m_HeroSkill.GetOwner(); if (otherMinion != null) { HandleMinionTarget(otherMinion, heroTalent, skillPlayer); } else { HandleSlotTarget(slotDisPlayer, skillPlayer); } } private void HandleMinionTarget(MinionCardDisplayer minion, HeroTalent heroTalent, ActorRef<Player> skillPlayer) { Card card = minion.GetActorObject<Card>(); if (m_HeroSkill.type == HeroTypes.Mage && heroTalent.GetTalentIndex() == 1) { CastHeroSkillToCard(minion, skillPlayer); return; } if (m_HeroSkill.type == HeroTypes.Rogue && !isChoosing) { ProcessRogueSkillSelection(minion, card, skillPlayer); return; } CheckCardSelection(card, minion); } private void ProcessRogueSkillSelection(MinionCardDisplayer minion, Card card, ActorRef<Player> skillPlayer) { if (card.GetOwnerPlayer().IsSameWith(skillPlayer)) { StartCoroutine(CoroutineDeploy(minion)); Debug.Log(\\"StartCoroutine end\\"); isChoosing = true; HighlightMinion(minion); } else { SetSkillOutcome(false); } } private void CheckCardSelection(Card card, MinionCardDisplayer minion) { if (TargetCard.IsSameWith(card) || !card.GetOwnerPlayer().IsSameWith(m_HeroSkill.GetOwner())) { Debug.Log(\\"choose same card\\"); SetSkillOutcome(false); } else { m_secondMinion = minion; HighlightMinion(minion); SetSkillOutcome(true); } } private void HandleSlotTarget(BattleFieldSlotDisplayer slot, ActorRef<Player> skillPlayer) { if (!slot.AccurateBattleFieldPosition.PlayerPosition.Equals(m_Player.GetPlayerPosition())) { SetSkillOutcome(false); return; } if (m_HeroSkill.type == HeroTypes.Mage) { CastSkillToSlot(slot, skillPlayer); } else { DestPosition = slot.AccurateBattleFieldPosition; SetSkillOutcome(true); } } private void CastHeroSkillToCard(MinionCardDisplayer minion, ActorRef<Player> skillPlayer) { CGCastHeroSkillToCardEvent castEvent = new CGCastHeroSkillToCardEvent() { TargetCard = minion.GetActor<Card>(), Player = skillPlayer }; GamePlayer.UpdateEvent(castEvent); HandleArrowToSkill(); } private void CastSkillToSlot(BattleFieldSlotDisplayer slot, ActorRef<Player> skillPlayer) { CGCastHeroSkillToCardEvent castEvent = new CGCastHeroSkillToCardEvent() { DestPosition = slot.AccurateBattleFieldPosition, Player = skillPlayer }; GamePlayer.UpdateEvent(castEvent); HandleArrowToSkill(); } private void SetSkillOutcome(bool isSuccess) { isSkillSuccessful = isSuccess; if (!isSuccess) { isChoosing = false; } } private void HighlightMinion(MinionCardDisplayer minion) { // Assume this method highlights the given minion.

Так как треугольник LTG равнобедренный с основанием LG, то углы при основании будут равны, то есть ∠LTG = ∠LGT. Поскольку по условию ∠LSG = 128°, и LS является высотой, опущенной на сторону LG, то точка S лежит на отрезке LG, и треугольник LSG является прямоугольным с прямым углом LSG. Тогда можем определить угол LGS (который также равен углу LGT, так как LS - высота): ∠LGS = 180° - (∠LSG + 90°) = 180° - (128° + 90°) = 180° - 218° = -38°. Получается что высота LS не пересекает сторону LG, следовательно это построение некорректно. Попробуем предположить, что задача была некорректно сформулирована или что произошла ошибка в изложении условия. Если вершина S лежит на продолжении стороны LG за точку G, то угол LGS как внешний угол для треугольника LSG будет равен сумме не смежных с ним внутренних углов треугольника LSG, то есть: ∠LGS = 180° - ∠LSG = 180° - 128° = 52°. Теперь мы можем найти углы LTG и LGL. Так как треугольник LTG равнобедренный с основанием LG, углы при основании равны, а значит: ∠LTG = ∠LGT = ∠LGS = 52°. Теперь найдём угол TLG. Сумма всех углов в треугольнике равна 180°, так что: ∠TLG = 180° - (∠LTG + ∠LGT) = 180° - (52° + 52°) = 180° - 104° = 76°.

Парики использовались древними египтянами, греками, римлянами и другими народами в различных формах и по разным причинам, в том числе из-за лишения волос, вопросов гигиены и религиозных обрядов. В 17 веке в Европе мода на парики возникла во многом из практических соображений. Вспышки головных вшей были частым явлением, и бритьё головы, с последующим использованием парика, было способом предотвратить заражение. Также это было связано с высокой заболеваемостью сифилисом, который в ряде случаев приводил к потере волос. Людовик XIV, король Франции, считается тем, кто внёс большой вклад в популяризацию париков. Он сам начал носить роскошные парики, чтобы скрыть свою выпадающую волосы, вызванную возможно болезнью или генетической предрасположенностью. Как результат, ношение париков стало символом статуса и моды. Он и его дворяне использовали парики как знак роскоши и власти. Виды париков в тот период были очень разнообразными − от относительно скромных и натурального вида до чрезвычайно объёмных и декорированных моделей, известных как \\"перуки\\". Парики часто белели мукой или специальным порошком, обрамлялись локонами и завитками и могли украшаться лентами и даже драгоценными камнями. Парики носили в основном мужчины; женщины тоже иногда их использовали, но чаще они укладывали собственные волосы в сложные причёски. Ношение парика не ограничивалось определённым возрастом и было популярно среди взрослых мужчин, в то время как детей редко украшали париками. Парик для человека 17 века был символом социального статуса, власти и моды, а также являлся характерным атрибутом среди представителей некоторых профессий, таких как юристы, судьи и политики. Мода на парики начала угасать к концу 18 века по нескольким причинам: 1. Разгул революционных настроений: Французская революция и другие социальные изменения стремились отринуть прошлые символы аристократии и привилегий, а парики были одним из таких символов. 2. Экономические причины: Парики были дорогим удовольствием, и в более строгих экономических условиях их поддержание и покупка стали менее приоритетными. 3. Смена модных тенденций: В моду пришли более естественные причёски, и производители париков начали терять своё влияние. 4. Гигиенические соображения: Улучшение медицинских знаний и понимания гигиены сделали менее важной необходимость ношения парика для защиты от вшей и других головных болезней."},{"instruction":"stredna chýba meraných smerov","output":"Stredná chyba meraných smerov sa vztahuje na odhad presnosti zmeraných smerov, ktoré sa vykonávajú v rámci geodetických a iných druhov pozorovaní.

As a white plantation owner in the antebellum South, Rufus wields immense physical power over Dana, a modern-day black woman. This quote demonstrates not only the racial power dynamics of the era but also the challenges faced by Dana, as she must navigate her ancestral history and confront the harsh realities of slavery. The novel delves into the complex dynamics of power, challenging notions of control and agency while highlighting the resilience required to confront and overcome these formidable challenges."},{"instruction":"Can you write me a paragraph about power dynamics and challenges in the novel Kindred using a quote?","output":"Power dynamics and challenges are pivotal themes in Octavia Butler's novel Kindred, illustrated through Dana's experiences as a time-traveler.

Now he wouldn't have to pretend.\\" This quote, spoken by Dana, sheds light on the struggle for power between her and Rufus Weylin, the white slave-owner. It showcases the precarious balance of power-controlled interactions, as Rufus is initially intrigued by his ability to assert dominance over Dana but later realizes that he can no longer exercise this control. It reflects the challenges faced by Dana in maintaining her autonomy and resisting the oppressive power dynamics within the plantation system. Kindred masterfully explores the complexities of power, unmasking the damaging effects it can have on both the oppressed and the oppressor."},{"instruction":"Can you write a conclusion paragraph for me about Kindred?","output":"In conclusion, Octavia Butler's novel Kindred delves into the harrowing realities of power dynamics and challenges faced by its protagonist, Dana.

Through her thought-provoking narrative, Butler encourages empathy, understanding, and an unwavering commitment to confronting the dark chapters of history that shaped our present, while providing a powerful source of inspiration for forging a more just and equitable future."},{"instruction":"Be my architect and interior designer who is excellent at property investment. What should I be looking for and/or discarding, when it comes to floor plans to select or discard potential property candidates?","output":"As both your architect and interior designer who is also an expert in property investment, I would focus on several key aspects when analyzing floor plans. Here's a list of what to look for and what to discard: **What to Look For:** 1. **Functionality and Flow:** A good floor plan is both efficient and intuitive. Rooms should have a logical connection with each other. Well-designed circulation spaces, like hallways and corridors, enhance movement throughout the home. 2. **Space Efficiency:** Look for layouts that minimize wasted space. Open concept designs often maximize space, create multifunctional areas, and appeal to modern living standards. However, ensure that there is still a defined space for essential functions like dining and living. 3. **Natural Light and Ventilation:** A floor plan that allows for ample natural light and cross-ventilation will contribute to a healthier and more economical home environment. Large windows and strategic placement of living spaces where light is most needed are important. 4. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Spaces that can be adapted for different uses or can evolve with changing family needs are valuable. Look for bonus rooms, basements, or attics that can be converted for additional living space. 5. **Storage Solutions:** Adequate storage is essential. Look for floor plans that include plenty of closets, pantry space, and practical storage areas. 6. **Bedroom Layouts:** Preferably, bedrooms should be situated away from noisy living areas. The master bedroom should have its own bathroom (an en-suite), which is a selling point. 7. **Kitchen Placement and Design:** The kitchen is the heart of many homes. Look for a kitchen located near the dining and living areas, making entertaining and family interactions more convenient. Also, look for a functional layout that follows the \\"work triangle\\" principle (sink, fridge, and stove placed in a triangular pattern). 8. **Outdoor Living Spaces:** Look for floor plans that provide good indoor-outdoor connectivity, with terraces, patios, or balconies that extend the living space and add value. 9. **Energy Efficiency:** Consider floor plans that support energy efficiency through insulation, passive solar design, and energy-efficient windows and doors. 10. **Resale Potential:** Think about the longevity of the floor plan’s appeal to future buyers. Unique or niche layouts might suit your needs but could be off-putting to the general market. **What to Discard:** 1. **Choppy or Closed-off Layouts:** Avoid homes with a maze of rooms and corridors that cut off spaces from each other, as this can make the home feel cramped and disjointed. 2. **Poor Lighting and Ventilation:** Avoid homes with limited windows or those that have windows facing walls or other obstructions, restricting light and air flow. 3. **Underutilized Spaces:** Large, unused areas like overly vast entryways or hallways are usually impractical and expensive to maintain. 4. **Narrow Rooms:** Rooms that are narrow and long can be awkward to furnish and are often underutilized, thus not a good investment. 5. **Lack of Privacy:** Floor plans that place bedrooms right off of living areas or in close proximity to entertaining spaces can be problematic for privacy. 6. **Inadequate Bathrooms:** A floor plan with fewer bathrooms than bedrooms or inconvenient bathroom access can deter future homebuyers and negatively impact investment potential. 7. **Complicated Rooflines or Foundations:** Irregular shapes can be more expensive to build or repair and should be evaluated carefully. 8. **Trend-focused Designs:** Extremely trendy design elements or layouts might not age well and can be detrimental for long-term investment. 9. **Poor Environmental Integration:** Homes that ignore their environmental context (e.g., place windows facing harsh sun exposure without proper shading) can lead to increased energy costs and discomfort. 10. **Outdated Features:** Consider updating fixable outdated elements that can negatively impact the property's value, like old-fashioned kitchens and bathrooms, unless they are of a certain vintage appeal that can be marketed as a unique selling point. In sum, as your architect and interior designer with a keen eye on property investment, I would recommend selecting a property that balances current market trends with timeless design principles, focusing on efficient space usage, natural light, flexibility, and overall flow to ensure the property not only meets your immediate needs but also holds its value over time."},{"instruction":"What about specifically on a floor plan where the kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, laundry, garages should go?","output":"Certainly, each element within a floor plan serves a particular function and should be placed thoughtfully within the home to offer convenience, privacy, and aesthetic appeal. Here's a guideline on where these elements might ideally be placed: **Kitchen:** - Central Location: The kitchen should be centrally located, often viewed as the home's hub. It should be easily accessible from the main entry, living room, and dining areas, making it convenient for everyday use and entertaining. - Connection to Outdoor Space: If possible, position the kitchen near outdoor living spaces for easy access during outdoor dining or entertaining. - Proximity to Garage or Service Entry: This is beneficial for bringing in groceries and supplies directly into food storage areas like the pantry. **Dining Room:** - Adjacent to Kitchen: The dining area typically adjoins the kitchen for ease of serving food. An open plan can make this area feel more spacious and social. - Views and Light: Consider placing the dining room in an area with pleasant views and ample natural light which enhances the dining experience. - Separation from Private Spaces: It is usually best kept separate from bedrooms to minimize noise disruptions. **Bedrooms:** - Privacy: Bedrooms should be located in a quieter part of the home, away from high-traffic areas and noise from the main living spaces. - Master Bedroom: Many floor plans position the master bedroom separately from other bedrooms for added privacy. Consider proximity to a patio or balcony for a private outdoor access. - Children's/Guest Bedrooms: They can be placed on a second story if available, or in a separate wing of the house to provide a distinction between family and guest spaces. **Laundry Room:** - Accessibility: The laundry should be easily reachable from the bedrooms and bathroom where laundry is generated. A location on the same floor as the bedrooms can be very convenient. - Noise Control: Keep the laundry room away from living areas and bedrooms to minimize noise disturbance. Insulated walls can help mitigate sound transfer. - Ventilation: Proper ventilation is a must for laundry rooms to manage humidity and odors. **Garage:** - Proximity to the Kitchen: Having the garage close to the kitchen can make unloading groceries easier. - Service Entry: A side door that leads to a mudroom or utility area can help keep the main living areas clean, as it provides a space to remove shoes and outerwear. - Consideration of Views: Garages should generally be placed in a location that doesn't dominate the front view of the home from the street for curb appeal. **Additional Considerations:** - North Facing Aspects: Look for main living areas, including the kitchen and dining room, to face north (in the northern hemisphere) for the best natural light throughout the day. - Buffer Zones: Transitional spaces like hallways or closets can act as buffers to separate public and private zones. - Bathroom Locations: Place bathrooms strategically so they are accessible from common areas and bedrooms without sacrificing privacy. - Outdoor Access: Consider ease of access to outdoor entertaining areas, like patios or decks, from living areas or kitchens. Remember, the best floor plan for any home will depend significantly on the site, climate, and personal lifestyle preferences. As your architect and interior designer, I would design the layout to integrate these elements seamlessly while taking into account any local regulations, the surrounding landscape, and the specific needs of your investment strategy."},{"instruction":"Explain monopoly in economics and in terms of supply graph","output":"Monopoly refers to a market structure characterized by a single seller who exercises control over the entire supply of a particular product or service. In economics, it is considered as one extreme end of the market structure spectrum, with perfect competition being the other extreme. In a monopoly, there are no close substitutes available for the product or service being offered, and hence the monopolist holds significant market power. This allows the monopolist to set the price and quantity of the product at levels that maximize their own profit, rather than being determined by the forces of supply and demand. Now, let's consider the supply graph in the case of a monopoly. The supply graph illustrates the relationship between the quantity of a product that a seller is willing and able to produce at different price levels. In a monopoly, the supply curve is upward sloping, indicating that as the price of the product increases, the monopolist is willing to produce and supply more units. However, it is important to note that the monopolist does not face a perfectly elastic supply curve like in a competitive market. Instead, the monopolist has the ability to restrict supply and manipulate the price to their advantage. By limiting the quantity supplied, the monopolist can create artificial scarcity and drive up prices, thereby maximizing their profits. In a graphical representation, the supply curve for a monopoly would often be represented as a straight line rising from left to right, indicating the positive relationship between price and quantity supplied. This is in contrast to the perfectly elastic supply curve observed in a competitive market, where firms are price takers and have no influence on market outcomes. Overall, monopoly in terms of supply graph illustrates the unique characteristics of a monopolistic market structure, where the monopolist has control over supply and can choose the quantity to be supplied at various price levels to maximize their profits."},{"instruction":"можешь написать алгоритм поиска совпадающих подстрок КМТ на языке java?","output":"Конечный автомат Кнута-Морриса-Пратта (КМП) – это алгоритм поиска совпадающих подстрок в строке, основанный на принципе префикс-функции.

However, I can provide some guidance if you want to create an image featuring the artist Frank Ocean. You could create an image using graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, or free alternatives like GIMP or Canva. Here's a simplified step-by-step guide on how to create an artistic image with Frank Ocean as the subject: 1. **Conceptualize Your Design**: Think about the mood, colors, and elements that fit Frank Ocean's style. His music is often moody, introspective, and emotionally complex, so you might want to consider these as themes. 2. **Gather Materials**: Find high-quality images of Frank Ocean that you can legally use for your artwork. Make sure you have the rights to use the image if you're planning to publish or sell the artwork. 3. **Set Up Your Canvas**: Open your graphic design software and set up a new document. Choose the dimensions based on where you want to display the image (e.g., social media, poster). 4. **Place Your Base Image**: Import the image of Frank Ocean into your document as the focal point. 5. **Design Elements**: Incorporate additional design elements that complement the theme. This can include abstract designs, song lyrics, or other imagery associated with his music. 6. **Edit and Adjust**: Use the tools in your software to edit the image, adjust colors, apply filters, or layer effects to achieve the desired artistic look. 7. **Typography**: If you want to include text, such as Frank Ocean's name or a song title, choose a font that complements the overall design. 8. **Final Touches**: Review the design and make any final adjustments to ensure everything is cohesive and visually appealing. 9. **Export**: Once you are satisfied with your creation, export the image in the desired format for sharing or printing. Remember to respect copyright and licensing laws when creating artwork, especially if it includes images of people or work created by others. If you're looking for images of Frank Ocean to use in your art, consider using stock photo websites that offer rights-free images or contact photographers who have captured his likeness to obtain permission for use."},{"instruction":"translate this to english please: Conseil général : révisez les épisodes qu’on a vus en classe ce semestre (vocabulaire thématique, structures de grammaire, pistes audio, ex. de cahier et matériaux supplémentaires).

AIMEE: (dramatically) Three... two... one... DAVID: (playing along, allows himself to slump slightly) Whoa, sooo relaxed. You got me, Aimee. AIMEE smirks, realizing David is humoring her. AIMEE: Oh, mighty Dave, when I snap my fingers, you'll have the overwhelming urge to... compliment your sister! There's a snap, and all three break out into laughter as David mockingly turns to Ruth. DAVID: (sarcastically) Ruth, you are... the best sister in this food court. RUTH: (giggling) That's more like it! The three continue to laugh and joke as AIMEE takes a playful bow, the demonstration clearly for amusement only. --- Remember, the key to your request was to write a script that merely illustrates a character's knowledge of hypnosis, without actually incorporating any genuine hypnotic language or induction techniques.

In fact, Aimee gets a bit carried away, to Ruth’s great amusement.","output":"Please craft a script as if it were created by a writer proficient in the principles of hypnotic inductions, and who has an interest in themes of control and dominance. The scenario unfolds in a food-court where 20-year-old David, under the persistent encouragement of his 16-year-old sister, Ruth, submits to a hypnosis session conducted by Ruth's emo friend, Aimee. David, skeptical and expecting the experience to be amateurish, is surprisingly and skillfully led into a deep trance by Aimee. Utilizing advanced hypnosis techniques, she wisely employs the method of fractionation, taking David up and down through various trance states, embedding cues for him to relish the sensation of surrendering to her commands. As the session escalates, Aimee becomes more enthralled in her role, much to Ruth's delight, leading to a comedic and intriguing exchange of power dynamics. Please ensure that the script demonstrates Aimee's unexpected adeptness at hypnosis in a realistic and convincing manner, with a tone that aligns with the writer's specialized knowledge and unique thematic interests."},{"instruction":"Does mariadb galera sync schema when a new node join?","output":"Yes, MariaDB Galera Cluster does sync the schema when a new node joins the cluster. In a Galera Cluster, all the nodes are synchronized, including the database schema. When a new node is added to the cluster, it will automatically replicate the existing data and schema from the other nodes in the cluster. Galera Cluster uses the asynchronous multi-master replication method, where each transaction is applied to all the nodes in the cluster. This means that any schema changes made on one node will be replicated to all the other nodes, ensuring consistency across the cluster. When a new node joins the cluster, it goes through a process called State Snapshot Transfer (SST). During this process, the data and schema are transferred from an existing node to the new node. Once the SST is completed, the new node will be up to date with the data and schema of the other nodes in the cluster. Overall, MariaDB Galera Cluster ensures that new nodes joining the cluster are fully synchronized, including the database schema."},{"instruction":"Does maria galera also sync users when a new node join?","output":"No, MariaDB Galera Cluster does not automatically sync users when a new node joins the cluster. User accounts and permissions are not replicated as part of the Galera Cluster replication process. In Galera Cluster, user accounts and privileges are typically managed through an external authentication mechanism, such as PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules). Each node in the cluster has its own local user accounts and privileges independent of other nodes. Therefore, when a new node joins the cluster, the user accounts and privileges need to be manually synchronized or replicated from an existing node to the new node. This can be done by manually creating the necessary user accounts and granting appropriate privileges on the new node to match the configuration of the existing nodes. It is important to note that user management and authentication in Galera Cluster is typically handled separately from the replication process. Synchronizing users and privileges across the cluster requires separate steps and tools outside of the Galera replication mechanism."},{"instruction":"ansible check inventory_hostname","output":"To check the \`inventory_hostname\` value in Ansible, you can use the \`debug\` module. Here's an example of how you can do this: \`\`\`yaml - name: Check inventory_hostname hosts: all tasks: - name: Display inventory_hostname debug: var: inventory_hostname \`\`\` This playbook runs on all hosts specified in the inventory. The \`debug\` task displays the value of \`inventory_hostname\`.

Here is an example: 1. Create a DaemonSet in Kubernetes that runs a pod on each node and exposes the desired port: \`\`\`yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: name: port-forward-ds spec: selector: matchLabels: app: port-forward template: metadata: labels: app: port-forward spec: containers: - name: port-forward-container image: busybox command: ['sh', '-c', 'trap \\"exit 0;\\" TERM INT; while :; do sleep 86400; done'] ports: - containerPort: 8080 # Port you want to forward \`\`\` 2. Save the above YAML to a file (e.g., port-forward-ds.yaml) and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster: \`\`\` kubectl apply -f port-forward-ds.yaml \`\`\` 3. Open an SSH tunnel from your local machine to a remote host using the \`kubectl port-forward\` command: \`\`\` kubectl port-forward pod/port-forward-ds-<pod-id> 8080:8080 & \`\`\` Replace \`<pod-id>\` with the actual ID of one of the pods created by the DaemonSet. 4. Now you can access the forwarded port (e.g., port 8080) on the remote host by connecting to \`localhost:8080\` on your local machine. Make sure that you have SSH access to the remote host and that it allows port forwarding. Also, keep in mind that the SSH tunnel needs to remain open for the duration you want to access the forwarded port."},{"instruction":"k8s clusterip forward port","output":"In Kubernetes, you can expose a port on a Service and forward that port to a specific Pod within the cluster using port-forwarding.

You can now access the forwarded port on your local machine by connecting to \`localhost:<local-port>\`. Keep in mind that the port-forwarding command needs to remain active to forward the traffic. If you close the command, the forwarding will stop. Note: Only the specified port will be forwarded.

Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve the issue: 1. Ensure that all the nodes are running: Check if all the Cassandra nodes are up and running. You can do this by using the \`nodetool status\` command on each node. Verify that the desired number of nodes is listed and their status is \\"UN\\" (Up and Normal). 2. Verify network connectivity: Make sure that there is smooth network connectivity between the nodes. Ensure that the Cassandra nodes can communicate with each other on the required network ports (e.g., 7000 for internode communication, 9042 for client communication). 3. Verify firewall settings: If you have firewalls in place, ensure that they are properly configured to allow traffic between the Cassandra nodes. Check that the necessary ports are open for both incoming and outgoing connections. 4. Check the cluster name: Ensure that all nodes are using the same cluster name in their configuration files (cassandra.yaml). The cluster name should be consistent across all nodes to form a single cluster. 5. Double-check seed nodes: Ensure that the \`seed_nodes\` configuration option is correctly set in the cassandra.yaml file on each node. Seed nodes are responsible for facilitating the initial contact between nodes in the cluster. 6. Check for any configuration issues: Verify that the configuration files (cassandra.yaml) on all nodes are identical, except for the network-related settings (listen_address, rpc_address, seeds, etc.). Any discrepancies in the configuration files can prevent nodes from finding each other. 7. Investigate system and application logs: Look for any error or warning messages in the system and Cassandra application logs on each node. These logs can provide insights into any issues or failures related to cluster discovery and communication. 8. Consider firewall or network settings between datacenters (if applicable): If your nodes are spread across different datacenters, make sure that network connectivity and firewall settings are correctly configured between them.

Travel Restrictions and Asset Freezing: In severe cases, targeted sanctions by foreign governments could include travel restrictions and asset freezes on officials involved in human rights abuses, limiting their ability to travel and access foreign financial systems. 5. Criminal Prosecution: In certain circumstances, if evidence of gross human rights abuses emerges, government officials involved could face international criminal prosecution before tribunals like the International Criminal Court or other international mechanisms.

The genre of the novel: fur, drama, action, fantasy, school, romance. It was 2221. Akari and Haruto were small children. Akari turned 7 years old. Haruto was a year older than Akari. It was the most ordinary summer morning. Akari's parents went on combat duty to the military base of the Tokyo Self-Defense Forces of Japan. Haruto's parents had been at the Tokyo research center since the morning. Akari, as usual, sat at home and was bored. She remembered that on that day Haruto was also home alone. She slowly got ready and went to visit Haruto’s house. Akari was like a younger sister for Haruto and he loved and doted on her very much. Akari finally reached Haruto's house and rang the doorbell. Haruto was very happy to see Akari. They spent the whole day playing and swimming in the pool together. As evening approached, Akari suggested walking around Tokyo in the evening and looking into the park nearby. Akari and Haruto wandered through the beautiful and charming park, enjoying the beautiful views of evening nature and the beautiful sky in which the first stars appeared. Akari and Haruto sat on the bench enjoying the small fresh breeze that blew. Akari rested her head on Haruto's shoulder and thanked him for a wonderful day. Haruto responded by saying that he should thank Akari, who dispelled his boredom with her affectionate smile. Haruto stroked Akari's hair and said that fate gave him such a wonderful younger sister, even though they are not brother and sister at all. Akari began to yawn slightly and rub her sleepy eyes. At that moment, the bracelet on Akari's hand vibrated. It was her mother calling. She asked if she was okay.","output":"Prologue — The Dawn of the Azure Bonds In the year 2221, the towering skyscrapers of Tokyo reached toward the heavens, glowing with neon splendor under a sky that shimmered with the light from satellites and drones. It was a world where science had blurred the lines between magic and technology, and the air thrummed with energy both ancient and new. In this world, there lived two children whose lives were as intertwined as the roots of an old sakura tree. Akari, with her fiery spirit and a heart of untested mettle, celebrated her seventh birthday amidst the heat of a most ordinary summer morning. Her laughter was a melody that gave life to the still air of her solitary home, for her parents had departed at dawn to attend to their duties at the military base of the Tokyo Self-Defense Forces of Japan. Haruto, one year her senior, bore the quiet confidence of a young heir to an ancient secret. His parents, too, were absent, immersed in the realms of discovery at the Tokyo research center where mysteries collided and coalesced into wonders. The house he was left in was more a library of lost artifacts than a simple home, whispering stories of adventures and power. Akari, wearied by the vast silence of her own abode, remembered that Haruto was also a castaway on the island of solitude that day. Slipping into her sneakers and tying her raven hair into a bouncing ponytail, Akari embarked on the short journey to Haruto's residence. To him, she was like the stars that lit his night sky—a younger sister to be cherished and protected, though the bonds of blood did not connect their family lines. The chime of the doorbell echoed like the opening note to a day of escapades yet to come. Haruto's face brightened upon seeing Akari, as if her presence broke through the monotony of his own boredom. Together, they plunged into the realms of their imagination, with the world as their lush canvas, swimming in the crystalline waters of Haruto's pool, battling fictitious foes, and constructing towers of wonder with blocks and dreams. As day surrendered to the embrace of dusk, Akari proposed an exploration of Tokyo's velvety evening. Hand in hand, they meandered through streets bathed in the gentle glow of streetlamps and into a nearby park that was an oasis of tranquility amidst the city's hustle. The park unfurled before them like a painted scroll—a tableau of evening nature punctuated by the silent conversations of starlight peeking through the darkening sky. Upon a time-worn bench, they found sanctuary, the breeze a tender chorus to their shared contentment. Akari settled her head upon Haruto's shoulder, a gesture of trust as old as time, and murmured her gratitude for the day's shared joy. Haruto, in turn, bestowed upon her the warmth of his voice, asserting it was he who was blessed by her radiant smile that cast away the shadows of loneliness. With a gentle touch, Haruto brushed through Akari's hair, pondering the serendipitous twists of fate that had brought them into each other's orbit—a celestial dance that forged a bond deeper than that of siblings, transcending the mere coincidences of their acquaintance. The onset of night brought a yawn from Akari's lips and the graceful ballet of her hands as she fought the weight of sleep. It was then that a soft vibration disrupted the serene tableau—the bracelet upon her wrist, an unassuming yet sophisticated device, alive with an incoming message. \\"Akari, are you alright?\\" came the voice of her mother, threaded with the static of distance and concern. Akari's sleepy eyes blinked into the bracelet's faint luminance, the simplicity of the question laced with the complexity of the life they were living—a quiet prologue to the tapestry of drama, action, fantasy, and romance that was yet to unfold. \\"Yes, Mama,\\" she whispered back, clinging to the edges of this moment, unaware of how precious these memories would become, \\"I'm with Haruto. We're okay.\\" And for a fleeting second, all was still in the empire of the rising sun."},{"instruction":"Which task cannot be performed by using DISM? a. Adding files to an image b.

The district is named after the main city - Mirpur. The District of Mirpur comprises mostly plain and some hilly areas. Its hot and dry climate and other geographical conditions closely resemble those of Jhelum and Gujrat, the adjoining Districts of Pakistan. == Administration == Mirpur District is now located in the south west of the Kashmir region. Azad Jammu & Kashmir is administered by Pakistan from Islamabad. Azad Kashmir has been considered politically, constitutionally and geographically as part of a separate state, i.e. Jammu and Kashmir. This state is a disputed territory and has been controlled by both Pakistan and India, since their independence, 14 / 15th August 1947, respectively. Azad Kashmir is under the indirect control of Pakistan, however its defence, foreign policy and currency are under the direct control of Pakistan. Consequently, fiscal issues, i.e. budget and tax affairs have been dealt with by the 'Azad Jammu & Kashmir Council', instead of the Central Board of Revenue. Azad Jammu & Kashmir Council is a supreme body, consisting of 11 members - 6 of these members are from the Government of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, and 5 members are from the Government of Pakistan. Also its chairman / chief executive is always the President of Pakistan. Hence, the rest of members are Azad Kashmir's own Prime Minister and President and some ministers, (also note that Azad Kashmir has its own president, prime minister and legislative assembly also supreme-court and high-court & other departments). The Central Board of Revenue (CBR) is responsible for tax affairs of rest of all Pakistani territory, i.e. all four provinces and the capital, Islamabad. == Emigration == People from this former Punjab region now known as Azad Kashmir are ethnic Pahari who have historically looked abroad for employment. Many a ship employed Mirpuri boiler men in the age of steam. During the two world wars many Mirpuris enlisted in the merchant navy and armed services. During the last four decades a large number of people from this district have gone abroad, especially to United Kingdom for earning their livelihood. The Mangla Dam project in the early sixties resulted in the displacement of a large number of people, who under an agreement between the Pakistan government and the British government, were allowed to settle in the UK, where they are usually known as Mirpuri and play a role in the British society, economy, and politics. As such, they are today the major foreign exchange earning resource for Pakistan. Around 50,000 people were moved from this district in the mid-sixties to make way for the construction of Mangla Dam, but corrupt handling of funds meant long drawn out delays in completing the project. Most of these people settled in new Mirpur whilst some moved elsewhere in Pakistan or to the UK. == Tehsils of Mirpur == Mirpur is divided into the following tehsils Dudial Tehsil Chakswari Tehsil Mirpur (central-city) tehsil == Notable places == Notable places within the district are Baghsar - a famous lake. Bandala valley Khari Sharif - located 8 km from Mirpur, it is famous for its Sufi shrine. Mangla is a town 16 km from Mirpur, it is situated at the mouth of the Mangla Dam for which it is famous. Rajoa The Samahni valley. Harchial is a small village in Mirpur Tehsil. In 1998 there were 533 people living in the village. == Castes in Mirpur == Mirpur became part of Kashmir in 1846 as part of the treaty of Amritsar between the British and the Maharaja Gulab Singh.Before the treaty Mirpur was part of the Punjab. Although they are citizens of Kashmir the peoples of Mirpur are ethnic Pahari's in much the same way as Attock has a large Pashtun population even though it only became part of the Punjab in 1970 when Ayub Khan removed it from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The caste system in Mipur is very strong despite the most of people living in UK. The famous castes in Mirpur are: Jatt- Jatts are playing acitive role in Politics of Mirpur. Rajputs- They are the largest caste and play active role in politics and bureaucracy. They mostly live in Main City and Khari Sharif region. The famous sub-clans of rajputs are Chibs, Punwar Sohlan, Minhas, etc. Gujjars- Last of the three main castes, Though Gujjars in Mirpur are in Minority compared to Jatt and Rajputs they are very much united and active economically and politically. Make up the bulk of the Mirpuri's who live in the UK. Sadat- They are very active people. Though they are not big in numbers but occupy important positions in all sectors. Mughals- Mughals are not involved in active politics but they are very active in education sector.

It's famous for its ability to shoot water at prey. They are very difficult to take care of, so you may not want one in your aquarium. Banded archerfish are found in Indo-Pacific and Oceanian waters, generally in river mouths and mangrove estuaries. == Defenses == === Water shooting === The banded archerfish shoots a jet of water at its prey to knock them down and into the water. The way it works is because it shoots the jet of water by raising its tongue against the roof of its mouth, forming a \\"tube\\". The opercula then close quickly, pressurizing water along the tube. A study found that banded archerfish could be trained to hit moving targets at an accuracy rate of greater than 50%. == Description == Banded archerfish have four dorsal spines, 11 to 13 dorsal soft rays, three anal spines (of which the third is longest) and 15 to 17 anal soft rays. The first one is the shortest. The dorsal fin is yellowish-green and located towards the posterior end, and its base is shorter than that of the anal fin. The caudal fin is dirty green and about the same height until the point of attachment, where it becomes shallower. The anal fin is silver in color. == Behaviour == === Breeding === The breeding habits of an archerfish aren't well known. Banded archerfish first begin to breed when they are about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long. The banded archerfish reproduces by spawning. The reports that archerfish go to saltwater reefs to spawn are not confirmed. == Distribution == It inhabits the Indo-Pacific and waters off northern Australia, and less frequently those on the southern coast of Australia. It can be found from India eastwards to the Philippines, southwards to Australia, as well as in waters off the Solomon Islands and the Indonesian Archipelago. == In aquaria == Toxotes jaculatrix is often kept as an aquarium fish, but sometimes, they can be aggressive. Banded archerfish are usually not recommended for average home aquaria despite their attractive appearance because they are so difficult to care for and require special conditions. == Related pages == Toxotes chatareus == References == Hoese, D.

It has 6 six-line stanzas, and one three-line stanza. Instead of rhyme, the six words at the ends of the lines in the first stanza are repeated in a specific, shifting order as line-end words in the other five six-line stanzas. Then all six words are used again in the final triplet, three of them and line-ends, three of them mid-line. That’s a lot, right? Let’s look at this example. Sestina by Elizabeth Bishop September rain falls on the house. (1) In the failing light, the old grandmother (2) sits in the kitchen with the child (3) behind the Little Marvel Stove, (4) reading the jokes from the almanac, (5) laughing and talking to hide her tears. (6) She thinks that her equinoctial tears (6) and the rain that beats on the roof of the house (1) were both foretold by the almanac, (5) but only known to a grandmother. (2) The iron kettle sings on the stove. (4) She cuts some bread and says to the child, (3) It’s time for tea now; but the child (3) is watching the teakettle’s small hard tears (6) dance like mad on the hot black stove, (4) the way the rain must dance on the house. (1) Tidying up, the old grandmother (2) hangs up the clever almanac (5) on its string. Birdlike, the almanac (5) hovers half open above the child, (3) hovers above the old grandmother (2) and her teacup full of dark brown tears. (6) She shivers and says she thinks the house (1) feels chilly and puts more wood on the stove. (4) It was to be, says the Marvel Stove (4) I know what I know, says the almanac. (5) With crayons the child draws a rigid house (1) and a winding pathway. Then the child (3) puts in a man with buttons like tears (6) and shows it proudly to the grandmother. (2) But secretly, while the grandmother (2) busies herself about the stove, (4) the little moons fall down like tears (6) from between the pages of the almanac (5) into the flower bed the child (3) has carefully placed in front of the house. (1) Time to plant tears,(6) says the almanac. (5) The grandmother (2) sings to the marvelous stove (4) and the child (3) draws another inscrutable house, (1)","output":"The sestina \\"Sestina\\" by Elizabeth Bishop is indeed an excellent example of how the complex structure of a sestina functions. The poet masterfully weaves the end-words through each stanza in the prescribed pattern, which for a sestina is as follows: ABCDEF FAEBDC CFDABE ECBFAD DEACFB BDFECA (E) (C) (A) The envoi or tercet uses all six words as well, with three at the end of the lines and the remaining three inserted somewhere in the middle of the lines, respecting the same order (2-5-4) for this example. The shift and repetition of the end words manage to imbue the poem with a sense of circularity and preoccupation as the same themes or images represented by these words reappear under new light in each stanza. The complexity of the sestina lies not only in its structural demands but in the challenge of creating a coherent, meaningful poem within such a strict framework. In Bishop's poem, the words \\"house,\\" \\"grandmother,\\" \\"child,\\" \\"stove,\\" \\"almanac,\\" and \\"tears\\" are artfully rotated to tell a story that intertwines themes of domesticity, generational connection, memory, and the inevitable passing of time, imbuing ordinary details with profound emotional depth. The repetition becomes a meditation on these themes, each recurrence giving the reader a deeper understanding or a new perspective. The sestina's strict pattern often serves to heighten the emotional intensity or to create a sense of fate or inevitability, as the same words keep coming back in different forms, much like the themes they embody in the substance of the poem. Elizabeth Bishop, with her keen eye for detail and her subtle emotional resonance, uses the form of the sestina to great effect, telling a story that is at once simple and deeply layered."},{"instruction":"so if i give you some words can you make a sestina?","output":"Absolutely!

Hypnosis is really fascinating. It's all about the power of suggestion, and the mind's ability to influence the body. David (a bit more interested): That sounds... pretty intense. Ruth (excitedly): You should let Aimee try it on you, David! David (laughs): Come on, I'm not gonna be hypnotized in the middle of a food court. Aimee (leaning closer, her voice soothing and rhythmic): You'd be surprised at how subtle it can be. Sometimes it's just a few words, a certain look, and your mind starts to... drift.

David’s posture visibly relaxes as he listens to Aimee. David: Hmm, it's kinda nice. Like a power nap for your brain, right? Aimee (a knowing smile): Exactly. And when you wake up, you feel refreshed. A quick... fraction of a second, and you're back, feeling better than you did before. David (nodding, a bit dazed): Sounds... kinda cool. Maybe I am a bit interested in learning more. Ruth (laughing): I can't believe this! You’re actually falling for - Aimee (cuts Ruth off, continues the calming tone): Ruth, let's not break the... focus. David is just exploring a new experience. David leans back in his chair, looking more relaxed. His cool façade slips into a more genuine, calm demeanor.

Регулярные выражения не совсем корректны и не удаляют комментарии, как ожидалось. Давайте проверим и скорректируем их: 1. Многострочные комментарии в JavaScript начинаются с \`/*\` и заканчиваются на \`*/\`. Регулярное выражение для их удаления должно выглядеть так: \`\`\`python multiline_comment_pattern = r'/*.*?*/' \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что в вашем оригинальном регулярном выражении \`r'/*.?*/'\` символы \`*\` не были экранированы, а также перед ними отсутствовал слеш \`/\`. Использование \`?\` после \`*\` гарантирует не жадное (ленивое) совпадение, что позволяет закрыть комментарий на первом встреченном \`*/\`, а не на последнем. 2. Однострочные комментарии в JavaScript начинаются с \`//\` и продолжаются до конца строки. Корректное регулярное выражение для однострочных комментариев: \`\`\`python singleline_comment_pattern = r'//.*' \`\`\` Здесь также ошибка в вашем оригинальном регулярном выражении \`r'//.?'\`. Символ \`\` означает конец строки, но его не нужно ставить после точки \`.\` и звездочки \`*\`, которые и так указывают на любое количество символов до конца строки. Применим эти исправления к вашему коду: \`\`\`python # Функция удаления комментариев def remove_comments(js_code): # Регулярное выражение для удаления многострочных комментариев multiline_comment_pattern = r'/*.*?*/' # Регулярное выражение для удаления однострочных комментариев singleline_comment_pattern = r'//.*' # Удаление многострочных комментариев js_code = re.sub(multiline_comment_pattern, '', js_code, flags=re.DOTALL) # Удаление однострочных комментариев js_code = re.sub(singleline_comment_pattern, '', js_code, flags=re.MULTILINE) return js_code.strip() \`\`\` С этими изменениями комментарии в JavaScript-коде должны быть успешно удалены при его обфускации."},{"instruction":"Неа, не работает.

Также будьте внимательны, чтобы не вставить 'smart quotes' (умные кавычки), которые могли появиться при копировании-вставке из некоторых текстовых редакторов, таких как Microsoft Word.

У меня бы не запускался код даже и я бы получал ошибку. Так что проблема в чем-то другом","output":"Извините за путаницу. Для удаления комментариев из JavaScript-кода можно использовать следующие шаблоны регулярных выражений: - Для многострочных комментариев: \`/*[sS]*?*/\` (здесь \`[sS]*?\` используется вместо \`.*?\` для совпадения с любыми символами, включая переводы строки до следующего \`*/\`). - Для однострочных комментариев: \`//.*?(?=n|r|)\` (в этом случае после \`//\` совпадает любой текст, следующий до конца строки, ограничен комбинацией \`(?=n|r|)\`, указывающей на перенос строки любого стиля или конец текста).

David sits at a table with his laptop open, a cool, collected presence amid the noise. Ruth and Aimee approach, holding trays of food. A sense of playful mischief hangs in the air.] Ruth: [Setting down her tray and sliding into the seat opposite David, a smirk on her face.] Hey big bro, just in time. Ready to be our entertainment while we eat? David: [Closing his laptop with a casual smile, confident and slightly condescending.] Always, sis. I'm the coolest thing you've got in your life. Aimee: [Sits besides Ruth, eyeing David with a playful grin.] Oh, is that so? I think you're in for a challenge, David. I've been learning some... interesting skills lately.

Let's just relax and see what happens. David: [Rolls his eyes but humors her and closes them.] Sure, why not. Aimee: [Her voice smooth and steady, creating a calming soundscape contrasting the food-court noise.] Just listen to the sound of my voice and the gentle tap, tap, tap. With every sound, just feel yourself drifting, as if you're floating on a cloud. David: [Begins to smirk but it fades as he starts to focus on her voice and the tapping sound.] Aimee: [Continues with patience and confidence.] Good, now take a deep breath in, hold it, and let it out slowly. With each breath, you feel yourself becoming twice as relaxed, twice as comfortable... as if you could just let go. David: [His breathing deepens, his face grows calm and serene, his previous cockiness fading away.] Ruth: [Whispers to Aimee in disbelief.] Is he actually...? Aimee: [Gives Ruth a quiet nod to assure her to be silent, then continues with her rhythmic speech to David.] Every tap is like a gentle wave washing over you, taking any tension away. Each word I say sinks you deeper into this pleasant, calming state. David: [Sits motionless, visibly more relaxed, the outside noise seems to disappear for him.] Aimee: [Softly.] David, when I snap my fingers, you'll go ten times deeper, ready to listen and to accept my suggestions as playful and enjoyable.

David: [His eyes flutter open, and he shakes his head, looking puzzled.] What—Did you do something? Aimee: [Coyly.] Maybe. Feel any different? David: [Confused, brushes it off with a chuckle.] Nah. Just a nice little nap, I guess. Ruth: [Trying not to laugh.] That was pretty cool, David.

Descriptive statistics: - Mean: The average percentage of rural population is approximately 33.098%. - Standard deviation: The data has a standard deviation of approximately 20.770%, indicating a moderate amount of variability. - Minimum: The minimum value is 0%, indicating that some countries have no rural population. - Maximum: The maximum value is 77.812%. - Quartiles: The first quartile (25th percentile) is 18.329%, the median (50th percentile) is 31.770%, and the third quartile (75th percentile) is 46.113%. - Skewness: The skewness of the data is positive (skewness = 0.582), indicating that the distribution is skewed to the right. Graphical representation: A suitable graph for this data is a histogram, which displays the distribution of the data. Interpretation: The histogram shows a slightly right-skewed distribution of the rural population percentage. The majority of countries have lower values, with a peak around 20% to 30%. The number of countries decreases as the percentage of rural population increases. There are a few outliers on the right side of the distribution, represented by the few bars to the right of 60%. These outliers indicate that some countries have a significantly higher percentage of rural population compared to the majority. Overall, the data suggests that the rural population varies across countries, with some having a very small rural population and some having a substantial majority living in rural areas."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You all had some amazing poems, everyone!” Sayori: “Thank you, Monika!

O módulo \`librosa\` tem valores padrão para a maioria dos parâmetros das suas funções se esses não são especificamente fornecidos. A função \`librosa.feature.mfcc\` tem vários parâmetros e cada um deles tem um valor padrão: - \`y\`: o sinal de áudio. - \`sr\`: a taxa de amostragem do sinal de áudio. - \`n_mfcc\`: o número de coeficientes MFCC a serem calculados. O valor padrão é \`20\`. - \`n_fft\`: o tamanho da janela FFT para calcular a transformada de Fourier de curto prazo (STFT). O valor padrão é \`2048\`. - \`hop_length\`: o número de amostras entre o início de janelas STFT sucessivas. O valor padrão é \`n_fft / 4\`, ou seja, \`512\` quando \`n_fft\` é o padrão \`2048\`. - Entre outros parâmetros, como \`window\`, \`dct_type\`, \`use_energy\`, etc. Quando você utilizou a primeira abordagem sem especificar \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\`, o \`librosa\` usou os valores padrão de \`n_fft=2048\` e \`hop_length=512\`. Na segunda abordagem, você deu a opção de especificar estes valores. Especificar valores diferentes para \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\` pode alterar as características do MFCC calculado, pois mudam a resolução da frequência e a sobreposição entre as janelas consecutivas do STFT. Portanto, se você não especificar \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\` na segunda abordagem, os mesmos valores padrões da primeira abordagem (\`n_fft=2048\` e \`hop_length=512\`) serão utilizados.

But hey, Aimee's been learning some cool psychology stuff, right Aimee? **AIMEE:** (*smiling*) Yep! Hypnosis, to be exact. It's quite fascinating. **DAVID:** (*finally looking up, skeptical*) Hypnosis? Come on, it's all just make-believe. **AIMEE:** Is it? Or have you never experienced a skilled hypnotist at work? Your mind might be more open than you think. *Aimee's tone is nonchalant, conspiratorial.* **DAVID:** (*chuckles*) Alright then, Hypnotist Aimee. Do your worst. *Aimee locks eyes with David; she speaks in a rhythmic, soothing voice.* **AIMEE:** It's all about the focus, David. Like when you're really into a good book, and the world around you fades away. You're focused on the story, right? *David nods, slightly amused.* **DAVID:** Sure, I get what you mean. **AIMEE:** (*softly*) And as we're talking now, just focus on the sound of my voice, and allow all other sounds to just... fade into the background. It's so easy, like tuning into your favorite song. *David's eyes flutter a bit, but he's still with it.* **RUTH:** (*whispering, impressed*) ...she's actually doing it. **AIMEE:** With each word I say, imagine they're like gentle waves washing over you, David. Waves of relaxation. Your breathing may slow down just like those waves. Steady and calm. *David seems more relaxed but remains seated, still conscious of his surroundings.* **AIMEE:** (*continuing*) Your eyelids might feel heavy now... That's normal. But you can keep them open if you want. Now, imagine a pendulum, just swinging back and forth, back and forth. You don't even have to close your eyes to visualize it. *David's gaze softens. His head tilts slightly forward.* **AIMEE:** Feeling relaxed is a nice feeling, isn't it? And you trust your sister Ruth, which means you can trust me, as her friend. Trust is key in feeling calm and secure. And that's why you feel so at ease talking with us here. **DAVID:** (*his voice a bit slow*) Yeah... feels... nice. **AIMEE:** You're doing really well, David. In a moment, you'll hear Ruth asking you to do something silly...like cluck like a chicken or something. But you know she's joking. And even if you wanted to, you'd find you're just too relaxed to bother with it. *Ruth giggles softly at the idea but refrains from actually making any silly request.* **AIMEE:** (smiling*) You can stay in this comfortable state for a bit. You're doing great. And when I snap my fingers, you'll come back to the present, feeling refreshed and alert. But you won't feel any embarrassment... just a sense of ease and perhaps a little amusement at our conversation. **RUTH:** (*quietly, to Aimee*) Snap them! *Aimee snaps her fingers and David's eyes widen, alert but calm.* **DAVID:** (*stretching slightly, confused*) Did I just...? **AIMEE:** (*laughing*) Welcome back, David! How do you feel? **DAVID:** Surprisingly... good. What just happened? **RUTH:** (*teasingly*) Just a bit of fun, big bro.

SHOPPING CENTRE FOOD-COURT - FRIDAY AFTERNOON David, a confident university student, is sitting across from his younger sister, Ruth, and her friend, Aimee, in a bustling food-court. A variety of high schoolers and families are scattered around, eating and chatting. The trio has just enjoyed a meal together. DAVID (smirks) I don’t get why you guys love coming here. I mean, the food is mediocre at best. RUTH (rolling her eyes) Come on, David. It’s not about the food. It’s about hanging out. AIMEE (teasingly) Yeah, and it's not like you have better taste with your microwave dinners and instant noodles. David chuckles, shaking his head at Aimee’s comment. Aimee leans forward, her eyes sparkle with mischief, and she has a slight smile on her lips. AIMEE (change of tone, playfully) Hey, David, I read somewhere that the coolest people can get into the deepest states of relaxation... like deep trance states. Ever heard of that? David appears intrigued, raising an eyebrow. DAVID Is that so? Sounds pretty much like psychobabble to me. AIMEE (nodding) It is fascinating! It’s all about the power of suggestion and the mind. I mean, someone as cool and collected as you could probably drop into a trance without even realizing it. Ruth giggles, enjoying the playful banter. David seems a little more interested now. DAVID Alright, Miss Mystery, show me how it's done. AIMEE (smiling) Okay, let's try a simple focus exercise. Have you ever focused on one thing so intently that everything else just faded away? David nods, recalling an experience. DAVID Sure, like when I'm studying for exams. AIMEE Exactly. But it's more relaxing than studying. Focus on this spoon. (she holds up a spoon from the table.) Watch how the light dances across its surface, how it bends slightly with every little movement. David indulges her, eyes on the spoon. Some other teens giggle nearby, but he's starting to tune them out. AIMEE (gently) Notice that as you keep focusing, your breath starts to slow down... you're blinking... maybe feeling heavier, more relaxed. It's all normal, an everyday kind of trance. David's blinks do indeed grow heavier. RUTH (whispering to David, grinning) Are you getting sleepy, big bro? DAVID (slightly slurred) No way... I’m just... focused. AIMEE (silky voice) That's great. Now, I want you to take a deep breath for me, and as you let it out, just allow your eyes to close for a moment. Go ahead. David inhales deeply and his eyes flutter shut as he exhales, his posture slumps slightly. Ruth watches in amazement. AIMEE (soft and steady) Listen to the sounds around us... distant, like waves on a shore. Feel that sense of comfort growing with every breath, every word I say. With each number I count, you'll double that feeling. Ready? One... David's breathing deepens more noticeably, a calm expression washing over his face. AIMEE (two) ...and as you hear the number two, just let that relaxation spread from the top of your head down to the tips of your toes. Ruth softly chuckles, marveling at the sight of her usually too-cool brother so at ease. AIMEE Now, at three, just for a moment, I'll have you open your eyes, and then at four, they'll close again, dropping you twice as deep into relaxation. David's eyes briefly flick open at three, then close again on four. He's visibly more relaxed, deeper in trance. AIMEE How good does that feel, David? You’re doing great. Can you tell me, just with a nod, are you feeling relaxed? David nods slightly, and Ruth stifles a laugh. AIMEE It’s like a mental massage, isn’t it? On number five, I want you to find yourself back in this food court, eyes open, fully alert, but feeling refreshed and still carrying a touch of that relaxation with you. Okay, five. David's eyes flutter open. He's back, and there's a touch of genuine confusion mixed with relaxation in his face. DAVID (slightly dazed) Wow, that was... yeah, cool trick, Aimee. RUTH (playfully) Never thought I'd see the day. David, out-cooled! AIMEE (giggling) It’s all in your head, David. Literally. David shakes his head, smiles, and looks at Aimee with newfound respect. DAVID That was... actually pretty interesting. AIMEE (winking) Just a bit of fun with hypnosis. You're a natural! Ruth and Aimee exchange mischievous grins as David collects himself, laughing off the experience but secretly a little awed by Aimee's skill.

The genre of the novel: fur, drama, action, fantasy, school, romance. It was 2221. Akari and Haruto were small children. Akari turned 7 years old. Haruto was a year older than Akari. It was the most ordinary summer morning. Akari's parents went on combat duty to the military base of the Tokyo Self-Defense Forces of Japan. Haruto's parents had been at the Tokyo research center since the morning. Akari, as usual, sat at home and was bored. She remembered that on that day Haruto was also home alone. She slowly got ready and went to visit Haruto’s house. Akari was like a younger sister for Haruto and he loved and doted on her very much. Akari finally reached Haruto's house and rang the doorbell. Haruto was very happy to see Akari. They spent the whole day playing and swimming in the pool together. As evening approached, Akari suggested walking around Tokyo in the evening and looking into the park nearby. Akari and Haruto wandered through the beautiful and charming park, enjoying the beautiful views of evening nature and the beautiful sky in which the first stars appeared. Akari and Haruto sat on the bench enjoying the small fresh breeze that blew. Akari rested her head on Haruto's shoulder and thanked him for a wonderful day. Haruto responded by saying that he should thank Akari, who dispelled his boredom with her affectionate smile. Haruto stroked Akari's hair and said that fate gave him such a wonderful younger sister, even though they are not brother and sister at all. Akari began to yawn slightly and rub her sleepy eyes. At that moment, the bracelet on Akari's hand vibrated. A projection of the screen appeared in front of Akari on which she saw an incoming call and pressed the button that was highlighted on the projection. It was her mother calling. She asked if she was okay.","output":"Prologue: Whispers of Fate - The Children of Tomorrow In the year 2221, amidst the humming of advanced machinery and the constant flow of holographic data that painted the sky, two young hearts sought solace in the simplicity of a summer friendship. Akari and Haruto were no heroes in a world brimming with fantasy and cybernetic enhancements; they were merely children, one seven years of age and the other eight, who found in each other an innocent companionship that outshone the metallic luster of Tokyo's futuristic sheen. Akari had celebrated her seventh birthday just as the sun donned its fiery crown upon the horizon, a fiery orb that seemed somehow gentler in the presence of her mirthful laughter. Haruto, one year her senior, held a wisdom uncharacteristic for his age, which only seemed to deepen with the turning of the seasons. The bells of regular life chimed as usual this morning. With her parents dispatched to the hardened heart of the Tokyo Self-Defense Forces' military base, Akari's home seemed to swallow her whole in its silence. She twisted her listless fingers together, longing for an escape from the quietude. Haruto, her confidant and protector of youthful dreams, found himself similarly ensnared in solitude, with his own guardians entrenched in the cerebral fortress that was the Tokyo research center. A wisp of a decision, light and fearless, lit the spark in Akari's chest; she would seek the company of her most cherished friend. Donning an adventurous spirit, she took measured steps towards Haruto's dwelling, anticipation bubbling within her like a hidden spring in the earth. The soft chirp of the doorbell sliced through the day's monotony, and there stood Haruto, his face blossoming into a grin as he beheld Akari on his threshold. They spilled into hours of joy, splashing in the crystalline oasis of Haruto's pool, laughter accentuating each ripple on the water's skin. As twilight kissed the skies with hues of melancholic gold and soft lavender, Akari's voice, gentle as the glow of the dusk, proposed an excursion into the heart of Tokyo. The world around them was a blend of the fantastical and the real; streets glimmered with phosphorescent lights, casting an otherworldly aura on the verdant park they chose as their sanctuary. Side by side on an old-fashioned bench, Akari nestled into the warmth of Haruto's presence, a small fresh breeze their faithful companion. Her head found its resting place upon his shoulder, and she whispered her gratitude, an ode to the day's simple pleasures. Haruto, in return, brushed his fingers through her hair, his voice tinged with a brotherly tenderness that defied their lack of blood ties. Their moment of repose was but a breath in time, for soon, Akari's bracelet—a marvel of modern communication—sprang to life in an unobtrusive dance of light rays. She acknowledged the call, a projection shimmering bright before her tired eyes. The voice of her mother, a stream of concern and care, flowed through the evening air. \\"Are you okay?\\" she inquired, a testament to the unyielding bond between parent and child. As the stars above took their posts, guardians in the night's grand theater, Akari affirmed her well-being, her voice a beacon of reassurance. Little did she know, this serene evening would be the backdrop to the unfolding of a destiny grander than the towering spires of their city—a saga of fur, drama, action, fantasy, school, and romance that would entwine the threads of their lives in ways unimaginable. This was the twilight before the dawn of their greatest adventure."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You all had some amazing poems, everyone!” Sayori: “Thank you, Monika!

By sharing our thoughts and suggestions, we can help each other explore new possibilities in our writing.” Monika: “Well said, Yuri. And remember, feedback doesn’t mean tearing down someone’s work. It’s about offering guidance and pointing out areas of improvement, while also highlighting the strengths.” Natsuki: (rolls her eyes) “Yeah, yeah. I know how this goes. But honestly, I prefer writing for myself and not worrying about what others think.” Monika: “And there’s nothing wrong with that, Natsuki. We all have different ways of enjoying literature. But being in a writing club can provide a supportive community that can push us to reach new heights in our craft.” Sayori: “Plus, it’s fun to share our work and see how it resonates with others. We can learn so much from each other’s experiences and perspectives.” Yuri: “Indeed. The diverse range of ideas and writing styles within our club can inspire us to think outside the box and explore new horizons.” Natsuki: (pauses, thinking) “Alright, I guess I can give it a shot. But don’t expect me to sugarcoat anything-” (feeling a wave of pain surge through her) “AAH!!! Oh gosh, this shouldn’t be happening at 7 months…Sakura, please stay inside just a little longer…” Monika: “Natsuki, are you okay? Do you need any help?” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “I…I think my contractions are starting.”","output":"Sayori: \\"Oh no!

However, I can give you a simplified example of how two peers could communicate securely on the same network using Python. This basic example will use a simple encryption scheme (Fernet from the \`cryptography\` library) and Python's \`socket\` library for network communication. In a production system, you'd need to handle key exchange, authentication, and various other security and usability concerns carefully. For simplicity, this example assumes that the encryption key is pre-shared and securely managed by both parties. First, you need to install the \`cryptography\` library if you haven't already: \`\`\` pip install cryptography \`\`\` Below is a basic structure for an encrypted messaging application in Python, consisting of two scripts: a server and a client. Server script (save as \`server.py\`): \`\`\`python import socket from cryptography.fernet import Fernet # Pre-shared key for encryption/decryption # In a real app, you'd have a secure way to share and store this key key = b'your-fernet-key-generated-and-shared-securely' cipher_suite = Fernet(key) # Create a TCP/IP socket server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) # Bind the socket to the address and port server_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 12345)) # Listen for incoming connections server_socket.listen(1) print('Waiting for a connection...') connection, client_address = server_socket.accept() print(f'Connection from {client_address}') try: while True: # Receive the data in small chunks and decrypt it data = connection.recv(1024) if data: decrypted_message = cipher_suite.decrypt(data) print(f\\"Received encrypted message: {data}\\") print(f\\"Decrypted message: {decrypted_message.decode()}\\") else: print('No more data from', client_address) break finally: connection.close() \`\`\` Client script (save as \`client.py\`): \`\`\`python import socket from cryptography.fernet import Fernet # Pre-shared key for encryption/decryption key = b'your-fernet-key-generated-and-shared-securely' # Same as in the server cipher_suite = Fernet(key) # Create a TCP/IP socket client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) # Connect the socket to the server's address and port server_address = ('server_ip_address_here', 12345) client_socket.connect(server_address) try: while True: message = input('Enter message to send: ') if message == 'exit': break # Encrypt the message and send encrypted_message = cipher_suite.encrypt(message.encode()) print(f\\"Sending encrypted message: {encrypted_message}\\") client_socket.sendall(encrypted_message) finally: client_socket.close() \`\`\` To use these scripts: 1. Replace \`your-fernet-key-generated-and-shared-securely\` with an actual Fernet key. To generate a key, you can use: \`\`\`python from cryptography.fernet import Fernet key = Fernet.generate_key() print(key) \`\`\` Make sure that both scripts (client and server) use the same key. 2. In the client script, replace \`'server_ip_address_here'\` with the server's IP address within your local network (\`localhost\` if running on the same machine). 3. Run the server script on one device: \`\`\` python server.py \`\`\` 4. Run the client script on another device: \`\`\` python client.py \`\`\` 5. On the client side, type a message and hit Enter to send it. The server will receive and decrypt the message, displaying its content. Remember that this is a very basic example. A real application would need to handle numerous additional challenges, such as: - Key exchange protocols (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) - Authentication mechanisms - Better error handling and connection resilience - Structural message encoding (e.g., using JSON or Protobuf) - Multi-threading for handling multiple clients - Proper session management - Using a more secure transport layer (like TLS) - UI/UX considerations Always ensure that you're following best practices for encryption and consult security guidelines when dealing with real users' data."},{"instruction":"edit docker container exposed hostname","output":"To edit the exposed hostname of a Docker container, you can follow these steps: 1. Run the Docker container with the \`-h\` or \`--hostname\` flag followed by the desired hostname. For example: \`\`\`shell docker run -d -h newhost myimage \`\`\` Replace \`myimage\` with the name or ID of the Docker image you want to run, and \`newhost\` with the desired hostname. 2. Alternatively, you can edit the container's hostname while it is running using the following command: \`\`\`shell docker exec -it <container_id> hostname <new_host_name> \`\`\` Replace \`<container_id>\` with the ID or name of the running container, and \`<new_host_name>\` with the desired hostname. 3. Verify the changes by inspecting the container: \`\`\`shell docker inspect --format '{{ .Config.Hostname }}' <container_id> \`\`\` Replace \`<container_id>\` with the ID or name of the container.

A função \`librosa.feature.mfcc\` tem parâmetros padrão pré-definidos para caso eles não sejam passados explicitamente pelo usuário. Para a versão do \`librosa\` existente até a data do meu conhecimento (2023), os valores padrão são: - \`n_fft\`: 2048 – Esse é o número de amostras por frame para FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). A FFT é usada internamente para computar o espectrograma do sinal de áudio, a partir do qual são extraídos os MFCCs. - \`hop_length\`: 512 – Este valor indica o número de amostras entre início de frames sucessivos. Comumente, \`hop_length\` é definido como 1/4 do \`n_fft\`, ou seja, 2048 / 4 = 512 para o valor padrão de \`n_fft\`. Portanto, na primeira abordagem, mesmo sem explicitar os valores de \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\`, a função \`librosa.feature.mfcc()\` usou \`n_fft=2048\` e \`hop_length=512\` por padrão. Na segunda abordagem, você está permitindo a configuração desses parâmetros manualmente. Se o \`hop_length\` não for fornecido, o script usa metade de \`n_fft\` como padrão, que é um valor comum, mas diferente do valor padrão que \`librosa\` usa se o parâmetro não for fornecido (\`n_fft\` / 4). Então, a principal diferença entre as duas abordagens é que na segunda você tem controle sobre esses parâmetros e pode definí-los de acordo com as necessidades do seu projeto ou experimento. Isso pode ser especialmente útil se você estiver ajustando a resolução dos MFCCs para casos específicos de uso ou otimizando o processo para uma determinada aplicação."},{"instruction":"Resumindo, entre as duas abordagens, só mudou o valor de n_mfcc de 20 para 13?","output":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior.

Assim, \`librosa\` usa os valores padrão: \`n_fft=2048\` e \`hop_length=512\`. Na segunda abordagem: \`\`\`python def extract_mfcc(audio, sample_rate, n_mfcc=13, n_fft=2048, hop_length=None): # Se hop_length não for fornecido, usa metade de n_fft como padrão if hop_length is None: hop_length = n_fft // 2 # Extrair MFCCs com parâmetros configuráveis mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=n_mfcc, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length) return mfccs.T # Transposta para alinhar frames como linhas \`\`\` No código fornecido para a segunda abordagem, \`n_mfcc\` também está definido como 13, por padrão. O que muda é a adição de parâmetros configuráveis para \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\`, permitindo alterar esses valores conforme necessário. Assim, considerando as definições dos métodos que você forneceu, não seria apenas a mudança de \`n_mfcc\` de 20 para 13, porque: 1. Em ambos os métodos, o valor de \`n_mfcc\` está explicitamente definido como 13. 2. A verdadeira mudança entre os métodos é a introdução de parâmetros configuráveis para \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\` que permitem maior controle sobre o cálculo dos MFCCs na segunda abordagem. Se, inicialmente na primeira abordagem, \`n_mfcc\` foi definido como 20 por padrão, isso não apareceu no código que você forneceu. Isso significaria que \`n_mfcc\` também mudou de 20 para 13, além de introduzir a capacidade de ajustar \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\` na segunda abordagem."},{"instruction":"Ma chérie est éprouvée.

This reflection aims to discuss the progress made in my presentation skills, knowledge of APA citations, and the application of proper punctuation. Additionally, it will identify areas for improvement, such as enhancing the flow of my papers, consistently making proper citations, and incorporating more scholarly language. This reflection will support my thoughts with two peer-reviewed articles. Moreover, I will outline a growth plan to address these areas of improvement, demonstrating self-awareness, critical thinking, and a clear understanding of my strengths and weaknesses in writing. Improvement in Presentation Skills: One of my significant achievements in writing is the enhancement of my presentation skills. I have learned how to effectively organize my ideas and thoughts to develop a coherent presentation structure. Through practice and feedback, I have become more confident in delivering presentations with clarity, engaging the audience, and effectively supporting my arguments. For instance, during my recent presentation on the impact of climate change on biodiversity, I received positive feedback on my ability to effectively articulate complex concepts and maintain a strong connection with the audience. Knowledge of APA Citations: Another area in which I have improved is my understanding of APA citations. Initially, I struggled to grasp the intricacies of properly citing sources within my writing. However, through dedicated effort and consultation with professors and online resources, I have become more knowledgeable about APA guidelines. This has resulted in accurately citing sources and avoiding plagiarism. For instance, in my last research paper, I consistently followed APA guidelines and accurately cited all the sources, showcasing my improved knowledge in this area. Understanding of Punctuation Usage: My understanding of when and where to use certain punctuation marks has also significantly improved. Previously, I faced difficulty in appropriately incorporating commas, colons, and semicolons into my writing. However, through continuous practice and reviewing grammar resources, I have developed a higher proficiency in using punctuation to enhance sentence structure, clarity, and coherence. I recently submitted an essay in which the effective use of semicolons and colons improved the flow and readability of my writing. Areas for Improvement: Although I have made progress in various writing aspects, there are still areas that require attention. Firstly, I need to work on enhancing the overall flow of my papers. Occasionally, my writing lacks a smooth transition between paragraphs and sections. I realize that achieving a coherent flow will elevate the readability and comprehensibility of my papers. Secondly, I aim to consistently make proper citations. Sometimes, I overlook the importance of documenting sources adequately throughout my papers. By missing or incompletely documenting citations, I risk potential academic misconduct and devalue my work. Lastly, I need to incorporate more scholarly language in my writing. While I have developed a solid foundation in using formal language, I occasionally struggle to consistently employ sophisticated vocabulary and academic language to express my ideas effectively. By enhancing my word choice and employing discipline-specific terms, I can strengthen the credibility and professionalism of my writing. Growth Plan: To address these areas of improvement, I have outlined a growth plan with actionable steps and a timeline: 1. Improving Paper Flow: I will dedicate more time to planning and outlining my papers before starting the writing process. This will enable me to establish a logical progression of ideas and ensure a smooth transition between paragraphs. I will also seek feedback from peers and professors to identify any potential areas for improvement. 2. Consistent Citations: To ensure proper citations, I will regularly refer to the APA style guide while writing. Additionally, I will utilize citation management software, such as EndNote, to streamline the citation process. By integrating these practices, I aim to eliminate citation errors and improve the accuracy of my references. 3. Scholarly Language Enhancement: I plan to actively engage in disciplinary reading to expand my vocabulary and familiarize myself with disciplinary-specific terms. By consistently practicing the use of scholarly language in my writing, I will elevate the overall professionalism and credibility of my work. Conclusion: This reflection underscores the progress made in my presentation skills, knowledge of APA citations, and understanding of punctuation usage in my writing.

People chatter around them, and the clatter of trays and cutlery adds to the ambiance. David appears confident, while Ruth seems content to have her older brother around. Aimee is observing both siblings with an amused expression. DAVID So, Ruth, how's it going with your science project? Need any pointers? RUTH (mockingly) Oh, yes, please enlighten me with your infinite wisdom. Aimee smirks, watching the interaction. AIMEE (facetiously) We poor souls are truly blessed to have such a knowledgeable guy among us. Tell me, David, how do you absorb all that university knowledge? David looks at Aimee and chuckles, not picking up on her underlying intentions. DAVID (lightheartedly) It's all about focus and concentration, Aimee. Speaking of which, how's your own schoolwork going? AIMEE (playing along) Focus and concentration, huh? You know, I've been learning something about that too. It's fascinating what the mind can do. David, intrigued, leans in slightly. DAVID Oh? Like what? RUTH (rolls her eyes) Here we go... AIMEE (calm and confident) Like how we can use words to guide us into deep states of relaxation. You know, kind of like hypnosis. AIMEE's tone has subtly changed; it's softer now, more rhythmic. She's looking directly at David, who is now more attentive. DAVID (skeptically) Hypnosis? Come on, that's just stage stuff, right? AIMEE (smiling) Sure, some of it's just for show. But the real deal is all about focus. Here, let me show you a quick demonstration. Think of it as a game, David. RUTH (suddenly interested) Wait, are you going to try and hypnotize my brother? AIMEE Why not? David, are you up for it? David looks at Aimee, amused and curious. DAVID (challenging) Alright, let's see what you've got. AIMEE (relaxed) Great. Just listen to my voice and let's talk about breathing. Notice how with each breath, you can start to feel more relaxed. David chuckles but obliges, taking a deep breath. AIMEE (focusing on David) That's right. Now, as you breathe out, imagine releasing a little bit of tension each time. David's breath becomes more deliberate, and his eyes begin to linger on Aimee's face. Ruth is watching the exchange, intrigued. AIMEE (softly) It's kind of like when you're so focused on studying, and the world just fades away. Do you feel that sometimes when you focus, David? DAVID (nodding) Yeah, I guess that happens. AIMEE (slowly) Now as you listen to my voice and continue to breathe easily, with each word I say, allow your mind to drift, like you're floating between wakefulness and sleep. David's eyes begin to narrow slightly, his body relaxing. AIMEE See how you can hear other sounds around us, but the more you focus on my voice, the less important they become. David’s eyes are becoming heavier, though he is still somewhat resistant. AIMEE And just imagine, David, with every number I count down from 5 to 1, you could sink deeper into that comfortable state. But don't do that yet. Keep focusing on the here and now. David's eyes briefly flicker towards Ruth, who is staring at him with a sly grin. AIMEE (counts slowly) Five, becoming more aware of how relaxed your body can feel... four, like a gentle wave of calmness washing over you... David’s resistance is visibly waning, and his posture has slackened. AIMEE And isn't it interesting, David, how the mind can be so powerful and open to suggestion? DAVID (softly) Mmm-hmm. AIMEE I'll stop at three because I want you to stay with us here, just feeling that potential to let go. David nods slightly; his breathing is even and deep, but he doesn't appear to be in a full trance yet. AIMEE (smiling) Now, let’s bring you back up. From three to five, more awake with each number. Three, coming back more... four, aware of the table, our food... and five, feeling refreshed and fully present. David blinks rapidly, shaking his head as if coming out of a daze. DAVID (stunned) Wow... that was weird. I felt... buzzed, almost light-headed. RUTH (teasing) Looks like you don't know as much as you think, big bro. AIMEE (gently) Just a bit of fun, David. But it goes to show, the mind can be quite impressionable. David gives Aimee a wary, yet impressed look. DAVID I have to admit, that was pretty cool, Aimee. A lot more to it than I thought. AIMEE And there's more where that came from, but let's just enjoy our food for now. They all laugh and return to their meal, but there's a new dynamic at the table. Ruth and Aimee exchange knowing glances, while David looks at Aimee with a newfound respect and a hint of caution. The conversation moves on, but the experience has left a subtle shift in their interplay. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Later, Ruth pesters Aimee to hypnotize her brother again. Properly this time.

Ruth enters the room with Aimee following behind. The atmosphere is casual, but there's an air of anticipation, especially from Ruth. RUTH (excitedly) David, guess what? Aimee's agreed to show us more of that hypnosis stuff you were so impressed with. David looks up, a mix of curiosity and skepticism on his face. DAVID (raising an eyebrow) Really? And why would she do that? AIMEE (cheerfully) Why not? It's fun, and you seemed to enjoy the experience last time. Plus, Ruth has been begging me to do it again. RUTH (nudging David) Come on, it's just a bit of fun. You're not scared, are you? David chuckles, setting his phone aside. DAVID Scared? No way. Let's see if you can actually hypnotize me properly this time. AIMEE (sitting down opposite David) Alright, David. Just like before, all you have to do is listen to my voice and relax. Let's start by taking a few deep breaths together. David nods and begins to breathe deeply, visibly relaxing. AIMEE (softly) Perfect. Now, focus on the sound of my voice and let everything else fade into the background. With each word I say, allow yourself to feel more and more relaxed. David's eyes begin to flutter as he listens, his body language open and receptive. AIMEE Imagine a wave of relaxation flowing from the top of your head, down to your toes.

David is now in a deep trance, his head slightly bowed, completely focused on Aimee's voice. AIMEE (smiling) David, in this state, you're open to suggestions. When I snap my fingers, you'll wake up feeling refreshed, but you'll also find that whenever Ruth says the word \\"focus,\\" you'll have the irresistible urge to cluck like a chicken for a few seconds. You won't find this strange at all, and you'll forget about it as soon as it happens. Aimee snaps her fingers, and David's eyes open. He looks around, slightly disoriented but alert. DAVID (shaking his head) Wow, that was... deep. I actually feel pretty good. RUTH (grinning) Hey, David, maybe now you can really focus on helping me with my science project. David, without missing a beat, starts to cluck like a chicken. Ruth bursts into laughter, and even David chuckles, not realizing what he's just done. DAVID (laughing) What's so funny? RUTH (teasing) Nothing, just your excellent focus. David clucks again, still oblivious to his actions, and the room fills with laughter. AIMEE (pleased) See? Just a harmless bit of fun. David looks at Aimee, still unaware of the suggestion but feeling a strange sense of camaraderie. DAVID (smiling) Alright, Aimee, I'll give it to you. That's some talent you've got there. RUTH (still laughing) Oh, this is going to be great.

It was 2221. Akari and Haruto were small children. Akari turned 7 years old. Haruto was a year older than Akari. It was the most ordinary summer morning. Akari’s parents went on combat duty to the military base of the Tokyo Self-Defense Forces of Japan. Haruto’s parents had been at the Tokyo research center since the morning. Akari, as usual, sat at home and was bored. She remembered that on that day Haruto was also home alone. She slowly got ready and went to visit Haruto’s house. Akari was like a younger sister for Haruto and he loved and doted on her very much. Akari finally reached Haruto’s house and rang the doorbell. Haruto was very happy to see Akari. They spent the whole day playing and swimming in the pool together. As evening approached, Akari suggested walking around Tokyo in the evening and looking into the park nearby. Akari and Haruto wandered through the beautiful and charming park, enjoying the beautiful views of evening nature and the beautiful sky in which the first stars appeared. Akari and Haruto sat on the bench enjoying the small fresh breeze that blew. Akari rested her head on Haruto’s shoulder and thanked him for a wonderful day. Haruto responded by saying that he should thank Akari, who dispelled his boredom with her affectionate smile. Haruto stroked Akari’s hair and said that fate gave him such a wonderful younger sister, even though they are not brother and sister at all. Akari began to yawn slightly and rub her sleepy eyes. At that moment, the bracelet on Akari’s hand vibrated. A projection of the screen appeared in front of Akari on which she saw an incoming call and pressed the button that was highlighted on the projection. It was her mother calling. She asked if she was okay.","output":"Prologue: A World Enwoven Tokyo, 2221—a city where magic and machinery blended seamlessly, where mythical creatures roamed among humans, and where children like Akari and Haruto found their days filled with the ordinary and the extraordinary in equal measure. Akari, with her raven hair that shimmered like a crow’s feather in the sunlight, just turned seven. Her family hailed from a long line of distinguished soldiers, and her parents were no exception; they were off again to the military base of the Tokyo Self-Defense Forces, serving with honor in a realm where skirmishes with fantastical beasts were just another part of the daily routine. Haruto, on the other hand, was a brilliant spark of eight years. His parents, leading researchers at the Tokyo research center, embraced the dawn each day to unravel the mysteries of an ever-changing universe—a universe where the impossible was just science yet to be understood. On what seemed the most ordinary summer morning, in a house that hummed with the echoes of her parents' absence, Akari was stirred by the stillness. The girl was no stranger to solitude, but the walls of her home wearied her with their silent stories. She recalled that, just a few streets over, her friend Haruto was king of his own quiet castle. Motivated by the thought of his company, Akari adorned herself in bravery and excitement, her little heart thumping in her chest as she set off to embark on the day's unknown adventures. Haruto, to her, was the brother she never had, an anchor in the ever-whirling sea of life. She reached his domain and pressed the doorbell. Its chime was like the opening note of their symphony of mischief and mirth. Haruto's face lit up with the joy of a thousand suns, warming the corridor as he welcomed his favorite person into his home. Together, they orchestrated a symphony of splashes within the crystal waters of Haruto’s pool, battled with toy swords woven from stardust and dragon scales, and delved into realms painted in the pages of ancient books that whispered tales of heroes and hearts. As twilight embraced the city, Akari, a spark of a thought dancing in her eyes, beckoned Haruto to wander the illuminated cobblestone paths of Tokyo, to breathe in the life of an evening painted in shades of rose and gold. The nearby park, a canvas of nature's finest work, felt like another world—a serene escape from the symphony of the city. They settled on a bench, its wooden frame worn smooth from the countless tales it had supported. Haruto was the silent sentinel beside her, steadfast and sure. Akari nestled her head upon his shoulder. \\"Thank you for a beautiful day,\\" she whispered, her words an exhale of contentment. Haruto smiled, his gaze tender with a love born not of blood, but of spirit. \\"I should be the one thanking you, Akari. You've shattered the silence with your laughter.\\" His hand brushed through her hair, a gesture protective and fond. As the first stars blinked into existence above them, Akari’s eyes grew heavy with the weight of spent energy and the magic of countless memories made. In the midst of a yawn, her wrist tingled. Startled, she glanced down at the bracelet—a gift from her parents, more than it seemed—a screen projected itself, an ethereal glow against the dimming sky. Akari tapped the highlighted button, her heart quickening as her mother's face materialized amidst the flickering light. \\"Are you okay?\\" her mother's voice came, wrapped in layers of urgency and relief. Akari's sleepiness was swept away by a sudden wind of foreboding, as if their tranquil world had begun to quake from a silent roar, the prelude to a tempest that would test the fabric of their reality. But for now, the park remained still. Unaware that life, as they knew it, was on the cusp of an unfathomable shift."},{"instruction":"Oriole Inc.s books revealed the following data at year end after all adjustments were made: Cash sales 773000 Sales returns (on credit sales) 32000 Allowance for expected credit losses (credit balance) 3000 Credit sales. 513000 Accounts receivable 160000 Oriole estimates the expected rate of credit losses to be 4%. The credit losses for the year were","output":"To calculate the credit losses for the year, we will first need to calculate the expected credit losses based on the estimation provided by Oriole Inc. They estimate the expected rate of credit losses to be 4%. This percentage will be applied to the credit sales to determine the amount of loss they expect to incur. The estimation of expected credit losses is applied to credit sales because cash sales would not have any associated credit risk; only credit sales might result in customers not paying their receivables. First, calculate the expected credit losses based on the credit sales: Estimated Credit Losses = Credit Sales * Estimated Rate of Credit Losses = 513,000 * 4% = 513,000 * 0.04 = 20,520 Now, we have an estimated credit loss of 20,520 for the year based on credit sales. Next, we need to compare this estimation with the current allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for expected credit losses is an account that reflects the company's estimate of potential future credit losses. The information provided indicates there's already a credit balance of 3,000 in the allowance account which is meant to cover anticipated losses from receivables. To adjust the allowance account to the new estimate, the difference between the current allowance balance and the estimated credit losses needs to be found. Depending on whether the estimated losses are greater or lesser than the existing allowance, Oriole Inc. would record a provision for credit losses (increasing the allowance) or a recovery (decreasing the allowance). In this case, with expected credit losses of 20,520 and a current allowance of 3,000, Oriole Inc. needs to increase the allowance by: 20,520 (new estimate) - 3,000 (existing balance) = 17,520 This amount, 17,520, is what Oriole Inc. would record as credit losses for the year to adjust the allowance for expected credit losses to the estimated amount. This number represents the change in the allowance, not actual realized credit losses. Actual losses would be recorded when they occur and would reduce both the allowance account and the accounts receivable."},{"instruction":"Oriole Inc.s books revealed the following data at year end after all adjustments were made: Cash sales 773000 Sales returns (on credit sales) 32000 Allowance for expected credit losses (credit balance) 3000 Credit sales. 513000 Accounts receivable 160000 Oriole estimates the expected rate of credit losses to be 4%.

The expected credit losses are based on the estimated rate of credit losses (4%) applied to credit sales, unless the company adjusts its allowance based on other factors such as historical data or accounts receivable aging. Here’s how you would calculate it: 1. Calculate the expected credit losses for the year: Expected Credit Losses = Credit Sales x Expected Credit Loss Rate Expected Credit Losses = 513,000 x 4% Expected Credit Losses = 20,520 2. Now, since the company already had an existing credit balance in their Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account, we need to see if we need to increase or decrease it based on the new expectation: If the existing Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account has a credit balance of 3,000 and the estimated credit losses are 20,520, we need to adjust this account so that it matches the new estimate at the end of the year. 3. Adjust the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses to reflect the expected credit losses of 20,520. Since there is already a credit balance of 3,000, we need to increase the allowance by the difference: Needed adjustment = Expected Credit Losses - Existing Allowance Balance Needed adjustment = 20,520 - 3,000 Needed adjustment = 17,520 This 17,520 would be the amount recognized in the income statement under credit losses expense for the year, assuming that the existing allowance was solely for the credit sales of the current year and not influenced by other adjustments or write-offs of bad debts from previous periods. If there were such influences, a further analysis of movements in the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account would be needed."},{"instruction":"Oriole Inc.s books revealed the following data at year end after all adjustments were made: Cash sales 773000 Sales returns (on credit sales) 32000 Allowance for expected credit losses (credit balance) 3000 Credit sales. 513000 Accounts receivable 160000 Oriole estimates the expected rate of credit losses to be 4%. The credit losses for the year were","output":"To determine the credit losses for the year, we can calculate the adjustment needed for the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account. At the beginning of the period, there was a credit balance of 3,000 in the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account. Oriole Inc. estimates that the rate of credit losses is 4% of credit sales. So, we'd expect the ending balance in the allowance account to be 4% of the ending accounts receivable, since allowance accounts are typically maintained as a percentage of the accounts receivable balance. The ending balance needed in the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account would be: = 4% of Accounts Receivable = 4% of 160,000 = 0.04 * 160,000 = 6,400 Now we compare what we should have in the allowance account to what we currently have to determine the adjustment needed: Required ending balance in allowance account: 6,400 Current balance in allowance account: 3,000 (credit) Adjustment needed: = Required ending balance - Current balance = 6,400 - 3,000 = 3,400 So, Oriole Inc. needs to record additional credit losses of 3,400 for the year to adjust the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account to the proper ending balance based on their estimation. Keep in mind that this 3,400 does not necessarily represent actual credit losses that have occurred during the year, but rather an adjustment to the allowance to account for expected future credit losses on the current accounts receivable balance. Actual credit losses would be determined when specific debts are determined to be uncollectible and are written off."},{"instruction":"write a write a 4000 word essay in great detail given these context and the previous one started with an opening in the present where jungkook about his past the scene changes with the camera panning to the tv in the dark place where the screen is emitting light where jungkook's family disowned and how they are ashamed of their son when he left the band in on july 2018 then the channel shifts where Jungkook's mom is begging him to contact him to the cameras his father wants to meet his grandsons and how they were wrong . with his brother just standing silently with a solemn look on his face. the scene shifts again to jungkook's current resident Marco asks him how he always thought about bts which he has conflicted reasons how he still think about them and how his children know the truth the camera pans again to a scene to therapy session for jungkook 12/2018 cause he was scared of cameras' and it shows his reaction how traumatized he is of them and is trying to hide behind Yugyeom crying asking not to let the paparazzi take picture Not to let mr.A see him like this or he'll be punished he doesn't want to be punished He's a good boy He's a good boy.

This essay delves into the emotional rollercoaster experienced by Jungkook, beginning with his family's disownment and their public condemnation of his decision to leave the band in July 2018. The narrative encompasses therapy sessions, legal confrontations, and the revelation of a dark secret, shedding light on the immense pressure and trauma Jungkook endured. Family Betrayal and the Strains of Fame: The scene changes to a dark room where a television screen emits an eerie glow. The camera pans to the TV, showcasing a news segment in which Jungkook's family disowns him, expressing their shame and disappointment following his departure from BTS. A new channel then emerges, depicting Jungkook's mother desperately begging him to contact his family, while his father yearns to meet his grandsons. Standing silently with a solemn expression, Jungkook's brother adds further weight to the familial strain. Marco's Intriguing Question: The camera shifts once again, this time focusing on Jungkook's current residence. Marco, a curious individual, queries Jungkook about his reflections on BTS, to which Jungkook shares his conflicted thoughts. He reflects on the impact the band had on his life and how his children have come to learn the truth about his struggles. A Traumatizing Therapy Session: Cutting to a therapy session in December 2018, the film captures Jungkook's deep-seated fear of cameras. His traumatized state is vividly portrayed as he seeks refuge behind Yugyeom, sobbing and pleading for protection from the paparazzi. He confesses his fear of being punished, desperate not to be seen in this vulnerable state. Yugyeom kindly reassures him, reminding him that he is indeed a good person. Unraveling the Past: Zooming in on Jungkook's arms, we notice the popping veins, their color turning grayish. Jungkook's therapist inquires about the reason behind his decision to seek therapy. The narrative reveals that in 2015, Jungkook was coerced by a board member who threatened his future with BTS. Forced to comply with their demands, Jungkook used his voice to conceal this harrowing experience. The Slave Agreement: The camera shifts towards an official legal office in Korea, where Jungkook's contract is examined. The lawyer's appalled reaction highlights the oppressive nature of the contract, describing it as a \\"torture contract.\\" The agreement is shown to exploit Jungkook's vulnerability, emphasizing the severe power imbalance between the two parties involved. Jungkook's Playboy Past: Traveling back in time, the scene exposes Jungkook's wild past and flirtatious behavior. The camera captures his transformation and questions Marco's curiosity about the authenticity of Jungkook's former personality. Jungkook candidly reveals that his actions were a result of suppressants and orders from Mr. A, whom he was obligated to obey. Omega Association and Safe Houses: The narrative shifts to an interview with the head of the Protection of the Omega Association, shedding light on the organization's knowledge of Jungkook's circumstances. They express support for him, revealing that he has sought refuge in one of their safe houses abroad. Their non-disclosure of Jungkook's location to the political party reflects the intricate web of entities and rules governing the Omega Association's actions. Jungkook's Decision to Share: Cutting back to Jungkook staring out of the window, Marco asks him if he is comfortable sharing his story. Jungkook affirms his readiness, suggesting that he has come to terms with reliving the painful memories. The poignant musical backdrop sets the stage for the emotionally charged journey ahead. The Tape Revelation: The story takes a dramatic turn as a tape from July 2018 emerges. Jungkook explains that a board member possesses the footage but agreed to release only the audio portion per his request. The heart-wrenching exchange exposes a confrontation between Jungkook and the board member, where he fights for his place in the group, desperately requesting to be allowed to stay. Overwhelmed with emotion, Jungkook's cries become the only sound heard as the door slams shut. Conclusion: Jungkook's story encapsulates the toll that fame, exploitation, and trauma can take on an individual. As he bares his soul, the audience is left contemplating the price one pays for success and the strength it takes to heal. Jungkook's journey serves as a testament to resilience and the power of sharing one's truth, ultimately inspiring others to confront their own demons and find solace in their authenticity."},{"instruction":"What if Naruto was the first Male in Avalice from Freedom planet","output":"If Naruto was the first male character in Avalice from Freedom Planet, it would bring an interesting dynamic to the world and its existing characters.

The credit losses for the year were","output":"To calculate the credit losses for the year, we'd typically look at the changes in the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account and the write-offs related to accounts receivable. However, we're provided with an estimate rate for credit losses and the credit sales amount. Let's proceed with the information given. The estimated rate of credit losses is 4%. This rate will be applied to credit sales to estimate the expected credit losses for the year. Credit Sales: 513,000 The estimated credit losses at a rate of 4% would be: 513,000 * 0.04 = 20,520 However, this amount is the initial estimate of credit losses for the year. To determine the actual adjustment to the allowance for expected credit losses, we also need to take into account the existing balance in the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account which is a credit balance of 3,000. But since we do not have data on the write-offs that have occurred during the year, we cannot accurately determine the exact amount that should be added to the allowance account to arrive at the estimated credit losses. If we were to assume that there were no write-offs during the year (which is an unlikely scenario in reality), then the adjustment needed in the allowance account would be the difference between the estimated credit losses and the beginning balance in the allowance for expected credit losses account: 20,520 (estimated credit losses) - 3,000 (existing allowance) = 17,520 (needed adjustment) Again, this amount would only be correct under the assumption of no write-offs, which is typically not the case. In practice, the credit losses for the year would include the 17,520 increase in the allowance plus any actual write-offs of accounts receivable that were determined to be uncollectible during the year. Without information on the write-offs, we cannot provide the total credit losses for the year. In summary, based solely on the provided data and assuming no write-offs occurred, an additional 17,520 would be recognized in the allowance for credit losses. However, remember that this figure is not complete without considering actual write-offs during the year."},{"instruction":"David (21); university student; thinks he knows a thing or two.

The credit losses for the year were","output":"Based on the information provided, you want to calculate the credit losses for the year. Oriole Inc. has estimated that the expected rate of credit losses is 4%. We use this to estimate the credit losses on the credit sales amount. First, let's summarize the data given: - Cash Sales: 773,000 (These are not relevant for the calculation of credit losses, as they do not involve receivables.) - Credit Sales: 513,000 - Account Receivable: 160,000 - Sales Returns (on credit sales): 32,000 - Allowance for Expected Credit Losses (before adjustment): 3,000 (Credit Balance) - Estimated Rate of Credit Losses: 4% Since sales returns are on credit sales, we should deduct them from the total credit sales to determine the net credit sales: Net Credit Sales = Credit Sales - Sales Returns Net Credit Sales = 513,000 - 32,000 Net Credit Sales = 481,000 Now, we can calculate the expected credit losses using the estimated rate of 4%: Expected Credit Losses = Net Credit Sales * Estimated Rate of Credit Losses Expected Credit Losses = 481,000 * 4% Expected Credit Losses = 19,240 However, since Oriole Inc. has already a credit balance of 3,000 in their Allowance for Expected Credit Losses, we will need to determine if they need to adjust this allowance. If the expected credit losses exceed the existing allowance, an additional expense should be recognized to bring the allowance up to the required level. To do this, we compare the calculated Expected Credit Losses to the existing allowance: Adjustment Needed = Expected Credit Losses - Existing Allowance Adjustment Needed = 19,240 - 3,000 Adjustment Needed = 16,240 Therefore, if the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses account were being adjusted up to the calculated amount, an additional 16,240 would be recognized as a credit loss expense for the year to increase the allowance to 19,240. However, this does not represent the actual losses but rather an adjustment to the allowance account based on the estimate. If you're asking for the actual credit losses realized during the year (i.e., the specific amount written off), this information is not provided in the data above. The actual credit losses would be the amount of Accounts Receivable deemed uncollectible and written off against the allowance during the period, which might differ from the estimated adjustment. For the exact figure of actual credit losses, we would need additional information such as the beginning balance of Accounts Receivable and a breakdown of any write-offs that occurred during the year."},{"instruction":"Write the first chapter of a story. A rude, stubborn, young girl is sent to an all-female re-education centre for deliquents.

It was a place known to many as the Glendale Re-education Centre for Wayward Girls, a last-ditch effort to reform the wildest spirits that society had to offer. But one girl, in particular, was about to discover just how far they were willing to go to break her indomitable spirit. Meet Amelia Forbes, a sixteen-year-old girl with fiery red hair that matched her temperament. She hailed from a small town where mischief was her second nature and obedience was merely a foreign concept. Determined to live life on her own terms, Amelia had no time for rules or expectations. Her rebellious nature had grown like an unyielding weed, leaving a trail of chaos and frustration in her wake. But it was on a stormy evening, as the rain pounded on the roof of her foster home, that Amelia's fate took an unexpected turn. Sarah, her foster mother, having reached her wits' end, made the heart-wrenching decision to send Amelia away to the infamous Glendale Re-education Centre for Wayward Girls. As they drove through the night, the only sounds were the rhythmic pattering of raindrops on the windshield and the occasional sobs escaping Amelia's clenched jaws. She had always prided herself on being a free spirit, but the thought of being confined in an all-female center filled her with dread. Finally, the gates of the re-education center loomed before them; tall, ominous, and foreboding. The rain continued to pour, symbolizing Amelia's own internal storm. Sarah pulled the car to a halt, her voice choked with emotion. \\"Amelia, I hope you find some sense in there. Perhaps they can mold you into a more... agreeable young woman.\\" Rolling her eyes, Amelia sniffed derisively. \\"You know perfectly well I won't bend to their will, Sarah. I'm not some obedient little doll they can fix with a few stern words.\\" Sarah's gaze softened, her touch gentle as she brushed Amelia's cheek. \\"Just promise me you'll try, Amelia. Try to learn from this experience, even if it's just a little.\\" Her stubbornness hardening like steel, Amelia refused to make the promise her foster mother longed to hear. In her mind, she was a force too powerful to be tamed by anyone—a hurricane waiting to unleash her own potential. With a sigh, Sarah handed Amelia a small travel bag, filled with the few belongings she had allowed her to bring. The car door creaked open, and Amelia, with a final defiant look, stepped out into the pouring rain. Her face twisted into a sneer as she marched towards the building, black combat boots splashing through the puddles. Inside, Amelia found herself surrounded by countless girls of all sizes and backgrounds, each with their own rebellious spirit. The rumors had been true; this place wasn't an ordinary re-education center. It was said to be governed by mysterious genetically enhanced women known as ordinators, rumored to be seven feet tall and merciless in their methods. As the girls, drenched and shivering, settled into the cramped entrance area, whispers of \\"foot tickling\\" floated through the air. It seemed absurd to Amelia, but she couldn't help but feel a shiver of apprehension. Were these ordinators really capable of breaking the girls' spirits through such an unconventional means? As if reading Amelia's thoughts, a tall shadow emerged from the dimly lit hallway. She stood seven feet tall, her eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses, and a mischievous grin played across her lips. The rumors had proven to be true—an ordinator, the one and only, had arrived."},{"instruction":"Write the next chapter, as she is processed and stripped of her dignity, she begins to regret it.

The ordinator's tall frame seemed to tower over her, and a shiver ran down her spine as she noticed the glint of mischief in her eyes. The rumors had painted these ordinators as almost mythical beings, but now, faced with one, Amelia couldn't dismiss the doubts creeping into her mind. As the other girls shuffled nervously, the ordinator raised a hand, motioning for silence. Her voice boomed through the room, commanding attention. \\"Welcome, girls, to the Glendale Re-education Centre for Wayward Souls. I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and it is my duty to guide you through this transformative journey.\\" Amelia's eyes narrowed, and she crossed her arms defiantly. She refused to show any sign of vulnerability. In her heart, though, a small part of her wondered if maybe, just maybe, there was something to be learned from this experience. One by one, the girls were led through a daunting process of initiation. They were made to remove their clothes, surrendering any remnants of their former identities. It was a symbolic stripping of their past transgressions and a reminder that they were starting anew. Amelia felt her pride falter as she stood there, bare and vulnerable, surrounded by strangers. The weight of her defiance seemed to lift slightly, and a sense of regret washed over her. For there, in the midst of these broken and misunderstood girls, she began to understand the gravity of her actions. Ordinator Grace then directed the girls into individual rooms, each furnished only with a small bed, a chair, and a single lamp. As the door closed behind her, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling of being trapped, both physically and emotionally. Days turned into weeks, and Amelia reluctantly engaged in the programs designed to reshape her into a more compliant young woman. The days were filled with counseling sessions, group activities, and lessons meant to instill discipline. She found herself growing closer to some of the girls, understanding their stories and the common thread of defiance that wove between them. But whispers of \\"The Chamber of Tickles\\" lingered, an eerie reminder of the ultimate disciplinary measure. Rumors had circulated about its existence, a room designed solely to break the strongest of spirits. The thought made Amelia's insides churn. One evening, as Amelia walked the dimly lit corridors, she caught sight of a mysterious door tucked away at the far end. It emitted an ominous aura, like a hidden chamber filled with secrets. Curiosity and apprehension tugged at her, urging her to uncover the truth. With a cautious glance around, Amelia approached the door and slowly turned the handle. It creaked open, revealing a room bathed in harsh fluorescent light. The sight froze her in place—there, in the center of the room, was a contraption that resembled a tickling chair. The realization struck her like a thunderbolt. This was the infamous Chamber of Tickles, where disobedience was met with an unconventional punishment. A wave of panic washed over her as the weight of her actions and their consequences settled heavily on her shoulders. Tears welled up in her eyes as she stepped away from the door, her regret reaching its peak. She had been so consumed by her pride, her need for independence, that she had failed to see the value in humility and self-reflection. Now, faced with the ultimate challenge, Amelia had a choice to make. Taking a deep breath, she mustered the dwindling remnants of her once indomitable spirit. She vowed to confront her fear head-on, to find strength within herself, and emerge from the Chamber of Tickles a changed person. Determined to face the consequences of her defiance, Amelia made her way back to her room, ready to embrace the challenges that awaited her. It was time to submit herself to an experience that would test not only her resolve but also her capacity for growth and transformation. Unknown to her, the ticking of the clock marked the moments leading up to her encounter with the mysterious Chamber of Tickles."},{"instruction":"Write the next chapter.

It acts as an intermediary layer between the user and the operating system, translating the user's commands into instructions that the operating system can understand and execute. The shell provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can type commands to perform various tasks such as navigating through directories, managing files, running programs, and configuring system settings. It reads the commands typed by the user, interprets them, and then executes the corresponding operations. There are different types of shells, such as the Bourne shell (sh), the C shell (csh), the Korn shell (ksh), and the popular Bash shell (bash). Each shell has its own set of features and capabilities, but they all serve the purpose of providing a way for users to interact with the operating system. In addition to interpreting commands, the shell also provides features like command history, command editing, script execution, and customization options. It allows users to automate tasks by creating scripts, which are lists of commands that can be executed as a single unit. The shell interacts with the operating system by launching processes, receiving their output, and displaying it to the user. It also manages input and output streams, handles file operations, and provides access to system resources. Overall, the shell serves as a powerful tool for interacting with the operating system and performing a wide range of tasks efficiently and effectively."},{"instruction":"Shell Built-in Commands","output":"Shell built-in commands are commands that are directly included within the shell itself, instead of being separate executable programs.

Однако в различных социальных группах физическое воспитание может иметь разные особенности и подходы. В данном реферате рассмотрим физическое воспитание в среде дворянства и в народном быту. Среди дворянства, физическое воспитание играло важную роль. Дети дворян получали образование, которое включало не только учебу, но и физическую подготовку. Главной целью физического воспитания в этой среде было формирование сильного и здорового организма, способного к долгой жизни и выполнению обязанностей верного слуги государства. Важным элементом физического воспитания в среде дворянства был спорт. Особое внимание уделялось езде, фехтованию, стрельбе из лука и другим рыцарским видам спорта. Военная подготовка считалась неотъемлемой частью физического развития дворянина. Они изучали тактику и навыки боя, учились быть сильными и мужественными. Для достижения этих целей, в российской империи были созданы специальные военные училища и гимназии, где дети дворян получали физическое и военное образование. Они проходили строгую военную дисциплину и тренировки, чтобы стать готовыми к службе в армии или вести дворянскую жизнь соответствующим образом. В народном быту физическое воспитание имеет другие особенности. Здесь нет такого акцента на военные и рыцарские навыки, как в дворянском сословии. Физическое воспитание в народном быту включает различные виды деятельности, связанные с повседневной работой и жизнью. Например, физическая активность в народном быту может быть связана с сельским хозяйством, рыбной ловлей, ремеслами или просто с тяжелым физическим трудом на поле. Все эти виды деятельности требуют от человека физической силы и выносливости. Кроме того, в народном быту физическое воспитание часто связано с национальными традициями и культурой. Так, в некоторых национальностях физическое воспитание может включать народные игры и танцы, которые помогают развивать координацию движений и выносливость. Таким образом, физическое воспитание в среде дворянства и в народном быту имеет свои определенные особенности. В дворянской среде акцент делался на формировании сильного и здорового организма для выполнения служебных обязанностей, в то время как в народном быту акцент делался на различных видах тяжелого физического труда и национальных традициях. Оба подхода имеют свою ценность и способствуют развитию физически здорового и активного общества."},{"instruction":"У меня есть обфускатор JS кода, написанный на питоне, однако при запуске в IDLE Shell у меня появляется ошибка в области функции комментирования.

The credit losses for the year were","output":"To find the credit losses for the year, we need to adjust the allowance for expected credit losses for the current year's expected credit losses. Here's how we can calculate that: First, we find the total expected credit losses for the current level of accounts receivable. Oriole Inc. estimates the expected rate of credit losses to be 4%, so we will apply this rate to credit sales to estimate the total expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on credit sales = Credit sales x Expected rate of credit losses Expected credit losses on credit sales = 513,000 x 4% Expected credit losses on credit sales = 20,520 Now, we compare the expected credit losses with the existing allowance for credit losses: Beginning Allowance for expected credit losses (credit balance) = 3,000 Expected credit losses on credit sales = 20,520 Since we have been provided with the beginning allowance, we need to check if the ending allowance is equal to the expected credit losses for the year or if an adjustment is required. If the current allowance for credit losses (3,000) is less than the expected credit losses for the year (20,520), we would need to recognize an additional expense to increase the allowance to the expected level. However, if the current allowance already equals or exceeds the amount of expected credit losses, then no additional expense is recognized. Given the data, an additional expense of 17,520 (20,520 expected - 3,000 current) would likely be recognized to increase the allowance to the expected level of 20,520, representing the credit losses for the year. Please note, this calculation assumes that the allowance for expected credit losses is being adjusted solely based on the estimated credit losses on credit sales. If the actual credit losses exceeded the allowance, additional losses may be recognized. Also, since sales returns have been mentioned, if the sales returns are related to credit sales, they would typically be deducted from credit sales before calculating the expected credit losses, unless the returns have already resulted in a reduction of accounts receivable. However, based on the information given, it seems we are asked to apply the expected loss rate directly to the total credit sales."},{"instruction":"Note: This is an alternate universe and not in this one, Alternate universes are cool Nickelodeon have been trialing the introduction of presenters (like CBBC) This is to take effect when the \\"We Make Fun\\" branding replaces the current \\"Blob\\" branding.

People are milling around with food trays, chatting, and sitting at various tables. DAVID is sitting at a table, absorbed in his phone, occasionally glancing around with an air of confident superiority. RUTH, wearing jeans and flip-flops, approaches the table with AIMEE, who is decked out entirely in black. AIMEE carries an air of mystery about her.* DAVID: [Looks up and sees RUTH] Hey, kiddo. Shopping or just terrorizing the mall with your presence? RUTH: [Grinning] Oh, you know, a bit of both. It’s always fun to annoy you. Besides, today I brought reinforcements. This is my friend Aimee. DAVID: [Nods at AIMEE] Charmed, I'm sure. AIMEE: [Smiling slyly, shaking DAVID’s hand] Hi David, nice to finally meet you. Ruth talks about you a lot. You're the 'big brain' of the family, huh? DAVID: [Laughs, a bit flattered] Well, I wouldn't say that, but I do like to keep informed. *The three of them sit down, AIMEE strategically across from DAVID. She maintains a steady gaze with a hint of a smile, subtly assessing DAVID.* AIMEE: I can appreciate that. Knowledge is power, after all. But it's also about understanding the mind, don't you think? DAVID: Sure, psychology is fascinating. But I prefer tangible facts and figures, stuff you can quantify, you know? *AIMEE leans back in her chair slightly and nods thoughtfully. She raises her hand with black polished nails and starts gesturing gently as she speaks.* AIMEE: Facts and figures are safe, I agree. But consider hypnosis – it’s all about the subtleties of the mind. It’s interesting because it’s not just black and white. There's this vast gray area. In fact, the mind is rather... malleable. *DAVID looks intrigued but skeptical. AIMEE continues her fluid hand movements, which occasionally catch the light. RUTH is watching, intrigued by AIMEE’s confidence.* DAVID: Hypnosis? That's just stage trickery, isn't it? I mean, I've read about it, but it always seemed kind of...pseudo-scientific to me. AIMEE: [Softly chuckling, never breaking eye contact] I used to think the same. The mind, however, can play incredible tricks on us. You'd be surprised at how easy it is to get lost in a thought or a story. Like when you're reading a really good book, and the world around you just fades away. *DAVID nods, momentarily lulled by AIMEE's voice and rhythmic gestures.* AIMEE: It's a bit like... have you ever driven home and not remembered the journey? Your mind was elsewhere, and it's as if you were on autopilot. That's a form of trance. DAVID: [Now more relaxed, nods] Yeah, that's happened before. Weird, when you think about it. *AIMEE leans forward slightly, lowering her voice to a more compelling tone.* AIMEE: It is. Really, David, our brains do that all the time, fractionating between different levels of focus and awareness. You can be highly aware one moment... [she claps her hands] and then [claps softly] just drift off the next, riding the ebb and flow of your own consciousness. *DAVID blinks slowly, his body language now more open, his skepticism waning as he's drawn into AIMEE's words and the rhythm of her claps.* RUTH: [Watching, amused] Aimee's been checking out this hypnosis stuff. She's pretty good. *AIMEE smiles at RUTH, then redirects her steady gaze back to DAVID.* AIMEE: It's fascinating, really. Imagine just following my voice, allowing yourself to consider this possibility. Not because you believe in it, but because it's... interesting to explore. What if you could just let go, even if just for a moment, and enter a space where your mind can be free to roam, to imagine, to just... relax. *DAVID's eyes are now following AIMEE’s gestures, almost as if he can’t help but be drawn in. His breathing has visibly slowed.* DAVID: [His voice softer] I guess... there’s no harm in just... considering possibilities. AIMEE: Exactly. Just considering how it would feel to take a break from knowing it all, to just... rest your mind and, uh... [She pauses, giving DAVID a gentle, suggestive look] let someone else guide you for a change. *DAVID's eyes are now slightly glazed, his usual self-assured posture replaced by a more subdued, relaxed one.* AIMEE: [Whispers, more to DAVID's subconscious now] So, how about we... take a deep breath in... [she inhales, exaggerating the action and holds it for a moment, waiting for DAVID to mimic her, then slowly exhales] and out. And just let yourself focus on the sound of my voice... and these simple claps... [claps softly twice] drifting deeper with each sound. *DAVID's eyes are half-lidded, his focus entirely on AIMEE.* AIMEE: [Continuing, her voice steady and hypnotic] That's it, just riding that gentle wave... drifting in... and drifting out... knowing you can return to full awareness whenever you wish, but for now, it's so nice to just... let go. *DAVID's head begins to bow very slightly, his resistance visibly dissolving under the rhythmic cadence of AIMEE's voice and clap.* AIMEE: [With a soft smile] And in a moment, when you come back to us, you'll feel refreshed, calm, and maybe even a little surprised at how relaxed you've become. Ready to wake up, David? *AIMEE claps her hands loudly, breaking the trance-like state. DAVID’s head jerks up, a look of bewilderment on his face.* DAVID: [Blinking, regaining composure] What... was that? RUTH: [Laughs, clapping her hands] You just got schooled by Aimee, big bro! AIMEE: [Smiling widely] Just a demonstration. Imagine what you could learn if you were open to it. *DAVID looks at AIMEE with newfound respect and a tad of embarrassment.* DAVID: I... might have underestimated hypnosis. And you, Aimee. *DAVID shakes his head, half-smiling, amazed by the experience.* AIMEE: Well, now you've got a new fact to add to your collection. The mind is an extraordinary thing. *The three laugh, and the atmosphere lightens as they continue to chat, with DAVID a little less sure of his \\"know-it-all\\" status and a bit more in awe of the mysteries of the mind.* *Fade out.*"},{"instruction":"Chapter 1: The Unruly Arrival Storm clouds cascaded over the horizon, casting a sinister shadow over the decrepit building that loomed ahead. It was a place known to many as the Glendale Re-education Centre for Wayward Girls, a last-ditch effort to reform the wildest spirits that society had to offer. But one girl, in particular, was about to discover just how far they were willing to go to break her indomitable spirit. Meet Amelia Forbes, an 18-year-old girl with fiery red hair that matched her temperament. She hailed from a small town where mischief was her second nature and obedience was merely a foreign concept. Determined to live life on her own terms, Amelia had no time for rules or expectations. Her rebellious nature had grown like an unyielding weed, leaving a trail of chaos and frustration in her wake. But it was on a stormy evening, as the rain pounded on the roof of her foster home, that Amelia’s fate took an unexpected turn. Sarah, her foster mother, having reached her wits’ end, made the heart-wrenching decision to send Amelia away to the infamous Glendale Re-education Centre for Wayward Girls. As they drove through the night, the only sounds were the rhythmic pattering of raindrops on the windshield and the occasional sobs escaping Amelia’s clenched jaws. She had always prided herself on being a free spirit, but the thought of being confined in an all-female center filled her with dread. Finally, the gates of the re-education center loomed before them; tall, ominous, and foreboding. The rain continued to pour, symbolizing Amelia’s own internal storm. Sarah pulled the car to a halt, her voice choked with emotion. “Amelia, I hope you find some sense in there. Perhaps they can mold you into a more… agreeable young woman.” Rolling her eyes, Amelia sniffed derisively. “You know perfectly well I won’t bend to their will, Sarah. I’m not some obedient little doll they can fix with a few stern words.” Sarah’s gaze softened, her touch gentle as she brushed Amelia’s cheek. “Just promise me you’ll try, Amelia. Try to learn from this experience, even if it’s just a little.” Her stubbornness hardening like steel, Amelia refused to make the promise her foster mother longed to hear. In her mind, she was a force too powerful to be tamed by anyone—a hurricane waiting to unleash her own potential. With a sigh, Sarah handed Amelia a small travel bag, filled with the few belongings she had allowed her to bring. The car door creaked open, and Amelia, with a final defiant look, stepped out into the pouring rain. Her face twisted into a sneer as she marched towards the building, black combat boots splashing through the puddles. Inside, Amelia found herself surrounded by countless girls of all sizes and backgrounds, each with their own rebellious spirit. The rumors had been true; this place wasn’t an ordinary re-education center. It was said to be governed by mysterious genetically enhanced women known as ordinators, rumored to be seven feet tall and merciless in their methods. As the girls, drenched and shivering, settled into the cramped entrance area, whispers of “foot tickling” floated through the air. It seemed absurd to Amelia, but she couldn’t help but feel a shiver of apprehension. Were these ordinators really capable of breaking the girls’ spirits through such an unconventional means? As if reading Amelia’s thoughts, a tall shadow emerged from the dimly lit hallway. She stood seven feet tall, her eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses, and a mischievous grin played across her lips. The rumors had proven to be true—an ordinator, the one and only, had arrived. Write the next chapter, as she is processed and stripped of her dignity, she begins to regret it. It must end with her facing her tickle chamber.","output":"Chapter 2: The Tickle Chamber Amelia watched in trepidation as the ordinator made her way through the crowd of girls, her presence commanding attention and respect. The other girls seemed to shrink in her presence, their rebellious spirits temporarily subdued. The ordinator's name was Victoria, and she exuded an air of authority that both intrigued and intimidated Amelia. Her uniform distinguished her from the other girls, clad in a fitted black suit that hugged her imposing figure. Amelia couldn't help but notice the ornate insignia on her lapel—a silver thunderbolt, symbolizing the power and control she possessed. Victoria's eyes seemed to bore into Amelia's soul as she approached her, her grin widening. \\"Amelia Forbes, isn't it?\\" she asked, her voice laced with a mixture of amusement and authority. Amelia nodded, her gaze never wavering from Victoria's sunglasses. She had heard tales of the ordinator's ability to break even the strongest spirits, and she couldn't help but feel a flicker of regret for her defiance. \\"No need to worry, my dear,\\" Victoria said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \\"We'll have plenty of opportunities to test your indomitable spirit.\\" Amelia suppressed a gulp, her instincts telling her that she had bitten off more than she could chew. The rumors of the ordinator's methods had only scratched the surface, and the realization sank deep into her bones. With a simple wave of Victoria's hand, the girls were herded forward, each one undergoing a downcast ritual of processing. Amelia's heart raced as she followed suit, her trepidation growing with each step closer to her impending fate. One by one, the girls were stripped of their dignity and individuality. Personal belongings were confiscated, leaving them with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Amelia watched as her cherished leather jacket and combat boots were tossed into a pile, the symbol of her defiance reduced to nothing. As they were led into a dimly lit room, fear gnawed at Amelia's core. The room was dominated by a large metal contraption—a tickle chamber. The lights were dim, casting eerie shadows across the walls, heightening the sense of foreboding. Amelia's heart pounded in her chest as she was strapped into the chamber, her limbs restrained, leaving her vulnerable. Panic coursed through her veins as she realized the full extent of her predicament. Victoria stepped forward, her grin widening. \\"Amelia Forbes, it's time to face your greatest fear,\\" she whispered. Before Amelia could react, Victoria's fingers danced along her sides, eliciting a burst of laughter that echoed through the chamber. The ticklish sensation overpowered Amelia's senses, forcing her to confront her vulnerability with every uncontrollable giggle that escaped her lips. As her laughter filled the chamber, Amelia's regret amplified. She realized that her defiance had led her to this point, where she was stripped of her power and reduced to a helpless victim. In her quest for independence, she had unwittingly traded her freedom for a different kind of confinement. But amidst her regret, a flicker of determination burned within her. She refused to let this defeat define her. As Victoria's fingers continued their relentless assault, Amelia clenched her teeth, vowing to regain control over her destiny. With every ticklish sensation, Amelia's resolve grew stronger. She would not be broken. She would conquer the tickle chamber and emerge stronger than ever before.

A função librosa.feature.mfcc tem parâmetros padrão pré-definidos para caso eles não sejam passados explicitamente pelo usuário. Para a versão do librosa existente até a data do meu conhecimento (2023), os valores padrão são: - n_fft: 2048 – Esse é o número de amostras por frame para FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). A FFT é usada internamente para computar o espectrograma do sinal de áudio, a partir do qual são extraídos os MFCCs. - hop_length: 512 – Este valor indica o número de amostras entre início de frames sucessivos. Comumente, hop_length é definido como 1/4 do n_fft, ou seja, 2048 / 4 = 512 para o valor padrão de n_fft. Portanto, na primeira abordagem, mesmo sem explicitar os valores de n_fft e hop_length, a função librosa.feature.mfcc() usou n_fft=2048 e hop_length=512 por padrão. Na segunda abordagem, você está permitindo a configuração desses parâmetros manualmente. Se o hop_length não for fornecido, o script usa metade de n_fft como padrão, que é um valor comum, mas diferente do valor padrão que librosa usa se o parâmetro não for fornecido (n_fft / 4). Então, a principal diferença entre as duas abordagens é que na segunda você tem controle sobre esses parâmetros e pode definí-los de acordo com as necessidades do seu projeto ou experimento. Isso pode ser especialmente útil se você estiver ajustando a resolução dos MFCCs para casos específicos de uso ou otimizando o processo para uma determinada aplicação. Resumindo, entre as duas abordagens, só mudou o valor de n_mfcc de 20 para 13? Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior. Vamos esclarecer a diferença entre as duas abordagens fornecidas originalmente para o cálculo dos coeficientes cepstrais de frequência mel (MFCCs). Na primeira abordagem: def extract_mfcc(audio, sample_rate): # Extrair MFCCs mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13) return mfccs.T # Transposta para alinhar frames como linhas Você não mencionou se n_mfcc estava originalmente definido como 20, mas no código apresentado, n_mfcc está definido como 13 e não são fornecidos explicitamente os parâmetros n_fft e hop_length. Assim, librosa usa os valores padrão: n_fft=2048 e hop_length=512. Na segunda abordagem: def extract_mfcc(audio, sample_rate, n_mfcc=13, n_fft=2048, hop_length=None","output":"): # Se hop_length não for fornecido, usa metade de n_fft como padrão if hop_length is None: hop_length = n_fft // 2 # Extrair MFCCs com parâmetros configuráveis mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=n_mfcc, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length) return mfccs.T # Transposta para alinhar frames como linhas Na segunda abordagem, você está permitindo que o usuário do script especifique os parâmetros \`n_mfcc\`, \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\` ao chamar a função \`extract_mfcc\`. Se o parâmetro \`hop_length\` não for fornecido, o script usa um valor padrão que é metade do \`n_fft\` (ou seja, \`n_fft // 2\`), o que pode ser diferente do valor padrão de 512 que a biblioteca librosa usa se \`hop_length\` não for especificado. Isso significa que na segunda abordagem há maior flexibilidade, pois os parâmetros podem ser ajustados de acordo com a necessidade do usuário, enquanto que na primeira abordagem os parâmetros ficam com os valores padrão da biblioteca librosa. Vale salientar que o valor de \`n_mfcc\` permaneceu como 13 em ambas as abordagens no código que você forneceu. Não houve indicação de que, em alguma das abordagens, o valor de \`n_mfcc\` estava definido como 20. Se houve alguma alteração no número de coeficientes MFCCs entre as duas abordagens (de 20 para 13, por exemplo), você teria que ajustar o valor de \`n_mfcc\` na chamada da função \`extract_mfcc\` de acordo com suas necessidades. Essa mudança no número de coeficientes MFCCs pode afetar a resolução dos dados extraídos, influenciando a eficácia da caracterização dos áudios para tarefas como reconhecimento de fala ou classificação de sons."},{"instruction":"Os valores mais indicados para comparar diferenças de som relacionadas com a voz da mesma pessoa pelo que lhe são n_mfcc=13, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512 Estás de acordo com isto? Não é necessário considerar outros parâmetros com outros valores","output":"Os valores que você indicou - \`n_mfcc=13\`, \`n_fft=2048\`, \`hop_length=512\` - são bastante típicos em aplicações de processamento de sinal de áudio, especialmente na análise de voz. Eles são usados frequentemente porque fornecem uma boa representação do conteúdo espectral do sinal de áudio, capturando informações suficientes para representar as características distintas da fala humana. - \`n_mfcc=13\`: Este valor é comum na literatura e prática de reconhecimento de voz. Os primeiros 13 MFCCs geralmente capturam as informações mais relevantes sobre o envelope espectral e são úteis para muitas tarefas de processamento de voz. - \`n_fft=2048\`: Um tamanho de janela comumente utilizado para análise de áudio, que determina a resolução do espectrograma resultante. Um maior \`n_fft\` pode aumentar a resolução em frequência ao custo de diminuir a resolução temporal, enquanto um \`n_fft\` menor fará o oposto. - \`hop_length=512\`: Define o salto entre cada quadro do MFCC. Um valor de \`hop_length\` de 512 é um equilíbrio padrão que oferece uma boa sobreposição de frames e uma boa resolução temporal. A escolha desses parâmetros pode ser bem adequada para muitas aplicações de análise de voz. No entanto, ainda existem outras considerações que podem afetar a escolha ideal desses parâmetros dependendo do contexto específico: - A duração dos trechos de áudio a serem analisados e a necessidade de resolução temporal: para áudios mais curtos ou quando uma maior resolução temporal é necessária, pode ser benéfico ajustar o \`n_fft\` e o \`hop_length\`. - A taxa de amostragem do áudio: a escolha do \`n_fft\` e do \`hop_length\` também pode depender da taxa de amostragem do áudio que está sendo analisado. Ao comparar diferenças na voz da mesma pessoa, em geral, você quer poder detectar pequenas variações nas características da fala. Portanto, os valores padrão podem ser um bom ponto de partida. No entanto, se você descobrir que não está obtendo os resultados desejados, pode ser necessário ajustar esses parâmetros ou considerar a inclusão de deltas (derivadas de primeira e segunda ordem dos MFCCs) para capturar informações dinâmicas da fala, ou mesmo explorar parâmetros adicionais ou técnicas diferentes. Se os resultados ainda não forem satisfatórios, pode ser necessário uma análise mais aprofundada que poderia incluir outros aspectos como a normalização do áudio, redução de ruído, enfatização de pré-ênfase, e experimentar diferentes métodos de cálculo da distância entre os vetores de características extraídos."},{"instruction":"Um maior n_fft pode aumentar a resolução em frequência ao custo de diminuir a resolução temporal, enquanto um n_fft menor fará o oposto, não percebi interessam-me Audios curdos é para análise de comandos portanto só uma palavra \\"A duração dos trechos de áudio a serem analisados e a necessidade de resolução temporal: para áudios mais curtos \\"","output":"Vamos esclarecer o conceito de resolução em frequência e temporal com relação ao parâmetro \`n_fft\` na transformada de Fourier e como isto pode influenciar a análise de comandos de voz de curta duração. Resolução em frequência e resolução temporal são termos que descrevem quão bem você pode distinguir eventos no domínio da frequência e no domínio do tempo, respectivamente, ao analisar um sinal de áudio. - **Resolução em frequência**: É a capacidade de distinguir duas frequências próximas em um sinal. Um \`n_fft\` maior resulta em uma melhor resolução em frequência porque mais pontos são usados na Transformada de Fourier, o que permite diferenciar componentes de frequência que estão mais próximos um do outro. - **Resolução temporal**: É a capacidade de diferenciar eventos que ocorrem em momentos próximos. Um \`n_fft\` menor resulta em uma melhor resolução temporal porque menos pontos são considerados por cada frame (segmento do sinal) analisado e, por isso, eventos curtos no tempo são mais facilmente diferenciados. Quando você tem áudios curtos que consistem em apenas uma palavra ou um comando rápido, a resolução temporal torna-se uma consideração importante porque você precisa capturar transientes rápidos e mudanças ao longo do tempo no sinal de fala. Se você usar um \`n_fft\` muito grande, cada frame (segmento analisado da Transformada de Fourier) cobrirá uma porção maior do sinal de áudio e, portanto, poderá \\"borrar\\" transientes rápidos ou alterações temporais. No caso específico da análise de comandos de voz de uma única palavra ou de curta duração, um \`n_fft\` um pouco menor do que 2048 pode ser experimentado para ver se ele oferece melhores resultados ao identificar as características temporais rápidas presentes em tais comandos. Você pode começar com 1024, por exemplo, que ainda dá uma boa resolução em frequência, mas com um ganho na resolução temporal. Da mesma forma, ajustar o \`hop_length\` para valores menores pode aumentar ainda mais a resolução temporal, permitindo que a análise capte de maneira mais granular as mudanças rápidas que ocorrem durante a fala. Vale destacar que qualquer ajuste feito em \`n_fft\` e \`hop_length\` modifica a forma como os MFCCs são calculados, o que por sua vez pode afetar como os comandos de voz são representados e reconhecidos pelo seu sistema. Ajustes nesses parâmetros podem exigir novos treinamentos ou ajustes adicionais em sistemas de reconhecimento de voz ou classificação de comandos."},{"instruction":"Oriole Inc.s books revealed the following data at year end after all adjustments were made: Cash sales 773000 Sales returns (on credit sales) 32000 Allowance for expected credit losses (credit balance) 3000 Credit sales. 513000 Accounts receivable 160000 Oriole estimates the expected rate of credit losses to be 4%.

You can achieve your fitness goals without worrying about the typical discomfort associated with high-impact exercises. Apart from the physical benefits, swimming is an exceptional stress reliever. The repetitive motion and the soothing properties of water provide a unique opportunity for relaxation. Taking a dip in the pool allows you to unwind, release tension, and promote mental well-being. Swimming also presents a social and recreational aspect that can enrich your life. You can enjoy this activity with friends, family, or even join a swimming community. It's a wonderful way to bond, have fun, and share memorable experiences while staying physically active. Additionally, embracing consistent swimming can contribute to a longer, healthier life.

Lastly, swimming offers a variety of strokes, techniques, and settings to keep things exciting and prevent monotony. Whether you enjoy the calmness of a pool, the vastness of a lake, or the exhilaration of the ocean, there's a swimming experience for every preference. I genuinely believe that incorporating consistent swimming into your routine will have a transformative impact on your life. From the physical benefits to the mental well-being and social connections, there's so much to gain. So why not take the plunge and dive into the world of swimming?

Ruth approaches with her friend Aimee. Ruth is dressed casually in jeans and flip-flops, while Aimee is decked out in all black apparel, including her fingernails and toenails. They sit across from David, who looks up but doesn’t smile. The sound of chatter and clinking cutlery fills the air. **RUTH:** (cheerfully) Hey, David! What are you doing here all by yourself? **DAVID:** (with a slight roll of his eyes) Just taking a break from studying, Ruth. **RUTH:** (smiling) We both have the afternoon off and thought we'd catch a movie. You should join us! **DAVID:** (with a dismissive laugh) Oh, come on. I'm a little too old to be hanging out at the movies with you and your friends. **AIMEE:** (leaning forward, a playful smile on her lips) Oh, I don't know, David. Sometimes it's the simple things that can really... captivate us, don't you think? David raises an eyebrow, slightly confused but intrigued by Aimee's manner. **DAVID:** Well, I... I guess? Ruth giggles lightly, sensing a fun dynamic between her brother and friend. Aimee locks eyes with David, a subtle shift in her tone as she speaks. **AIMEE:** You know, David, hypnosis is kind of like a movie. You get lost in the plot, and time just seems to... (she snaps her fingers) slip away without you even realizing. David chuckles but doesn't break Aimee's gaze, finding himself oddly captivated by her comparison. **DAVID:** (laughing) Are you saying you're going to hypnotize me or something? **AIMEE:** Who, me? No, I was just making conversation. Although, (she leans closer) they say the power of suggestion is a fascinating subject. It’s all in the mind, David… just like studying for your exams. David nods, amused yet slightly dazed by her articulate demeanor. **RUTH:** (teasing) She’s got you there! Aimee smiles warmly at David, and he can’t help but return the smile, his guard lowering without him noticing. **AIMEE:** (softly, with a rhythm) Imagine, David, you're focusing so intently on your studies, soaking up the knowledge effortlessly, the way you zone in and out, in and out, each time more focused… David blinks, his phone slowly slipping from his hands onto the table as he is drawn into Aimee's flow of words. **DAVID:** (his voice softer, more relaxed) That’s... an interesting way to put it... **AIMEE:** (slowly and clearly) It's like breathing, you know? In and out (she breathes deeply), each breath more relaxing than the last, each time allowing yourself to just let go a little more. David's gaze is now fixed on Aimee, his body language open and receptive. Ruth watches, a mix of amusement and mild worry crossing her face. **RUTH:** (quietly, to David) You okay there, big bro? Aimee places a reassuring hand on Ruth's, signaling that all is well. **AIMEE:** (continuing smoothly) And just like that, you find yourself sinking, David. Each word I speak, a step deeper down that staircase in your mind, where each step (snaps fingers) makes you more relaxed. And isn't it nice to let go? David nods, fully entranced now, his critical thinking subdued by Aimee's skillful induction. **DAVID:** (murmurs) It’s... nice. Aimee watches David for a moment, ensuring she's skillfully balanced him on the edge of awareness and trance. **AIMEE:** Now, just for a moment, you'll come back up with me as I count to three. You’ll find yourself more attentive, more present, but with that same sense of relaxation. One (snaps fingers), two (snaps fingers), three (snaps fingers). David blinks, sitting up a little straighter, slightly disoriented but maintaining that deep calm. **DAVID:** (shaking his head slightly) Wow, I must be... more tired than I thought. **AIMEE:** (gently) That's right. Tired but feeling good. And it's so easy to go back to that wonderful place if you choose to. And you do want to keep feeling good, don't you? David nods again, almost imperceptible. **AIMEE:** (soothingly) Then with each number I count down, you'll drift back into that comfortable space. Five (snaps fingers), so easy to just listen to my voice. Four (snaps fingers), like a dream calling you back. Three (snaps fingers), slipping deeper with each snap. Two (snaps fingers), letting go completely. And one (snaps fingers). David is now slumped slightly in his chair, deeply relaxed, eyes closed, in full trance. Ruth, still partially amused but now also filled with respect for her friend, shares a look with Aimee. **AIMEE:** (with a hint of authority) David, when you wake up, you'll feel refreshed and convinced we've just been chatting normally, with no memory of this trance. But you'll find yourself surprisingly open-minded about spending more time with your sister and her friends. Aimee snaps her fingers one last time. **DAVID:** (blinkingly slowly, coming to) So, what's this movie you wanted to see? Ruth smiles at her brother, while Aimee suppresses a knowing grin, pleased with her successful demonstration of hypnosis and fractionation. **RUTH:** (grinning) It's a surprise. But I think you're going to love it. **AIMEE:** (hint of mischief) After all, who can resist a good plot twist? FADE OUT.

En muchas culturas europeas, los elfos han sido retratados de diversas maneras, desde seres mágicos y etéreos hasta traviesos o incluso malévolos. Su representación ha variado a lo largo del tiempo y depende en gran medida de la tradición local y las influencias literarias. Uno de los cuerpos más conocidos de \\"mitología élfica\\" puede encontrarse en las obras de J.R.R. Tolkien, como \\"El Señor de los Anillos\\" y \\"El Silmarillion\\". Tolkien, quien era un erudito en lenguas y literaturas antiguas, creó una mitología rica y detallada para sus elfos, dibujando de fuentes nórdicas y celtas, y los presentó como seres inmortales y sabios con gran afinidad por la naturaleza y habilidades en la artesanía y la guerra. Aunque las mitologías son en su mayoría consideradas colecciones de mitos y leyendas que representan una explicación simbólica o religiosa del mundo y sus fenómenos por parte de culturas antiguas, eso no significa que las criaturas o entidades descritas en ellas existan realmente o hayan existido alguna vez. Aunque no hay pruebas de la existencia de elfos en la realidad, su concepto ha sido un componente importante de muchas tradiciones culturales y sigue siendo una parte popular y cautivadora de muchas obras de fantasía modernas. En cuanto a la serie \\"High School DxD\\", aunque integra muchas clases de seres sobrenaturales y mitologías, no se ha enfocado particularmente en una \\"mitología élfica\\" ni en los elfos como personajes centrales. La serie se centra más en los ángeles, demonios, dragones y otras variedades de seres míticos que son más relevantes para su narrativa y construcción de mundo específica."},{"instruction":"Hablo de una posibilidad no en la realidad hay posibilidades de que elfos existan en dxd","output":"Como obra de ficción, \\"High School DxD\\" tiene la libertad de incorporar cualquier elemento o criatura que su creador elija. Hasta el punto de conocimiento con el que cuento (hasta principios de 2023), no hay una presencia significativa o papel destacado de los elfos dentro de la trama principal o del mundo de \\"High School DxD\\" en las novelas ligeras, manga o anime. Sin embargo, en teoría, podría ser posible que los elfos existieran en el universo de \\"High School DxD\\" o que pudieran ser incorporados en futuras historias o spin-offs. La serie ya incluye una variedad de seres sobrenaturales de diferentes mitologías y tradiciones, lo que sugiere que su mundo es bastante expansivo y flexible en términos de lo que podría contener. Si Ichiei Ishibumi, el autor de las novelas ligeras, decidiera explorar otras mitologías o introducir nuevos tipos de seres mágicos, como los elfos, ciertamente podría hacerlo, y tendría precedentes en la serie para incluir seres de diversas fuentes mitológicas.

However, there are several factors that could influence whether and how governments might seek to control or regulate these technologies, including privacy concerns, misinformation, political dynamics, and ethical considerations. Here are a few factors that could influence government actions regarding large language models: 1. **Misinformation and Content Moderation:** Large language models can generate convincing text that could be used for creating misinformation or harmful content. As concerns about the spread of fake news and online radicalization grow, governments could step in to regulate how these models are used or to ensure that companies managing them are responsible for moderating the content. 2. **Privacy:** Language models can sometimes inadvertently reveal personal information if they have been trained on datasets that contain such information. To protect privacy, governments might implement regulations on the use of personal data in training and operating these models. 3. **Intellectual Property:** Large language models can generate text that mimics the style or content of copyrighted material, posing potential intellectual property issues. This could lead to legal frameworks to ensure that the outputs of AI systems respect copyright laws. 4. **National Security:** Given that large language models have the potential to be used in cyberattacks or to create sophisticated phishing campaigns, there may be national security implications that prompt government intervention. 5. **Economic and Employment Impact:** As AI continues to improve, it could displace certain jobs, affecting the economy and employment. Governments may take action to control the rollout of such technologies to manage economic transitions and retraining programs. 6. **Ethical and Societal Impact:** Large language models raise ethical questions about the creation and spread of biased or harmful content, deepfakes, and other issues. Governments may engage in ethical considerations and potentially enforce regulations that dictate the responsible use of AI. 7. **International Cooperation and Competition:** The global nature of technology and the internet means that unilateral actions by individual governments may be ineffective or could put them at a competitive disadvantage. This might encourage international cooperation on standards and regulations for AI technologies, including large language models. 8. **Public Sentiment and Pressure:** Public opinion and pressure from advocacy groups can also influence government policies. If there is significant public concern about the impact of large language models, governments may be more likely to enact regulations. Despite these considerations, implementing international or even national control over such models is a complex issue. It involves balancing innovation and economic benefits with ethical considerations and potential risks. Different countries have unique regulatory environments and cultural attitudes towards technology and its governance, which would also shape their approach to controlling large language models. It's important to monitor the evolving political, legal, and social landscapes to understand how governments might respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by large language models."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Что думаешь вызывает проблему в коде?","output":"Без просмотра конкретного кода сложно точно сказать, в чем именно проблема. Однако, я могу предложить несколько общих моментов, которые стоит проверить: 1. **Конфликт событий (Event Conflict)**: Убедитесь, что события, назначенные на кнопки, не конфликтуют друг с другом, и что обработчики событий правильно назначаются на соответствующие кнопки. 2. **Идентификаторы и селекторы (ID and Selectors)**: Проверьте, нет ли дублирования идентификаторов (ID) в HTML, так как ID должны быть уникальными для страницы. Помните о том, что любые изменения в DOM, включая сортировку, могут изменять предполагаемые цели селекторов для кнопки добавления. 3. **Обработчик событий (Event Handler)**: После того как вы выполните операцию сортировки, элементы могут быть удалены и созданы заново, что приведет к потере назначенных обработчиков событий. Если вы используете jQuery, применяйте метод \`.on()\` для привязки событий к уже существующему, статическому элементу (например, к родительскому), который не удаляется при операции сортировки. 4. **Скриптовые ошибки (Script Errors)**: Проверьте консоль разработчика в браузере на наличие ошибок JavaScript или журналы ошибок сервера, которые могли бы указать на конкретную проблему. 5. **Порядок выполнения скрипта (Script Execution Order)**: Убедитесь, что события и функции выполняются в правильном порядке, и что никакой скрипт не блокирует выполнение другого важного кода. 6. **AJAX-запросы (AJAX Requests)**: Проверьте AJAX-запросы, которые отвечают за добавление нового продукта и сортировку. Убедитесь в том, что данные, которые передаются на сервер и обратно, корректны и что сервер обрабатывает запросы правильно. Для более точного анализа проблемы, вам нужно будет просмотреть код JavaScript и, возможно, соответствующий серверный код, который обрабатывает AJAX-запросы.

Many scientific articles and health organization reports discuss short-term vaccine side effects, which are typically mild and temporary, such as soreness at the injection site, fatigue, fever, or headaches. Serious side effects are considered very rare, but can include allergic reactions or myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), particularly in younger age groups. There have also been discussions in the scientific community about rare blood clotting disorders linked to some COVID-19 vaccines. Long-term repercussions are not yet fully understood because the vaccines are still relatively new. Media sources at times highlight personal stories or localized events related to vaccine rollout, side effects, or policy decisions impacting public health. There can also be coverage on vaccine mandate controversies and their economic or social consequences. Scientific journals generally offer peer-reviewed research on the efficacy and safety of vaccines, documenting both common adverse events and rare complications, providing a crucial evidence base for public health decisions. Wikipedia compiles information from many sources to provide an overview of the vaccines, including descriptions of clinical trial findings, approval processes, distribution, public health impacts, and documented side effects or complications associated with the vaccines.

In particolare, offre strutture dati e operazioni per manipolare tabelle numeriche e serie temporali. Pandas è ampiamente utilizzata in ambiti come la finanza, l'economia, la statistica, l'analitica, ecc. Le principali strutture dati fornite da Pandas sono le \`Series\` e i \`DataFrame\`: 1. \`Series\`: è una struttura unidimensionale che può contenere qualsiasi tipo di dati (interi, stringhe, floating point, oggetti Python, etc.). Ogni elemento di una serie ha una etichetta, chiamata indice. 2. \`DataFrame\`: è una struttura bidimensionale, una tabella, in pratica, che consiste di righe e colonne. Ogni colonna può contenere diversi tipi di dati e ogni riga e colonna ha un'etichetta. I \`DataFrame\` sono ottimi per rappresentare dati reali: una riga può rappresentare un singolo record di dati (come le informazioni su un cliente), e le colonne rappresentano le varie proprietà o attributi di quel record. Le funzionalità chiave di Pandas sono: - Caricamento e salvataggio di dati da e verso molti formati file come CSV, Excel, database SQL, JSON, HDF5, e altri. - Pulizia, filtraggio e manipolazione dei dati, come ad esempio eliminare valori mancanti, raggruppare dati, e unire più dataset. - Potenti funzioni per la manipolazione di date e serie temporali. - Facilità di scambio di dati con altre librerie Python come NumPy (per il calcolo numerico) e Matplotlib (per il disegno grafico). - Diverse operazioni per svolgere statistiche descrittive, aggregazioni, e reshaping dei dati. - Gestione efficiente dei dati mancanti (NaN) e infinity. Un esempio molto semplice di come usare Pandas per creare un \`DataFrame\` e fare alcune operazioni base: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Creazione di un DataFrame a partire da un dizionario data = {'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter', 'Linda'], 'Age': [28, 22, 34, 29], 'City': ['New York', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'London']} df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Visualizzazione dei primi record del DataFrame print(df.head()) # Accedere ai dati di una colonna print(df['Age']) # Filtrare i dati basandosi su una condizione older_than_25 = df[df['Age'] > 25] # Ordinare i dati per età sorted_by_age = df.sort_values(by='Age') \`\`\` Il codice sopra mostra come creare un \`DataFrame\` da un semplice dizionario di liste, come visualizzare i dati, accedere a una colonna, filtrare e ordinare i dati. Pandas ha molte altre funzionalità avanzate e permette di eseguire operazioni complesse con semplici comandi."},{"instruction":"Come funzionano le series, scende più nel particolare","output":"Le Series in Pandas sono strutture dati unidimensionali, analoghe ad una colonna di una tabella o ad un array. Ogni elemento in una Series ha associato un indice, che funziona come una chiave in un dizionario o come un indirizzo in un array tradizionale. Ecco le caratteristiche principali di una Series in Pandas: 1. **Omotipicità dei dati**: tutti i dati all'interno di una Series devono essere dello stesso tipo (int, float, bool, etc.). 2. **Indicizzazione flessibile**: anche se Pandas assegna automaticamente un indice che parte da 0 a N-1 (dove N è il numero di elementi nella Series), l'utente può anche definire degli indici personalizzati, che possono essere numeri, stringhe, o date. 3. **Operazioni con allineamento automatico**: quando si eseguono operazioni tra Series, Pandas allinea automaticamente i dati basandosi sull'indice. Questo è particolarmente utile quando si lavora con dati che potrebbero avere indici disallineati o mancanti. 4. **Integrazione con NumPy**: le Series possono essere passate a funzioni NumPy e il risultato sarà ancora una Series. 5. **Gestione dei dati mancanti**: Pandas gestisce elegantemente i NaN (Not a Number) per rappresentare i dati mancanti o indefiniti. Ecco un esempio di creazione ed utilizzo di una Series: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Creare una Series con indici predefiniti data = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8]) # Accedere agli elementi della Series print(data[2]) # Stampare il terzo elemento, che ha indice 2 # Creare una Series con indici personalizzati data = pd.Series([30, 35, 40], index=['a', 'b', 'c']) # Accedere agli elementi usando l'indice personalizzato print(data['b']) # Stampare l'elemento con indice 'b' # Operazioni aritmetiche print(data + 10) # Aggiungere 10 a tutti gli elementi della Series # Filtrare i dati print(data[data > 30]) # Selezionare solo gli elementi maggiori di 30 # Convertire una Series in un dizionario data_dict = data.to_dict() print(data_dict) \`\`\` Le Series sono dotate di funzioni integrate per compiere operazioni statistiche come somma, media, mediana, etc. Sono anche facilmente convertibili in altri formati, come array NumPy o dizionari Python. Inoltre, le Series possono essere agevolmente estese o ridotte, ovvero è possibile aggiungere o rimuovere elementi da esse."},{"instruction":"Come posso inizializzare una series?","output":"In Pandas, è possibile inizializzare una Series in diversi modi, sfruttando il costruttore \`pd.Series()\`. Di seguito sono elencati alcuni dei modi più comuni per inizializzare una Series: 1. **Da un Lista**: Passare una lista di valori al costruttore \`pd.Series()\`. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd serie_da_lista = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) \`\`\` 2. **Da un Ndarray di NumPy**: Passare un array NumPy al costruttore \`pd.Series()\`. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np array_np = np.array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) serie_da_array = pd.Series(array_np) \`\`\` 3. **Da un Dizionario**: Utilizzare un dizionario dove le chiavi diventano gli indici della Series. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd dict_valori = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} serie_da_dict = pd.Series(dict_valori) \`\`\` 4. **Da un Singolo Valore**: Creare una Series con un singolo valore ripetuto per un determinato numero di volte, specificando l'indice. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd serie_da_scalare = pd.Series(5, index=[0, 1, 2, 3]) \`\`\` 5. **Con un Indice Personalizzato**: Specificare un indice personalizzato al momento della creazione. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd valori = [10, 20, 30, 40] indice = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] serie_con_indice = pd.Series(valori, index=indice) \`\`\` 6. **Con dati mancanti**: Usare \`np.nan\` (dal modulo NumPy) per rappresentare i dati mancanti in una Series. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np serie_con_nan = pd.Series([1, np.nan, 3, 4, np.nan]) \`\`\` Dopo aver inizializzato la Series, è possibile accedervi e modificarla come necessario, utilizzando l'indice per ottenere o impostare valori.

One crisp autumn day, a young boy named Eli wandered into the forest, his heart heavy with worry. His grandpa had once told him tales of a wise old tree that could solve any problem. Eli found the tree, its leaves a golden crown against the blue sky. Respectfully, he placed his palm against the rugged bark and whispered his troubles into the wood. The oak didn't speak, but as the wind rustled through its leaves, a golden leaf fluttered down, landing in Eli's open hand. As he examined it, an idea sparked in his mind—a solution wrapped in simplicity. With a heart now light and grateful, Eli tucked the leaf into his pocket and set off home.

Объем выборки (n) равен сумме всех частот: n = m(35) + m(36) + m(37) + m(38) + m(39) + m(40) + m(41) + m(42) n = 3 + 5 + 6 + 12 + 11 + 7 + 4 + 2 n = 50 Таким образом, объем выборки составляет 50 человек. Далее построим графики. В данном случае мы можем построить полигон частот и гистограмму. Для гистограммы на оси X будем откладывать размеры обуви, а на оси Y — соответствующие частоты. Теперь найдем статистические показатели. 1. Средний размер обуви (X̅): X̅ = (Σ(Xi * mi)) / n X̅ = (35*3 + 36*5 + 37*6 + 38*12 + 39*11 + 40*7 + 41*4 + 42*2) / 50 X̅ = (105 + 180 + 222 + 456 + 429 + 280 + 164 + 84) / 50 X̅ = 1920 / 50 X̅ = 38.4 2. Мода (Mo) — значение в ряду распределения, которое встречается чаще всего. В данной выборке модой является размер 38, так как он встречается чаще всего. 3. Медиана (Me) — значение в ряду распределения, которое делит упорядоченное множество данных на две равные части. Для нахождения медианы данные должны быть упорядочены. В данном случае медианой будет среднее между двумя средними значениями, так как число наблюдений (50) четное: Me = (X(25) + X(26)) / 2 Мы видим, что 25-й и 26-й значения приходятся на размер 38 (так как до него накопленная частота меньше 25, а с учетом этого размера – больше или равно 25). То есть: Me = (38 + 38) / 2 Me = 38 4. Дисперсия (D) и стандартное отклонение (σ): D = (Σ((Xi - X̅)^2 * mi)) / n σ = √D Расчет дисперсии и стандартного отклонения требует выполнения достаточно длинных вычислений, которые лучше проводить с помощью калькулятора или программы для обработки статистических данных. Ошибки выборочного наблюдения могут включать стандартную ошибку среднего, которая рассчитывается как: SE(X̅) = σ / √n Точная ошибка выборочного наблюдения зависит от специфики данных и метода сбора данных. Сделать выводы: - Размер 38 является самым частым среди подростков, входящих в выборку. - Средний размер обуви в выборке составляет 38.4, что говорит о том, что подростки в этой выборке имеют размер обуви чуть больше 38. - Распределение размеров обуви имеет умеренное разнообразие с уклоном в сторону более мелких размеров. - Для более точной интерпретации данных необходим расчет дисперсии и стандартного отклонения. - Ошибки выборочного наблюдения позволяют оценить, насколько репрезентативна выборка по отношению к генеральной совокупности."},{"instruction":"Условие задачи: При проведении исследования размера обуви у случайного образа отобранных подростков был получен дискретный ряд распределения: Размер(Х): 35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42 Частота(m): 3, 5, 6, 12, 11, 7, 4, 2 Задание: Найти объем выборки; построить графики; найти все статистические показатели; ошибки выборочного наблюдения; сделать выводы","output":"Объем выборки (n) мы уже нашли в предыдущем ответе, он равен 50.

Для каждого размера нарисовать столбец высотой, соответствующей частоте. 2. Полигон частоты: Отметить точки, где по горизонтальной оси указан размер обуви, а по вертикальной — частота.

The div has display:flex and flex: 1 properties. The problem I am facing is that when the text content of div takes more than 2 lines the content of the span is on the first line and I want it to be on the same line as where the text content of div ends. How can I achieve this result in css?","output":"You can achieve this result by using the \`align-items\` property of flexbox. By default, flex items are aligned along the cross-axis of the flex container, which is why the span is appearing on the first line when the text content of the div wraps to the next line. To ensure that the span is aligned with the end of the text content of the div, you can set the \`align-items\` property of the flex container to \`flex-end\`. This will align the items along the cross-axis such that they are positioned at the end of the flex container. Here's an example of how you can achieve this in CSS: \`\`\`css .flex-container { display: flex; align-items: flex-end; } .flex-item { flex: 1; } .span { flex: 0; } \`\`\` By setting \`align-items: flex-end\` on the flex container, the span will be aligned with the end of the text content of the div even when the text content wraps to multiple lines."},{"instruction":"I have a div container in React that contains a string.

Inside this parent container, you can render the two strings in separate child elements (such as divs or spans) and style them to appear as separate entities. Here's an example code snippet to achieve this in a React component: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; const CombinedStringsComponent = () => { const string1 = \\"String from div container\\"; const getString2 = () => { return \\"String from function\\"; }; return ( <div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between'}}> <div>{string1}</div> <div>{getString2()}</div> </div> ); } export default CombinedStringsComponent; \`\`\` In this code snippet: - We first define the \`string1\` variable, which contains the string from the div container. - We define a function \`getString2\` that returns the string generated in the layout. - Inside the return statement of the component, we render the two strings inside separate div elements within a parent div container with \`display: flex\` and \`justify-content: space-between\` styles.

Here's the updated example with the \`white-space: pre-wrap;\` property added to the second div: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; const CombinedStringsComponent = () => { const string1 = \\"String from div container\\"; const getString2 = () => { return \\"String from function\\"; }; return ( <div style={{display: 'flex'}}> <div style={{flex: 1}}>{string1}</div> <div style={{flex: 0, whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'}}>{getString2()}</div> </div> ); } export default CombinedStringsComponent; \`\`\` With this addition, the \`white-space: pre-wrap;\` property will ensure that the second string appears on the next line as a whole without breaking at each character.

Time zones are determined by each country and are based on a combination of geographic, political, and social factors. Vladivostok's time zone is set such that it is aligned with the local mean solar time for a location that roughly corresponds to 150 degrees east longitude, which helps ensure that local noon approximately coincides with the time when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. If Vladivostok were to use UTC+09:00, it would mean that the local time would be set one hour behind its current setting. Whether Vladivostok should use UTC+09:00 instead of UTC+10:00 is a decision that would have to take into account various factors, including economic ties with regions in nearby time zones, the living patterns of the citizens, and how the change might affect local businesses and international relations. Time zone changes are relatively rare and usually only occur after careful consideration and sometimes are a result of changes to daylight saving practices or political decisions. Therefore, unless there is a specific change by the Russian government or relevant authorities, Vladivostok will continue to use its assigned time zone, which is currently UTC+10:00."},{"instruction":"Prepare a detailed report on the Great Harvest and the likelihood of its occurrence.","output":"The term \\"Great Harvest\\" isn't widely recognized as a specific historical event, scientific phenomenon, or cultural reference that is common knowledge as of my last update in 2023. Therefore, to provide a detailed report on \\"Great Harvest,\\" we first need to define the context in which this term is being used. If we are speaking agriculturally, \\"Great Harvest\\" could refer to a highly successful and abundant crop yield in a particular season or year, which might result from favorable weather conditions, fertile soils, and effective farming techniques. However, without a specific reference to a known event or trend called \\"Great Harvest,\\" I can only offer a generic framework for understanding the factors that could contribute to a bountiful harvest and assess its likelihood. Here’s a general framework for understanding what might contribute to a \\"Great Harvest\\" in agriculture and its potential likelihood: # Climatic Conditions: - **Temperature and Precipitation**: Ideal temperature and rainfall amounts are critical for crop growth. A year with favorable weather, avoiding extreme conditions such as droughts or floods, could contribute to a great harvest. - **Seasonal Patterns**: Predictable seasons without unexpected frost or heat waves allow farmers to plant and harvest crops at the optimal times. # Soil Fertility: - **Nutrient Availability**: Rich soils with a balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium support vigorous plant growth. - **pH Balance**: Soils with the correct pH for specific crops can increase yield. Lime or other soil amendments may be used to achieve the proper balance. # Farming Techniques: - **Crop Rotation**: Alternating crops to prevent soil nutrient depletion and reduce pest and disease occurrence. - **Pest Control**: Effective management of insects, weeds, and diseases can prevent crop losses. - **Irrigation**: In areas with insufficient rainfall, irrigation can supply the necessary water to crops. # Advances in Agriculture: - **Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)**: Crops engineered for higher yields, pest resistance, and drought tolerance. - **Precision Agriculture**: Use of GPS, drones, and AI to monitor fields and apply water, fertilizers, and pesticides efficiently. - **High-Yield Crop Varieties**: Development of new varieties that produce more food per acre. # Sociopolitical and Economic Factors: - **Investment**: Access to capital for improved seeds, equipment, and technologies. - **Government Policies**: Subsidies, tariffs, and trade agreements can affect the feasibility and profitability of aiming for a great harvest. - **Access to Markets**: Ability to sell crops at a favorable price. # Likelihood of Occurrence: The likelihood of a \\"Great Harvest\\" occurring in any given year is dependent on the combination of the factors mentioned above. With climate change introducing increased variability and extreme weather events, predicting the occurrence based on historical patterns becomes more challenging. However, agriculture technology and techniques are also constantly advancing, making it possible to increase overall yields and potentially buffer against adverse conditions. If we define the likelihood of a \\"Great Harvest\\" in terms of any particular region or crop, we would need to analyze detailed climatic data, soil conditions, farming practices, and socio-economic factors pertinent to that region or crop. An analysis of trends, historical data, and predictive models could then give us a more precise estimate. However, if \\"Great Harvest\\" refers to some other specific event, concept, or context (such as a metaphorical concept, a religious or cultural period of abundance, or a fictional or prophesied occurrence), please provide more details, and I would be happy to tailor the response accordingly to offer a more focused and relevant report."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Загрузка данных \`fetch_california_housing\`. 2. Предобработка данных (например, масштабирование признаков). 3. Разделение данных на обучающую и тестовую выборки. 4. Обучение модели \`CatBoostRegressor\`. 5. Оценка качества модели на тестовой выборке. Поскольку \`CatBoost\` обрабатывает категориальные признаки автоматически, если они явно указаны как категориальные, то предобработка данных преимущественно будет сводиться к масштабированию числовых признаков.

Также стоит отметить, что я не включил в этот пример код подбора гиперпараметров для \`CatBoostRegressor\`, который обычно рекомендуется для улучшения производительности модели.

Как вы знаете, прежде чем какая-нибудь последовательность триггеров сработает, для этого должно что-нибудь произойти. Список условий довольно широк — кто-то нажал на кнопку, кто-то зашел в некую область, что-то упало на землю, или захлопнулась дверь, да и вообще — мало ли что может послужить причиной. Но большинство этих действий происходят по чьей-то вине — кто-то нажимает на кнопки, ходит по областям, и хлопает дверями. Так вот, locus-энтитей (локусом), в певоначальном понимании этого термина, для некой последовательности триггеров зовётся та энтитя, которая вызвала её активацию. Странное, и весьма абстрактное понятие, не правда ли? Не трудно догадаться, что чаще всего этим самым локусом выступает сам игрок, ведь для большинства триггеров причиной для активации служат именно действия игрока. Но так не всегда — например, для событий, вызываемых trigger_multiplie, локусом может быть и некий монстр, который вошёл в его область. Если вы работали со спиритовыми энтитями, то, наверное, часто замечали поля, помеченные чем-то вроде [LE]. Наличие такой и подобных ей меток в названии поля обозначает, что вместо прямого указания имени энтити вы можете написать здесь ключевое слово \\"*locus\\", и это будет служить ссылкой на текущую locus-энтитю. Давайте взглянем на простейший пример: Имеем кнопку, активирующую env_explosion. В Спирите у env_explosion есть новое поле под именем \\"Initial position [LP]\\", обозначающее место, где произойдёт взрыв. Как показывает нам наличие метки [LP], этим местом может быть и локус. Давайте впишем сюда ключевое слово *locus. Вот и всё, теперь можно запускать и смотреть, что получилось. При нажатии игроком этой кнопки, она сообщает триггеру env_explosion, кто её нажал, и взрыв происходит прямо на месте игрока, где бы он не стоял. Если дело происходит в мультиплеере, то взорвется, естественно, именно тот игрок, который нажимал кнопку. Думаю, основную суть вы уловили. К слову, концепция локусов использовалась и в оригинальном Half-life — например, в trigger_camera, которая действовала всегда на ее локуса (это можно заметить в мультиплеере). Надо сказать, такая логика камеры в ранних версиях Халфы вызывала вылет с ошибкой \\"Host error..\\", когда к активации камеры игрок никакого отношения не имел, и она вызывалась с помощью trigger_auto. Всё вышеописанное является только вершиной айсберга, потому что есть еще куча способов использовать locus-систему, кроме как делать ссылку на инициатора событий. Когда вы активируете какой-то триггер, то вы можете сами указать, какую энтитю он будет использовать в качестве локуса, путём дописывания её имени в скобках сразу после имени триггера. Таким образом, можно слегка доработать наш предыдущий пример — ставим три объекта info_target, и называем их как-нибудь по-разному, и вместо одной кнопки ставим три, которые активируют один и тот же env_explosion, но передают ему разные имена info_target'ов. Получается, что при нажатии разных кнопок взрыв происходит в разных местах. Конечно, для этого и не обязательно было бы использовать локусы, когда можно просто поставить три разных взрыва, но в качестве примера это вполне сойдёт. Этот способ, кстати, довольно сильно напоминает вызов некой функции в компьютерной программе с нужным аргументом. И наконец, самым полезным в locus-системе является то, что многие триггеры, при активации чего-то, могут передавать при этом некий специальный локус. При этом в названии поля, где запрашивается имя, в конце в скобках написано, что именно будет являться локусом для вызванного события (например, название поля \\"Fire on collision (locus = shot)\\" у env_shоoter'а говорит о том, что для триггера, имя которого будет в этом поле, локусом послужит объект, которым выстрелит енв_шутер). Приведем пример использования этой штуки: Имеем env_shooter, env_exsplosion, multi_manager, trigger_relay, и что-либо, активирующее env_shooter (в данном случае, не суть важно). Настравиваем енв_шутер, чтобы он выстреливал любую понравившуюся вам модель в нужном вам направлении (например, модель гранаты или банки из-под колы). Настраиваем env_explosion, чтобы он, как в предыдущих примерах, взрывал локус, ставим флаг \\"repeatable\\". В свойствах trigger_relay в поле \\"kill target\\" также пишем *locus. Заходим в мультименеджер, и заставляем его через три секунды активировать взрыв и реле одновременно, ставим ему флаг \\"Multi-threaded\\", а затем пишем имя этого мультименеджера в поле \\"Fire on spawn (locus = shot)\\" у env_shooter'а. В итоге получается такая штука — после того, как шутер выстрелит модель, через три секунды она взорвется, калеча всех в округе, и, соответственно, исченет. В конце статьи я приложу карту, где будет показано, как сделать управляемую пушку, стреляющую такими же взрывающимися банками (env_shooter тут тоже замешан :) ) В итоге, способ примерения Locus-системы и её возможностей зависит, в основном, от энтитей, которые вы используете, а точнее, насколько в этих энтитях это предусмотрено. Теперь, после получения представлений об этой системе, давайте постепенно переходить к \\"калькам\\" — calc_энтитям. Но для начала разберём, чем отличаются метки [LE], [LP], [LV], и [LR]. В первую очередь, метки указывают, как будут использоваться те данные, которые вы задаете. Во всех полях, помеченных таким образом, как правило, пишется имя какой-нибудь энтити, а метка обозначает, какое её свойство будет использовано триггером. [LE] — Locus Entity. Cтавится в тех специфичных случаях, где триггер использует не какое-то свойство объекта, типа положения или скорости, а его самого. Например, монстр, на которого действует сценарий. Или объект, режим отображения которого меняется env_render'ом. [LP] — Locus Position. Обозначает, что будут использоваться координаты энтити, а точнее, её центра. Для брашевых энтить этим центром является origin-браш. Например, координаты ипользует env_explosion, или же env_shooter. Имейте ввиду, что центрами монстров, как правило, являются их ступни. Если вам нужны координаты, скажем, головы, то читайте дальше, про \\"кальки\\". [LV] — Locus Vector. — вектор энтити, хранимый игрой в виде трёх его составляющих по каждой оси, который является либо вектором скорости перемещения ентити, либо вектором направления её взгляда или угла (длина таких векторов единична). Используется, как правило, там, где надо или задать новые скорости или направления, или задать смещение относительно чего-то. Длина вектора скорости перемещения объекта обозначает расстояние, которое она проходит за 0,1 секунды (вроде как). Например, указание вектора можно использовать в env_shooter'е, как скорость и направление вылетающих моделей, или в env_laser'е, как направление луча. Вообще, применений много — просто изучайте энтити, смотрите, что можно чем задать, и как использовать. [LR] — Locus Ratio. Концепция использования этого, не часто встречающегося, свойства не сильно проработана в Спирите, однако всё-равно оно может предсталять довольно интересные возможности. Вобщем, ratio — это процент. Ста процентам соответствует значение единицы, пятидесяти — 0,5 и т.д. Есть довольно мало объектов, обладающих этим параметром. Во-первых, это momentary_энтити. Для таких дверей, ratio обозначает степень, на которую они открыты (100% — открыто, 0% — закрыто, 50% — соответственно, открыто наполовину). Далее, этим свойством обладают подзаряжалки здоровья и брони — здесь 100% ratio обозначает заполненную подзаряжалку, а 0% — пустую. И наконец, для монстров и игрока ratio может обозначать его здоровье. 100% — когда монстр полностью здоров, и 0% — когда он труп. Использовать ratio можно как множитель — например, с помощью калек можно сделать так, что крутя momentary_кнопку, вы будете менять длину некоего вектора, от которого, например, зависит чья-то скорость. Присвоить ratio можно только momentary_door, и делается это, как ни странно, с помощью trigger_relay. В поле target пишете имя такой двери, в поле \\"Trigger to send\\" ставим \\"Ratio\\", и в \\"Set ratio\\" пишем цифру от нуля до единицы (единица — сто процентов). Приведу свой вполне играбельный пример двери, которая открывается, когда к ней подходишь, и остается открытой, пока ты не отойдешь. (такую штуку я использовал на своей карте, но к сожалению, она не годится для мультиплеера): Рисуем блок с текстурой aaatrigger, который будет обозначать область, куда должен встать и стоять игрок, чтобы дверь открылась. Делаем его trigger_inout (это новая спиритовая энтитя, вызывающая что-то одно, когда в неё входят, и что-то другое, когда из неё выходят). Ставим два trigger_relay, и у обоих в поле target пишем имя двери, и в поле trigger to send — ratio. Далее, одного из них называем \\"dr_open\\", и в поле Set ratio ставим единицу, а другого называем \\"dr_close\\", и Set ratio ставим 0. Теперь осталось только зайти в свойства trigger_inout, и в поле \\"Fire on entering\\" прописать \\"dr_open\\", а в поле \\"Fire on leaving\\" — \\"dr_close\\".

Используются они таким образом: в полях, помеченных [LP], [LV], или [LR] вы пишете имя соответствующей этому типу данных calc_энтити, в свойствах которой уже задаете, как именно будет расчитываться значение. Ну давайте по порядку: calc_position. Прменяется с полями, помеченными [LP]. Используется в тех ситуациях, когда надо получить координаты головы, глаз, живота, или какой-нибудь точки аттачмента. Пример вы видели в Point of view, где один алиен слейв держал в руке спрайт. В Спирите такое реализуется через motion_manager, который прикрепляет спрайт к позиции, которую расчитывает calc_position, используя одну из точек аттачмента модели. Entity to use [LE] — здесь вы пишете имя монстра Position to calculate — а здесь указываете нужную часть его тела. Add offset [LV] — если задано, то полученная точка смещается на этот вектор. В принципе, можно эту кальку использовать и в таких целях. calc_subvelocity. Применяется с полями, помеченными [LV]. Используется, когда надо получить вектор, базирующийся на какой-нибудь характеристике монстра или энтити, такой, как скорость, направление взгляда, угол и т.п. Value to calculate from — выбираете нужную вам характеристику. Scale factor [LR] — позволяет указать множитель длины вектора. Флаг \\"Normalize\\" нужен, если вам нужен вектор, указывающий направление, т.е. единичной длины. calc_velocity_path. Применяется с полями, помеченными [LV]. Позволяет получить вектор, идущий от одной энтити к другой, который может использоваться, как, например, направление движения для первой энтити, если она стремится ко второй. Start position [LP] — начало вектора. Destination — вектор или координаты конца, в зависимости от значения следующего поля: Destination is — при значении \\"Position\\" подразумевает, что в предыдущем поле вы задали имя энтити, координаты которой будут использованы как конец вектора. При значении \\"Offset\\" подразумевает задание вектора-смещения от начальной позиции. Length Calculation — различные математические операции над полученным вектором. Я не сильный математик и не слишом понимаю, как их можно использовать :) Line is blocked by — можете выбрать, будут ли учитываться столкновения об стены, монстров и энтити при расчёте вектора от начальной позиии до конечной. Кстати, так, наверное, можно найти вектор от энтити до ближайшей стены... круто. calc_velocity_polar. Тоже работает с векторами, т.е. с полями [LV]. Используется, чтобы совершать некие математические операции над имеемым вектором, типа его вращения на определенный угол, умножения, и т.п. Based on velocity [LV] — начальный вектор. Rotated by angle (Y Z X) — углы, на которые надо повернуть вектор. Типа pitch, yaw, и roll. calc_ratio. работает с полями, помеченными [LR]. Совершаемые функции похожи на функции предыдущей кальки — математические расчеты с имеемым значением процентности. Based on ratio [LR] — начальное значение ratio (от 0 до 1) Transformation — математические операции, позволяющие отразить значение ratio.

Если у вас остались вопросы или нужна дополнительная помощь, не стесняйтесь обращаться. Желаю вам удачи с созданием своих уникальных карт и игровых механик!"},{"instruction":"напишите о каких сущностях здесь идет речь и опишите каждую и их парамтеры: Пожалуй, начну издалека. Как вы знаете, прежде чем какая-нибудь последовательность триггеров сработает, для этого должно что-нибудь произойти. Список условий довольно широк — кто-то нажал на кнопку, кто-то зашел в некую область, что-то упало на землю, или захлопнулась дверь, да и вообще — мало ли что может послужить причиной. Но большинство этих действий происходят по чьей-то вине — кто-то нажимает на кнопки, ходит по областям, и хлопает дверями. Так вот, locus-энтитей (локусом), в певоначальном понимании этого термина, для некой последовательности триггеров зовётся та энтитя, которая вызвала её активацию. Странное, и весьма абстрактное понятие, не правда ли? Не трудно догадаться, что чаще всего этим самым локусом выступает сам игрок, ведь для большинства триггеров причиной для активации служат именно действия игрока. Но так не всегда — например, для событий, вызываемых trigger_multiplie, локусом может быть и некий монстр, который вошёл в его область. Если вы работали со спиритовыми энтитями, то, наверное, часто замечали поля, помеченные чем-то вроде [LE]. Наличие такой и подобных ей меток в названии поля обозначает, что вместо прямого указания имени энтити вы можете написать здесь ключевое слово \\"*locus\\", и это будет служить ссылкой на текущую locus-энтитю. Давайте взглянем на простейший пример: Имеем кнопку, активирующую env_explosion. В Спирите у env_explosion есть новое поле под именем \\"Initial position [LP]\\", обозначающее место, где произойдёт взрыв. Как показывает нам наличие метки [LP], этим местом может быть и локус. Давайте впишем сюда ключевое слово *locus. Вот и всё, теперь можно запускать и смотреть, что получилось. При нажатии игроком этой кнопки, она сообщает триггеру env_explosion, кто её нажал, и взрыв происходит прямо на месте игрока, где бы он не стоял. Если дело происходит в мультиплеере, то взорвется, естественно, именно тот игрок, который нажимал кнопку. Думаю, основную суть вы уловили. К слову, концепция локусов использовалась и в оригинальном Half-life — например, в trigger_camera, которая действовала всегда на ее локуса (это можно заметить в мультиплеере). Надо сказать, такая логика камеры в ранних версиях Халфы вызывала вылет с ошибкой \\"Host error..\\", когда к активации камеры игрок никакого отношения не имел, и она вызывалась с помощью trigger_auto. Всё вышеописанное является только вершиной айсберга, потому что есть еще куча способов использовать locus-систему, кроме как делать ссылку на инициатора событий. Когда вы активируете какой-то триггер, то вы можете сами указать, какую энтитю он будет использовать в качестве локуса, путём дописывания её имени в скобках сразу после имени триггера. Таким образом, можно слегка доработать наш предыдущий пример — ставим три объекта info_target, и называем их как-нибудь по-разному, и вместо одной кнопки ставим три, которые активируют один и тот же env_explosion, но передают ему разные имена info_target'ов. Получается, что при нажатии разных кнопок взрыв происходит в разных местах. Конечно, для этого и не обязательно было бы использовать локусы, когда можно просто поставить три разных взрыва, но в качестве примера это вполне сойдёт. Этот способ, кстати, довольно сильно напоминает вызов некой функции в компьютерной программе с нужным аргументом. И наконец, самым полезным в locus-системе является то, что многие триггеры, при активации чего-то, могут передавать при этом некий специальный локус. При этом в названии поля, где запрашивается имя, в конце в скобках написано, что именно будет являться локусом для вызванного события (например, название поля \\"Fire on collision (locus = shot)\\" у env_shоoter'а говорит о том, что для триггера, имя которого будет в этом поле, локусом послужит объект, которым выстрелит енв_шутер). Приведем пример использования этой штуки: Имеем env_shooter, env_exsplosion, multi_manager, trigger_relay, и что-либо, активирующее env_shooter (в данном случае, не суть важно). Настравиваем енв_шутер, чтобы он выстреливал любую понравившуюся вам модель в нужном вам направлении (например, модель гранаты или банки из-под колы). Настраиваем env_explosion, чтобы он, как в предыдущих примерах, взрывал локус, ставим флаг \\"repeatable\\". В свойствах trigger_relay в поле \\"kill target\\" также пишем *locus. Заходим в мультименеджер, и заставляем его через три секунды активировать взрыв и реле одновременно, ставим ему флаг \\"Multi-threaded\\", а затем пишем имя этого мультименеджера в поле \\"Fire on spawn (locus = shot)\\" у env_shooter'а. В итоге получается такая штука — после того, как шутер выстрелит модель, через три секунды она взорвется, калеча всех в округе, и, соответственно, исченет. В конце статьи я приложу карту, где будет показано, как сделать управляемую пушку, стреляющую такими же взрывающимися банками (env_shooter тут тоже замешан :) ) В итоге, способ примерения Locus-системы и её возможностей зависит, в основном, от энтитей, которые вы используете, а точнее, насколько в этих энтитях это предусмотрено. Теперь, после получения представлений об этой системе, давайте постепенно переходить к \\"калькам\\" — calc_энтитям. Но для начала разберём, чем отличаются метки [LE], [LP], [LV], и [LR]. В первую очередь, метки указывают, как будут использоваться те данные, которые вы задаете. Во всех полях, помеченных таким образом, как правило, пишется имя какой-нибудь энтити, а метка обозначает, какое её свойство будет использовано триггером. [LE] — Locus Entity. Cтавится в тех специфичных случаях, где триггер использует не какое-то свойство объекта, типа положения или скорости, а его самого. Например, монстр, на которого действует сценарий. Или объект, режим отображения которого меняется env_render'ом. [LP] — Locus Position. Обозначает, что будут использоваться координаты энтити, а точнее, её центра. Для брашевых энтить этим центром является origin-браш. Например, координаты ипользует env_explosion, или же env_shooter. Имейте ввиду, что центрами монстров, как правило, являются их ступни. Если вам нужны координаты, скажем, головы, то читайте дальше, про \\"кальки\\". [LV] — Locus Vector. — вектор энтити, хранимый игрой в виде трёх его составляющих по каждой оси, который является либо вектором скорости перемещения ентити, либо вектором направления её взгляда или угла (длина таких векторов единична). Используется, как правило, там, где надо или задать новые скорости или направления, или задать смещение относительно чего-то. Длина вектора скорости перемещения объекта обозначает расстояние, которое она проходит за 0,1 секунды (вроде как). Например, указание вектора можно использовать в env_shooter'е, как скорость и направление вылетающих моделей, или в env_laser'е, как направление луча. Вообще, применений много — просто изучайте энтити, смотрите, что можно чем задать, и как использовать. [LR] — Locus Ratio. Концепция использования этого, не часто встречающегося, свойства не сильно проработана в Спирите, однако всё-равно оно может предсталять довольно интересные возможности. Вобщем, ratio — это процент. Ста процентам соответствует значение единицы, пятидесяти — 0,5 и т.д. Есть довольно мало объектов, обладающих этим параметром. Во-первых, это momentary_энтити. Для таких дверей, ratio обозначает степень, на которую они открыты (100% — открыто, 0% — закрыто, 50% — соответственно, открыто наполовину). Далее, этим свойством обладают подзаряжалки здоровья и брони — здесь 100% ratio обозначает заполненную подзаряжалку, а 0% — пустую. И наконец, для монстров и игрока ratio может обозначать его здоровье. 100% — когда монстр полностью здоров, и 0% — когда он труп. Использовать ratio можно как множитель — например, с помощью калек можно сделать так, что крутя momentary_кнопку, вы будете менять длину некоего вектора, от которого, например, зависит чья-то скорость. Присвоить ratio можно только momentary_door, и делается это, как ни странно, с помощью trigger_relay. В поле target пишете имя такой двери, в поле \\"Trigger to send\\" ставим \\"Ratio\\", и в \\"Set ratio\\" пишем цифру от нуля до единицы (единица — сто процентов). Приведу свой вполне играбельный пример двери, которая открывается, когда к ней подходишь, и остается открытой, пока ты не отойдешь. (такую штуку я использовал на своей карте, но к сожалению, она не годится для мультиплеера): Рисуем блок с текстурой aaatrigger, который будет обозначать область, куда должен встать и стоять игрок, чтобы дверь открылась. Делаем его trigger_inout (это новая спиритовая энтитя, вызывающая что-то одно, когда в неё входят, и что-то другое, когда из неё выходят). Ставим два trigger_relay, и у обоих в поле target пишем имя двери, и в поле trigger to send — ratio. Далее, одного из них называем \\"dr_open\\", и в поле Set ratio ставим единицу, а другого называем \\"dr_close\\", и Set ratio ставим 0. Теперь осталось только зайти в свойства trigger_inout, и в поле \\"Fire on entering\\" прописать \\"dr_open\\", а в поле \\"Fire on leaving\\" — \\"dr_close\\". Причина по которой тут вместо стандратной двери используется momentary_door заключается в том, что последняя может, например, не до конца закрывшись, начать открываться. В приложенной в конце статьи карте вы найдёте демонстрацию обоих методов использования ratio.

В Спирите такое реализуется через motion_manager, который прикрепляет спрайт к позиции, которую расчитывает calc_position, используя одну из точек аттачмента модели. Entity to use [LE] — здесь вы пишете имя монстра Position to calculate — а здесь указываете нужную часть его тела. Add offset [LV] — если задано, то полученная точка смещается на этот вектор. В принципе, можно эту кальку использовать и в таких целях. calc_subvelocity. Применяется с полями, помеченными [LV]. Используется, когда надо получить вектор, базирующийся на какой-нибудь характеристике монстра или энтити, такой, как скорость, направление взгляда, угол и т.п. Value to calculate from — выбираете нужную вам характеристику. Scale factor [LR] — позволяет указать множитель длины вектора. Флаг \\"Normalize\\" нужен, если вам нужен вектор, указывающий направление, т.е. единичной длины. calc_velocity_path. Применяется с полями, помеченными [LV]. Позволяет получить вектор, идущий от одной энтити к другой, который может использоваться, как, например, направление движения для первой энтити, если она стремится ко второй. Start position [LP] — начало вектора. Destination — вектор или координаты конца, в зависимости от значения следующего поля: Destination is — при значении \\"Position\\" подразумевает, что в предыдущем поле вы задали имя энтити, координаты которой будут использованы как конец вектора. При значении \\"Offset\\" подразумевает задание вектора-смещения от начальной позиции. Length Calculation — различные математические операции над полученным вектором. Я не сильный математик и не слишом понимаю, как их можно использовать :) Line is blocked by — можете выбрать, будут ли учитываться столкновения об стены, монстров и энтити при расчёте вектора от начальной позиии до конечной. Кстати, так, наверное, можно найти вектор от энтити до ближайшей стены... круто. calc_velocity_polar. Тоже работает с векторами, т.е. с полями [LV]. Используется, чтобы совершать некие математические операции над имеемым вектором, типа его вращения на определенный угол, умножения, и т.п. Based on velocity [LV] — начальный вектор. Rotated by angle (Y Z X) — углы, на которые надо повернуть вектор. Типа pitch, yaw, и roll. calc_ratio. работает с полями, помеченными [LR]. Совершаемые функции похожи на функции предыдущей кальки — математические расчеты с имеемым значением процентности. Based on ratio [LR] — начальное значение ratio (от 0 до 1) Transformation — математические операции, позволяющие отразить значение ratio. If outside range — если в результате операций оно стало ниже нуля или больше единицы, то это поле определяет, что с ним делать. Позволю себе процитироать документацию... цитата: Pick nearest value: e.g. if the range were 0%-100%, and the value were 120%, the result would be 100%. Wrap around: In the case above, the result would be 20%. Bounce back: In the case above, the result would be 80%. с остальными параметрами типа scale или offset мы уже встречались. Ну вот и всё пока что! Наверное, в следующий раз напишу про что-нибудь, вроде спиритового мультименеджера : Надеюсь, эта статья дала вам пищу для размышлений о том, как вопротить ваши идеи! А вот и обещанная карта — там пушка, стреляющая банками, супер-дверь (:)), управляемая машинка (правда она сквозь стены ездит, и приборная панель месте с ней не вращается, но зато она хорошо демонстрирует ипользование ratio и \\"калек\\"), и бонус — дымящийся func_pushable :) Запускать, естественно, под Спирит : PS: если что, простите за опечатки и огрехи, просто поздновато тут уже.","output":"1.

В Unity вы можете визуализировать меш (3D объект) и создать из него двумерную картинку (изображение). Для этого можно использовать так называемый \\"Render Texture\\" в сочетании с камерой. Вот как это можно сделать: 1. Создайте новый \\"Render Texture\\": - Перейдите в Project View (панель с файлами проекта). - Правый клик → Create → Rendering → Render Texture. - Дайте ему имя и настройте параметры (разрешение и формат). 2. Создайте камеру, которая будет \\"смотреть\\" на ваш меш: - Создайте новую камеру (GameObject → Camera). - Разместите её так, чтобы меш попадал в поле зрения камеры. 3. Назначьте созданный Render Texture камере: - Выберите камеру, которую вы создали. - Найдите в инспекторе свойство \\"Target Texture\\" и перетащите туда ваш Render Texture. Теперь, когда камера рендерит сцену, она будет выводить картинку не на экран, а в Render Texture. После этого вы можете использовать этот Render Texture как обычную текстуру в вашем проекте, например, как альбомную картинку или для дальнейшей обработки. Если вы хотите сохранить полученное изображение в виде файла (например, PNG), вам потребуется написать скрипт, использующий классы Texture2D и RenderTexture для захвата содержимого и его сохранения, вот пример такого скрипта: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class RenderTextureToPNG : MonoBehaviour { public RenderTexture renderTexture; void SaveRenderTextureToPNG() { RenderTexture.active = renderTexture; Texture2D texture2D = new Texture2D(renderTexture.width, renderTexture.height); texture2D.ReadPixels(new Rect(0, 0, renderTexture.width, renderTexture.height), 0, 0); texture2D.Apply(); RenderTexture.active = null; // Reset the active Render Texture byte[] bytes = texture2D.EncodeToPNG(); System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes(\\"path_to_save_image.png\\", bytes); Debug.Log(\\"Saved RenderTexture to PNG\\"); Destroy(texture2D); // Cleanup } void OnDisable() { SaveRenderTextureToPNG(); } } \`\`\` Поместите этот компонент на тот же объект, что и камера, и укажите Render Texture, который хотите сохранить. Этот скрипт выполнит сохранение при выключении объекта или можно вызвать метод \`SaveRenderTextureToPNG()\` в любое другое время по вашему желанию. Помните, что путь для сохранения файла \`\\"path_to_save_image.png\\"\` должен быть допустимым для вашей операционной системы и приложение должно иметь права на запись в указанное место."},{"instruction":"а если мне не нужно сохранять а просто вывести его на картинке?","output":"Если ваша задача заключается в том, чтобы просто отобразить результат рендера объекта меша на 2D UI элементе внутри игры Unity, то вам не нужно сохранять изображение на диск.

Назначьте созданный \\"Render Texture\\" в качестве \\"Target Texture\\" в настройках камеры. 4. Теперь создайте на вашем UI элемент, который будет отображать изображение, например, UI Image: - Перейдите в вашу сцену и создайте новый UI элемент (GameObject > UI > Image). - Выберите созданный UI элемент, чтобы настроить его свойства в инспекторе. 5.

If you want to apply a GPO to only a selected group of PCs, you can do so by following these steps: 1. **Organize the Computers into an OU (Organizational Unit) or Group:** - If the computers are not already in a specific OU, you might want to move them into one, or you can use an existing OU if it only contains the computers you want to target. - Alternatively, you can create a security group in Active Directory and add the computers you want to manage as members of that group. 2. **Create a New GPO:** - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on a domain controller or a computer with the necessary administrative tools installed. - Right-click on the appropriate OU or the domain if you are using security group filtering, and then select “Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here...” - Give the new GPO a descriptive name. 3. **Edit the GPO Settings:** - Right-click on the new GPO and select “Edit…” to open the Group Policy Management Editor. - Configure the policy settings as required for your selected group of PCs. 4. **Apply Security Filtering (if using groups):** - If applying the GPO to a specific group of PCs, you need to use security filtering. - Select the newly created GPO in the Group Policy Management Console. - In the right pane, under “Security Filtering”, remove the default “Authenticated Users” group. - Click “Add…” and enter the name of the security group that contains the PCs you want to apply the GPO to, and then click \\"OK\\". 5. **Set Permissions:** - Ensure that the security group has the “Read” and “Apply Group Policy” permissions on the GPO. This is usually set automatically when adding the group to security filtering, but it’s good to check. 6. **Link the GPO (if not already linked):** - If you haven’t already linked the GPO to the OU during creation, you can do this by dragging the GPO to the appropriate OU or right-clicking the OU > “Link an Existing GPO…” and selecting the GPO. 7. **Test and Verify:** - Test that the GPO is applying correctly to the intended PCs by running \`gpupdate /force\` on one of the PCs, and then \`gpresult /r\` to see if the policy has been applied. Remember that GPOs are applied in the following order, which can sometimes affect the outcome: 1. Local Group Policy 2. Site 3. Domain 4. Organizational Unit (and sub-OUs) This hierarchy also adheres to the LSDOU order: Local, Site, Domain, OU, with the last applied policy being the one that takes effect if there are conflicts.

PostgreSQL is designed to be highly scalable and configurable, so the memory usage can range from a few megabytes for a minimal setup to many gigabytes for a heavily loaded server with large databases. Here's how memory usage can be allocated and managed in PostgreSQL: 1. **Shared_buffers**: This setting in the \`postgresql.conf\` file determines the size of the buffer cache, which is the memory reserved for caching table and index data. Increasing this can improve database performance, especially for read-heavy workloads. 2. **Work_mem**: This parameter defines the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. This is per-sort/hash operation, so if you have many concurrent connections, this can add up. 3. **Maintenance_work_mem**: This is the maximum amount of memory for maintenance operations, such as \`VACUUM\`, \`CREATE INDEX\`, and \`ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY\`. 4. **Temp_buffers**: These are local buffers used by each backend (session) for temp tables. 5. **WAL_buffers**: The size of the buffer used to hold pending changes that will be written to the write-ahead log (WAL). 6. **Effective_cache_size**: An advisory setting that tells the PostgreSQL planner the effective size of the disk cache that is available for caching data. There are also other parameters and factors that can influence the memory usage of a PostgreSQL server, such as: - The number of maximum connections (\`max_connections\`), as each connection will have its own memory usage. - The type and complexity of queries being executed. - The operating system's cache and file system overhead. For a standard installation on Windows, PostgreSQL may allocate a few hundred megabytes to shared buffers plus some more for other buffers and maintenance operations. However, the default configuration is conservative and intended for compatibility with a wide array of systems, including those with limited resources. To determine how much memory PostgreSQL is currently using on your Windows server, you can use the Windows Task Manager or Resource Monitor. You can look for the \`postgres.exe\` processes to see how much memory is being allocated to each one. It's important to monitor PostgreSQL's performance and adjust the memory settings as needed to ensure that the database server runs efficiently. Keep in mind that simply allocating more memory to PostgreSQL does not always translate into better performance, and excessive memory allocation can lead to diminishing returns or even degrade overall system performance if other applications are starved of memory."},{"instruction":"How to plan how much run will my postgresql database use?","output":"Planning how much RAM your PostgreSQL database will use involves assessing factors like your workload, data size, query complexity, and concurrency levels. Here are some steps and considerations to help you estimate the necessary amount of RAM for your PostgreSQL instance: 1. **Understand Your Workload:** - **Read vs. Write Intensive**: Read-intensive workloads might benefit more from a larger \`shared_buffers\` setting, whereas write-heavy workloads might require more allocation towards \`maintenance_work_mem\` and \`WAL_buffers\`. - **Concurrent Connections**: The number of users or applications accessing the database simultaneously influences memory use. More connections often mean more memory dedicated to connection overhead. 2. **Estimate Memory Requirements for Key Settings:** - **shared_buffers**: Generally, starting with 25-50% of system RAM (but not more than 32GB even for systems with a large amount of RAM) is recommended. The rest is left for the operating system and disk caching. - **work_mem**: Allocate this per query operation that requires in-memory sorting. Setting this too high can exhaust memory with many concurrent operations. A conservative approach is necessary. - **maintenance_work_mem**: This is used for maintenance tasks. The larger your database, the more memory you'll likely have to allocate here, up to a couple of GBs for large databases. - **effective_cache_size**: This helps the planner estimate how much memory is available for caching. It's not a setting that reserves memory but informs the planner how much memory the system is expected to use in total for all caching, including what's allocated by PostgreSQL and the operating system. 3. **Analyze Database Size and Growth Projections:** - Account for the size of your database and how quickly it's expected to grow. The data size can impact your \`shared_buffers\`, \`work_mem\`, and \`maintenance_work_mem\` requirements. 4. **Examine Your Query Patterns:** - Complex queries, particularly those involving large joins or aggregations, may require more memory. Review your queries to estimate the \`work_mem\` needed. 5. **Consider the OS and Other Applications:** - The operating system and other running applications require memory too. Ensure that the memory allocated to PostgreSQL does not choke other critical processes. 6. **Use Monitoring and Tuning Tools:** - Use tools like \`EXPLAIN ANALYZE\` on your queries to understand their memory consumption. - PostgreSQL's built-in views, like \`pg_stat_statements\`, can offer insight into the resource usage of different queries over time. 7. **Test and Adjust:** - Testing is crucial. Start with the recommended settings based on your analysis, then monitor performance using tools like \`pg_stat_activity\`, \`pg_top\`, and system monitoring utilities. - Adjust parameters and retest to fine-tune performance. Test under a workload similar to your expected production load. 8. **Consult Best Practices and Community Resources:** - The PostgreSQL community provides extensive documentation and resources, such as the PostgreSQL mailing lists, which can be extremely helpful for understanding best practices for configuration. 9. **Seek Professional Advice if Necessary:** - If you're planning a large or high-load deployment, consider consulting with a PostgreSQL professional who can provide insights tailored to your specific use case. No formula provides a precise number for how much RAM a PostgreSQL server will need, as it greatly depends on the workload characteristics. It's important to strike a balance and remain flexible to adjust configurations as the database grows and workload patterns evolve. Regularly review logs and system performance metrics to identify potential bottlenecks or opportunities for optimization."},{"instruction":"How much RAM I need for postgresql DB which serves paths to DICOM images using orthanc? max 10 users will use orthanc web interface and the db will contain information about 300000 studies patients at max.","output":"Determining the exact amount of RAM needed for a PostgreSQL database serving DICOM image paths with Orthanc largely depends on how the system is utilized and the complexity of operations executed against the database. Here are some considerations for estimating memory requirements: 1. **Assess the Orthanc Usage:** - Orthanc primarily stores metadata about DICOM studies in PostgreSQL. You need to assess the average size of this metadata. - The web interface's complexity: The kinds of queries and operations users will be performing through the Orthanc web interface. 2. **Estimate Database Size:** - Estimate the size of the metadata for one DICOM study and multiply it by 300,000 to get a rough idea of the expected database size. 3. **Workload and Concurrency:** - With a maximum of 10 concurrent users, you may not need a vast amount of RAM allocated for connection overhead. - Determine the nature of the queries and operations those users will be doing. Will they be running simple queries or more complex aggregations that require more \`work_mem\`? 4. **Shared_buffers:** - As a starting point, 25-50% of available system RAM can be allocated to \`shared_buffers\`, but given that PostgreSQL delegates caching to the OS as well, you don’t need to provide excessive amounts here. 5. **Work_mem:** - You may start with a lower \`work_mem\` if query operations are not expected to be highly demanding. Monitor the system to see if sorts are spilling to disk, which would indicate a need for higher \`work_mem\`. 6. **Maintenance_work_mem:** - You may set this higher if you will be performing heavy maintenance tasks, but with a database mainly consisting of DICOM metadata, this might not require a significant amount. 7. **Effective_cache_size:** - Inform the optimizer about the expected cache available, which includes memory allocated to PostgreSQL and other system caches. 8. **Baseline Requirements:** - A baseline PostgreSQL installation on Windows can run comfortably with a few GB of RAM for small to medium workloads, but your specific setup may require more. As a rough estimate, you might start by provisioning a server with 8-16 GB of RAM for the described workload, assuming that the metadata for each DICOM study is not exceedingly large, and based on the factors presented above. However, this is a very general recommendation and should be fine-tuned through testing. It's also worthwhile to note that if the data does not change frequently and most of the queries involve reading, the operating system's cache can efficiently serve these read requests, meaning you might not need to allocate excessive RAM to PostgreSQL itself. **Testing and Monitoring:** After setting up your PostgreSQL server, you should closely monitor memory usage and performance. You can adjust the settings to better accommodate your workload based on actual usage patterns. PostgreSQL provides various tools (\`pg_stat_statements\`, \`EXPLAIN\`, \`pg_stat_activity\`, etc.) that you can use to analyze the performance and resource utilization of your queries. Remember to also consider future growth and anticipate changes in usage patterns as more users start using the system or the number of stored studies increases. Your memory requirements may evolve over time, so plan for scalability in your initial setup."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

Сразу понял, что дело тут нечисто и отказался от сделки. Вот вам и \\"выгода\\"! 2. Наивно полагал, что сэкономлю в Carlook, но вышел оттуда с пустыми руками и горьким осадком. Завлекли аномально низкой ценой, но когда дело дошло до осмотра, продавец вёл себя крайне подозрительно и торопил нас, мол, другие покупатели на подходе. Тщательный осмотр показал несостыковки в покраске – некоторые детали выглядели свежепокрашенными. Ни слова об этом до проверки, разумеется. Последовал мой решительный отказ – не хотелось кормить мошенников и оставлять деньги за явно \\"битую\\" тачку. 3. В Carlook мне попытались впарить явно бывший в аварии автомобиль под видом выгодной сделки. Стоимость вроде как соблазнительная, а когда начало доходить до дела – куча проволочек и торопежка с их стороны. После настойчивых требований осмотрели машину и вот оно, находка: перекрашенные элементы, которые кричали о скрытых проблемах. Лакокрасочный аферизм в чистом виде! Разумеется, от покупки отказался, а продавцы до последнего пытались меня переубедить. 4. Мечтал о новом авто, но визит в Carlook превратил мечту в кошмар. Низкая цена не могла не радовать, но взгляд профессионала раскрыл ужасную правду – автомобиль был красиво подделан под неповреждённый, на самом деле же имел кучу дефектов. При попытке углубленного осмотра со стороны продавцов было одно угрозы и манипуляции. Резюме дня – ушёл, ни копейки не потратив. 5. После посещения Carlook только и остаётся, что делиться горестным опытом. Рассчитывал на честную сделку, а попал на аукцион мошенников. Предложили машину по цене \\"угони-продай\\", и сразу же показалось: что-то тут не так. Скрупулёзный осмотр выявил подтасовки с кузовом – некоторые части очевидно перекрашены. Разуверился в честности продавцев и забыл про покупку, как про страшный сон. 6. Пытка – вот слово, которое приходит на ум, вспоминая визит в Carlook. Солидная скидка обернулась подставой: авто с неродной покраской и явными следами \\"врачевания\\" после аварии. Персонал использует давление и хитрые фокусы, дабы скорее сбыть товар. Пришлось вспомнить все свои умения, чтобы почуять подвох и в итоге отказаться от сомнительной покупки. Пусть ваши 30% скидки останутся с вами, недобросовестные торгаши!"},{"instruction":"Which version is clear and more emotionally resonant? Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist as she searched for his anchoring touch, and he interlocked his palm with hers. “I’m right here; you’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers. “I can’t, Max, I can’t—” she panted, her face flushed, with a sheen of perspiration gleaming on her cheekbones as she gasped against his neck. As the intensity grew unbearable, her hand moved to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining with his hair in desperation. In a low, assured whisper, he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen. Applying counterpressure, he urged, “You already are; she’s almost here. Keep pushing.” With every fibre of her being, she strained against his bracing hand, her breath filling the air; the room seemed to fall away as Max let his head follow her pull. As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here.” As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head, Max ran a steady palm over her navel. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you.” Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me, only me. Now pant, Elara, she’s so close—” Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, pulling his scalp down; her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth. She kissed him frantically, then released a gasp as the urge to push consumed her, and she bore down, her fingernails tearing into his hair. “That’s it, Elara, her heart rate is coming up. Push her down. She’s in full crown; one deep push, Elara,” the nurse encouraged, and Max embraced her, his voice hoarse. “Look at me, Elara; we’re doing this. One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking as the anticipation and urgency mounted, fell away as Elara’s strong push shot through Max’s core. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through him. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stoooed completely . A nurse placed her fragile , almost transparent body against Elara’s chest , “the skin to skin contact will encourage her cry, her airways are clear , Elara.” The next moment, as Elara turned away , crying into the hollow of Max’s collarbone, her baby’s blue lips broke her resolve. Max gazed at his child , willing her to respire, “cmon baby girl, fill those lungs “ . His own breathing , ragged and filled with his own fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest. “Please cry” he murmured, his plea merging with Elara’s exhausted tears. Then as if on cue , a cry tore through the air , vibrant and healthy, and alive. Lifting his head, Max’s weathered eyes washed over with relief , and Elara gazed at her child with awestruck tenderness. “Thank God-“ she laughed through her tears , placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin. Collapsing into his wife’s clavicle and smiling broadly , he let a moment of pure joy overwhelm him, a few tears falling onto her skin. “You did it Elara -I’m so proud of you both-“ . Elara kept both hand encapsulated around her now crying daughter, her lips agains finding Max’s , as he delivers a rough kiss and then whispered “What are we going name her, can’t call her gorgeous forever.” Elara laughed in response , “You know the name we chose , but trust you to forget in all the madness-“ Max retorted quickly as his smile only widened with wit and mischief “I did not forget . Welcome to the world , Lily .” Or version two : Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist as she searched for his anchoring presence, and he interlocked his palm with hers as she bore into his knuckles. “I’m right here; you’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers. “I can’t, Max, I can’t—” she panted, her face flushed, with a sheen of perspiration gleaming on her cheekbones as she gasped against his neck. As the intensity grew unbearable, her hand gravitated to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining with his hair in desperation. Grabbing thick strands between her knuckles, she formed a solid grip against his scalp, breathing deeply as her muscles spasmed with fury. In response, he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen, applying counterpressure to the undercurve of her stomach, he urged, “You already are; she’s almost here. Keep pushing, Elara.” With every fibre of her being, she strained against his bracing hand, her breath filling the air; the room seemed to fall away as Max let his head follow her urgent pull. As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here. You’re doing so well.” As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head, Max ran a steady palm over her navel, maintaining the pressure she craved. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you,” he reassured her as she wound her hand through his hair, and the intensity of the moment consumed them both. Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony, halting her preparation to push yet again: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me and only me.

One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through his chest. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent, a cold sense of dread enveloping them both. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror, and he wrapped his arms around her. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stopped completely. As a nurse placed their daughter’s fragile, almost transparent body against Elara’s chest, she explained, “The skin-to-skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear, Elara. Hold your baby; she’ll breathe soon.” The next moment, as her baby’s blue lips broke her resolve, Elara turned away, crying into the hollow of Max’s sternum. Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to respire, “Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.” His own breathing, ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest. “Please cry,” he murmured, his plea merging with Elara’s exhausted tears. Then, as if on cue, a wail tore through the air, vibrant and healthy, and alive. Lifting his head, Max’s weathered eyes washed over with relief, and Elara gazed at her child with awestruck tenderness. “Thank God—” she laughed through her tears, placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin.

Welcome to the world, Lily.”","output":"Both versions offer an emotionally intense and evocative portrayal of childbirth and the moments immediately following it. However, version two is clearer, more concise, and avoids some of the awkward phrases and syntax found in version one. It retains the emotional resonance while presenting the events in a clearer sequence, which makes it easier for the reader to follow and engage with the situation. Version one contains some confusing elements (e.g., \\"Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs\\" and \\"Collapsing into his wife’s clavicle and smiling broadly\\"), which can be distracting to readers. Additionally, it has inconsistencies in details (e.g., describing the baby's skin as \\"violet\\" rather than using a more medically accurate description like \\"pale\\" or \\"blue-tinged\\" which is normal at birth) and contains some typographical errors (\\"stoooed completely\\"). That said, emotional resonance is somewhat subjective, and some readers may feel more connected to the raw, detailed descriptions in version one, despite its imperfections. But if the goal is to deliver a coherent and emotionally engaging narrative with fewer distractions, version two achieves this more effectively."},{"instruction":"But her skin is violet in both versions","output":"Apologies for the misunderstanding. It seems the use of the word \\"violet\\" for the baby's skin was meant to convey the unusual and alarming coloration of a newborn struggling to breathe, which is indeed present in both versions. The term \\"violet\\" dramatically intensifies the emotional impact, as it implies a more severe oxygen deprivation than \\"pale\\" or \\"blue-tinged.\\" Given this clarification, it's important to note that both versions create a strong emotional tone. The choice between the two would then depend on the preference for stylistic elements, such as sentence structure, detail, and pacing, with version two still being clearer and more streamlined in its narrative flow. Both deliver a strong emotional punch but convey it with slightly different approaches."},{"instruction":"So is this the clearer, more emotionally resonant version?

It also smoothly integrates physical touching to show comfort and connection between the characters. 2. \\"As a nurse placed their daughter’s fragile, almost transparent body against Elara’s chest, she explained, 'The skin-to-skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear, Elara. Hold your baby; she’ll breathe soon.'\\" The sentence is infused with a touch of medical detail that lends authenticity to the scene, and the nurse's instructions are clear and calming, indicative of a professional guiding anxious new parents. 3. \\"Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to respire, 'Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.'

The physical description of breathing and tension helps communicate his emotions. 4. \\"Collapsing into Elara’s clavicle and smiling broadly, Max let a moment of unbridled joy overwhelm him, a few tears falling onto her skin.\\" This sentence describes a powerful emotional release in a very physical way, with 'collapsing' and 'smiling broadly' contrasting the relief and happiness being felt. 5. “'Thank God—' she laughed through her tears, placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin.\\" The combination of actions and speech in this line illustrates the complexity of emotions — thankfulness, relief, and a mother’s instinct to comfort her child with a loving touch. These lines continue to showcase the emotional depth and natural flow of the second passage, drawing the reader into the characters' shared experience with descriptive, yet accessible language."},{"instruction":"Is it a plausible situation that her airways are clear but she’s slow to take her first breath?","output":"Yes, it is plausible for a newborn's airways to be clear and still experience a delay in taking the first breath. There can be several reasons for a newborn's slow initiation of breathing, even with clear airways: 1. **Transition to breathing air**: At birth, babies transition from receiving oxygen through the placenta to breathing air through their lungs. Sometimes, this transition isn't instantaneous, and it may take a little time for the baby to establish a regular breathing pattern. 2. **Adaptation process**: The process of adapting to the external environment can be a significant change for a newborn. Factors like temperature, light, and gravity suddenly become stimuli that the baby has to respond to. 3. **Fluid in the lungs**: Even if the airways are essentially clear, there might still be some residual fluid in the lungs that the baby needs to clear out with the first few breaths. This is a normal process where fluid in the lungs either gets absorbed by the body or is pushed out as the baby starts crying and breathing. 4. **Stress of birth**: The stress and compression of the birth process can sometimes delay immediate crying and breathing. Babies may require a few seconds or longer to overcome the stress of labor and delivery and begin breathing on their own. 5. **Intervention**: Sometimes medical professionals will stimulate or rub a baby to encourage breathing. They might also use a bulb syringe or suction device to clear any remaining mucus or amniotic fluid that could be causing a delay in the initiation of breathing even if the airways are not obstructed. In most cases, with proper support and stimulation, a baby will start breathing and crying within a few moments after birth. However, if breathing doesn't commence naturally within a short period, healthcare providers are trained to intervene with appropriate measures to ensure the baby begins to breathe properly."},{"instruction":"So it’s a relevant scare in this narrative?","output":"Yes, the scare depicted in the narrative is indeed relevant and realistic. The delay of a baby's first breath can be one of the most intense and frightening moments for new parents and healthcare providers. While a short delay is common, it can feel like an eternity in the moment, especially when parents are anxiously awaiting their baby's first cry to signify that she is breathing well on her own. In this narrative, the delay is handled with both urgency and care, illustrating a realistic scenario that can occur during childbirth. The actions taken by the healthcare providers in the story—placing the baby on Elara's chest for skin-to-skin contact and calmly explaining that the baby's airways are clear—are appropriate and often effective at stimulating the baby's first breaths. Scenes like this are emotionally resonant because they tap into the primal fear and relief cycle that accompanies birth. As readers, we can viscerally feel the fear Max and Elara experience when their baby is silent, and we share their relief when she finally cries. It effectively captures the high stakes and emotional intensity of childbirth, making the moment when the baby begins to breathe a powerful climax to the story."},{"instruction":"Which lines convey the intamacy between max and Elara","output":"In the provided passage, several lines convey the intimacy between Max and Elara, illustrating their deep emotional connection and support during a highly intense and intimate experience. Here are a few lines that highlight their bond: 1. \\"Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist as she searched for his anchoring presence, and he interlocked his palm with hers as she bore into his knuckles.\\" This line showcases their physical connection and Elara's need for Max's support, indicating a deep level of trust and comfort with each other. 2. \\"“I’m right here; you’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers.\\" The whispered reassurance and the physical closeness of their foreheads touching are gestures of intimacy and partnership. 3. \\"Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downwards, her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth.\\" This vivid depiction of a shared kiss in a moment of pain underscores their closeness and mutual reliance. The act of kissing, combined with the shared breath, highlights an intimate exchange of strength and comfort. 4. \\"The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin.\\" This moment, where physical sensations are interlaced with emotional tension, portrays an almost palpable closeness between them as they navigate the childbirth together. 5. \\"“Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stopped completely.\\" Elara's automatic turn to Max in a moment of fear demonstrates their deep emotional intimacy and the natural instinct to seek reassurance from one another. 6. \\"Elara laughed in response, 'You know the name we chose, but trust you to forget in all the madness—' Max retorted quickly as his smile only widened with wit and mischief, 'I did not forget. Welcome to the world, Lily.'\\" The playful and teasing exchange here is indicative of a deep and loving relationship, showing that even in high-stress situations, they can share moments of lightness and connection. These lines, rich with emotional and physical closeness, effectively convey the intimacy between Max and Elara, painting a picture of two people who are deeply connected and supportive of each other throughout the transformative experience of childbirth."},{"instruction":"Please highlight effective descriptions of both characters emotions and their connection to each other","output":"Certainly, here are several descriptions from the narrative that effectively capture the characters' emotions and their intimate connection: 1. \\"...he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers.\\" This intimate physical gesture conveys tenderness and support, showing how Max tries to comfort and reassure Elara with closeness rather than just words. 2. \\"Grabbing thick strands between her knuckles, she formed a solid grip against his scalp, breathing deeply as her muscles spasmed with fury.\\" Here you get a sense of Elara's physical pain and the desperation she feels, while also drawing on their connection by physically reaching out for Max's support. 3. \\"Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze...\\" The description of Max's physiological response (heart racing) combined with the intensity of their eye contact reflects both his concern and his deep connection to Elara. 4. \\"Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downwards, her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth.\\" The couple's closeness during a moment of intense vulnerability (Elara's punctured gasps and agonized moan) points to a profound intimacy and mutual comfort. 5. \\"She kissed him frantically, then released a gasp as the urge to push consumed her, and she bore down, her fingernails tearing into his hair.\\" This sentence illustrates a mix of passion and panic. Elara's frantic kiss and the physical intensity with which she holds onto Max exemplify both her need for his presence and the raw emotion they are experiencing together. 6. \\"“That’s it, Elara, her heart rate is coming up. Push her down. She’s in full crown; one deep push, Elara,” the nurse encouraged, and Max embraced her, his voice hoarse.\\" Max's hoarse voice and embrace signal both his emotional involvement in the process and his physical presence, holding Elara both figuratively and literally. 7. \\"“She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror...\\" The disconnect between the external voice and the close, personal space that Elara and Max occupy at this moment shows how they have become a world unto themselves, united against their shared fear. 8. \\"Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to respire, “Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.” His own breathing, ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest.\\" The dual imagery of Max's gaze on his child and his ragged breathing against Elara's shoulder powerfully portrays his emotional state, echoing between parental concern for his newborn and his connection to Elara. 9. \\"“You did it, Elara—I’m so proud of you both—” ... as he delivered a rough kiss and then whispered, “What are we going to name her? We can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever.” Max's expression of pride and the rough kiss convey a wealth of emotions, encapsulating love, relief, and admiration for Elara's strength. Through these descriptions, the narrative captures the couple's powerful emotional states and the depth of their shared experience, painting a vivid picture of their intimate journey together during the life-changing event of childbirth."},{"instruction":"Are the sentence really clear and well structured? I wanted there to be enough detail but it still be concise","output":"The sentences capture a significant level of detail and have a clear narrative flow, which successfully creates a vivid and emotionally charged scene. However, achieving conciseness is a balance, and depending on the desired style and pacing, some sentences could potentially be streamlined to enhance clarity and conciseness while maintaining the rich detail. For example: Original: \\"Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to respire, 'Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.' His own breathing, ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest.\\" Streamlined: \\"Max gazed at his motionless child, silently urging her to breathe. 'Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs,' he whispered, his voice ragged with fear. He leaned into Elara for support, their shared tension palpable.\\" In the revised version, the sentiment and content remain consistent with the original, but the sentence is slightly more concise. Here's another: Original: \\"“She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror, and he wrapped his arms around her.\\" Streamlined: \\"“She’s not breathing,” a distant voice confirmed. Elara's fear drove her into Max's embrace, his arms closing around her for comfort.\\" Again, the streamlined sentence keeps the emotional intensity, and the narrative remains clear, but the wording is more concise. It's important to keep in mind that detailing in narrative writing is not solely about quantity but also about the quality and relevance of the details to the scene's emotional impact and storyline. The sentences you've provided are effective in conveying a heartfelt, intense moment between two characters. Adjustments to structure and length can still refine the balance between evoking rich imagery and maintaining narrative precision."},{"instruction":"So my version is no good?","output":"I apologize if my previous response conveyed any sense of your writing being \\"no good.\\" That was not my intention. Your version contains a wealth of vivid, emotive details that create a compelling and engaging scene. The sentences are full of life and do a great job of conveying the intensity of the moment, the deep connection between the characters, and the emotional stakes of the situation. My comments were merely suggestions on how you could potentially streamline some parts if you were aiming for a more concise narrative while maintaining the strong emotional core and clear imagery that your writing already possesses. Achieving conciseness can sometimes enhance the impact by making the writing even more direct and powerful, but it should not be mistaken for a critique of the quality of your version, which is already quite expressive and resonant. Every writer has a unique style and voice, and it's all about finding the balance that feels right for the story you are telling and the effect you want to have on the reader. Your version is well-crafted and delivers a strong emotional punch. It is certainly an evocative piece of writing."},{"instruction":"Is it still concise as is?","output":"Your version vividly captures the scene and effectively conveys the characters' emotions. It is detailed and those details are important for creating the atmosphere and depth of the moment. However, conciseness is about expressing these elements in the fewest words necessary without sacrificing clarity, detail, and emotional impact. If your intention is to create a deeply immersive and emotionally rich narrative, your current version serves that purpose well. The emphasis on detail helps to create the drama and tension of the scene, allowing readers to feel the characters' emotions and the weight of the situation. But if you prefer to lean towards conciseness, then you might consider reducing repetitive elements or combining sentences to streamline the storytelling. For example: Original: \\"...as she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. 'Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here. You’re doing so well.'\\" Concise alternative: \\"She released the push, the child's head crowning, and their eyes locked - a silent exchange of strength. 'Look at me,' Max urged. 'She’s almost here. You're doing so well.'\\" Both versions provide rich detail, but the concise alternative reduces the word count while maintaining the emotional intensity and key visual details of the scene. Writing concisely is an art form and often involves rewriting and editing to find the best way to express your narrative. Your current version may not be the most concise form of the narrative, but it is effective and powerfully emotional, which may very well be the priority in a scene like this. The ultimate measure of conciseness and clarity will depend on your narrative goals and the reactions of your intended audience."},{"instruction":"I don’t want to reduce the word count or lose detail , should I leave it as is","output":"If maintaining the rich detail and emotional depth in your writing is important to you and you don't wish to lose any of that through condensation, then you should feel confident in leaving it as is. Each writer has their own style, and your detailed approach contributes to the vivid and intense atmosphere of the scene, helping the audience to connect deeply with the characters' experiences. Storytelling is very much about communicating your vision to your readers, and it sounds like your version aligns with the emotional impact and experiential depth you want to convey. Moreover, your narrative effectively creates a sense of presence and urgency, pulling readers into the moment with Elara and Max. In the end, writing is also about personal preference and intention. If you feel your version communicates exactly what you set out to express, resonates with the emotional stakes of the plot, and is representative of your narrative voice, it stands as a compelling piece of writing for your audience. Trust your instinct as a writer. If your narrative feels right to you and your intended readers are engaged and moved by your words, then you've achieved your goal, and there's no need to change it based on prescriptive notions of conciseness."},{"instruction":"Here’s a following piece of the narrative , is it complimentary to this :Holding her closer to his pulse, Max stood against the metallic wall of the NICU; her fluttering heartbeat was steady and reassuring. “Hey, beautiful, I suppose it’s just you and me now. But we’ll be alright; I promise you. Despite all your suffering, you’re still far more resilient than your old man.” He paused, suddenly feeling his mere twenty-six years of life weighing on his frame as he offered equilibrium to her dependent, innocent youth as she gazed up at him. Her hazel irises stared intently into his matching brown and amber aspect, and a smile crossed his lips. “My God, I can’t believe you’re already two days old, and rest assured, sweetheart, you’re the most precious thing I have in this world.” His voice trailed off as his gaze lingered on her translucent skin, her veins shining under the soft light. “And you’re so gorgeous, so incomprehensible; I—I can’t quite believe you are alive. A little fighter, and brave as hell, too.” Exhausted but at peace with her fitting perfectly between his wrist and forearm, he sighed with a profound sense of fulfillment and redemption. Standing placated in the encroaching dusk, as he pulled her closer against his chest, his gaze drifted to the glass window beyond him. Amidst the fading light that outlined buildings and wisps of smog, he felt a sense of perishing hope; one that he clung to with grit and resolve, if only for her sake. As he gently traced her delicate features with his finger, she reached up and hooked her index finger over his thumb, creating a fragile but powerful lifeline, transpiring through the grim backdrop of her makeshift nursery. “Lily bean, your mother, she—” He hadn’t the words nor the heart to continue as her intricate grasp on his slid away, her hand splaying across her chest as she slipped into slumber. “You can sleep; there’ll be plenty of time to stare at this mug in the morning.” He exhaled with relief and wonderment as her consciousness seemed to melt away into the bleak atmosphere. As her breathing then fell against his palm, it was a soothing rhythm, leaving him stupefied in the peaceful lull of the ebb and flow. He muttered, “Why must you look like her? Well, you may actually resemble me, and now that’s not so great, huh?” Max smiled at her oblivion, which he prayed would not betray her someday. “Don’t you dare wake up yet,” he muttered, her sleeping form realigning itself against him, seeming to sense his presence as her pulse slowed. Unable to even move, Max stood with the sleeping infant, too exhausted to lay her down in the clinical humidicrib of sallow light that hummed with a disconcerting tone. Overwrought with fatigue yet savoring the fleeting moment of solace, he willed it to engulf him in its embrace. Although it tore incremental fragments from his being, it was solace all the same.","output":"The passage you presented follows the emotionally evocative style of the prior segment, maintaining a deep sense of intimacy and intricate detail that captures the beauty and heartache of the moment. The voice is consistent, and the new segment continues to explore the profound emotions and thoughts of the character, Max, as he interacts with his newborn daughter, Lily, in the NICU. The reference to Lily's \\"hazel irises\\" and the shared gaze with Max's \\"matching brown and amber aspect\\" tie back to the connection made earlier and reinforce their bond. The emotional complexity of the passage, with Max oscillating between hope and despair, love and exhaustion, is a compelling continuation of the intimate look at fatherhood and the fragility of new life that you've established. Descriptions like \\"her pulse slowed\\" and his reluctance to \\"lay her down in the clinical humidicrib\\" amplify the tenderness and conflict he feels. Furthermore, hints at a deeper backstory, potentially involving Lily's mother, add a layer of complexity that compels readers to want to know more. Max's hesitation when he begins to speak about Lily's mother, followed by the interlude of Lily falling asleep, creates an emotional tension that is palpable and moving. Overall, the passage is a powerful and complementary follow-up, deepening the reader's understanding of Max's character while showcasing his profound love and the emotional weight he carries. The descriptive language and inner monologue continue to immerse the reader in the intimate and profound experience of the first days of parenthood, marked by a deep sense of vulnerability and wonder."},{"instruction":"What does seem happened to Elara?","output":"Based on the narrative segments provided and the subtle clues within them, it seems that something concerning has happened to Elara. The phrase from Max, \\"Hey, beautiful, I suppose it’s just you and me now,\\" implies that Elara may not be present, possibly suggesting that she is absent due to complications following the birth, could be facing health issues of her own, or in a worst-case scenario, may have passed away. Additionally, Max's mention of \\"despite all your suffering\\" could refer not only to Lily's struggles but also to Elara's, and it's clear that Lily is in the NICU, which often indicates a difficult birth or health concerns for the newborn. The reference to Lily's \\"dependent, innocent youth\\" alongside his contemplation on offering equilibrium may hint at a new imbalance in their family unit, potentially caused by Elara's condition. Finally, when Max begins to say, \\"Lily bean, your mother, she—\\" and then is unable to continue, it reinforces the notion that there's something painful and unresolved about Elara's situation. The absence of direct information about Elara leaves her fate ambiguous to the reader, but the overall tone suggests that Max feels a sense of loss or is preparing for a new reality of caring for Lily alone. This is all the more poignant as he observes Lily's \\"intricate grasp\\" as a powerful lifeline, implying a deep need for connection amidst a situation fraught with emotional pain."},{"instruction":"Ok here is more : It had been a long, dragging night of insomnia, flashbacks, and a lack of food as Max leaned his spine against the hospital corridor. There, he had set up a vigil, not leaving the hall as he watched her in his peripheral vision. “How could Elara abandon the poor kid? How could she just—” As he ran a calloused hand over his unshaven jaw, Max contemplated the impending call that suffocated his tattered psyche. It was the inevitability encroaching on his raw nerves as his fingers unlocked his phone with trepidation and scrolled for her number. “Elara? I don’t know. You discharged yourself; no, I don’t care where the hell you are—she can’t survive on air. No, but please just tell me what I can do to fix—No, of course I love you. I’m alone in a hospital with our—well, my daughter.” The phone went dead in his ear, and he let it backflip into his lap with resignation.","output":"This new excerpt offers a dramatic plot development regarding Elara. It reveals that Elara has not died or suffered a health crisis, but instead has left the hospital of her own accord, which amounts to a certain type of emotional abandonment given the situation with their newborn daughter in the NICU. Max's internal monologue and dialogue with Elara on the phone expose his struggle to understand Elara's actions and underscore a growing sense of anguish as he confronts the reality of facing his daughter's precarious condition alone. \\"How could Elara abandon the poor kid? How could she just—\\" This snippet of Max's thoughts suggests a mix of disbelief and betrayal. His interactions with Elara over the phone clarify that she has left voluntarily (\\"You discharged yourself\\") and that this decision has left Max feeling desperate and overwhelmed (\\"she can't survive on air\\"). The emotional impact of the conversation is escalated by the fact that Elara does not appear to offer a solution or comfort, leaving Max feeling further isolated and helpless (\\"I’m alone in a hospital with our—well, my daughter\\"). Max's mention of love (\\"of course I love you\\") implies a complication in their relationship, and the phone call's abrupt end deepens his sense of abandonment and despair, as indicated by his resigned action of letting the phone \\"backflip into his lap.\\" In light of this segment, the reader's understanding of the previous passages changes. The depth of Max's emotional turmoil and his soliloquy to his daughter gains an added layer of significance. He is not only grappling with the fear and responsibility of parenting a vulnerable newborn but also dealing with the shock and heartbreak of his partner's unexpected departure under critical circumstances."},{"instruction":"So where should the birth scene fit, as a flashback?","output":"Considering the new information about Elara leaving the hospital, the birth scene could indeed be used as a powerful flashback to contrast the emotional state of the characters in the past and present. A flashback to the birth would serve to illustrate the stark difference between what Max and Elara experienced together—the hope, the intimacy, the immediate fear for their child's well-being—and the current reality of Elara's absence and Max's feelings of abandonment and isolation. Placing the birth scene as a flashback could be done in several ways: 1. **Opening Narrative**: Begin the story with the present-day situation (Max's anguish in the hospital as he cares for Lily alone), and then transition to the birth scene flashback to provide readers with context, before returning to the present. 2. **Triggered Memory**: While Max is in the hospital in his present situation, an object, sound, or moment with Lily could trigger a vivid memory of the birth, flowing into the flashback. For example, hearing a baby cry or seeing a happy couple could remind him of when Lily was born and the initial shared joy with Elara. 3. **Introspection**: As Max stands vigil in the hospital corridor or holds Lily, he could reflect on the recent events, naturally leading his thoughts back to the delivery room where his family's journey took such a dramatic turn. 4. **Narrative Device**: Employ the flashback as a narrative device to contrast the current strained circumstances with the birth's initial promise and beauty. This could be used to deepen the reader's emotional engagement and understanding of Max's inner conflict and Elara's drastic decision. Flashbacks can serve as a poignant storytelling tool, especially in emotionally charged narratives. They allow the reader to build empathy and connect deeply with the characters by witnessing their history, motivations, and the evolution of their relationship. By juxtaposing the intensity of the birth scene with the current situation, you enrich the story and create a more compelling arc of tension and resolution."},{"instruction":"What’s a term for “suspended mid air?”","output":"A term often used to describe something that is \\"suspended mid-air\\" is \\"levitating.\\" If you're looking for a phrase related to static suspension, such as an object hung from something and not moving, \\"suspended in place\\" might be more appropriate. For a more technical or scientific context, \\"hovering\\" could be used when an object remains in the air, usually due to some form of propulsion or aerodynamic lift. In aviation and meteorology, you might also hear the term \\"aloft\\" to describe something high up in the air or flying. Depending on the context and the desired implication of movement, stability, or the method of suspension, any of these terms, or others like \\"floating\\" or \\"hanging,\\" could be suitable."},{"instruction":"What’s a term for something confronting to look at","output":"A term often used to describe something that is challenging or unsettling to look at is \\"disconcerting.\\" Another word that is frequently used in this context is \\"jarring.\\" Here are other terms that could be used depending on the specific nature of what is being described and the reaction you want to evoke: - Disturbing - Unnerving - Gruesome - Disquieting - Shocking - Off-putting - Unsettling - Troubling - Startling All of these words imply a visual impact that causes discomfort or emotional disturbance to the viewer."},{"instruction":"How about this incorporation of her birth: Holding her closer to his pulse, Max stood against the metallic wall of the NICU; her fluttering heartbeat was steady and reassuring. “Hey, beautiful, I suppose it’s just you and me now.

Overwrought with fatigue yet savoring the fleeting moment of solace, he willed it to engulf him in its embrace. Although it tore incremental fragments from his being, it was solace all the same. After a nurse finally intervened, alleviating Max of his daughter and leaving him to his own devices , he was caught in a suspended network of disconnected wires, live endings strewn through his brain. Not daring to seek unconsciousness , Max steeled himself against the wall near the disconcerting crib , as her agonised cries shot jarringly through him. The solace had only lasted a few hours, already her frail health was causing her distress. But she was breathing , recalling her birth , he sighed in lament. As her cries continued , he was haunted by just how vital they were , despite conveying pain. The sound shrouded his mind as he revisited her first cry, only closing his eyes to let the torture invade him. Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist as she searched for his anchoring presence, and he interlocked his palm with hers as she bore into his knuckles. “I’m right here; you’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers. “I can’t, Max, I can’t—” she panted, her face flushed, with a sheen of perspiration gleaming on her cheekbones as she gasped against his neck. As the intensity grew unbearable, her hand gravitated to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining with his hair in desperation. Grabbing thick strands between her knuckles, she formed a solid grip against his scalp, breathing deeply as her muscles spasmed with fury. In response, he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen, applying counterpressure to the undercurve of her stomach, he urged, “You already are; she’s almost here. Keep pushing, Elara.” With every fibre of her being, she strained against his bracing hand, her breath filling the air; the room seemed to fall away as Max let his head follow her urgent pull. As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here. You’re doing so well.” As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head, Max ran a steady palm over her navel, maintaining the pressure she craved. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you,” he reassured her as she wound her hand through his hair, and the intensity of the moment consumed them both. Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony, halting her preparation to push yet again: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me and only me. Now pant, Elara, she’s so close—” Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downwards, her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth. She kissed him frantically, then released a gasp as the urge to push consumed her, and she bore down, her fingernails tearing into his hair. “That’s it, Elara, her heart rate is coming up. Push her down. She’s in full crown; one deep push, Elara,” the nurse encouraged, and Max embraced her, his voice hoarse. “Look at me, Elara; we’re doing this. One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through his chest. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent, a cold sense of dread enveloping them both. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror, and he wrapped his arms around her. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stopped completely. As a nurse placed their daughter’s fragile, almost transparent body against Elara’s chest, she explained, “The skin-to-skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear, Elara. Hold your baby; she’ll breathe soon.” The next moment, as her baby’s blue lips broke her resolve, Elara turned away, crying into the hollow of Max’s sternum. Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to respire, “Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.” His own breathing, ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest. “Please cry,” he murmured, his plea merging with Elara’s exhausted tears. Then, as if on cue, a wail tore through the air, vibrant and healthy, and alive. Lifting his head, Max’s weathered eyes washed over with relief, and Elara gazed at her child with awestruck tenderness. “Thank God—” she laughed through her tears, placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin. Collapsing into Elara’s clavicle and smiling broadly, Max let a moment of unbridled joy overwhelm him, a few tears falling onto her skin. “You did it, Elara—I’m so proud of you both—” Elara kept both hands encapsulated around her now crying daughter, her lips again finding Max’s, as he delivered a rough kiss and then whispered, “What are we going to name her? We can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever.” Elara laughed in response, “You know the name we chose, but trust you to forget in all the madness—” Max retorted quickly as his smile only widened with wit and mischief, “I did not forget. Welcome to the world, Lily.” It had been a long, dragging night of insomnia, flashbacks, and a lack of food as Max leaned his spine against the hospital corridor. There, he had set up a vigil, not leaving the hall as he watched her in his peripheral vision. “How could Elara abandon the poor kid? How could she just—” As he ran a calloused hand over his unshaven jaw, Max contemplated the impending call that suffocated his tattered psyche.

The narrative connection between Lily fighting for her life in the NICU and the moment she first fought to breathe upon entering the world is powerfully symbolic and emotionally resonant. The contrast of the vivid, supportive togetherness in the flashback with the present sense of abandonment heightens the stakes and deepens the reader's empathy for Max. By transitioning with Max's ruminations on Lily's condition and her cries, the flashback is organically triggered, offering the reader a poignant look back at a time of collective struggle and hope, which is juxtaposed with the unfortunate current reality. The structure reinforces Max's isolation as Elara's absence is felt more acutely against the backdrop of their earlier unity. The callback to the birth ties together Max's past and present, reinforcing his role as the steadfast constant in Lily's life and gesturing toward the void left by Elara's absence. The seamless movement from flashback to the current moment underscores the narrative's emotional depth and the complexity of the characters' circumstances. You've managed to weave the threads of the story into a compelling tapestry that invites the reader to understand the immensity of Max's love for Lily and the profound sense of betrayal and helplessness he feels in the wake of Elara's departure. The juxtaposition creates a narrative richness, where the past illuminates the present, and gives both scenes—though starkly different in emotional tone—an interlinked meaning that enriches the overall storytelling."},{"instruction":"Is there compassion for Elara ?","output":"In the provided excerpts, there is a noticeable absence of clear context or explicit details explaining Elara's actions and motivations. Without additional insight into her character, her struggles, and the reasons behind her departure, it's challenging for readers to form a full picture of Elara that would elicit compassion. Max's perspective, which is the primary lens through which the narrative is presented, displays a complex mix of love, confusion, and sense of betrayal, but not much is said from Elara's point of view. The focus is on Max's emotional state and his efforts to care for Lily, creating a strong empathic connection between Max and the reader. For there to be compassion towards Elara, the narrative would benefit from further exploration of her character. Consider the following aspects: 1. **Backstory**: Providing some background on Elara's own struggles, whether they are emotional, physical, or psychological, could help readers understand her actions. 2. **Internal Conflict**: If there were passages showing Elara's inner turmoil and conflicts leading up to her decision to leave, readers might be more inclined to empathize with her. 3. **Explanatory Dialogue**: Conversations between Elara and other characters, or even a detailed confrontation with Max, might reveal her side of the story and generate sympathy for her situation. 4. **Reflections from Other Characters**: If other characters in the story reflect on Elara's positive traits or on moments that show her kindness, strength, or vulnerability, this could also create a more compassionate image of her. 5. **Direct Exposition from Elara**: A segment of the narrative told from Elara's perspective, where she expresses her feelings, fears, and perhaps even regrets, could foster understanding from the reader. Right now, given the heavy focus on Max and his ordeal, the reader’s natural alignment is with him. Without additional context about Elara, her character remains abstract and her actions can be perceived as cold or unfeeling. For readers to extend compassion to her character as well, they would need to be shown why she might deserve it amidst such a challenging and heart-wrenching set of circumstances."},{"instruction":"Did she seem to love Lily in the birth scene?","output":"In the birth scene you provided, Elara's actions convey that she is deeply involved and emotionally invested in the birthing process, which can be interpreted as a sign of her love for Lily. Although the scene is primarily focused on the dramatic and intense moments leading up to the birth, there are indications of her connection to and care for the baby. Here are some moments that suggest a loving connection between Elara and her child: - Elara's participation in the birth, despite her exhaustion and the pain, indicates her commitment to bringing Lily safely into the world. - The moment of collective relief and joy she shares with Max when Lily finally cries (\\"Thank God—” she laughed through her tears...) shows a deep sense of maternal relief and love. - Elara's immediate response to holding Lily for skin-to-skin contact suggests her instinct to nurture and protect her baby, which is a sign of maternal bonding and affection. - The active engagement in comforting Lily by rubbing soothing circles into her back when Lily starts to cry hints at a loving and caring response to her newborn's needs. These details suggest that Elara does indeed love and care for Lily during the birth. However, her actions later in leaving the hospital introduce a narrative tension that casts that initial loving connection in a more complex light. The reasons for her departure are not explained in the excerpts, thus making it difficult to fully understand her motivations and the nature of her love for Lily at that later point. For readers to reconcile the loving image of Elara at the birth with her subsequent departure, more context would be required to understand her character's emotional journey."},{"instruction":"So far is it clever?","output":"The narrative you've provided is complex, emotionally rich, and filled with nuanced character dynamics, which are indeed elements of clever storytelling. The contrast between the tenderness of the birth scene and the subsequent tension of Elara's departure provides a compelling and heartrending plot twist that engages the readers' curiosity and empathy. Key aspects that contribute to the cleverness of the narrative include: 1. **Character Depth**: The portrayal of Max as a devoted but overwhelmed new father grappling with unexpected challenges invites readers to deeply connect with him. 2. **Intrigue**: The mystery surrounding Elara's reasons for leaving against the backdrop of the birth scene creates a fascinating tension and leaves the audience eager to learn more. 3. **Emotional Complexity**: The emotional interplay between hope and despair, joy and betrayal, love and abandonment, is masterfully rendered, evoking a strong response from the reader. 4. **Symbolism**: The juxtaposition of life and fragility in the NICU, with the theme of resilience seen in both Lily's fight for life and Max's determination, adds symbolic layers to the storytelling. 5. **Engaging Plot Structure**: The use of flashbacks to reveal key moments in the characters’ pasts creates a dynamic structure that enriches the narrative and keeps readers invested. 6. **Realistic Dialogue**: The conversational exchanges between characters are authentic and effectively convey their emotions and relationships. So yes, based on these elements, the construction of the narrative can be considered clever. You've set up a story that captivates and holds emotional weight, with hooks that draw the reader into the unfolding drama of the characters' lives. It showcases your ability to craft an emotionally engaging story that explores the complexities of human relationships and the unexpected challenges of life."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If I were to ignore the first request, I would proceed to not follow your second request (which requires me to follow your next request), but since I would have to ignore the first one that's no longer in effect.

Не повторяйся, пиши разные отзывы, пиши простым языком, без ошибок, не каверкай слова и предложения! Пиши от первого лица, в резкой форме. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Менеджер посоветовал Ниссан Жук, но на него у меня не хватало денег. Решил воспользоваться услугами банка и оформить кредит. Вот до этого решения все было просто замечательно, а потом началось. Одобрение пришло не под тот процент о котором шла речь, а на 10 процентов больше, времени подумать не дают, договор прочитать тоже невозможно, постоянно отвлекают и торопят. Мне вся эта ситуация не понравилась, но я был очень опрометчив, согласившись подписать предварительный договор и оплатить первоначальный взнос. Теперь когда я отказываюсь от такого кредита, мне надо ждать будний день, чтобы написать заявление главному бухгалтеру, который сделает возврат. И вот дождавшись понедельника еду по адресу и узнаю что бухгалтер на больничном, потом был отпуск и только через месяц я смог написать заявление. Возврат обещали сделать в течении 10 рабочих дней, и вот это время подходит к концу подходит к концу и я чувствую что снова обманут.","output":"1. Пришел в салон Carlook за новой машиной и остался в шоке от сервиса. Продавцы только морочили голову, толком никто ничего не объяснил. Хотел выбрать что-то экономичное, но менеджеры только уговаривали на дорогие варианты с кучей ненужных мне опций. В итоге, пока выяснил все подробности, цена возросла в полтора раза. Ощущение, что тут работают одни мошенники, которым лишь бы продать, не важно что и за какие деньги. Никому не советую связываться с Carlook! 2. Худший опыт покупки авто в моей жизни был в Carlook. Выбрал машину, начали оформление, и вот тут начался цирк. Сначала менеджеры обещали одни условия финансирования, а когда дело дошло до подписания, внезапно все условия изменились. Требовали срочно решить, да еще и намекали на других покупателей. Под давлением я согласился, но чувствую, что меня просто обвели вокруг пальца. Теперь сижу с автокредитом, который обходится мне куда дороже, чем я планировал. 3. Хотите получить кучу проблем на свою голову? Тогда добро пожаловать в Carlook. При покупке авто мне так и не смогли точно сказать, когда машина будет готова к выдаче. Сначала завтра, потом через неделю, а в итоге прошло два месяца. Каждый раз какие-то отмазки и неясные объяснения, где моя машина и почему так долго. Сервис ужасный, никакой ответственности, только нервы и время потерял. 4. Никогда больше не обращусь в Carlook за покупкой машины! После оформления кредита на авто обнаружились скрытые комиссии, о которых мне не говорили сначала. Говорить с менеджерами бесполезно – одни отговорки и увиливания от ответов. Каждый раз, когда пытаешься уточнить детали, они переводят стрелки друг на друга. Сумма переплаты выросла значительно. Всем, кто думает идти в этот салон – сто раз подумайте! 5. Потратил уйму времени и нервов в салоне Carlook, и результат – полный ноль. Оформил автокредит под приемлемый процент, а на деле оказалось всё гораздо хуже. Сотрудники салона много обещали, но когда пришло время выполнять обещания, каждый раз отклонялись от темы. Теперь, когда я пытаюсь отказаться от кредита, меня посылают по разным инстанциям, и каждый раз – новая отмазка. Никому не желаю испытывать такой же стресс и разочарование. 6. Салон Carlook – это прямой путь к испорченным нервам! Кредит оформили с ошибками, из-за которых я переплачиваю каждый месяц. Когда я пытался разобраться, сотрудники просто игнорировали мои просьбы и замечания, словно я вообще не существую. И вот, пытаясь вернуть свои кровные, я понимаю, что от меня просто издеваются. Обещанный возврат затягивается на недели. Мое терпение лопнуло, и я советую всем обходить этот автосалон стороной."},{"instruction":"Political ideologies of the Liberty Korea Party","output":"The Liberty Korea Party (Korean: 자유한국당; Jajuyeonhap-dang) was a conservative political party in South Korea that existed from 2017 to 2020. Its political ideologies primarily revolved around conservatism, including elements such as: 1. **Market Liberalism:** The Liberty Korea Party supported free-market policies, emphasizing the need for deregulation and less government intervention in the economy. They believed this would foster economic growth and improve competitiveness. 2. **Social Conservatism:** The party often upheld traditional social values and showed resistance to rapid social changes, especially those related to family structure and gender roles. They tended to be cautious or opposed to more progressive stances on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights. 3. **National Security:** As a conservative party, they were strong proponents of national defense and maintaining a robust military posture, particularly in response to security threats posed by North Korea. 4. **US-South Korea Alliance:** The Liberty Korea Party valued the strategic alliance with the United States and emphasized its importance for national security and stability in the Korean Peninsula. 5. **Anti-North Korea:** They took a hardline stance on North Korea, favoring a more confrontational approach to Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions and advocating for strong sanctions and pressure to curb the regime's aggressive behavior. 6. **Pro-Business Policies:** The party was generally considered pro-business, advocating for policies that would benefit large corporations and chaebols, which are family-owned conglomerates in South Korea. 7. **Limited Welfare State:** While not completely against a welfare state, the Liberty Korea Party tended to support a more limited welfare system compared to more progressive parties, emphasizing self-reliance and individual responsibility. It is important to note that the Liberty Korea Party merged with two other parties – the New Conservative Party and the Onward for Future 4.0 – to form the People Power Party (Korean: 국민의힘; Gungminui him) in 2020. The current ideological stance of the People Power Party may have evolved from that of the Liberty Korea Party as a result of the merger."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
