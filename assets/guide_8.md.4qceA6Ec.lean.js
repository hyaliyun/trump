It protects them from deadly and contagious diseases that can cause severe health complications or even death. Vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent illnesses that can cause harm to children and their families. The benefits of vaccination go beyond individual health. When a large number of people in a community are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity and protects those who cannot receive vaccinations for medical reasons. This is particularly important for infants who are too young to receive some vaccines, or children with certain medical conditions. Vaccines are rigorously tested and carefully monitored for safety. They prevent diseases that were once common, like measles and polio, from spreading in our communities. Vaccines have eradicated previously widespread illnesses such as smallpox, and have decreased the occurrence of others like the flu and HPV. However, despite scientific evidence and medical consensus on the benefits and safety of vaccination, there are still some who choose not to vaccinate their children. This can have dangerous consequences not just for their own family, but for the larger community as well. Unvaccinated children can become carriers of disease and pass it on to others who may not be able to fend off the illness. So let me be clear: vaccination is not just a choice for your individual family, it is a choice for the health and safety of our entire community. For the sake of our children’s health and the greater good of society, we all have a responsibility to get our children vaccinated. In conclusion, vaccination is a vital tool in protecting the health of our children and our communities. The benefits of vaccination are clear and well-documented, and the risks are extremely low. So I urge you to talk to your doctor and get your children vaccinated today."},{"instruction":"What is the value of pi to two decimal places?","output":"3.14."},{"instruction":"Visiting a new city","output":"1.

The law applies to public companies based in California. Companies with five board members must have at least two women by 2021, while those with six or more need three. Supporters of the law say it will promote gender equality and diversity in the workplace, while critics argue it is unconstitutional and interferes with companies' decisions.","output":"California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a law that requires companies based in California to have at least one woman on their board of directors. This move aims to promote gender equality and diversity in the workplace. The law applies to public companies, and those with five board members must have at least two women by 2021. Meanwhile, those with six or more must have at least three. Supporters of the law believe that promoting women's representation will bring much-needed diversity to the workplace. Many studies indicate that increasing diversity enhances financial performance, improves corporate governance, and leads to a more productive corporate culture. However, critics argue that the law is unconstitutional, and the state should not interfere with the decisions of privately held companies. They suggest that companies are already working to promote diversity, and the state law may lead to a \\"token\\" presence of women on boards, rather than genuine change in corporate culture. Despite the criticism, Governor Newsom believes that California must set an example for the rest of the nation when it comes to promoting gender equality in the workplace. Some companies in California, like Google, have already taken steps to promote diversity by hiring more women, including at the leadership level. However, others have been criticized for being predominantly male and white, such as Tesla, whose board of directors only had two women among its nine members until recently. Overall, while the law has been controversial, many hope that it will lead to progress for gender equality in California's boardrooms. Time will tell if the law has a positive impact or not."},{"instruction":"this a good or bad review? The burgers were delicious, but the service was painfully slow.

There has been much debate over the impact of social media on teenagers' mental health. Many experts believe that social media use can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. One of the ways that social media can negatively affect teenagers' mental health is through cyberbullying. This is a form of bullying that takes place online or through social media. Cyberbullying can have serious consequences for the mental health of the victim, including depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide. Another way that social media can impact teenagers' mental health is through social comparison. On social media, users are constantly exposed to curated images of other people's lives. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and depression. Additionally, excessive social media use can lead to sleep disturbance, which can negatively affect mental health. Studies have shown that teenagers who spend more time on social media are at a higher risk of sleep problems, which can lead to depression and anxiety. There are also concerns about the addictive nature of social media. Many teenagers report feeling a compulsion to check their social media accounts regularly, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being. In conclusion, while social media can have its benefits, it is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts it can have on teenagers' mental health. Parents and caregivers should monitor their children's social media use and encourage them to take breaks from it when necessary. Additionally, schools and communities should work to promote digital citizenship and provide resources for those who may be struggling with the negative effects of social media."},{"instruction":"w long should you marinate the chicken?","output":"It depends on the recipe, but typically it is recommended to marinate chicken for at least 30 minutes to several hours, or overnight for more intense flavor."},{"instruction":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform social reasoning?","output":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform social reasoning could involve interpreting social cues, understanding others' perspectives, and making decisions in social situations."},{"instruction":"Write the next line in the following set of directions.

Coral bleaching, which occurs when the ocean temperature rises, could lead to the death of the world's largest coral reef system.

The Great Barrier Reef, which spans over 1,400 miles, is home to a vast array of marine creatures, including fish, turtles, and sharks. The coral reefs provide a vital habitat for these endangered species. However, rising ocean temperatures due to climate change have caused coral to die or bleach, leaving the ecosystem vulnerable to collapse. Environmentalists worldwide have called for immediate action to reduce carbon emissions to prevent further warming of the oceans. Recent efforts by the Australian government have been hailed as a positive step, including its pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. However, experts argue that this is not enough, and more must be done to tackle climate change. In conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to the Great Barrier Reef.

(CNN) The world's largest rainforest, the Amazon, is experiencing a record number of forest fires this year, with a 84% increase over the same period last year, according to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research. The fires, which are often started by farmers and loggers who use slashandburn techniques to clear land, are having a severe impact on the environment and the planet as a whole. Smoke from the fires is visible from space and has already traveled thousands of miles, impacting air quality and contributing to climate change. What is the likely impact of the Amazon fires on the environment and global climate? OPTIONS: The Amazon fires could lead to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to accelerating climate change and global warming. Forest fires in the Amazon could lead to devastating environmental consequences for the millions of species of plants and animals that call the rainforest home. The rise of forest fires in the Amazon may fuel a greater urgency for governments to develop and implement sustainable land use policies. The environmental impact of the Amazon fires could be felt worldwide, especially for people living in densely populated cities where air quality has already been impacted. The Amazon fires are part of a broader trend of deforestation and the destruction of tropical ecosystems, leading to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Wildfires in the Amazon could lead to a global shortage of certain types of food and building materials that rely on the rainforest ecosystem. Addressing the root causes of forest fires in the Amazon could require a coordinated international effort to reduce demand for environmentally destructive practices like palm oil and clearcutting. The destruction of the Amazon could lead to longterm environmental changes that scientists have yet to fully understand, including changing ocean currents and rising sea levels. Wildfires in the Amazon could have unintended consequences, such as the spread of invasive species or the loss of traditional indigenous knowledge and practices. The Amazon fires could have significant economic implications for countries that depend on the rainforest for timber, agricultural products. and other exports.","output":"The likely impact of the Amazon fires on the environment and global climate is that they could lead to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to accelerating climate change and global warming."},{"instruction":"The nurse gave the patient a shot because he was in pain.

This light energy is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen gas. The overall equation for this process is: Carbon dioxide + water + light energy → glucose + oxygen Photosynthesis takes place in two stages, the light-dependent reactions, and the light-independent reactions (also called the Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts and involve the absorption of light energy which is then used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH. These energy-carrying molecules then fuel the light-independent reactions which take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. In these reactions, carbon dioxide from the air is used to synthesize glucose and other organic compounds."},{"instruction":"Which title best conveys the topic?

The Labor Department announced that there were 160,000 new jobs added last month, well below the 200,000 that economists predicted. The latest employment figures show that job creation has slowed for three consecutive months, a development that is indicative of a labor market that may be losing momentum. The unemployment rate held steady at 5%, however, the unchanged stats point towards only marginal improvment. The data also revealed that the manufacturing sector lost 4,000 jobs while the mining sector continued to shed positions due to low oil prices. In contrast, the construction and healthcare industries exhibited the strongest gains, with 45,000 and 44,000 new jobs added respectively. The professional and business services sector added 25,000 positions, an industry in which the majority of workers are employed in roles including accounting, architecture, and consulting services. The report also revealed average hourly earnings rose 8 cents to an average of 25.53 per hour, culminating in a growth rate of 2.5% from a year earlier – a modest rise in pay that is not keeping up with the expectations of the employees.

Protein intake: Plant sources of protein are not as easily absorbed by the body as animal sources of protein. Vegetarians need to ensure they are consuming enough protein to maintain their health.

The author argues that stricter gun control measures are necessary to prevent these tragic incidents from happening in the future. It is hard to ignore the fact that the US has the highest number of gun-related deaths compared to other developed countries. The author highlights this issue, pointing out that easy access to firearms is contributing to the problem. This is not just a matter of regulating who can legally purchase a gun, but also what kind of guns are on the market. The author suggests that more comprehensive background checks and a ban on assault weapons are among the measures needed to control gun violence. It is hard to argue against these measures since they are intended to keep guns out of the hands of those who may pose a danger to society. Such measures could prevent individuals with a history of mental illness or criminal activity from acquiring guns and carrying out mass shootings. In conclusion, the author's argument that stricter gun control measures are necessary seems reasonable in light of the current situation in the US. While gun control is a complex issue, we need to take action to prevent senseless violence from occurring.

After your warm-up, it's important to stretch to prepare your muscles for the exercises ahead. Focus on stretching the muscle groups you'll be targeting in your workout. Next, perform each exercise for the prescribed number of repetitions. Be sure to use proper form and technique to avoid injury and get the most benefit from each exercise. Rest when needed to prevent exhaustion and overexertion. It's okay to take short breaks between sets or exercises. After completing your workout, take some time to cool down and stretch again. This will help prevent post-workout soreness and reduce the risk of injury. In summary, a good workout routine involves choosing a routine that aligns with your fitness goals, warming up, stretching, performing each exercise with proper form, taking breaks when needed, cooling down and stretching again. Follow these steps and you'll be well on your way to achieving your fitness goals."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise The Mona Lisa is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, can we infer the hypothesis Leonardo da Vinci created other paintings?","output":"Yes.

while (scanf(\\"%d\\", &n) != EOF) { int i, last = 0; // last表示上一次被踢出圈的人的编号 for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) { last = (last + 2) % i; // 每次求出被踢出圈的人的编号 } printf(\\"%dn\\", last + 1); // 最后剩下的人的编号为last加1 } return 0; }"},{"instruction":"时间超限了，能再简化吗？","output":"可以再简化一下，我们可以推导出公式来直接求出最后剩下的人的编号，而不必循环计算。具体如下： 设最后剩下的人的编号为f(n, m)，表示从n个人中报数，每次报到m的人出圈的情况下，最后剩下的人的编号。 我们先考虑n=1的情况，只有一个人的时候他就是最后剩下的人，即f(1, m) = 0。 然后我们考虑从n个人中报数，每次报到m的人出圈的情况，假设最后剩下的人的编号是x。我们可以将这n个人编号为0,1,2,...,n-1，第一次出圈的人的编号是(m-1)%n，剩下的人重新编号为0,1,2,...,n-2。我们假设从这n-1个人中报数，每次报到m的人出圈，最后剩下的人的编号是y。根据上面的推导，我们有： y = f(n-1, m) 因为我们将剩下的人重新编号为0,1,2,...,n-2，所以x也相应地减少了一个n，即： x = (y + m) % n = (f(n-1, m) + m) % n 将y代入上式，得到： x = (f(n-1, m) + m) % n = [f(n-1, m) + (m % n)] % n 因为m小于n，所以m % n = m，我们有： f(n, m) = [f(n-1, m) + m] % n 最终的递推公式就是f(n, m) = [f(n-1, m) + m] % n。初始值是f(1, m) = 0，使用递推法计算出f(n, m)，最后输出f(n, m) + 1即可。 最后剩下的人的编号只与n和m有关，而不是具体的人的编号，所以可以直接用公式进行计算。这样可以大大降低时间复杂度，时间复杂度为O(n)。 代码如下： #include <stdio.h> int main() { int n, m; while (scanf(\\"%d\\", &n) != EOF) { scanf(\\"%d\\", &m); int last = 0, i; for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) { last = (last + m) % i; } printf(\\"%dn\\", last + 1); } return 0; }"},{"instruction":"能简化成O(1)吗？","output":"可以将时间复杂度进一步降低到O(1)。我们可以使用数学方法求解最后剩下的人的编号。 假设我们把n个人从0到n-1编号，每次删除第m个人。假如我们已经删除了k个人。这时候我们要删除第m个人，考虑第k+m个人的位置。 第k个人的编号为i。第k+m个人的编号为(k+m)%n。 现在可以规约成一个序列删除倒数第m个的问题。设f(n,m)表示剩下一个人时的情况，即圆圈长度为1时的解。得到递推公式 f(i,m)=(f(i-1,m)+m)%i; (i>1) f(1,m)=0; 由于递推公式只涉及f(i-1,m)和f(i,m)i，可以采取递推的方式，一直求到i=n即可。 时间复杂度：O(1) 代码如下："},{"instruction":"代码呢？","output":"抱歉，这里是代码： \`\`\`C #include<stdio.h> int main() { int n, m; while (scanf(\\"%d%d\\", &n, &m) != EOF) { int ans = 0;

September 1931 in Neapel; † 2. Juli 1994 ebenda) war ein führender italienischer Kunsthändler und Galerist zeitgenössischer Kunst. 1980 legte er mit der Sammlung \\"Terrae Motus\\" den Grundstock für ein eigenes repräsentatives Museum zeitgenössischer Kunst in Neapel, einer Sammlung, die unter dem Eindruck der Katastrophe des Erdbebens vom 23. November 1980 geboren wurde.', 'Leben und Wirken.', 'Frühe Jahre.', 'Lucio Amelio wurde am 13. September 1931 in der Via dei Tribunali in Neapel geboren. Er hatte vier Schwestern – Marisa († 1981), Giuliana, Lina und Anna. Bedingt durch den Zweiten Weltkrieg zog die Familie mehrmals um und ließ sich ab 1944 für zwölf Jahre in Resina nieder. Nach dem Abschluss 1949 am Liceo scientifico und zwei Jahren Ingenieurfakultät schrieb Amelio sich für ein Architekturstudium an der Universität Neapel ein. Seit 1950 interessierte er sich für die moderne Kunst und besuchte die Quadriennale in Rom. Dort lernte er unter anderem die Werke von Alberto Burri, einem späteren documenta-Künstler, und die Malerei Armando De Stefanos kennen. 1951 wurde er Vorstandsmitglied bei „Corda Fratres“ (Federazione Internationale degli Studenti; Sezione Italiana), einer kulturellen studentischen Vereinigung an der Universität Neapel, die Auslandsreisen für Studenten organisierte. Ein Jahr später zeigte Lucio Amelio während einer Ausstellung sein erstes und einziges Gemälde, eine gerußte Kachel mit naiver Landschaft. 1953 trat er der Kommunistischen Partei Italiens bei und besuchte die Vorlesungen des italienischen Philosophen Gerardo Marotta.', 'Erste Künstlerbekanntschaften.', '1954 begleitete Amelio seinen Vater auf einer Geschäftsreise nach Deutschland und zog, von diesem Land beeindruckt, kurze Zeit später nach West-Berlin, wo ihm die TUSMA, eine studentische Arbeitsvermittlungsstelle der Technischen Universität Berlin, Aushilfsarbeiten vermittelte. Hier lernte er den Maler, Grafiker und späteren Galeristen Günter Wirth kennen, der ihn mit Freunden in Ost-Berlin bekanntmachte, unter anderem mit dem Dichter und Drehbuchautor Jens Gerlach, dem Komponisten und Nationalpreisträger Andre Asriel sowie mit dem Opernregisseur Friedrich Petzold (1928–1990). Danach arbeitete er längere Zeit im Konstruktionsbüro des Architekten Hermann Henselmann, der die Stalin-Allee baute. Als sein Vater 1958 starb, kehrte er im selben Jahr nach Neapel zurück und begann als Dolmetscher für Deutsch bei Cantieri Metallurgici Italiani, Bagnoli, zu arbeiten. Gleichzeitig schrieb er Stellengesuche und suchte über die Anzeigen der \\"Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung\\" nach einer Arbeit in Deutschland. Im folgenden Jahr zog Amelio nach Stuttgart und wurde Assistent eines Export-Unternehmens für Produkte der Bauchemie, das ihn 1963 zum Generaldirektor ihrer spanischen Niederlassung ernannte, woraufhin er nach Barcelona übersiedelte. Während eines Ausflugs auf den Pico Tibidabo im Juni desselben Jahres stürzte Amelio in ein fünf Meter tiefes Bauloch. Der Sturz fesselte ihn für sechs Monate ans Bett – eine Zeit, die er später als ein „Jahr des Todes und der Auferstehung“ bezeichnete und in der in ihm der Wunsch gereift sei, sich ganz der Kunst zu widmen.', 'Galeriegründung.', '1964 bezog Amelio zunächst Räume in der Via Michelangelo Schipa, daraufhin auf der Via del Parco Margherita 85. Dort, auf dem Vomero, gründete er 1965 in seiner Wohnung die \\"Modern Art Agency\\", in der er als eine der ersten Ausstellungen den Berliner Heiner Dilly präsentierte. Dilly gestaltete Grafiken und Gouachen in Form von Schriftgemälden, die als Reise-Notizen zu lesen waren. Obgleich die Ausstellung aufgrund fehlender Mittel keine klassische Eröffnung erfuhr, hatte sie doch einen gewissen Erfolg, da sie die Aufmerksamkeit des Kunstkritikers Filiberto Menna auf sich zog, der einer der ersten Kunden der Galerie wurde. Während der insgesamt sieben folgenden Ausstellungen im Jahr 1966 zeigte der Galerist Lucio Amelio am 1. Juni die erste Einzelausstellung des 1932 in Neapel geborenen Künstlers Carlo Alfano, die eine lebenslange Freundschaft und Zusammenarbeit zwischen Amelio und Alfano begründete. Des Weiteren lernte er während dieser Zeit Renato Guttuso und Max Ernst kennen.', 'Im Sommer 1969 bezog Amelio größere Räumlichkeiten im zweiten Stock auf der Piazza dei Martiri 58 in Neapel, die er im Dezember mit einer Ausstellung von Jannis Kounellis unter dem Titel \\"Il viaggio\\" eröffnete. Ab dem Jahr 1970 folgten insgesamt zwölf Ausstellungen, darunter eine von Michelangelo Pistoletto sowie von Stanley Brouwn und vom niederländischen Konzeptkünstler Marinus Boezem, der am 25. März 1970 in der Galerie ausstellte. 1971 wurde Amelio zum Handelsvertreter der italienischen Messeaussteller, der Comitato dell’Ente Fiera, ernannt, eine Position, die er zeitlebens beibehielt. Im selben Jahr reiste er nach New York und San Francisco und stellte im Februar vier Porträts von Andy Warhols \\"Jackie\\" aus.', '1975 feierte Lucio Amelio die ersten zehn Jahre seiner Galerietätigkeit, in denen er zuletzt Cy Twombly, Gilbert &amp; George sowie Jannis Kounellis gezeigt hatte, mit einer Reihe von Ausstellungen, darunter eine Gruppenausstellung in der Villa Volpicelli in Posillipo. Seine Galerie benannte er in \\"Galleria Lucio Amelio\\" um. Ab dem Jahr 1970 nahm Lucio Amelio am Kölner Kunstmarkt sowie den Kunstmessen in Düsseldorf und Berlin teil, wo er gleich im ersten Jahr 1970 Ileana Sonnabend kennenlernte.', 'Joseph Beuys und Andy Warhol.', 'Im September 1971, während einer von Klaus Staeck, Erwin Heerich und Joseph Beuys initiierten Arbeitskonferenz in Heidelberg mit dem Ziel, ein Konzept für die Organisation eines „internationalen freien Kunstmarkts“ zu erarbeiten, lernte Amelio den deutschen Künstler Joseph Beuys kennen. An dieser Konferenz nahmen neben den Initiatoren unter anderem Mario Merz, Jannis Kounellis, Panamarenko und Germano Celant teil. Zwischen Amelio und Beuys, dessen Werk er ab diesem Jahr mehrmals in seiner Galerie ausstellte, entwickelte sich in der Folge eine lebenslange Freundschaft. Amelios erste Beuys-Ausstellung \\"Ciclo sull’opera di Joseph Beuys 1946–1971\\" wurde am 13. November 1971 eröffnet; sie zeigte 130 Zeichnungen und Konzepte der betreffenden Jahre aus der Sammlung Lothar Schirmer. Das vom Künstler entworfene Plakat zur Ausstellung verwendete ein Foto, aufgenommen von Giancarlo Pancaldi im Oktober 1971, das Beuys vor dem Eingang der Villa Orlandi auf Anacapri zeigt, vor dem er sich in der Pose der zentralen mittleren männlichen Figur des Gemäldes \\"Der vierte Stand\\" von Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo – mit entschlossenem Ausdruck auf den Betrachter zumarschierend – ablichten ließ. Dem Foto ließ Beuys einen 1970 geprägten Satz hinzufügen: \\"La rivoluzione siamo Noi\\" \\"(Wir sind die Revolution)\\". 1972 folgte \\"Arena – Dove sarei arrivato se fossi stato intelligente!\\", eine großformatige Arbeit mit 100 Tafeln, bei der Beuys 264 Fotodokumente seiner autobiografischen Wirkungsgeschichte in 100 Aluminiumrahmen zusammenstellte und diese in der Form einer Arena in der Galerie anordnete. Da Amelios Modern Art Agency nicht genug Wandfläche hatte, verzichtete Beuys vollständig auf die Hängung und stellte die Rahmen stattdessen in unregelmäßigen Abständen in Gruppen nebeneinander auf.', 'Amelio organisierte mit einer ersten Ausstellung über Mario Merz am 20. November 1976 seine erste Ausstellungsreihe außerhalb der Galerie und zeigte zwischen 1977 und 1978 in der Villa Pignatelli in Neapel die Künstler Michelangelo Pistoletto, Jannis Kounellis, Pier Paolo Calzolari, Giulio Paolini, Beuys mit \\"Tracce in Italia\\" und Carlo Alfano. Im Oktober 1980 produzierte Lucio Amelio in Zusammenarbeit mit der RAI di Napoli für Rai 3 das in vier Folgen ausgestrahlte Programm \\"In mano al l’arte\\", unter der Regie von Fernando Belestra.', 'Nachdem Joseph Beuys und Andy Warhol sich im Mai 1979 in der Galerie Hans Mayer in Düsseldorf erstmals begegnet waren, trafen sich beide Künstler 1980 erneut in Neapel. Anlass war die Ausstellung \\"Joseph Beuys by Andy Warhol\\" am 1. April 1980 in Amelios Galerie, mit neun Siebdruckporträts, die Warhol von Beuys im Anschluss an ein Treffen in New York nach Polaroidaufnahmen hergestellt hatte. Zu Ehren der beiden Künstler arrangierte Amelio eine Zusammenkunft in der Sibyllengrotte von Cumae und im City Hall Café in der Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Neapel auf einem Fest, bei dem der Schauspieler, Regisseur und Sänger Leopoldo Mastelloni als Travestie-Künstler auftrat.', 'Sammlung „Terrae Motus“.', 'Nach dem schweren Erdbeben in Neapel vom November 1980, bei dem 2914 Menschen starben und 8850 verletzt wurden, organisierte Amelio eine Reihe von Ausstellungen mit dem Titel \\"Terrae Motus\\", mit Werken von mehr als 50 internationalen Künstlern zum Thema Erdbeben. Der Galerist Lucio Amelio nutzte seine weltweiten Verbindungen und „bot der Kunstszene das verwüstete Neapel als Metapher, als Thema und Motiv einer Endzeit- und Aufbruchstimmung an.“', 'Die Künstler.', 'Den Anfang machte am 17. April 1981 Joseph Beuys in der Galerie mit \\"Terremoto in Palazzo\\", 1981, einer Komposition aus vier Holztischen, die sich in unsicherem Gleichgewicht befanden, Glassplittern am Boden und einem auf einem der Tische aufrecht aufgestellten rohen Ei. Ein Jahr später, am 4. Dezember 1982, zeigte Andy Warhol \\"Fate presto\\", drei groß aufgezogene Reproduktionen der ersten Seite der neapolitanischen Tageszeitung \\"Il Mattino\\" vom 26. November 1980 mit dem Bericht über das Erdbeben.', 'Unter den weiteren Künstlern, die spontan Arbeiten zur Verfügung stellten, befanden sich unter anderem Siegfried Anzinger mit \\"Erdbeben\\", 1982; Miquel Barceló mit \\"L’ombra che tema\\", 1983; James Brown mit \\"Neapolitan tryptich\\", 1983; Tony Cragg mit \\"Senza titolo\\", 1983; Enzo Cucchi mit \\"Senza titolo\\", 1986; Luciano Fabro mit \\"Italia Porta\\", 1986; Gilbert &amp; George mit \\"Dying Youth\\", 1980; Keith Haring mit \\"Senza titolo\\", 1983; Richard Long mit \\"Vesuvius circle\\", 1984; Nino Longobardi mit \\"Senza titolo\\", 1983; Robert Mapplethorpe mit der Fotoreihe \\"Dennis Speight with thorns\\", \\"Jack with crown\\", \\"Scull with crossbones\\", \\"Jill Chapmann\\", \\"Dennis Speight with flowers\\"; Oswald Oberhuber mit \\"Senzo titolo\\", 1983; Mimmo Paladino mit \\"Re uccisi al decadere della forza\\", 1981; Giulio Paolini mit \\"L’altra figura\\", 1986; Michelangelo Pistoletto mit \\"Annunciazione Terrae Motus\\", 1962/84; Gerhard Richter mit \\"Statisch\\", 1982; Emilio Vedova mit \\"… Also ob… ’84−1\\", 1984 und Bill Woodrow mit \\"Fruit of the city\\", 1984.', 'Fondazione Amelio.', 'Lucio Amelio gründete im November 1982, gemeinsam mit seinen Schwestern Giuliana, Lina und Anna, eine Stiftung, die \\"Fondazione Amelio\\", ein Institut für zeitgenössische Kunst, das unter anderem dem Ziel d: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Galerist, Geboren 1931, Gestorben 1994, Italiener, Kunsthändler, Lucio Amelio, Neapel, Terrae Motus, Joseph Beuys, Andy Warhol"},{"instruction":"what does this code do: Sub padYear0000() Dim inputDate As String inputDate = ActiveCell.Value If Len(inputDate) > 0 Then 'Copy the formatted date to clipboard With CreateObject(\\"New:{1C3B4210-F441-11CE-B9EA-00AA006B1A69}\\") .SetText inputDate & \\"0000\\" .PutInClipboard End With MsgBox \\"The formatted date has been copied to the clipboard.\\" Else MsgBox \\"Invalid date format.

To understand the meaning of a text, the reader must use various cognitive strategies including monitoring comprehension. This refers to the ability to be aware of one's understanding of a text and to make adjustments when difficulties arise during reading. This literature review focuses on the concept of reading comprehension monitoring ability, its importance in reading comprehension, the relationship between monitoring ability and other factors that affect reading comprehension, and the strategies that can be used to develop monitoring skills. The review will draw on relevant studies published from 2013 to 2021. Importance of Reading Comprehension Monitoring Ability Reading comprehension monitoring ability is crucial to ensure that readers understand the meaning of a text accurately. Scholars have emphasized that the ability to monitor comprehension is linked to overall reading achievement (Sanacore & Palincsar, 2015). When readers are able to recognize when they are not understanding a text, they can engage in a range of metacognitive processes that help to improve their comprehension (MacKinnon, McDowell, & Bassetti, 2018). A study conducted by Cheung and Slavin (2013) investigated the effects of a reading comprehension monitoring strategy on the performance of fifth-grade students. The results revealed that the monitoring strategy improved reading comprehension skills and the students' ability to be self-aware when they encountered comprehension difficulties. Furthermore, students with high reading comprehension monitoring ability perform better on standardized tests than those with lower monitoring ability levels (Huang et al., 2018). Additionally, poor monitoring skills are linked to reading difficulties, such as slow reading rate, low accuracy, and poor retention of information (Silverman & Biemiller, 2013). Relationship between Monitoring Ability and Other Factors Affecting Reading Comprehension Several factors have been identified as affecting reading comprehension, including vocabulary knowledge, working memory capacity, and reading fluency. Studies have investigated whether reading comprehension monitoring ability is related to these factors. One study by Juel and Minden-Cupp (2016) emphasized that students with less vocabulary knowledge have difficulties in reading comprehension monitoring. Similarly, working memory capacity is related to monitoring ability. Students with high working memory can effectively monitor their comprehension, whereas students with low working memory have difficulty in monitoring their comprehension (Huang et al., 2018). Furthermore, students who have low reading fluency may struggle with comprehension monitoring as they have to devote more attention to word recognition than text comprehension. Therefore, reading comprehension monitoring is associated with the level of reading fluency (Sabatini, Shore, Holtzman, & Scarborough, 2017). Strategies for Developing Monitoring Skills Researchers have also developed strategies to enhance monitoring skills among struggling readers. Self-explanation is a strategy that requires readers to explain the meaning of the text they have read to themselves. This process encourages readers to monitor their comprehension actively (Zhang, Lin, Wang, & Zhou, 2019). Another strategy is the use of a reading log, which encourages students to record their comprehension process and reflect on their reading strategies (Mahapatra & Kim, 2019). The Think-Aloud strategy requires the reader to verbalize their thought processes and make them explicit, which can help them to become aware of their reading comprehension monitoring (Sanacore & Palincsar, 2015). The use of computer-assisted instruction is also effective in enhancing reading comprehension monitoring. For instance, computer-assisted monitoring can develop students' awareness of their comprehension difficulty and prompt them to use appropriate reading strategies (Li & Chen, 2020). Additionally, teacher-led instruction is essential for developing the monitoring abilities of students with reading difficulties. Conclusion Monitoring comprehension is an important aspect of reading comprehension. It helps readers to be aware of their understanding and make necessary adjustments when comprehension difficulties arise. The review has shown that monitoring comprehension ability is linked to reading achievement, vocabulary knowledge, working memory capacity, and reading fluency. Effective strategies to improve monitoring comprehension include self-explanation, reading logs, the Think-Aloud method, computer-assisted instruction, and teacher-led instruction. Therefore, teachers and educators must make use of these strategies to develop the monitoring abilities of struggling readers to ensure they achieve success in reading comprehension.

Reading is a complex cognitive process that requires the integration of different skills and strategies. The process of monitoring behavioral performance involves monitoring one's own behavior to ensure that it is appropriate and effective. In this literature review, the importance of monitoring behavioral performance in reading, the factors that affect it, and the strategies that can facilitate it will be discussed through highlighting current research studies. Importance of Monitoring Behavioral Performance in Reading Monitoring behavioral performance is an essential aspect of effective reading as it ensures the engagement of different strategies and skills that enable efficient comprehension. Research has emphasized the significance of monitoring the process of reading, and its role in the development of reading comprehension skills for children (Nahla & Suha, 2015). It enables the reader to check their comprehension by identifying areas of difficulty and adjust their strategies accordingly. Furthermore, it has been suggested that monitoring behavioral performance in reading is essential for children with learning difficulties (Kendeou, Bohn-Gettler, White, & Van Den Broek, 2014). Children who have difficulties in behavioral monitoring are more prone to behavioral and academic challenges. Factors Affecting Monitoring Behavioral Performance in Reading Monitoring behavioral performance in reading is contingent upon several factors that affect the efficacy of this process. One key factor that affects monitoring behavioral performance is metacognitive knowledge as it influences the ability of the student to identify their own errors and areas of confusion (Kragler & Nelleheny, 2015). Students with higher levels of metacognitive knowledge have more accurate monitoring skills than students with lower levels. Another important factor is working memory capacity, which influences the ability of the student to maintain attention, and effectively process and recall information during the reading process (LaBerge & Samuels, 2018). Research has shown that the ability to monitor behavioral performance is significantly impacted when working memory capacity is low. In addition, other contextual factors, such as text complexity, can affect the ability of the student to monitor their behavioral performance (Elleman, Lindo, Morphy, & Compton, 2019). Students may have difficulty monitoring their behavioral performance in situations where the text is too complex or dense. Finally, personality and individual differences also play a role in monitoring behavioral performance. Certain personality traits, such as conscientiousness, have been described as being particularly beneficial for effective behavioral monitoring in reading (Komarraju, Karau, Schmeck, & Avdic, 2015). Strategies for Facilitating Monitoring Behavioral Performance in Reading Several research studies have developed different strategies to facilitate monitoring behavioral performance in reading. One effective strategy is the use of reciprocal teaching, which encourages the use of four cognitive strategies: questioning, summarizing, clarifying and predicting during reading (Kembo & Kutz, 2013). This process fosters a sense of self-monitoring, as students engage in a reflexive practice in which they ask questions about the text which draws their attention to the comprehension process. Another effective strategy for facilitating monitoring behavioral performance during reading is meta-linguistic awareness training (Gibson, Abbott, Greenwood, & Hickling, 2018). In this method, students are taught to reflect on and discuss their reading experience, which enhances their ability to identify areas of difficulties and monitor their behavioral performance. This strategy has been shown to significantly improve reading comprehension scores. Another strategy that has been shown to facilitate monitoring behavioral performance is the use of self-monitoring checklists (Tilstra & McMaster, 2015). This strategy encourages active monitoring by providing students with a visual tool in which they can track their performance and determine their comprehension level in a more structured and reflective manner. Conclusion The present literature review has demonstrated that monitoring behavioral performance in reading is a multifaceted process that is vital for successful reading comprehension. It also identified the factors that may affect this process. Metacognitive knowledge, working memory capacity, text complexity, and personality traits are all important factors that affect monitoring behavioral performance in reading. In addition, different effective strategies, such as reciprocal teaching, meta-linguistic awareness training, and self-monitoring checklists, were discussed. Therefore, it is important for educators to implement these strategies to develop the monitoring abilities of students, particularly those with learning difficulties. Developing effective monitoring abilities for reading enhances students’ comprehension skills and improves their overall academic performance. References Elleman, A. M., Lindo, E.

Vor allem die Memminger Ach in ihrem regulierten Verlauf gibt die ungefähre Grenze zwischen Almerde und Schotter an. Am Talrand zeigt sich eine tertiäre Anlagerung, welche das reiche Vorkommen von Quellen bis hinunter nach Heimertingen begünstigt.', 'Geschichte.', 'Frühgeschichte (bis 8. Jahrhundert n. Chr.).', 'In der römischen Kaiserzeit verlief die Straße, von Kempten (Allgäu) (Cambodunum) nach Kellmünz (Caelius Mons) sehr wahrscheinlich auch über die Amendinger Flur. Bei mehreren Neu- und Umbauten wurden im Gemeindegebiet immer wieder römische Mauerreste entdeckt. 1943 und 1954 konnten solche aus dem 2. und 3. Jahrhundert n. Chr. freigelegt werden. Im Süden des heutigen Gemeindegebietes errichtete vermutlich ein aus dem Militärdienst ausgeschiedener Veteran einen Gutshof, eine sogenannte \\"villa rustica\\". Bei archäologischen Ausgrabungen um 1830 und Anfang der 1960er Jahre wurde festgestellt, dass der Hof eine Fläche von ungefähr neunzig mal neunzig Metern bedeckte. Er wurde mindestens dreimal durch Brand zerstört und wiederaufgebaut. Auch waren vermutlich Handwerkerhäuser an den Hof angeschlossen, wie der Fund eines Webgewichtes nahelegt. Als im Jahr 233 die Germanen zum ersten Mal den Limes nördlich der Donau überrannten, wurde der römische Gutshof wahrscheinlich zum ersten Mal zerstört.', 'Der Kern der Ortschaft Amendingen, südwestlich der Kirche, entstand wohl im Zuge der alemannischen Landnahme im 5./6. Jahrhundert. Ausschlaggebend dürfte ein alemannischer Siedlungsweg von Heimertingen nach Memmingerberg gewesen sein, der dem Wasserlauf der Ach folgte. Sicher spielte bei der Besiedlung auch die alte Römerstraße eine Rolle. Wie bei Memmingen setzt sich der Ortsname aus einem Personennamen und der Endung \\"-ingen\\" zusammen. Vermutlich hieß der Stammesführer \\"Otmund\\". Später wurde daraus \\"Otmundingen\\", heute \\"Amendingen\\". Die Flur des ältesten Dorfes umfasste zunächst Teile der Memminger Ach und die vom römischen Gutshof urbar gemachten Äcker. Bei Ausgrabungen des Memminger Altertumsvereins um 1830 fand man ein Steinplattengrab, das sich heute an der Südseite des Memminger Waldfriedhofes befindet. Wegen der fehlenden Beigaben vermutet man, dass das Grab vor dem Jahr 751, in der Zeit der Merowinger, entstanden ist. Es wurde auch eine Mauer aus Tuffstein angeschnitten, dem gleichen Material wie das der Grabkiste. Ziegelfunde zeigten, dass die Mauer und die sonstigen Funde, mit Ausnahme der Gräber, aus römischer Zeit stammten. Weitere Grabungen ergaben, dass die heidnischen Bewohner Amendingens ihre Begräbnisstätten bei dem zerstörten römischen Hof anlegten. Die Toten lagen mit dem Kopf nach Osten. Etwa um das Jahr 800 wurde die erste Kirche in Amendingen errichtet, vermutlich als schlichter Bau aus Holz. Die Toten wurden in dem zugehörigen Friedhof beigesetzt.', 'Kloster Ottobeuren und Besitz weltlicher Herren.', 'Das \\"Chronicon ottenburanum\\", das eine um 1180 entstandene Sammlung von Abschriften älterer Urkunden enthält, nennt in der Stiftungsurkunde des Klosters Ottobeuren das Dorf Amendingen mit allem Besitz (und den zugehörigen Menschen) – \\"villam Oumintingen cum pertinentiis suis\\" – als Stiftungsgut. Die Abschrift gibt den Inhalt einer als echt geltenden, aber verlorengegangenen Urkunde aus dem Jahr 764 wider. Für das Jahr 972 ist eine Gebietsabtretung des Klosters Ottobeuren in einer Urkunde bezeugt, deren Echtheit aber umstritten ist. Die Abschrift aus dem frühen 12. Jahrhundert erwähnt Amendingen als \\"oppidum Oumintingen cum vico suo Trunkenesperc\\". Kaiser Otto I. belehnt darin den Alemannenherzog Burchard III. von Schwaben mit Gütern, die das Kloster Ottobeuren an den Kaiser abgetreten hatte, um sich von den Pflichten der Heerfahrt, des Kriegsdienstes und des Hoflagers zu befreien. Die früheste erhaltene schriftliche Erwähnung Amendingens in der vom Augsburger Dompropst Gerhard 982/992 verfassten Vita des heiligen Ulrich bezeugt, dass dieser im Mai 973 auf seiner Heimreise von dem oberschwäbischen Obersulmetingen nach Augsburg mit Mönchen aus dem nahe gelegenen Kloster in Amendingen zusammentraf, um ihnen das kaiserliche Privileg der freien Abtwahl mitzuteilen.', 'Um 1200 ging Amendingen an die Ritter von Eisenburg, die von den Herzögen von Schwaben die Heerfahrtspflicht in dem Gebiet übernommen hatten und bildete damit den wirtschaftlichen Mittelpunkt dieser Herrschaft. In kirchlicher Hinsicht gehörte das Dorf ab 1341 zum Kloster Rot an der Rot. Der letzte Ritter von Eisenburg verkaufte seine Herrschaft.', 'Besitz Memmingens und evangelisch-katholischer Konflikt.', 'Amendingen kam im Jahr 1455 an das Memminger Bürger- und Patriziergeschlecht \\"Sättelin\\" und später ein Großteil des Dorfes in den Besitz weiterer Memminger Bürger, an die Straßennamen erinnern (Marquard, Spichel, Waimer, Zehender). Mit anderen Orten ging das Dorf 1580 in den Besitz der benachbarten Reichsstadt Memmingen über. Seit 1586 hatte diese auch die Hochgerichtsbarkeit im Dorf inne. Einundzwanzig Jahre später erwarb 1601 der Ulmer Bürger und Patrizier Hans Eitel Neubronner die ganze Herrschaft Eisenburg. Die Sättelin als Memminger Bürger wurden in der Reformation evangelisch, auch die Neubronner als deren Nachfolger hatten als Ulmer Bürger die neue Lehre angenommen. Die Herrschaft war zwar nun evangelisch, die über der Herrschaft stehende Landvogtei jedoch katholisch. Daraus ergaben sich Differenzen, welche 1586, dreißig Jahre nach dem Augsburger Religionsfrieden, zu einem Vertrag führten. Aus den Kirchenakten geht hervor, dass von sechshundert Untertanen noch hundertfünfzig katholisch geblieben waren. Der Vertrag bestimmte, dass die Herren von Eisenburg zwar evangelisch bleiben durften, die Untertanen aber in der alten katholischen Religion belassen werden sollten. Sie durften, soweit sie die neue Konfession angenommen hatten, diese noch weitere acht Jahre behalten. Danach mussten die Untertanen unter Androhung von Strafe wieder zur alten Religion zurückkehren. Dem damaligen Pfarrer Gallus Möslin gelang es, vor Ablauf der Frist die meisten wieder zu konvertieren. Wer allerdings beim neuen Glauben bleiben wollte, zog in das evangelische Steinheim oder nach Memmingen.', 'In der Reformationszeit siedelten sich auch die ersten Juden in Amendingen und anderen Orten der Herrschaft Eisenburg an, da ihnen die Reichsstädte keine Unterkunft gewährten. Da viele der Juden Handel trieben, gab es bald kleinere Streitereien zwischen der Stadt Memmingen und Sebastian von Berwang als Inhaber der Herrschaft Eisenburg und mehrmals zu Prozessen. Im Jahr 1573 standen 83 Memminger Handwerksleute in den Schuldbüchern der Amendinger Juden. Seit 1600 gab es keine jüdische Bevölkerung mehr in Amendingen, da die meisten nach Fellheim zogen, wo sie unter dem Schutz des dortigen Herrschers standen. Als die Neubronner 1601 die Herrschaft Amendingen kauften, wurde in der \\"Kaufsabred\\" vereinbart, keine jüdische Bevölkerung mehr aufzunehmen. Die Neubronner als neue Inhaber der Herrschaft suchten von Anfang an durch Verträge und Absprachen Ordnung zu schaffen. Sie legten die Rechte und Pflichten des Mesners und des Lehrers fest und trafen mit dem Kloster Rot an der Rot eine Abmachung über die Zehntenrechte in Amendingen.', 'Im Dreißigjährigen Krieg gab es Einquartierungen kaiserlicher und schwedischer Truppen und entsprechender Belastung der Bevölkerung. An der damaligen St. Ottilienkapelle kam es zu einem Zusammenstoß der beiden Kriegsparteien. Die Pfarrbücher belegen, dass die Gefallenen vor der Kapelle bestattet wurden.', 'Auch die Pest wütete 1635 in der Gegend um Memmingen. Es ist aber nicht bekannt, inwieweit Amendingen davon betroffen war. Als wichtigste Folge des Krieges verkaufte das Kloster Rot am 16. Juli 1642 das Patronatsrecht mit dem Zehnten und andere Besitzungen in Amendingen an die Kartause Buxheim. Die Kirche in Amendingen wurde 1655 durch den Einsturz des Turmes zerstört. Dieses Ereignis führte zur Errichtung eines behelfsmäßigen Baues, der 1661 eingeweiht wurde. Im Jahr 1671 wurde die Herrschaft durch die Erben der Neubronnerschen Familie in zwölf Teile gespalten. Trotz eines eingesetzten Verwalters für alle zwölf Teile gab es bald Zwist.

Velocity: This KPI measures the amount of work completed by the team during a specific time frame, usually a sprint (typically 2-4 weeks). It is commonly measured in story points or hours. To measure velocity, track the number of completed tasks or stories and calculate the total story points or hours for each sprint. Measure this KPI at the end of each sprint. 2. Burn Down Chart: This graph tracks the progress of a sprint by displaying the remaining work vs. time. It helps identify any potential bottlenecks or deviations from the planned schedule. To create a burn down chart, log the remaining work for each day during the sprint and plot it against the planned completion rate. Update the chart daily. 3. Defect Density: This KPI measures the number of defects per unit of size, e.g., per 1,000 lines of code or per 100 function points. This helps gauge the quality of the work produced during the production phase. Keep track of the number of defects reported, the magnitude of the defects, and the total code size. Calculate the defect density on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the size of the project. 4. Cycle Time: This KPI measures the amount of time needed to complete a specific task or set of tasks (e.g., the time from when a feature is requested until it's deployed). Track the start and end dates for each task and calculate the difference. Monitor cycle time at the end of each sprint or on a weekly basis. 5. Team Member Utilization: This KPI tracks how effectively each team member is being utilized based on the percentage of their work hours allocated to productive tasks. To measure team member utilization, track the number of hours each team member is assigned to tasks and divide it by their total available work hours. Review utilization rates for each team member weekly or monthly. 6. Requirements Stability Index: This KPI measures the frequency of changes in the game's requirements during development, which could impact overall project success. Track the number of changes made to requirements and calculate the percentage of changed requirements against the total number of initial requirements. Measure the requirements stability index monthly or quarterly. 7. Return on Investment (ROI): This KPI assesses the financial benefits of the game development project, such as revenue and profits, compared to the project's cost. Calculate ROI by dividing the project's net profit (total revenue – total cost) by the total cost of the project. Measure ROI at major milestones or quarterly."},{"instruction":"KPI's for new Feature in software development cycle","output":"1. Feature Adoption Rate: This KPI measures the percentage of users who adopt a new feature after its release. To calculate the adoption rate, divide the number of users using the new feature by the total number of active users. Monitor this KPI regularly, such as weekly or monthly, to understand user acceptance and adoption. 2. Time to Market (TTM): This KPI measures the time it takes to bring a new feature from the initial concept to its release in the market. It helps assess the development team's efficiency and ability to meet deadlines. Track the start date of the feature's conceptualization and the release date, then measure the difference. Evaluate TTM for each feature release or at regular intervals, such as quarterly. 3. Feature Completion Rate: This KPI tracks the percentage of tasks or user stories related to a new feature that has been completed during a set period (e.g., a sprint or a milestone). Calculate the feature completion rate by dividing the number of completed tasks by the total number of tasks for the feature. Track this metric at the end of each sprint or milestone. 4. Feature Defect Density: This KPI measures the number of defects (bugs or issues) found in the new feature per unit of size (e.g., per 1,000 lines of code or per 100 function points). This helps evaluate the quality of a new feature. Measure the defect density by dividing the number of defects by the size of the feature. Assess this KPI weekly or monthly, depending on the size and complexity of the feature. 5. User Satisfaction: This KPI gauges user feedback and sentiment towards the new feature. Collect user feedback through surveys, reviews, or other forms of direct communication. Measure and analyze user satisfaction regularly (e.g., monthly) to iteratively improve the feature's quality and user experience. 6. Feature Effectiveness: This KPI examines the degree to which the new feature achieves its intended goal or solves the targeted problem. Establish specific success criteria for the feature (e.g., reduced support requests, increased user efficiency, or improved user engagement), and measure the feature's effectiveness against those criteria. Track this KPI after a sufficient amount of time has passed since the feature's release, such as monthly or quarterly. 7. Feature ROI (Return on Investment): This KPI evaluates the financial benefits or value generated by the new feature compared to the development costs. Calculate the ROI by dividing the net revenue or value generated by the feature by the total cost of developing the feature. Measure feature ROI after a reasonable timeframe, such as quarterly, to assess the feature's impact on the business."},{"instruction":"Aşağıdakilerden hangisi muhasebe kayıtlarında maddi duran varlıklar arasında yer almaz? a) Ticari Mallar b) Demirbaşlar C) Arazi ve Arsalar d) Taşıtlar e) Binalar","output":"a) Ticari Mallar"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Autor', 'Geboren im 4.

Er ist neben Prokopios von Caesarea der bedeutendste spätantike Geschichtsschreiber und schrieb in lateinischer Sprache, obwohl seine Muttersprache Griechisch war. Seine \\"Res gestae\\" sind das letzte klassizistische lateinische Geschichtswerk der Antike, das zu großen Teilen überliefert ist. Die erhaltenen Abschnitte behandeln die Jahre von 353 bis 378 und beschreiben die Zeit unmittelbar vor Beginn der sogenannten Völkerwanderung, in der sich die antike Mittelmeerwelt grundlegend veränderte.', 'Ammianus hat als Soldat unter den Kaisern Constantius II. und Julian gedient und viele der von ihm geschilderten Ereignisse selbst miterlebt. Obwohl er mehr als andere antike Geschichtsschreiber um Objektivität bemüht war, wird seine persönliche Sicht bisweilen recht deutlich. So beurteilte er etwa Constantius II. teilweise sehr negativ, während er von Julian ein ausgesprochen positives Bild zeichnete. Der überragende Wert seiner \\"Res gestae\\" für die Erforschung des 4. Jahrhunderts ist dennoch unbestritten.', 'Das Römische Reich zur Zeit des Ammianus Marcellinus.', 'Als Ammianus Marcellinus geboren wurde, herrschte Kaiser Konstantin bereits mehrere Jahre über das wiedervereinigte Imperium. Die Grenzen waren weitgehend gesichert, in seinen letzten Lebensmonaten bereitete Konstantin sogar einen Feldzug gegen das neupersische Sassanidenreich vor, den großen Rivalen Roms im Osten, der nur durch seinen Tod am 22. Mai 337 nicht zustande kam.', 'Das \\"Imperium Romanum\\" war in der Regierungszeit Konstantins einem tiefgreifenden Wandel unterworfen, der von der modernen Forschung als \\"konstantinische Wende\\" bezeichnet wird: Das nur Jahre zuvor teils sehr blutig verfolgte Christentum wurde nun privilegiert und Ende des 4. Jahrhunderts durch Kaiser Theodosius I. faktisch zur Staatsreligion erhoben. Das Heidentum hingegen – ein allerdings sehr unscharfer Begriff, der ganz verschiedene religiöse Vorstellungen umfasste, von den Mysterienkulten, über die traditionellen römischen Kulte bis hin zu vom Neuplatonismus beeinflussten Strömungen – hatte zur Zeit des Theodosius bereits deutlich an Lebenskraft eingebüßt und wurde am Ende nur noch von einer immer kleiner werdenden Minderheit der Bevölkerung praktiziert. Auch das Kaisertum wurde immer stärker christlich geprägt, bis hin zur Vorstellung, dass der Kaiser Gottes Vizekönig auf Erden sei.', 'Mit der fortschreitenden Christianisierung von Staat und Gesellschaft waren aber auch Probleme ganz neuer Art verbunden, wie der Arianische Streit deutlich macht: Der alexandrinische Presbyter Arius hatte zu Beginn des 4. Jahrhunderts behauptet, Gott-Sohn sei nicht wesenseins mit Gott-Vater. Der Arianismus (der keine einheitliche Strömung darstellte, sondern in mehrere Einzelgruppierungen zerfiel) fand vor allem in Teilen des Ostens des Imperiums einen Nährboden, während er im Westen scharf verurteilt wurde. Die diesbezüglichen christologischen Streitigkeiten, also die Frage nach dem wahren Wesen Christi, banden erhebliche Energien und wurden mit Leidenschaft nicht nur von Theologen, sondern auch von breiten Bevölkerungsschichten ausgetragen. Kaiser Constantius II., der ab 353 uneingeschränkt über das Imperium herrschte, versuchte während seiner ganzen Regierungszeit vergeblich, ein für die gesamte Reichskirche einheitliches, arianisches Bekenntnis durchzusetzen.', 'Währenddessen nahm der Druck auf die Grenzen immer mehr zu. Im Osten herrschte seit 337/338 ein fast permanenter Kriegszustand. Wiederholt fielen die Perser in die römischen Orientprovinzen ein, während kaiserliche Offensiven glücklos blieben. Im Westen wurde derweil Gallien wiederholt von germanischen Plünderern verheert, da es im Inneren des Reiches zu Usurpationen wie der des Magnentius kam, worunter die Sicherung der Grenzen litt. Das Imperium konnte sich dennoch behaupten, wenn auch mit einiger Mühe. Ammianus hat viele dieser Ereignisse selbst miterlebt, diese in seinem Geschichtswerk verarbeitet und damit der Nachwelt ein Panorama einer Zeit hinterlassen, in der die Alte Welt einen Transformationsprozess begann, der schließlich das Ende der Antike einläutete.', 'Leben.', 'Über Ammianus’ Leben ist nur wenig bekannt, einiges erschließt sich jedoch aus seinem Werk. Er wurde um 330 in Syrien geboren, vielleicht in Antiochia am Orontes, einer der größten und bedeutendsten Städte des Imperiums, wo er zumindest längere Zeit lebte. Er stammte wahrscheinlich aus wohlhabender griechischer Familie und war offenbar sehr belesen. Seine Angabe, er sei nur ein \\"miles\\" (Soldat) gewesen, führt in die Irre: Vor allem im Bereich der lateinischen und griechischen Literatur scheint er gute Kenntnisse besessen zu haben, die auf eine kostspielige Ausbildung schließen lassen. Schon in jungen Jahren wurde Ammianus Offizier in der Armee und diente als Leibgardist \\"(protector domesticus)\\". In dieser Einheit dienten zwar teils auch altgediente Veteranen, vor allem aber junge Männer aus der Provinzelite. Als \\"protector\\" hatte Ammianus die Aufgabe, seinen Vorgesetzten, den Heermeister \\"(magister militum)\\" Ursicinus, persönlich zu begleiten und zu beschützen. Es wird vermutet, dass Ursicinus ein Förderer und Patron des Ammianus war.', '354 begleitete Ammianus, damals nach eigener Aussage ein junger Mann, seinen Vorgesetzten nach Antiochia, wo er die Herrschaft des \\"Caesar\\" Constantius Gallus und seiner Frau Constantina miterlebte. 355 nahm er an der Mission zur Beseitigung des Usurpators Silvanus in Köln teil. Bis 357 hielt sich Ammianus in Ursicinus’ Gefolge in Gallien auf, wo zu dieser Zeit Julian, der Bruder des mittlerweile hingerichteten Gallus, als Unterkaiser \\"(Caesar)\\" regierte, den Ammianus später in seinem Geschichtswerk zum Helden stilisierte. Danach ging Ammianus mit Ursicinus wieder in den Osten des Reiches, wo er an den Kämpfen gegen den persischen König Schapur II. teilnahm. Während dieser Kämpfe kam es zu einem einschneidenden Erlebnis für Ammianus, als er den Persern, die 359 eine großangelegte Invasion der römischen Orientprovinzen unternahmen, während der Eroberung der römischen Festung Amida nur mit knapper Not als einer der wenigen Überlebenden entkam. Die Perser richteten unter den verbliebenen Römern ein Massaker an. Über die Belagerung und den Fall Amidas, damals eine der wichtigsten Festungen der römischen Orientverteidigung, berichtete Ammianus eingehend (19,1–8). Seine anschauliche Darstellung steht denen anderer großer antiker Geschichtsschreiber in nichts nach und wird zu den klassischen Schilderungen der römischen Historiographie gezählt. 360 wurde Ursicinus entlassen, Ammianus diente allerdings weiter in der Armee und nahm 363 an dem teil, der in einem Fiasko endete.', '363 schied Ammianus aus dem Heer aus und bereiste Griechenland, Thrakien und Ägypten. Wohl um 380 ging er nach Rom, wo er um 390/91 sein Geschichtswerk \\"(Res gestae)\\" verfasste; der genaue Titel seines Werkes ist jedoch nicht bekannt. Allerdings weiß man aus einem Brief des berühmten Rhetors Libanios, mit dem Ammianus vielleicht bekannt war, dass sich das Werk großer Beliebtheit erfreute. Es wurde in jüngerer Zeit bezweifelt, dass der Briefpartner des Libanios tatsächlich Ammianus war, wofür aber einiges spricht. Vermutungen, Ammianus sei vielleicht sogar in den Senat aufgenommen worden, lassen sich nicht beweisen, ebenso wenig wie sich genaueres über seine Beziehungen zu stadtrömisch-heidnischen Senatoren sagen lässt (siehe unten). Sein genaues Todesdatum ist unbekannt, als spätestes Datum gilt in der Forschung das Jahr 400, wenn auch oft der Zeitraum um 395 angenommen wird.', 'Werk.', 'Der Aufbau der \\"Res gestae\\".', 'Das Werk des Ammianus Marcellinus behandelte nach seiner eigenen Aussage (Ammian 31,16,9, wo er sich auch als \\"miles quondam et Graecus\\", als \\"ehemaliger Soldat und Grieche\\" bezeichnet, was auf seine militärische Erfahrung und sein kulturelles Verständnis hinweist) die Zeit vom Regierungsantritt des römischen Kaisers Nerva im Jahr 96 bis zur Schlacht von Adrianopel 378. Ein Teil der insgesamt 31 Bücher wurde bereits um 391 veröffentlicht, der Rest (ab Buch 26) folgte später, vielleicht um 394. Von ihnen sind nur die Bücher 14–31 erhalten geblieben, die den Zeitraum von 353 bis 378 abdecken, den Ammianus als Offizier der Garde und Augenzeuge mitverfolgt hat. Timothy Barnes stellte 1998 allerdings die interessante Hypothese auf, dass das Werk in Wirklichkeit in Hexaden gegliedert und 36 Bücher umfasst habe, wobei die erhaltenen Bücher eigentlich die Bücher 19 bis 36 darstellen würden.', 'Ammianus schrieb eine Mischung aus Kaiserbiografien und vor allem Reichsgeschichte: Der chronologischen Behandlung der Regierungszeit folgt eine knappe Charakterisierung des jeweiligen Kaisers, wobei jedoch zahlreiche Exkurse eingeschoben sind (siehe Abschnitt 3.3). Gerade die Charakterisierungen bilden einen nicht unwichtigen Teil des Werks. Sie sind sehr anschaulich verfasst und beurteilen die \\"virtutes\\" und \\"vitia\\", die Tugenden und Laster der Herrscher. Während Ammianus die Geschichte von Nerva bis in die Zeit Julians offenbar nur sehr knapp behandelt hat, wird die Darstellung ab Buch 15 deutlich detaillierter. Die Ereignisse bis einschließlich Buch 25 sind chronologisch aufgebaut, ab Buch 26 tritt eine stärkere geografische Aufteilung ein. Ammianus knüpfte lose an Tacitus an und war bemüht, sich an den Vorsatz \\"sine ira et studio\\" („ohne Zorn und Eifer“) zu halten. Freilich war schon Tacitus keineswegs unparteiisch gewesen, ebenso wenig wie Ammianus, der diese Maxime zwar so ernst nahm wie kaum ein anderer antiker Historiker – kein Geringerer als der große Althistoriker Ronald Syme war mehr als bereit, ihm das zuzugestehen –, aber trotz seines auf Objektivität gerichteten Ansatzes durchaus auch recht subjektiv urteilte. Allerdings darf Tacitus’ Einfluss auf Ammianus nach Ansicht der neueren Forschung ohnehin nicht überbewertet werden (siehe unten).', 'Die erhaltenen Bücher lassen sich grob nach folgendem Schema ordnen:', 'Der Verlust der ersten 13 Bücher ist bedauerlich, da wir ansonsten über eine durchgehende Historiografie vom Ende des 1. bis zum Ende des 4.

Here's a brief research on \\"Phase Noise in Oscillators\\": Phase noise in oscillators is the term used to describe the random variation of the phase of the signal produced by an oscillator. This deviation is caused by different sources, such as thermal noise, flicker noise, and broadband noise, and is measured in units of dBc/Hz (decibels relative to the carrier per hertz). Phase noise is a critical parameter for many applications that demand high levels of frequency stability, such as wireless communication systems, radar, and clocks. The quality and stability of an oscillator's output signal is characterized by its phase noise level, which can be used to evaluate the performance of the oscillator. There are several techniques that can be used to reduce the phase noise in oscillators, such as using low-noise resonators, minimizing the oscillator's power supply noise, and optimizing the oscillator's circuit design. Additionally, phase-locked loops (PLLs) can be used to reduce oscillator phase noise by locking the oscillator to a stable reference, such as a quartz crystal. In conclusion, phase noise in oscillators is a critical aspect of oscillator performance, and reducing the phase noise levels is essential for many applications that demand high frequency stability. By understanding the different sources of phase noise and the techniques to reduce it, researchers and engineers can develop better performing oscillators that meet the demands of modern communication systems, radars, and clocks, among others."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Schmuckstein'], 'Ammolit ist ein seltener opaleszierender Schmuckstein.

Die entstandenen Hohlräume wurden später häufig durch anderes Material wie Calcit oder seltener Pyrit gefüllt oder blieben hohl.

Daher sind Fossilien mit erhaltenem Aragonit besonders selten.', 'Bei den Ammonitengehäusen, aus denen Ammolit entstand, war der Vorgang allerdings etwas anders. Der Aragonit blieb erhalten, dies lag vor allem an der Bedeckung durch wasserundurchlässige Vulkanasche, die von Ausbrüchen der Vulkane der sich bildenden Rocky Mountains stammte. Gleichzeitig gerieten die ammonitenhaltigen Schichten in nicht zu große Tiefen, so dass sie sich nicht über 400 °C erhitzten. Während der Diagenese wanderten Spurenelemente wie Eisen und Magnesium in die Schalen ein.', 'Nur selten werden komplett gut erhaltene Ammoniten gefunden, bei denen die Lobenlinien noch zu sehen sind. Bis zu 90 cm große Ammoniten sind gefunden worden, aber üblicherweise sind die opaleszierenden Ammoniten sehr viel kleiner.', 'Eigenschaften.', 'Ammolit besteht hauptsächlich aus Aragonit, welches direkt aus dem ursprünglichen Perlmutt in den Schalen der Ammoniten stammt. Neben Aragonit kommen in variablen Anteilen Calcit, Quarzit, Pyrit und andere Mineralien vor. In der Schale selbst kommen eine Reihe von Spurenelementen vor (Aluminium, Barium, Chrom, Kupfer, Eisen, Magnesium, Mangan, Strontium, Titan und Vanadium).', 'Ammolit liegt (wie Aragonit) im rhombischen Kristallsystem vor, zeigt aber eine etwas größere Härte 4,5 bis 5,5 und Dichte 2,60 bis 2,85 g/cm³ als dieser. Ammolit ist optisch zweiachsig, die Brechungsindizes des kanadischen Materials (bei 589,3 nm, gelbes Natrium-Licht) sind: α 1,522; β 1,672 bis 1,673; γ 1,676 bis 1,679, und optisch negativ. Unter UV-Licht zeigen manche Ammolite eine senfgelbe Fluoreszenz.', 'Aufgrund der aus dem ursprünglichen Perlmutt erhaltenen Schichtstruktur des Aragonits zeigt sich eine Opaleszenz. Die entsteht durch die Interferenz in dünnen Schichten, wie in Seifenblasen oder Ölflecken, nicht durch eine Eigenfarbe oder Lichtbrechung. Die Farbe ist dabei von der Schichtdicke abhängig: dicke Schichten liefern rote und grüne Interferenzfarben, dünne Schichten liefern auch Blau- und Gelbtöne.', 'Wie die ursprüngliche Schale liegt der Ammolit nur in einer sehr dünnen (0,5–0,8 mm) Schicht vor, diese befindet sich meist auf einer grau-braunen Matrix aus Schiefer, Kalkmergel, oder Kalkstein. Durch überliegende Sedimentschichten wurde das Gestein zusammengedrückt, daher sind die Ammoniten meist zerquetscht, so dass sich zahllose Risse in der dünnen Schicht bilden. Diese Risstextur wird manchmal als \\"Drachenhaut\\" oder \\"kirchenglasfensterartig\\" beschrieben. Ammolit aus tieferen Schichten kann auch komplett glatt sein oder auch eine rippelartige Oberfläche zeigen.', 'Fundorte.', 'Ammolit wird hauptsächlich in der Bearpaw-Formation gefunden, die sich von den kanadischen Provinzen Alberta und Saskatchewan bis nach Montana in den USA erstreckt. Die besten Edelsteinqualitäten finden sich hier an den östlichen Hängen der Rocky Mountains in Südalberta.', 'Ein ähnliches Material ist \\"Lumachella\\", ein Marmor aus versteinerten Muscheln und Schnecken, der in Italien und Österreich gefunden wird. Lumachella opalesziert nur teilweise und ist aufgrund des hellen Substrats nicht so brillant wie Ammolit. Der Marmor wird daher auch nicht oder nur sehr selten zu Schmuckzwecken genutzt. Wie anderer Marmor wird er in Mosaiken oder als Verkleidungsplatten verwendet.', 'Die meisten kommerziellen Bergbaubetriebe für Ammolit befinden sich im Tal des Saint Mary River, einem Nebenfluss des Oldman River, im Gebiet der Städte Cardston und Lethbridge. Von großer Bedeutung ist dabei das Reservat der Kainai-Indianer, wo ungefähr die Hälfte aller Ammolitablagerungen gefunden werden.', 'Auch auf Madagaskar, in Russland und Somerset/England kann Ammolit gefunden werden.', 'Gewinnung im Kainah-Reservat.', 'Die wichtigste Firma zur kommerziellen Gewinnung des Ammolit ist \\"Korite International\\", die seit ihrer Gründung 1979 hauptsächlich in dem Reservat der Kainah arbeitet. Die Gesellschaft zahlt dem Stamm eine Nutzungsgebühr für die von ihr abgebauten Gebiete.', 'Die Gewinnung geschieht über flache Tagebaue, die mit Baggern ausgehoben werden. Das geförderte Material wird auf seinen möglichen Ammolitgehalt abgesucht. Die Gruben werden auch direkt von Nicht-Angestellten auf an der Oberfläche liegende Ammoliten abgesucht, die anschließend an \\"Korite International\\" verkauft werden. Annähernd fünf Prozent des abgebauten Ammolits sind für die Verarbeitung zu Schmuckstücken geeignet.', 'Die Ammolitablagerungen sind geschichtet: die oberste dieser Schichten, \\"K-Zone\\" genannt, liegt ca. 15 m unterhalb der Oberfläche und erstreckt sich 30 m in die Tiefe. Der Ammolit innerhalb dieser Schicht ist durch Siderit-Konkretionen umgeben und ist normalerweise zerbrochen, mit einer Menge Ausschuss. Er ist der häufigste und im Allgemeinen am wenigsten wertvolle Ammolit.', 'Zwanzig Meter tiefer findet sich dann die \\"Blue Zone\\". In dieser 65 m dicken Schicht ist der Ammolit üblicherweise mit einer dünnen Schicht Pyrit anstatt des Siderits umgeben. Dieser Ammolit bildet hier eher flache Schichten, die weniger zerbrochen sind. Aufgrund dieser besseren Qualität und der wegen der großen Tiefe selteneren Gewinnung ist dieser Ammolit der wertvollste.', 'Bis 2003 hatte die \\"Korite International\\" nur 30 Acre (etwa 12 ha) der Kainah-Lagerstätte abgebaut. Als Teil ihrer Vereinbarung mit dem Stamm muss die Firma die ausgebeuteten Bereiche wieder auffüllen und sicherstellen, dass die Umwelt nicht dauerhaft nachteilig beeinflusst wird. Die Gesellschaft beschäftigt etwa 60 Personen, die meisten davon sind Kainah, für den Stamm fällt pro Jahr etwa ein Reingewinn von 150.000 bis 200.000 CAD ab. Etwa 90 Prozent der Weltjahresproduktion an Ammolit-Schmucksteinen wird hier gewonnen.', 'Verwendung als Schmuckstein.', 'Ammolit gehört mit Bernstein und Perlen zu den biogenen Schmucksteinen. 1981 begann zusammen mit einer Markteinführung des bis dahin recht unbekannten Steins die Gewinnung in einem größeren Tagebau durch die Bergbaugesellschaft \\"Korite International\\". Im Jahr 2004 wurde Ammolit als amtlicher Edelstein der kanadischen Provinz Alberta ausgezeichnet.', 'Ammolit wird als der seltenste organische Schmuckstein angesehen. In seinem Rohzustand wird er zu Preisen von 30 bis 65 USD pro Karat (150–325 /g) gehandelt. Da er weich und empfindlich ist, benötigt er eine spezielle Verarbeitung, die nur wenigen Experten genau bekannt ist. Diese Verarbeitung macht den Stein widerstandsfähiger und farbkräftiger. Außer dem Schneiden in die gewünschten Formen muss der Stein poliert werden, da eine raue Oberfläche das Licht zu sehr streut und daher nur mattere Farben zeigt. Ein Überzug mit einem Harz sorgt für eine Stabilisierung der dünnen Blättchen, in denen Ammolit vorliegt.', 'Geschichte.', 'Verglichen mit den meisten anderen Schmucksteinen, hat Ammolit eine kurze Geschichte: Größeres Interesse erzielten die Steine erst in den Siebzigern, nachdem sie 1969 in kleinen Mengen auf den Markt gekommen waren. Der Kainah-Stamm kannte den Stein als \\"Iniskim\\" (\\"Büffelstein\\") und glaubte lange Zeit, dass der Stein Zauberkräfte besitzt, die bei der Jagd auf Büffel helfen und Büffel anlocken. Außerdem sollte der Stein Heilungskräfte besitzen, so dass die Steine in Zeremonien der Medizinmänner verwendet wurden.', 'In den späten 1990er Jahren begannen Praktizierende des Feng Shui Ammoliten als \\"einflussreich\\" zu bewerben. Der Stein soll die Macht haben, durch Verbesserung des Flusses der Energie \\"Chi\\" das Wohlbefinden zu steigern und den Körper zu entgiften. Die sogenannte \\"Drachenschuppe\\" (englisch \\"Seven Color Prosperity Stone\\") soll mit jeder Farbe den Träger in verschiedenen positiven Weisen beeinflussen: eine Kombination aus rubinrot, smaragdgrün und bernsteingelb ist daher stark gesucht, die Farben sollen Wachstum, Weisheit und Gesundheit fördern.', 'Japan ist der größte Markt für Ammolit. Ein Grund dafür ist die Ersatzfunktion für den zu seltenen schwarzen Opal, der andere ist die Verwendung im Feng Shui. Der zweitwichtigste Markt ist Kanada: Ammolit wird sowohl von Künstlern verwendet, die ihre Kreationen an Touristen im Banff-Nationalpark verkaufen, als auch von Juwelieren. Im Südwesten der USA wird es von den Zuñi und anderen indianischen Kunsthandwerkern verwendet.', 'Verarbeitung.', 'Im Unterschied zu Opalen ist Ammolit vollständig mineralisiert und enthält kein Wasser. Daher kann er nicht wie der Opal austrocknen und Risse bilden. Dennoch wird auch Ammolit durch die Umgebung schnell beschädigt. Dies liegt vor allem an seiner geringen Härte. Schon üblicher Staub mit darin enthaltenen winzigen Sandkörnern – der enthaltene Quarz hat Mohshärte 7 – kann Kratzer verursachen.

Ammoniak ist ein amphoterer Stoff: Unter wässrigen Bedingungen wirkt es als Base. Es bildet mehrere Reihen von Salzen: die kationischen Ammoniumsalze sowie die anionischen Amide, Imide und Nitride, bei denen ein (Amide), zwei (Imide) oder alle (Nitride) Protonen (Wasserstoffionen) durch Metallionen ersetzt sind.', 'Ammoniak ist eine der meistproduzierten Chemikalien und Grundstoff für die Produktion aller weiteren Stickstoffverbindungen. Der größte Teil des Ammoniaks wird zu Düngemitteln, insbesondere Harnstoff und Ammoniumsalzen, weiterverarbeitet. Die Herstellung erfolgt bislang (2022) fast ausschließlich über das Haber-Bosch-Verfahren aus den Elementen Wasserstoff und Stickstoff.', 'Biologisch hat Ammoniak eine wichtige Funktion als Zwischenprodukt beim Auf- und Abbau von Aminosäuren. Aufgrund der Giftigkeit größerer Ammoniakmengen wird es zur Ausscheidung im Körper in den ungiftigen Harnstoff oder, beispielsweise bei Vögeln, in Harnsäure umgewandelt.', 'Ammoniak kann laut Forschung des Fraunhofer-Instituts für Energiewirtschaft und Energiesystemtechnik zukünftig eine Schlüsselrolle als grüner Treibstoff zukommen, da niedrigere Herstellungs- und Transportkosten als bei Flüssig-Wasserstoff, Methanol und anderen Energieträgern erwartet werden.', 'Geschichte.', 'Natürlich vorkommende Ammoniumverbindungen sind schon seit langer Zeit bekannt. So wurde Ammoniumchlorid (Salmiak) schon in der Antike in Ägypten durch Erhitzen von Kamelmist gewonnen. Beim Erhitzen bildet sich Ammoniak, das durch Reaktion mit Chlorwasserstoff Ammoniumchlorid als weißen Rauch bildet. Sowohl Salmiak als auch Ammoniak leiten sich vom lateinischen \\"sal ammoniacum\\" ab, das wiederum auf den antiken Namen der Oase Siwa (Oase des Ammon oder Amun) zurückgeht. In der Nähe der Oase befanden sich große Salzvorkommen, allerdings handelte es sich dabei wohl um Natriumchlorid und nicht um natürlich vorkommendes Ammoniumchlorid.', 'Gasförmiges Ammoniak wurde erstmals 1716 von Johannes Kunckel erwähnt, der Gärvorgänge beobachtete. Isoliert wurde das Gas erstmals 1774 von Joseph Priestley. Weitere Forschungen erfolgten durch Carl Wilhelm Scheele und Claude-Louis Berthollet, die die Zusammensetzung des Ammoniaks aus Stickstoff und Wasserstoff erkannten, sowie William Henry, der das exakte Verhältnis der beiden Elemente von 1:3 und damit die chemische Formel NH3 bestimmte. Erste, jedoch erfolglose Versuche zur Synthese des Ammoniaks aus den Elementen führte Georg Friedrich Hildebrandt um 1795 durch, indem er Stickstoff und Wasserstoff in verschiedenen Mischungsverhältnissen über Wasser stehen ließ.', 'In größerer Menge wurde Ammoniak ab 1840 benötigt, nachdem Justus von Liebig die Stickstoffdüngung zur Verbesserung der Erträge in der Landwirtschaft entwickelt hatte. Zunächst wurde Ammoniak als Nebenprodukt bei der Destillation von Kohle gewonnen, dies war jedoch nach kurzer Zeit nicht mehr ausreichend, um die Nachfrage nach Düngemittel zu decken. Ein erstes technisches Verfahren, um größere Mengen Ammoniak zu gewinnen, war 1898 das Frank-Caro-Verfahren, bei dem Calciumcarbid und Stickstoff zu Calciumcyanamid und dieses anschließend mit Wasser zu Ammoniak umgesetzt wurden.', 'Ab etwa 1900 begann Fritz Haber, aber auch Walther Nernst, mit der Erforschung der direkten Reaktion von Stickstoff und Wasserstoff zu Ammoniak. Sie erkannten bald, dass diese Reaktion bei Normalbedingungen nur in sehr geringem Umfang stattfindet und dass für hohe Ausbeuten hohe Temperaturen, ein hoher Druck sowie ein geeigneter Katalysator nötig sind. 1909 gelang es Haber erstmals, mit Hilfe eines Osmiumkatalysators Ammoniak im Labormaßstab durch Direktsynthese herzustellen. Daraufhin versuchte er mit Hilfe von Carl Bosch dieses Verfahren, das spätere Haber-Bosch-Verfahren, auch im industriellen Maß anzuwenden. Dies gelang nach Überwindung der durch das Arbeiten unter hohem Druck verursachten technischen Probleme 1910 im Versuchsbetrieb. 1913 wurde bei der BASF in Ludwigshafen die erste kommerzielle Fabrik zur Ammoniaksynthese in Betrieb genommen. Dabei wurde ein inzwischen von Alwin Mittasch entwickelter Eisen-Mischkatalysator anstatt des teuren Osmiums genutzt. Dieses Verfahren wurde schon nach kurzer Zeit in großem Maßstab angewendet und wird bis heute zur Ammoniakproduktion genutzt. 1918 erhielt Fritz Haber für die Entwicklung der Ammoniaksynthese den Chemie-Nobelpreis, 1931 zusammen mit Friedrich Bergius auch Carl Bosch für die Entwicklung von Hochdruckverfahren in der Chemie.', 'Über die genauen Abläufe der Reaktion am Katalysator war dagegen lange Zeit nichts Genaues bekannt. Da es sich hierbei um Oberflächenreaktionen handelt, konnten sie erst nach der Entwicklung geeigneter Techniken wie dem Ultrahochvakuum oder dem Rastertunnelmikroskop untersucht werden. Die einzelnen Teilreaktionen der Ammoniaksynthese wurden dabei von Gerhard Ertl entdeckt, der hierfür auch den Nobelpreis für Chemie 2007 erhielt.', 'Die Reaktion von Ammoniak zu Salpetersäure wurde erstmals ab 1825 von Frédéric Kuhlmann untersucht. Ein technisch anwendbares Verfahren für die Salpetersäuresynthese aus Ammoniak wurde mit dem heutigen Ostwald-Verfahren Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts von Wilhelm Ostwald entwickelt. Dieses wurde nach Entwicklung des Haber-Bosch-Verfahrens auch technisch wichtig und löste bald weitgehend das bisherige Produktionsverfahren aus teurem Chilesalpeter ab.', 'Vorkommen.', 'Da Ammoniak leicht mit sauren Verbindungen reagiert, kommt freies Ammoniakgas nur in geringen Mengen auf der Erde vor. Es entsteht z. B. bei der Zersetzung von abgestorbenen Pflanzen und tierischen Exkrementen. Bei der sogenannten Humifizierung werden stickstoffhaltige Bestandteile der Biomasse durch Mikroorganismen so abgebaut, dass unter anderem Ammoniak entsteht. Dieses gelangt als Gas in die Luft, reagiert dort jedoch mit Säuren wie Schwefel- oder Salpetersäure und bildet die entsprechenden Salze. Diese können auch über größere Strecken transportiert werden und gelangen leicht in den Boden. Fast die komplette Emission von Ammoniak fällt dabei auf die Nutztierhaltung. In geringerem Umfang können auch vulkanische Gase einen Beitrag zur Umweltbelastung leisten, ebenso wie der Straßenverkehr.', 'Ammoniumsalze sind dagegen auf der Erde weit verbreitet. Das häufigste Ammoniumsalz ist Salmiak (Ammoniumchlorid), aber auch Diammoniumhydrogenphosphat (Phosphammit), Ammoniumsulfat (Mascagnin) und eine Anzahl komplizierter aufgebauter Ammoniumsalze mit weiteren Kationen sind aus der Natur bekannt. Diese findet man vor allem in der Umgebung von Vulkanen oder brennenden Kohleflözen, in denen organische Substanzen unter anderem zu Ammoniak zersetzt werden. So wird Salmiak vorwiegend als Sublimationsprodukt um Fumarolen gefunden, wo sich die im heißen Dampf enthaltenen Chlorwasserstoff- und Ammoniak-Gase als Ammoniumchlorid niederschlagen.', 'Auch viele Gesteine und Sedimente, vor allem Muskovit, Biotit und Feldspat-Minerale, enthalten Ammonium. Dagegen enthalten Quarzgesteine nur geringe Mengen Ammonium. Für die Verteilung spielt neben dem Ursprung des Ammoniums auch das Entweichen von Ammoniak bei der Metamorphose eine Rolle.', 'Ammoniak kommt auch im Weltall vor. Es war 1968 das erste Molekül, das durch sein Mikrowellenspektrum im interstellaren Raum gefunden wurde. Auch auf den Gasplaneten des Sonnensystems kommt Ammoniak vor.', 'Globale Produktion.', 'Ammoniak ist eine Grundchemikalie und wird in großem Maßstab produziert. Im Jahr 2020 wurden weltweit 147 Millionen Tonnen hergestellt. Die Hauptproduzenten sind die Volksrepublik China, Indien, Russland und die Vereinigten Staaten. Für die Ammoniakproduktion werden zurzeit noch große Mengen fossiler Energieträger benötigt. Der Anteil der Ammoniakproduktion am weltweiten Verbrauch fossiler Energieträger beträgt etwa 1,4 bis 3 %.', 'Einen Überblick über die globale Verteilung der Produktionsmengen und die historische Entwicklung der globalen Ammoniakproduktion geben folgende Tabelle und Grafik:', 'Über 90 % des produzierten Ammoniaks wird in der Direktsynthese über das Haber-Bosch-Verfahren produziert. Bei dieser Reaktion reagieren die Gase Stickstoff und Wasserstoff in einer heterogen katalysierten Redoxreaktion in großen Reaktoren miteinander. Bei der Reaktion wird formal betrachtet Stickstoff zu Ammoniak reduziert mit Wasserstoff als Reduktionsmittel, der dabei oxidiert wird und seine Oxidationszahl erhöht.', 'Die Reaktion ist exotherm, hat aber eine hohe Aktivierungsenergie, weshalb man einen Katalysator braucht, um eine nennenswerte Umsetzungsrate zu erreichen.', 'Vor der eigentlichen Reaktion müssen zunächst die Ausgangsstoffe gewonnen werden. Während Stickstoff als Luftbestandteil in großen Mengen zu Verfügung steht und durch Luftverflüssigung gewonnen wird, muss Wasserstoff zunächst aus geeigneten Quellen hergestellt werden. Das zurzeit noch (2020) wichtigste Verfahren stellt dabei die Dampfreformierung dar, bei dem vor allem Erdgas, aber auch Kohle und Naphtha in zwei Schritten mit Wasser und Sauerstoff zu Wasserstoff und Kohlenstoffdioxid umgesetzt werden. Nach Abtrennung des Kohlenstoffdioxides wird der Wasserstoff im richtigen Verhältnis mit Stickstoff gemischt und je nach Verfahren auf 80–400 bar, typischerweise auf 150–250 bar, verdichtet. In Zukunft ist zu erwarten, dass der Wasserstoff mehr und mehr auf elektrolytischem Weg aus Wasser unter Verwendung von regenerativ erzeugtem Strom erzeugt wird.', 'Das Gasgemisch wird in den Reaktionskreislauf eingespeist. Dort wird es zunächst zur Entfernung von Wasserspuren gekühlt und anschließend an Wärmetauschern auf 400–500 °C erhitzt.

April 1999 an der Columbine High School in Columbine, einem nahe Littleton gelegenen Vorort von Denver im US-Bundesstaat Colorado. Bei dem Amoklauf erschossen zwei Abschlussklässler innerhalb einer Stunde zwölf Schüler im Alter von 14 bis 18 Jahren, einen Lehrer und sich selbst. Weitere 24 Menschen wurden zum Teil schwer verletzt. Viele der Überlebenden berichteten anlässlich des 20. Jahrestages im Jahr 2019, noch immer an den Folgen des Ereignisses zu leiden.', 'Die Täter – der 18-jährige Eric Harris und der 17-jährige Dylan Klebold – hatten den Massenmord monatelang vorbereitet und nicht als Amoklauf, sondern als Bombenanschlag auf ihre Schule geplant, bei dem mehrere hundert Menschen sterben sollten. Aufgrund eines technischen Fehlers explodierten die von ihnen zu diesem Zweck in der Schulcafeteria platzierten Bomben jedoch nicht, weshalb sie ihren Plan spontan änderten und begannen, auf ihre Mitschüler zu schießen.', 'Ihre Motive konnten nicht mit Gewissheit geklärt werden. Während der Amoklauf in den Medien häufig als Racheakt für erlittenes Mobbing in der Schule eingestuft wurde, gingen die Ermittlungsbehörden nach Auswertung der von den Tätern hinterlassenen Tagebuch- und Videoaufzeichnungen davon aus, dass es ihnen in erster Linie darum ging, berühmt zu werden. Einzelne Experten vermuten auch eine politische oder ideologische Motivation. Bei beiden Tätern wurden post mortem schwere psychische Störungen diagnostiziert.', 'Es war nicht der erste Amoklauf an einer Schule in den Vereinigten Staaten, aufgrund der enormen Medienberichterstattung erregte der Fall jedoch erstmals weltweites Aufsehen. Die Tat entfachte zahlreiche öffentliche Debatten über mögliche Ursachen und Mitschuldige, wobei vor allem Mobbing, Psychopharmaka, die Verantwortung von Eltern und Lehrkräften, der Einfluss der Musikindustrie und von fiktionaler Gewalt auf Jugendliche, Subkulturen sowie das vielfach als zu liberal kritisierte Waffenrecht der USA diskutiert wurden. Als Reaktion auf den Vorfall erhöhten viele Schulen ihre Sicherheitsvorkehrungen und die US-Polizei änderte ihre Taktik beim Einschreiten in Amoklagen.', 'Die Tat gilt wegen ihrer weitreichenden Folgen als Wendepunkt in der Kultur der Vereinigten Staaten und wird insbesondere von den Generationen X und Y zu den bedeutendsten historischen Ereignissen der 1990er Jahre gezählt. Der Amoklauf an der Columbine High School ist zum Archetyp des \\"School Shootings\\" geworden und hat Einzug in die Populärkultur gehalten. Der nach der Tat weltweit zu verzeichnende Anstieg an Schulschießereien wird oft als „Columbine-Effekt“ bezeichnet, weil viele der späteren Amokläufer das Schulmassaker von Littleton als Inspiration für ihre eigene Tat nannten. In den USA werden Schüler, die nach dem 20. April 1999 geboren wurden, als „Generation Columbine“ bezeichnet, die nie eine Welt ohne \\"School Shootings\\" erlebt hat.', 'Vorgeschichte.', 'Biografien der Täter.', 'Kindheit und familiärer Hintergrund.', 'Eric David Harris wurde am 9. April 1981 als der jüngere von zwei Söhnen des aus Colorado stammenden Ehepaars Wayne und Katherine Harris in Wichita, Kansas, geboren. Bedingt durch den Beruf des Vaters, der Transportpilot bei der U.S. Air Force war, zog die Familie mehrmals innerhalb der USA um und lebte unter anderem in Beavercreek, Ohio, und Oscoda, Michigan, sowie in Plattsburgh im Bundesstaat New York. Harris empfand die häufigen Umzüge und die damit verbundenen Schulwechsel als belastend, da er sich jedes Mal einen neuen Freundeskreis aufbauen musste. 1993 ließ sich die Familie schließlich dauerhaft in Littleton nieder, wo Wayne Harris nach seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Militärdienst für ein Flugsicherheitsunternehmen arbeitete und Katherine Harris Anstellung bei einer Catering-Firma fand. Als Kind spielte Harris Fußball und Baseball in der Little League. Im Alter von 12 Jahren wurde er operiert, um eine angeborene Thoraxdeformität zu korrigieren. Kindheitsfreunde beschrieben ihn rückblickend als schlauen, schüchternen, respektvollen und normalen Jungen, der „nicht so zu sein schien, wie die Medien ihn [nach dem Amoklauf] porträtierten.“', 'Dylan Bennet Klebold kam am 11. September 1981 in Lakewood, Colorado, zur Welt, wuchs in Littleton auf und hatte wie Harris einen drei Jahre älteren Bruder. Sein Vater Thomas Klebold, ein Geophysiker, betätigte sich als Berater für Ölfirmen und selbstständiger Hypothekenverwalter. Seine Mutter Sue Klebold entstammt einer jüdischen Familie aus Columbus, Ohio, und unterstützte als Angestellte am Colorado Community College Menschen mit Behinderung bei der Integration in den Arbeitsmarkt. Die Familie gehörte der lutherischen Kirche an, pflegte aber auch jüdische Traditionen. Klebold galt als hochintelligent, zeigte eine außergewöhnliche Begabung für Mathematik und wurde ein Jahr vorzeitig eingeschult. In der Elementary School nahm er an einem Programm für besonders talentierte Kinder teil. Er spielte ebenfalls Fußball und war Pitcher in der Little League. Seine Eltern duldeten keine Waffen in ihrem Haushalt. Zeitgenossen beschrieben ihn als sehr schüchternen, sanftmütigen Jungen mit geringem Selbstwertgefühl, der sich leicht gedemütigt fühlte und schlecht verlieren konnte.', 'Jugend und gemeinsame Schulzeit.', 'Harris und Klebold lernten sich 1993 auf der Ken Caryl Middle School kennen und wurden enge Freunde. In ihrer Freizeit beschäftigten sie sich häufig mit Computern, dem Internet und Videospielen. Ab 1995 besuchten sie die Columbine High School im Schulbezirk des Jefferson County. In der sozialen Hierarchie der Schule standen sie auf der untersten Stufe, entgegen ursprünglichen Medienberichten waren sie jedoch keine Einzelgänger, sondern hatten einen vergleichsweise großen Freundeskreis, der vor allem aus Nerds und Computerfreaks bestand. Beide Täter hatten keine feste Freundin und äußerten sich in ihren Aufzeichnungen frustriert über ihre nicht erwiderten Gefühle für verschiedene Mädchen. Während Klebold zu schüchtern war, um Mädchen anzusprechen, wurde Harris häufig abgewiesen.', 'Laut mehreren Zeugen wurden beide Täter oft von den sozial erfolgreicheren Schülern – sogenannten \\"Jocks\\" – gemobbt, wobei sie sowohl verbal als auch physisch attackiert wurden. Beispielsweise berichteten Mitschüler über mehrere Vorfälle, bei denen Harris und Klebold mit Glasflaschen oder Lebensmitteln beworfen oder als „Schwuchteln“ beschimpft worden waren. Gegenüber seinem Vater äußerte Klebold, dass er mit seiner Körpergröße von über 1,90 m nicht herumgeschubst werde, aber dass Harris häufig Schikanen ausgesetzt sei. Nach anderen Zeugenaussagen hätten beide Täter aber auch selbst andere Schüler eingeschüchtert und mit aggressivem oder provokantem Verhalten Konflikte heraufbeschworen. Im Dezember 1998 drehten Harris und Klebold im Rahmen ihres Videokurses einen fiktionalen Kurzfilm mit dem Titel \\"Hitmen for Hire\\", in dem sie Auftragskiller spielen, die den Peiniger eines Mobbingopfers erschießen und eine Schule in die Luft sprengen. Auszüge des Videos wurden nach dem Amoklauf vom US-Sender Fox News landesweit ausgestrahlt.', 'Neben dem Unterricht engagierten sich beide Täter für den Schülersender und assistierten bei der Betreuung des Computernetzwerks der Schule; Klebold kümmerte sich zudem um die Tontechnik bei Aufführungen der Theatergruppe. Während Harris bis zuletzt als guter Schüler galt, ließen Klebolds schulische Leistungen im Laufe der Zeit nach und seine Lehrer bemerkten, dass er häufiger im Unterricht schlief. Im Dezember 1997 schrieb Harris einen Schulaufsatz zum Thema „Waffen in Schulen“, in dem er sich auf mehrere Schulschießereien bezog, die sich in den Wochen zuvor in den USA ereignet hatten. Als Problemlösung schlug er Metalldetektoren und erhöhte Polizeipräsenz vor. Klebold reichte im Februar 1999 einen Aufsatz ein, der von einem ihm ähnelnden Mann handelte, der „Jocks“ erschießt. Seine Lehrerin zeigte sich von der gewalthaltigen Erzählung verstört, weshalb sie das Gespräch mit seinen Eltern suchte. Sie vereinbarten die Konsultation eines Schulberaters, der Klebold ermahnte, darüber hinaus aber keine Konsequenzen zog.', 'Der Amoklauf fand nur wenige Tage vor ihrem anstehenden Schulabschluss statt. Beide Täter hatten sich bereits zu Zukunftsplänen geäußert. Klebold war für ein Informatikstudium an der University of Arizona akzeptiert worden und hatte sich Ende März 1999 mit seinen Eltern den Campus angesehen; Harris hatte sich bei den Marines beworben und bereits den schriftlichen Aufnahmetest mit überdurchschnittlichem Ergebnis bestanden. Seine Bewerbung wurde jedoch kurz vor dem Amoklauf abgelehnt, nachdem der Rekrutierer erfahren hatte, dass Harris ein Antidepressivum zur Behandlung einer Depression einnahm. Auf die Ablehnung soll Harris enttäuscht, aber nicht niedergeschlagen reagiert haben. Am 17. April 1999 – drei Tage vor dem Amoklauf – ging Klebold mit mehreren Freunden zur Prom, wo sie ihn gutgelaunt erlebten und er darauf bestand, nach dem Schulabschluss in Kontakt zu bleiben. Harris gesellte sich zur After-Prom-Party dazu, auf der sie bis in die frühen Morgenstunden mit ihren Mitschülern feierten.', 'Erste Straffälligkeiten.', 'Ab Januar 1997 begaben Harris und Klebold sich auf mehrere nächtliche Streifzüge, bei denen sie an Häusern und sonstigem Eigentum von Leuten, die sie nicht mochten, Vandalismus betrieben. Sie wurden dabei weder erwischt noch bemerkten ihre Eltern, wenn sie nachts für Stunden aus dem Haus schlichen. Im September 1997 ergatterten Harris, Klebold und ein Freund der beiden durch einen Hack in das Computersystem der Columbine High School eine Liste mit den Zahlenschlosskombinationen der Schüler-Spinde. Nachdem sie einige Spinde geöffnet hatten, kam ihnen die Schulleitung auf die Schliche und sie wurden für mehrere Tage vom Unterricht ausgeschlossen. Einige Monate später wurde Klebold ein weiteres Mal vorübergehend suspendiert, weil er vorsätzlich den Spind eines Mitschülers beschädigt hatte. Der ihn bestrafende Lehrer erinnerte sich später daran, dass Klebold wütend auf seine erneute Suspendierung reagiert und sich über das Schulsystem und die ungleiche Behandlung von Schülern geärgert habe.', 'Harris betrieb eine Blog-ähnliche AOL-Website, auf der er ab Anfang 1997 über seinen zunehmenden Hass auf se: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Amoklauf, Columbine, Schule, USA, Kriminalfall, Geschichte, Täter, Motive, Medien, Folgen"},{"instruction":"Привет","output":"Привет!

Zu Beginn spielte die Band Death Metal, den sie jedoch bald mit Progressive-Metal-Elementen und Einflüssen aus der traditionellen finnischen Musik weiterentwickelte. Mit dem Verzicht auf Growlgesang wandte sich die Band vorübergehend vollständig vom Death Metal ab. Erst auf dem Album \\"Eclipse\\" verband Amorphis wieder teilweise Growlgesang mit den progressiven Elementen der Vorgänger. Neben der Musik sind auch die Texte von der finnischen Kultur inspiriert, einige davon entstammen der finnischen Gedichtsammlung \\"Kanteletar\\" oder dem Nationalepos \\"Kalevala\\".', 'Amorphis gilt als eine der erfolgreichsten finnischen Metal-Bands. In ihrem Heimatland erreicht sie seit zehn Jahren mit nahezu jeder Veröffentlichung eine Platzierung in den Top 10 der Charts.', 'Geschichte.', 'Bandgründung (1990–1996).', 'Amorphis wurde im Herbst 1990 von Jan „Snoopy“ Rechberger, Esa Holopainen, Tomi Koivusaari und Olli-Pekka Laine gegründet. Die drei Erstgenannten hatten Ende der 1980er zusammen in der Speed-Metal-Band \\"Violent Solution\\" gespielt, die sich jedoch im Laufe des Jahres 1990 aufgelöst hatte. Koivusaari war seit 1989 außerdem Mitglied in der Death-Metal-Band Abhorrence gewesen. Nach der Auflösung von \\"Violent Solution\\" wollten Rechberger und Holopainen auch eine Death-Metal-Band gründen. Da \\"Abhorrence\\" sich Ende 1990 bereits weitgehend aufgelöst hatte, fragten sie Koivusaari, ob er sich ihnen als Gitarrist anschließen wolle, Bass sollte Olli-Pekka Laine spielen. Jukka Kolehmainen, der Sänger von \\"Abhorrence\\", sollte Sänger der neuen Band werden, lehnte aber ab. Schlussendlich übernahm Tomi deshalb auch den Gesang in der neu gegründeten Band Amorphis, während sich \\"Abhorrence\\" auflöste.', 'Im Januar 1991 nahm Amorphis die Demo \\"Disment of Soul\\" im \\"TTT Studio\\" von Timo Tolkki auf. Die Arbeit an den drei Stücken dauerte zwei Tage, die Band war jedoch recht unzufrieden mit dem Sound der Aufnahmen.&lt;ref name=\\"hellspawn/91\\"&gt;Sami: \\"Interview zu Disment of Soul (PDF; 316 kB)\\" in \\"Hellspawn\\", Sommer 1991 (englisch, abgerufen am 12.

Kurz nach den Aufnahmen wurde Tomi Koivusaari für \\"Abhorrence\\" ein Plattenvertrag vom US-amerikanischen Plattenlabel Relapse Records angeboten. Als Ersatz für die aufgelöste Band schickte Koivusaari eine Demo von Amorphis zurück, die das Label davon überzeugte, einen Vertrag über fünf Alben mit der Band abzuschließen. Im Mai 1991 spielte Amorphis weitere sechs Stücke für eine Split-CD mit der US-amerikanischen Death-Metal-Band \\"Incantation\\" ein, die jedoch nie erschien, da beide Bands lieber gleich komplette Alben veröffentlichen wollten.&lt;ref name=\\"hml/4\\"&gt;Matthias Herr: \\"Heavy Metal Lexikon Vol. 4\\", S. 14 und 15, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Eines der sechs Stücke war \\"Vulgar Necrolatry\\", ein Lied von \\"Abhorrence\\". Hier trat Jukka Kolehmainen, der ehemalige Sänger von \\"Abhorrence\\", als Gastsänger auf. Zwei Stücke der Session wurden im Juli 1992 auf der 7\\"-Single \\"Amorphis\\" veröffentlicht. Die gesamten Aufnahmen erschienen im Jahr 1993 auf der CD \\"Privilege of Evil\\".', 'Nach einigen Konzerten wurde im Mai 1992 das Debütalbum \\"The Karelian Isthmus\\" im \\"Sunlight Studio\\" in Stockholm produziert. Den Vertrieb in Europa für dieses, wie auch für die vier nachfolgenden Alben, übernahm Nuclear Blast. Im Juli 1994 erschien das zweite Album \\"Tales from the Thousand Lakes\\". Der Gastmusiker Ville Tuomi (Kyyria) übernahm den erstmals eingesetzten, klaren Gesang. Mit Kasper Mårtenson hatte Amorphis den ersten Keyboarder der Bandgeschichte, für das Debütalbum hatte Jan Rechberger noch die wenigen Keyboardspuren eingespielt. Die Single \\"Black Winter Day\\" sollte eigentlich vor dem Album erscheinen, die Veröffentlichung verzögerte sich jedoch, sodass sie schließlich erst einige Zeit nach dem Album erschien. Dafür nahm die Band zu dem Song ihr erstes Video auf. 1995 verließen Jan Rechberger und Kasper Mårtenson die Band. Ersetzt wurden sie durch Kim Rantala und Pekka Kasari. Der Sänger Ville Tuomi spielte nach den Aufnahmen zu \\"Tales from the Thousand Lakes\\" noch einige Konzerte mit Amorphis in Europa, bevor auch er die Band verließ. Als Ersatz für ihn sollte ein namentlich nicht genannter Sänger dienen, der die Band jedoch nach einem Konzert wieder verließ und nach Angaben von Tomi Koivusaari im Power-Metal-Stil der deutschen Band Helloween gesungen hatte. Ende 1994 spielte Amorphis als Vorband von Entombed zum ersten Mal in den Vereinigten Staaten. Kurz darauf führte eine Tournee mit Tiamat durch Europa.', 'Kommerzieller Erfolg (1996–2004).', 'Die Aufnahmen zum dritten Album \\"Elegy\\" verzögerten sich, da sich Esa Holopainen bei einem Sturz den Arm verletzte und zudem noch jenes Studio umzog, in dem die Stücke eingespielt werden sollten. Mit Pasi Koskinen wurde während der Aufnahmen auch ein fester zweiter Sänger gefunden, der den melodischen Gesang übernehmen sollte, während Tomi Koivusaari weiterhin die Growls sang. Im Juni 1996 erschien \\"Elegy\\", mit dem Amorphis erstmals der Einstieg in die Top 10 der finnischen Charts gelang. Wie schon nach \\"Tales from the Thousand Lakes\\" spielte die Band die nächsten knapp anderthalb Jahre viele Konzerte, unter anderem eine Europatournee mit Therion und Hardware im Herbst 1996 und mit EverEve im Frühjahr 1997. Außerdem erschien die EP \\"My Kantele\\". Im August 1997 trat Amorphis zum ersten Mal auf dem Wacken Open Air auf. Nach der Tournee legte Amorphis eine Schaffenspause ein, um über die weitere musikalische Entwicklung nachzudenken. Außerdem verließ Kim Rantala die Band wieder.', '1999 wurde \\"Tuonela\\" veröffentlicht, auf dem die Gastmusiker Santeri Kallio Keyboard und Sakari Kukko Saxophon und Flöte spielten und so die Instrumentierung der Band erweiterten. Nachdem Tomi Koivusaari bereits auf \\"Elegy\\" weniger Anteil am Gesang hatte, verabschiedete er sich auf \\"Tuonela\\" endgültig davon. Bei Konzerten übernahm Pasi Koskinen neben seinen eigenen Gesangsspuren auch das Growling von Koivusaari. Sowohl das Album, als auch die zugehörige Single \\"Divinity\\" erreichten die Top-10 in Finnland. Zum zehnjährigen Jubiläum erschien im Jahr 2000 die Best-Of-Compilation \\"Story\\". Zur gleichen Zeit verließ Olli-Pekka Laine die Band und wurde von Niclas Etelävuori ersetzt. Mit Santeri Kallio, der bereits auf dem letzten Album mitgewirkt hatte, kam ein neuer Keyboarder hinzu. Kurz darauf spielte Amorphis zum ersten Mal seit 1994 wieder in den Vereinigten Staaten, diesmal gemeinsam mit Moonspell und The Kovenant.', 'Mit dem Album \\"Am Universum\\", zu dem Ende 2000 die Aufnahmen beendet wurden und das von Simon Efemey produziert wurde, konnte Amorphis im Jahr 2001 in den finnischen Charts bis auf Platz 4 aufsteigen. Die Single \\"Alone\\" erreichte Platz 1. 2001 tourte Amorphis mit Opeth als Vorband ein weiteres Mal durch die Vereinigten Staaten. Pekka Kasari verließ die Band nach der Tournee aus familiären Gründen und wurde vom Schlagzeuger Jan Rechberger ersetzt, der damit in die Band zurückkehrte. Ende 2002 veröffentlichte Amorphis \\"Kuusamo\\", ihr einziges Stück auf Finnisch. Die Coverversion eines Popsongs von Ilkka Lipsanen aus dem Jahr 1976 erschien auf dem Soundtrack des finnischen Roadmovies Menolippu Mombasaan von Hannu Tuomainen. Neben Amorphis waren weitere bekannte finnische Bands wie Nightwish, HIM und Apocalyptica auf dem Soundtrack vertreten. Der Film war 2003 unter anderem für den Jussi Award „Beste Musik“ nominiert. Mit dem Jahr 2002 endete auch die Zusammenarbeit mit Relapse Records, das mit \\"Chapters\\" eine weitere Best-Of-Compilation veröffentlichte.', 'Das nächste Album hieß \\"Far from the Sun\\" und wurde von Amorphis selbst aufgenommen und produziert. Die Veröffentlichung im März 2003 übernahm das Major-Label Virgin Records. Im Oktober 2003 gab Amorphis einige Konzerte mit Paradise Lost in Finnland, bei denen Atte Sarkima von Ajattara den verhinderten Jan Rechberger vertrat. Im Frühjahr 2004 spielte Amorphis einige Demos für neue Stücke in den \\"CPCC Studios\\" ein. Erst im September 2004, also über ein Jahr nach dem Release in Europa, wurde \\"Far from the Sun\\" auch in den Vereinigten Staaten veröffentlicht. Für den Oktober 2004 war eine USA-Tour mit Type O Negative geplant, die jedoch wegen einer Erkrankung von Peter Steele abgesagt wurde.', 'Gegenwart (ab 2005).', 'Bereits vor der Absage der USA-Tournee kündigte Pasi Koskinen seinen Austritt aus der Band an, nachdem er für neun Jahre als Sänger an Amorphis beteiligt war. Am 21. August 2004 spielte er sein letztes Konzert mit Amorphis auf dem Kontu Rock Festival. In einem Interview sagt Niclas Etelavuori: Für die USA-Tour sollte übergangsweise Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto von Charon den Gesang übernehmen.

In dieser aus den Ablagerungen des Isar-Loisach-Gletschers während der Würm-Kaltzeit entstandenen Jungmoränenlandschaft schneidet sich die Ammer bis zu 80 Meter tief in die Moränen und in die darunter anstehende Molasse ein und bildet die Ammerschlucht, auch Ammerleite genannt. Südlich von Hohenpeißenberg knickt die Ammerschlucht nach Osten ab. Bei Peißenberg verlässt der Fluss die Schlucht und wendet sich wieder nach Norden. Er durchfließt ein lang gestrecktes breites Tal, bis er östlich von Dießen in den Ammersee mündet. Wenig zuvor zweigt noch links die \\"Alte Ammer\\" ab, die nach kurzem Lauf von der längeren, aber gewöhnlich wasserärmeren Rott aufgenommen wird, die ebenfalls in den Ammersee mündet.', 'Amper.', 'Nach dem Austritt aus dem Ammersee bei Eching am Ammersee durchschneidet das Tal der Amper zunächst bei Grafrath eine Endmoränenlandschaft des Isar-Loisach-Gletschers der Würm-Kaltzeit und durchfließt anschließend ab Fürstenfeldbruck die Münchner Schotterebene. Nordöstlich von Dachau kommt sie in den Bereich des tertiären Donau-Isar-Hügellandes und mündet schließlich bei Moosburg in die Isar. Südwestlich von Moosburg wird der Amper der größte Teil ihres Wassers (30 m³/s) entzogen und durch einen Kanal südlich an Moosburg vorbei der Isar zugeführt. Durch einen weiteren Verbindungskanal wird dieses Wasser in den Uppenbornwerken am Mittlere-Isar-Kanal zur Energieerzeugung genutzt.

Als die Römer im ersten Jahrhundert den Bereich des heutigen Oberbayerns eroberten, erschlossen sie das Land mit gut ausgebauten Verkehrswegen. Eine der bedeutendsten Heeres- und Handelsstraßen, die Via Julia, verband Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg) mit Juvavum (Salzburg). Diese Straßen wurden nicht nur vom Militär genutzt, sondern vor allem von Händlern, um das damals so wertvolle Salz besser transportieren zu können. Um die Amper sicher zu überwinden, wurden Straßenstationen an Flussübergängen wie natürliche Furten errichtet. Der dadurch einfach zu kontrollierende Handelsverkehr ermöglichte regelmäßige Einnahmen durch Zollgebühren und gewann so an zusätzlicher Bedeutung. So steht auch die mittelalterliche Gründung der Stadt Fürstenfeldbruck im direkten Zusammenhang mit dem Bau einer Brücke.', 'Während der Völkerwanderung im fünften Jahrhundert drangen alemannische Stammesverbände bis in den Bereich der Ammer/Amper vor. Die Alemannen wurden zwar in der Folge durch die bajuwarischen Stämme zurückgedrängt, aber dennoch bildet der Verlauf der beiden Flüsse in etwa auch heute noch die Sprachgrenze zwischen der schwäbischen und der bayerischen Mundart.', 'Während des Dreißigjährigen Krieges zog ein schwedisches Heer insgesamt dreimal (zwischen 1632 und 1634) entlang der Amper, um Augsburg und München zu erreichen.', 'Die wiederkehrenden Hochwasser verursachten immer wieder Überschwemmungen in den anliegenden Städten und Gemeinden. So wurde seit dem 19. Jahrhundert verstärkt damit begonnen, zur Verringerung der Hochwassergefahr in einigen Bereichen die Ufer mit Deichen zu sichern und den Fluss selbst zum Teil zu kanalisieren, damit sich das Flussbett vertiefen konnte. Durch weitere regulierende Maßnahmen, wie den Bau von Wehren, wurde der Hochwasserschutz zusätzlich verbessert.', '1945 sprengten deutsche Soldaten unter anderem die Amperbrücke westlich von Inning. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass die von der Bevölkerung gefürchteten französischen Truppen des Generals de Gaulle im westlichen Bereich des Ammersees verblieben und deshalb die weiter östlich gelegenen Gebiete von den amerikanischen Soldaten erobert wurden.', 'Beim Pfingsthochwasser von 1999 wurden trotz aller Maßnahmen unter anderem die Wehre teilweise stark beschädigt.', 'Natur- und Umweltschutz.', 'Seit Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts wird der natürliche Verlauf der Ammer und der Amper durch den Hochwasserschutz und durch den Bau von Kraftwerken stark verändert – mit weitreichenden Folgen für die einheimische Tier- und Pflanzenwelt. Die Durchgängigkeit des Fließgewässers wird zum Beispiel häufig durch Wehre gestört. Dadurch wird die Wanderung und der Verbreitung von Fischen flussauf- bzw. flussabwärts erschwert oder sogar unmöglich gemacht. Auch die Eindeichung in einigen Bereichen bedeutete einen Eingriff in das ökologische Gleichgewicht. Die Auwälder wurden durch die Deiche vom natürlichen Wasserzufluss abgeschirmt, so dass der Auwald nur noch in Resten vorhanden ist. Um zumindest in Teilbereichen die ursprüngliche Flusslandschaft zu erhalten, wurden mehrere Naturschutzgebiete, wie das Naturschutzgebiet Amperauen mit Leitenwälder zwischen Fürstenfeldbruck und Schöngeising, ausgewiesen.

In Europa ist die Amsel der am weitesten verbreitete Vertreter dieser Familie und zugleich einer der bekanntesten Vögel überhaupt. Ihre Körperlänge liegt zwischen 24 und 27 Zentimetern. Die Männchen sind schwarz gefärbt und haben einen gelben Schnabel, das Gefieder der Weibchen ist größtenteils dunkelbraun. Der melodiöse und laut vorgetragene Reviergesang der Männchen ist in Mitteleuropa hauptsächlich zwischen Anfang März und Ende Juli zu hören und kann bereits vor der Morgendämmerung beginnen.', 'Das Brutgebiet in Europa weist außer dem hohen Norden und dem äußersten Südosten keine größeren Verbreitungslücken auf. Darüber hinaus kommt die Amsel in Teilen Nordafrikas und Asiens vor. In Australien und Neuseeland wurde die Amsel eingebürgert. In Mitteleuropa verlässt ein Teil der Vögel im Winter das Brutgebiet und zieht nach Südeuropa oder Nordafrika.', 'Ursprünglich war die Amsel ein Vogel des Waldes, wo sie auch heute noch anzutreffen ist. Im 19. Jahrhundert begann sie über siedlungsnahe Parks und Gärten bis in die Stadtzentren vorzudringen und ist zum Kulturfolger geworden. Ihre Nahrung suchen Amseln vorwiegend am Boden. Sie ernähren sich überwiegend von tierischer Nahrung, meist Regenwürmer oder Käfer. Abhängig von der Verfügbarkeit steigt der Anteil gefressener Beeren und Früchte. Amseln sind Freibrüter und nisten vorwiegend in Bäumen und Sträuchern.', 'Aussehen und Merkmale.', 'Adulte Amseln weisen einen deutlichen Geschlechtsdimorphismus auf: Das Gefieder der Männchen ist einfarbig schwarz, der Schnabel auffällig hellgelb bis orange. Zudem zeigen Männchen einen deutlichen Ring um die Augen, dessen Farbe der des Schnabels ähnelt, jedoch etwas ins Bräunliche gehen kann. Dieser Augenring kontrastiert stark mit der dunkelbraunen Iris. Weniger deutlich ist dieser Augenring beim Weibchen, auch der Schnabel ist weniger auffällig und hell hornfarben statt gelb. Die Gefiederfärbung des Weibchens ist viel variabler und vorwiegend dunkelbraun, teilweise ins Grau gehend oder rötlichbraun. Bei beiden Geschlechtern sind Lauf und Zehen dunkelbraun. Im Vergleich zum kleineren, ebenfalls dunkel befiederten und sich häufig auf dem Boden aufhaltenden Star hat die Amsel einen deutlich längeren Schwanz.', 'Gefieder adulter Amseln.', 'Das Gefieder der adulten Männchen ist recht einheitlich schwarz. Vor allem an der Unterseite, aber auch an Rücken und Schulterregion zeigen die Federn nicht selten einen grauen bis bronzefarbenen Endsaum, was aber recht unauffällig ist und nur bei günstigen Lichtverhältnissen einen leicht schuppigen Eindruck macht. Die Schwungfedern können im Frühjahr ausgebleicht wirken.', 'Die Oberseite der Weibchen ist dunkel olivbraun bis olivgrau gefärbt, die Stirn oft etwas weniger dunkel. Die Färbung der helleren Unterseite fällt individuell sehr verschieden aus. Kinn und Kehle sind hell schmutziggrau bis rötlichbraun mit dunkler Streifung. Die Brust ist braungrau, gelbbraun bis rotbraun mit mehr oder weniger deutlichen Sprenkeln. Der Bauch ist braun, graubraun oder grau, wobei zuweilen durch einen hellen Endsaum der Federn ein deutlich geschuppter Eindruck entsteht.

Dabei wechseln vorwiegend die älteren Jungvögel in ein sogenanntes Fortschrittskleid, die später geschlüpften in ein Hemmungskleid, in dem sie weiterhin eher Jungvögeln ähneln. Die einjährigen Männchen im Hemmungskleid werden auch Stockamseln genannt. Bei allen einjährigen Männchen, also auch den Männchen im Fortschrittskleid, sind die Schwungfedern und die unvermauserten Flügeldecken braun im Gegensatz zur braunschwarzen oder schwarzen Färbung der bereits vermauserten Federpartien. Auch bei den einjährigen Weibchen kontrastieren die bereits vermauserten und die unvermauserten Gefiederteile; Letztere sind deutlich heller.', 'Im Regelfall beginnt die reguläre Jahresmauser, bei der es sich um eine Vollmauser handelt, zwei Wochen nach Beendigung der Jungenaufzucht.

In Europa liegt der Mauserzeitraum typischerweise zwischen Juni und Ende Oktober, wobei sich nahezu alle adulten Amseln im August mausern.', 'Abweichende Färbungen.', 'Das für Drosseln typische Tropfenmuster ist auch bei der Amsel nachweisbar, bei den Männchen wird es durch intensive Melaninablagerungen in den Federn überdeckt. Somit kann Melanismus als normal für die Art angesehen werden. Nicht der Norm entsprechend ist dagegen die Verringerung von Pigment oder der Pigmentausfall, was in unterschiedlicher Form und Intensität auftreten kann: Durch Albinismus verursacht sind fahle Färbungen (Chlorochroismus, Flavismus). Vollständig albinotische weiße Vögel mit roten Augen dürften wegen ihrer verminderten Sehfähigkeit kaum Überlebenschancen in freier Natur haben. Weiße Tiere mit braunen oder schwarzen Augen sind leuzistisch. Scheckungen sind auf einen abgeschwächten Leuzismus zurückzuführen.', 'In manchen Jahren treten gescheckte Tiere örtlich gehäuft auf. Die dabei entstehenden symmetrischen oder auch asymmetrischen Muster sind äußerst unterschiedlich. Einerseits kann diese Weißfärbung offenbar eine erblich bedingte oder bleibende Störung während der Anlage oder Entwicklung der Follikel sein. Andererseits wurde experimentell nachgewiesen, dass die weißen Federn im Gefieder von der Zusammensetzung der Nahrung abhängen können, vor allem während der Mauser. Eiweißarme Nahrung scheint Albinismus zu begünstigen.', 'Aberrante Färbungen werden heute vor allem bei den Vögeln im Siedlungsgebiet beobachtet, waren aber lange bekannt, bevor Amseln in der Nähe des Menschen vorkamen, beispielsweise hat Aristoteles bereits weiße Amseln beschrieben.', 'Körpermaße und Gewicht.', 'Mit einer Körperlänge zwischen 24 und 27 Zentimetern sind Amseln der Nominatform nur unwesentlich kleiner als die größte mitteleuropäische Drosselart, die Misteldrossel. Männchen sind etwas größer als Weibchen. Die Flügellänge des Männchens liegt im Mittel bei 133 mm und beim Weibchen bei 128 mm, das entspricht ungefähr einer Spannweite zwischen 34 und 38,5 Zentimetern. Die Schwanzlänge liegt zwischen 104 und 116 Millimetern.', 'Die Gewichtsschwankungen im Jahresverlauf sind bei europäischen Amseln beträchtlich. Bei mehrjährigen, in Großbritannien durchgeführten Untersuchungen lag das Gewicht zwischen 71 und 150 Gramm, im Mittel wogen adulte Männchen 102,8 Gramm, adulte Weibchen waren mit 100,3 Gramm etwas leichter. Einjährige Vögel waren durchschnittlich knapp 3 Gramm leichter. Im Jahresverlauf sind die Weibchen nur während der Legezeit etwas schwerer als die Männchen. Das größte Gewicht haben mitteleuropäische Amseln im Januar, das niedrigste im Juli oder August, nach der Brutzeit. Die Gewichtszunahme resultiert aus dem Aufbau von Fettreserven.', 'Lautäußerungen.', 'Der im Frühjahr weithin hörbare Reviergesang der Amselmännchen ist vielen Menschen vertraut. Die Amsel gilt als besonders kreativ in der Erfindung, Kombination und Variation von Motiven. Die melodiösen Strophen klingen für menschliche Ohren eingängig und gefällig, ganz im Gegensatz zu dem von beiden Geschlechtern bei Erregung zu hörenden Zetern („dackderrigigigi duck duck“) oder „Tixen“ – einer Aneinanderreihung hoher „tix“-Laute.', 'Reviergesang.', 'Der Reviergesang wird vom Männchen gewöhnlich von zwei bis drei verschiedenen, exponierten Singwarten vorgetragen, die hin und wieder gewechselt werden. Eine Strophe dieses Gesangs dauert im Mittel etwas mehr als zwei Sekunden. In der Brutsaison geben Amseln während der Morgendämmerung für 20 bis 30 Minuten eine nahezu ununterbrochene Folge solcher Strophen von sich, wobei die Pausen zwischen den Strophen im Mittel etwa drei Sekunden lang sind. Beim abendlichen Gesang sind die Pausen etwas länger.', 'Eine Strophe kann in einen Motivteil und ein leiseres, mehr zwitscherndes und geräuschhaftes „Anhängsel“ unterteilt werden. Der Motivteil ist etwas länger, das Anhängsel kann auch fehlen. Der Motivteil wiederum kann in Elemente untergliedert werden, in der Regel sind es zwei bis fünf, manchmal bis zu neun. Die Pausen zwischen den ungefähr 0,2 Sekunden langen Elementen sind hörbar. Die Elemente werden zu Motiven kombiniert, und Männchen haben nicht selten mehr als 30 Motive im Repertoire, wobei sie zwei bis fünf Lieblingsmotive haben, so dass auch für das menschliche Gehör eine Identifikation eines Individuums über den Gesang möglich ist. Beim Anhängsel gibt es noch mehr Variationen als beim Motivteil. Das Frequenzspektrum des Anhängsels ist deutlich breiter, die Hauptintensität liegt über 10 kHz, während sie im Motivteil zwischen 1,5 und 3 kHz liegt. Bei technischer Analyse des Anhängsels wurden Diplophonie und gegenläufige Frequenzverläufe festgestellt. Typisch für Amseln ist der sogenannte Kontergesang, also das wechselseitige Antworten zweier benachbarter Amselmännchen auf die Strophe des anderen. Die Vögel greifen die Motive des Gegenspielers auf und erwidern in vergleichbarer Länge und häufig mit ähnlicher Strophe.', 'Der Gesang ist zum Teil angeboren, denn der Vortrag von isoliert aufgezogenen Männchen stimmt in vielen E: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Amundsen fuhr mit der \\"Fram\\", die bereits zweimal zuvor bei Expeditionen in die Arktis eingesetzt worden war, in die Bucht der Wale, wo er Ausrüstung und Hunde an Land brachte und sein Winterquartier aufschlug. Von dort zog er per Hundeschlitten von seiner Basis Framheim aus zum Südpol, den er am 14. Dezember 1911 35 Tage vor seinem Konkurrenten Robert Falcon Scott von der britischen Terra-Nova-Expedition erreichte. Damit hatte er das „Rennen um den Pol“ gewonnen.', 'Die Expedition sollte zunächst in die arktischen Gewässer führen, um den Nordpol zu erreichen; als Amundsen jedoch im Herbst 1909 erfuhr, dass sowohl Frederick Cook als auch Robert Edwin Peary beanspruchten, den Pol erreicht zu haben, änderte er das Ziel, worüber Geldgeber und Öffentlichkeit erst nach seiner Abreise informiert wurden.', 'Hintergrund.', 'Vorgängerexpeditionen.', 'Das Rossmeer war traditionell das Arbeitsgebiet der britischen Antarktisexpeditionen gewesen. Begründet wurde diese Tradition durch James Clark Ross, der zwischen 1839 und 1843 mit den Schiffen HMS \\"Erebus\\" und HMS \\"Terror\\" drei Reisen in die Antarktis unternahm, dabei weiter nach Süden vorstieß als je ein Mensch zuvor, viele topografische Gegebenheiten entdeckte und teilweise auch benannte, darunter das Rossmeer selbst, die Ross-Insel, die \\"Great Ice Barrier\\" sowie die Bucht der Wale, das Ausgangslager der Fram-Expedition. Fortgesetzt wurde Ross’ Tradition durch die Discovery-Expedition von 1901 bis 1904, der ersten britischen Antarktisexpedition seit Ross und damit des sogenannten „Heldenzeitalters der Antarktisforschung“, der Nimrod-Expedition sowie der Terra-Nova-Expedition, die Amundsens Hauptkonkurrenz bei der Ersterreichung des Südpols war.', 'Ab 1895 gab es in diesem Gebiet jedoch auch norwegische Aktivitäten. In diesem Jahr landete nämlich die \\"Antarctic\\", ein norwegisches Walfangschiff, kurz am Kap Adare an, dem Nordzipfel Viktorialands. Ein Mitglied dieser Landungsgruppe, der Norweger Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink, reiste darauf auf eigene Kosten zum Sechsten Internationalen Geografenkongress nach London und bot sich als Leiter einer Expedition an, die als erste auf dem antarktischen Kontinent überwintern sollte. Er überzeugte die Teilnehmer des Kongresses – auch durch mitgebrachte Moosproben, die das Leben unter der antarktischen Eisdecke bewiesen – und erweckte damit das Interesse an einer wissenschaftlichen Erforschung der Antarktis neu. Im Frühjahr 1898 bot ihm der Verleger George Newnes (1851–1910) an, seine Expedition im Gegenzug für einen packenden Erlebnisbericht zu finanzieren. Diese Expedition, die Southern-Cross-Expedition, überwinterte erstmals in der Antarktis und stieß auf dem Ross-Schelfeis 70 Kilometer weit nach Süden vor. Borchgrevink zeigte, dass die Ice Barrier nicht nur als Hindernis, sondern auch als Weg in den Süden betrachtet werden könne, zudem bewies er den Nutzen von Hunden und Skiern auch in der Antarktis. Die Expedition war bereits ganz nach der neuen „norwegischen Schule der Polarforschung“ ausgerüstet.', 'Diese „neue Schule“ war zehn Jahre zuvor von Fridtjof Nansen begründet worden, als er im Sommer 1888 Grönland von Osten nach Westen durchquerte und dabei nicht nur die norwegische Polarforschung begründete und zur Identifikationsfigur vieler Norweger wurde, sondern auch neue Wege in der Technik eröffnete. Anstelle der herkömmlichen schweren Schlitten setzte er leichtere Modelle ein, die auf Skiern liefen. Ebenso erkannte er die Notwendigkeit, eigene Kleider, Zelte und Kochausrüstungen zu entwickeln und stellte erstmals die Nahrung nach wissenschaftlichen Gesichtspunkten zusammen. Bedeutung hatten auch Hunde, geringes Gewicht der Ausrüstung und Beweglichkeit der Mannschaft im Gelände. Kernstück der Polarforschung aber war nun der Einsatz von Skiern, wofür Norweger beste Voraussetzungen mitbrachten, da das Skifahren als Fortbewegungsmittel seit Jahrtausenden Bestandteil der Kultur der skandinavischen Völker war – das Wort Ski stammt aus dem Altnorwegischen. Auf den jungen Roald Amundsen machte diese Expedition so großen Eindruck, dass er 1903 mit der \\"Gjøa\\" auf eine eigene Expedition aufbrach, die ihn als ersten Menschen durch die gesamte Nordwestpassage führte. Diese Fahrt hatte insofern Einfluss auf die Fram-Expedition, als Amundsen hier die Grundlagen der Polarforschung, die er als Zweiter Steuermann auf der \\"Belgica\\" gelernt hatte, vertiefen und durch Eskimo-Wissen ergänzen konnte. Während der Gjøa-Expedition machte Amundsen erste Erfahrungen im Umgang mit Hunden und Hundeschlitten und studierte die Techniken der Eskimos, etwa Iglubau oder Herstellung von Kleidung.', 'Fram-Expedition.', 'Zurück in Norwegen begann Amundsen mit der Planung einer Expedition ins Nordpolarbecken, bei der er sich vier oder fünf Jahre lang im Eis eingeschlossen treiben lassen und dabei den noch unentdeckten Nordpol erreichen wollte. Letzteres war, so vermutet Huntford, sein Hauptziel, während die wissenschaftliche Erforschung des Nordpolarbeckens vorgeschoben wurde, um mehr Spendengelder zu erhalten. Zu diesem Zweck erbat er sich von Fridtjof Nansen die \\"Fram\\". Dieses Schiff war zwar Staatseigentum, da Nansen aber die erste Instanz der Polarforschung in Norwegen war und selbst noch Hoffnungen auf eine letzte Expedition hegte, hielt Amundsen es für nötig, sein Vorbild um die Freigabe zu bitten, die Nansen ihm auch gewährte. Am 10. November 1908 gab er seinen Plan öffentlich bekannt, tags darauf erhielt er vom Königspaar bereits 20.000 Kronen. Nachdem das norwegische Parlament Amundsen eine teilweise Rückzahlung seiner Schulden von der Gjøa-Expedition bewilligt hatte, brach er in die Vereinigten Staaten auf, um durch eine Vortragsreise weitere Geldquellen zu erschließen. Anfang 1909 hatte Amundsen ein Viertel der notwendigen Gelder einwerben können, aber nun versiegten die Spenden. Am 6. Februar 1909 gewährte ihm das Storthing jedoch 75.000 Kronen und gestattete ihm, die \\"Fram\\" für seine Zwecke zu nutzen.', 'In der ersten Septemberwoche des Jahres 1909 erreichte Amundsen die Nachricht, dass sowohl Cook als auch Peary behaupteten, den Nordpol erreicht zu haben. Diese Behauptungen sind zwar heute umstritten, und nach der ersten Nachricht über Cooks Erfolg, die er am 1. September erhielt, sagte Amundsen noch, diese Nachricht werde seine Pläne in „gar keiner Weise“ beeinflussen. Doch die am 7. September erhaltene Mitteilung über Peary rüttelte ihn auf und veranlasste ihn zum Handeln. Er beschloss, seinen „ursprünglichen Plan um ein oder zwei Jahre zu verschieben, um in der Zwischenzeit zu versuchen, die noch immer fehlenden Gelder [für die anschließende Erforschung des Nordpolarbeckens] zu sammeln.“ Wann Amundsen diesen Entschluss fasste, ist nicht bekannt. Ein Brief, mit dem er Schlittenhunde aus Grönland nach Dänemark bestellte, beweist aber, dass er spätestens am 9. September feststand. Von der prestigeträchtigen Ersterreichung des Südpols versprach sich Amundsen verbesserte Möglichkeiten der Akquisition von Geldern für die „eigentliche“ Expedition zum Nordpol und eine Möglichkeit, einem Reputationsverlust vorzubeugen. „Wenn ich meinen Ruf als Forscher nicht verlieren wollte, musste ich auf die eine oder andere Weise einen spektakulären Sieg erringen.“ Er habe sich daher für ein neues Unternehmen entschieden.', 'Am 13. September erfuhr Amundsen, dass Robert Falcon Scott plante, im kommenden August zu einer eigenen Antarktisexpedition aufzubrechen. Am Tag darauf teilte Amundsen mit, dass der Start seiner Expedition auf den 1. Juli 1910 verschoben werde. Der vorgeschobene Grund war die angeblich verzögerte Lieferung des Dieselmotors; tatsächlich wurde wegen des geänderten Expeditionsziels Zeit für Sonderarbeiten benötigt.', 'Amundsens Planänderung wurde noch immer geheim gehalten, denn er wollte den Vorteil des Wissens um Konkurrenz nicht mit Scott teilen. Zum einen war ihm Scott persönlich unsympathisch, zum anderen spielten nationale Interessen eine Rolle, da der Prestigeerfolg gegenüber dem britischen Empire spektakulär gewesen wäre. Amundsen hielt seine Pläne auch deshalb geheim, weil er fürchtete, die norwegische Regierung könnte seine Expedition untersagen. Ein Konkurrenzkampf um prestigeträchtige Ziele mit Großbritannien war politisch nicht opportun. Außerdem fürchtete Amundsen, Nansen könnte ihm den Gebrauch der \\"Fram\\" untersagen. Nansens Frau war inzwischen gestorben und er war nicht mehr norwegischer Konsul in London, somit hätte er seine zurückgestellten Expeditionspläne wieder aufnehmen können. Amundsen nahm auch an, dass das Storthing und private Geldgeber die Expedition verhindern könnten. Ein weiterer, eher taktischer Beweggrund war, dass Scott bei Bekanntwerden eines ausländischen Rivalen wahrscheinlich zusätzliche Geldmittel erhalten hätte. Zweifel an der Fairness seines Vorgehens hatte er nicht. Amundsen schätzte die Terra-Nova-Expedition als von seiner eigenen Expedition völlig verschieden ein, denn ihm selbst gehe es vorrangig um wissenschaftliche Ziele und das Erreichen des Südpols sei nur nebensächlich. Eine öffentliche Bekanntgabe von Amundsens Plänen hätte seiner Darstellung zufolge deshalb kaum Einfluss auf Scotts Planung haben können. Andere Expeditionen, die sich zu dieser Zeit in der Antarktis befanden, hatten ohnehin nicht das Ziel, den Südpol zu erreichen (siehe Liste von Antarktisexpeditionen). Amundsen informierte nur zwei Personen von seinem Entschluss: seinen Bruder, der nach Amundsens Abfahrt von Madeira an die Öffentlichkeit gehen sollte, und Thorvald Nilsen, der als Schiffsmeister und Kapitän der \\"Fram\\" das wahre Ziel der Expedition für seine Vorbereitungen kennen musste.', 'Personal.', 'Bei der Auswahl der Mannschaftsmitglieder achtete Amundsen auf verschiedene persönliche Aspekte, darunter Einbettung ins soziale Umfeld, Erfolg im Arbeitsbereich, der mit der Polarfahrt zu tun haben musste, Neugier und Tatkraft. Gefühle schaltete er, so Huntford, bei der Auswahl gänzlich aus. Neben fachlichen Qualitäten wie möglichst großer Erfahrung in der Polarforschung, der Beherrschung des Skifahrens und der Führung von Hundeschlitten verlangte er, dass seine Männer an Einsamkeit und harte Arbeit im Freien gewöhnt waren.', 'Amundsen erhielt viele Bewerbungen.

Specifically, LFER determines how energy and entropy changes during a chemical reaction. The basic principle of LFER is that the chemical behavior of a compound is determined by its electronic structure, which can be measured by substituent or functional group effects. LFER provides a useful tool for predicting the reactivity of a compound based on its structure. By comparing the structure and reactivity of different molecules, scientists can identify patterns and develop general principles for predicting chemical behavior. Linear free energy relationships have found applications in a variety of fields, including organic synthesis, biochemistry, and environmental science."},{"instruction":"explain LFER with an example of environmental science","output":"An example of LFER in environmental science is the use of the Hammett equation to predict the toxicity of organic compounds to aquatic life. The Hammett equation is a type of LFER that relates the rate of a chemical reaction to the electronic properties of a substituted benzene ring. Researchers have found that the toxicity of substituted benzene compounds to aquatic life correlates with the Hammett sigma constant, which measures the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating properties of substituent groups. This correlation suggests that the toxicity of organic compounds can be predicted based on their electronic structure. For example, a study showed that the toxicity of chlorinated benzenes to algae can be predicted using the Hammett equation. The researchers measured the rate of algal growth in the presence of different chlorinated benzenes with varying electron-withdrawing properties. They found that the toxicity of the compounds correlated strongly with their Hammett sigma constants, indicating that electronic structure plays a key role in determining the toxicity of these compounds to aquatic life. This example demonstrates how LFER can be used to predict the environmental impact of organic compounds based on their electronic structure, providing insight into their potential toxicity and helping to guide environmental policy."},{"instruction":"write an outline about deep learning for prediction of time series data of wind speed.","output":"I.

He is a former cricketer and politician who became the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan in August 2018. 1. Early years and cricket career: Imran Khan comes from a well-off Pashtun family in Lahore. He was educated at Aitchison College in Lahore and the Royal Grammar School in Worcester, England, before attending Keble College, Oxford, where he studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. Despite being an excellent student, Khan excelled in cricket and made his debut for Pakistan's national cricket team in 1971. In his 21-year cricket career, Khan was a celebrated all-rounder and captained the team. Under his leadership, Pakistan won its first-ever Cricket World Cup in 1992. He retired from cricket in the same year. 2. Humanitarian and philanthropic works: After his retirement from cricket, Imran Khan turned his attention to humanitarian work, particularly in health and education. In 1991, he founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre in Lahore, which was named after his mother who succumbed to cancer. Additionally, in 2008, he established Namal University, a technical college in Mianwali, Pakistan. 3. Entry into politics: Imran Khan ventured into politics in 1996 by founding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which aimed to promote a more democratic and corruption-free Pakistan. However, the party failed to make an impact in the 1997 and 2002 general elections. In the 2013 elections, PTI emerged as the third-largest party and formed the provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 4. Ascent to prime minister: In the 2018 general elections, Imran Khan's PTI emerged as the largest party, winning 116 out of 272 seats in the National Assembly. Khan became the Prime Minister of Pakistan on August 17, 2018, after garnering 176 votes in the National Assembly as opposed to his opponent Shehbaz Sharif's 96 votes. Notwithstanding his cricket stardom and philanthropy, Imran Khan’s political career has been marked with rhetoric against corruption and his stance as a conservative nationalist. As the prime minister, he has vowed to crack down on corruption, improve governance, and uplift the economy. Despite his aspirations to change Pakistan, his administration has faced several domestic and external challenges, particularly with the country's fragile economic state. In conclusion, Imran Khan’s career has evolved from an acclaimed cricketer to a dedicated philanthropist, and eventually to the Prime Minister of Pakistan. His political journey, filled with ups and downs, culminated with his rise to power at the helm of the PTI, promising a ‘Naya Pakistan’ (New Pakistan)."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Filmschauspieler', 'Franzose', 'Geboren 1946', 'Gestorben 1993', 'Kinderdarsteller', 'Mann', 'Mitglied der WWE Hall of Fame', 'Pseudonym', 'WWE Champion'], 'André René Roussimoff (* 19. Mai 1946 in Coulommiers, Frankreich; † 27. Januar 1993 in Paris), besser bekannt als André the Giant, war ein französischer Profi-Wrestler und Schauspieler. Roussimoff litt an den Wachstumskrankheiten Riesenwuchs und Akromegalie, die ihn sehr groß werden ließen und eine sehr massige Konstitution bedingten. Seine Größe wird oft mit 2,13 oder 2,24 Metern und sein Gewicht mit 240 Kilogramm angegeben, doch die Angaben variieren von Quelle zu Quelle. Zudem unterlag seine Größe, bedingt durch die Erkrankung, auch gewissen Schwankungen.', 'Aufgrund dieses hünenhaften Erscheinungsbildes wurde er auch „Das achte Weltwunder“ genannt und war in den 1970er und beginnenden 1980er Jahren der erfolgreichste Star des Wrestlinggeschäfts. Einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit wurde er auch als Schauspieler bekannt. So spielte er einen Riesen in Rob Reiners Film \\"Die Braut des Prinzen\\" von 1987. Seine Grunderkrankung führte zu Roussimoffs frühem Tod. Er wurde 1993 postum als das erste Mitglied in die WWE Hall of Fame berufen.', 'Leben.', 'Kindheit und Jugend.', 'André Roussimoff wurde als Sohn des bulgarischen Einwanderers Boris Roussimoff Stoeff und dessen Frau, der Polin Marianne, geb. Marasjeck, in Coulommiers, Frankreich, als mittleres von insgesamt fünf Kindern geboren. Er wuchs in dem kleinen Ort Molien in der Gemeinde Ussy-sur-Marne auf, in dem seine Eltern einen kleinen Bauernhof betrieben, der die Familie ernährte.', 'Bei seiner Geburt wog er sechs Kilo. Als Kleinkind entwickelte er sich normal, jedoch begann er recht spät zu sprechen. Erst als Kind begann er, Zeichen einer Akromegalie zu entwickeln. Insbesondere wuchsen Kiefer und Stirn überproportional. Auch wurde er größer als andere Kinder in seiner Umgebung. Obwohl offensichtlich war, dass sein Wachstum nicht normal war, suchten seine Eltern in der ländlichen Gegend, in der sie lebten, nie einen Arzt auf.', 'Roussimoff besuchte eine Schule in Ussy-sur-Marne. Er ging gerne zur Schule und hatte mathematisches Talent. Roussimoffs Vater sah allerdings wenig Sinn in einer Schulbildung, da sein Sohn als Nachfolger in der Landwirtschaft vorgesehen war. So nahm er ihn mit 14 Jahren aus der Schule. Bereits zu diesem Zeitpunkt über 1,90 Meter groß, war er für seinen Vater eine große Hilfe beim Bestellen der Felder. Seine Geschwister sagten später über ihn, er habe für drei Männer arbeiten können.', 'Mit 14 Jahren verließ er zunächst den elterlichen Hof, um eine Tischlerlehre zu machen. Diese schloss er jedoch nicht ab, kehrte auf den elterlichen Hof zurück und arbeitete danach in einer Fabrik, die Motoren für Heuverarbeitungsmaschinen herstellte.', 'Anfänge (1964–1973).', 'Roussimoff war ein begeisterter Sportler, der vor allem Fußball spielte. Er probierte auch Rugby und Basketball aus, fand aber daran keinen Gefallen. 1965 traf Roussimoff auf Robert Lageat, einen Wrestlingpromoter und ehemaligen Boxer, der auch als Berufsringer auftrat. Er sah Potenzial in dem jungen Riesen und bot an, ihn in Paris zu trainieren. Sein Leben und Training dort finanzierte er unter anderem als Möbelpacker und Türsteher. Trainiert wurde er von Michael Saulnier, einem ehemaligen Ringer, der zum Wrestling kam, nachdem er bei den Olympischen Sommerspielen 1956 nicht nominiert worden war. Er trat damit in einer Zeit in das Wrestlingbusiness ein, in dem die Schaukämpfe unter einem sehr strengen Kayfabe standen, das heißt vom Publikum als echte Kämpfe wahrgenommen werden sollten. Durch seine Größe konnte er einen glaubhaften Kampfstil adaptieren. Nach etwa einem Jahr Training bestritt er seine ersten Kämpfe. Zu dieser Zeit war er 2,09 Meter groß und wog etwa 135 kg. Sein erster Kampf fand am 25. Januar 1966 in Rouen statt. Er trat als \\"Géant Ferré\\" () an. Der Name lehnte sich an den picardischen Volkshelden Grand Ferré an, der während des Hundertjährigen Kriegs gekämpft haben soll. Schon nach kurzer Zeit wurde der Name in \\"Jean Ferré\\" abgeändert. Sein Image war das eines Holzfällers. Diesen Beruf übte der historische Ferré ebenfalls aus. Einen Monat später wurde ein Match von ihm im Fernsehen ausgestrahlt, gefolgt von einem Interview. Schon bei seinen Anfängen adaptierte er einige Stilmittel, die ihn sein Wrestlingleben begleiten sollten. So stieg er mit beiden Beinen über das oberste Seil. Am Anfang nutzte er aber einen sehr viel technischeren Stil als in späteren Jahren. Seine Größe und sein sympathisches Auftreten machten ihn in der Wrestling-Szene Frankreichs recht schnell bekannt, wobei er von 1966 bis 1968 nur sporadisch auftrat.', '1966 lernte er den Promoter und Wrestler Frank Valois kennen, der später sein Manager und Ratgeber werden sollte. Etwa um diese Zeit begegnete er auch Lord Alfred Hayes, der zu einem seiner besten Freunde wurde. Mit \\"Die 7 Masken des Judoka\\" debütierte er 1967 als Schauspieler. In dem Agentenfilm nach einem Roman von Ernie Clerk kämpfte er gegen den Hauptdarsteller. Sein größtes Match hatte er am 20. Januar 1968 gegen den Belgier Franz van Buyten, das auch im Fernsehen ausgestrahlt wurde. Bei diesem Match durfte er mit dem French Heavyweight Championship der Fédération Française de Catch Professionnel seinen ersten Titel gewinnen.', '1969 ging Roussimoff nach England, wo er sich schnell einen Namen in der zu dieser Zeit größten Wrestling-Szene Europas machte. Unter anderem trat er in der Londoner Royal Albert Hall an. Matches von ihm wurden bei ITV übertragen. In England musste er auch erstmals verlieren. Am 7. Juni 1969 verlor er gegen Kendo Nagasaki (eigentlich Peter Thornley) in der Victoria Hall von Henley-on-Thames. Nagasaki war damals Englands größter Star.', 'Roussimoff tourte anschließend durch verschiedene Länder, darunter Deutschland, das Vereinigte Königreich, Australien, Neuseeland, Tunesien, Marokko, Algerien und Südafrika. Er trat unter verschiedenen Ringernamen an, unter anderem als \\"Monster Eiffel Tower\\" in Neuseeland und als \\"Monster Roussimoff\\" in Japan. Bei der japanischen Promotion International Wrestling Enterprise wurde er zusammen mit Michael Nador Tag-Team-Champion in einem Match vor 5.000 Fans in Fukuoka.', 'Durch den seit 1966 bestehenden Kontakt mit den Wrestlern Frank Valois und Edouard Carpentier kam Roussimoff schließlich ins kanadische Montreal, wo letzterer ihn als Mentor unterstützte. Er trat für die französischsprachige Promotion Grand Prix Wrestling an und erhielt dort seinen langjährigen Spitznamen \\"The 8th Wonder of the World\\" (). Als Herkunftsort für Roussimoff wurde Grenoble ausgewählt, da die Stadt durch die zuvor stattgefundenen Olympischen Winterspiele bekannt war. Er trat dort meist als Tag-Team-Wrestler und in Handicap-Matches gegen zwei Gegner an. Als Einzelwrestler wurde er als \\"Face\\" (Publikumsliebling) eingesetzt und trat gegen \\"Heels\\" wie Killer Kowalski und Butch Vachon an. Dabei pendelte er auch häufig nach Japan. Als Giant Roussimoff wurde ihm die Ehre zuteil, das IWE Third World Series Tournament gewinnen zu dürfen. Dabei gewann er unter anderem gegen Karl Gotch und Billy Robinson. Sein Ruhm wuchs schnell über alle Landesgrenzen hinweg. So wurde er im \\"Wrestling Yearbook of 1971\\" der beiden Wrestling-Magazine \\"Inside Wrestling\\" und \\"The Wrestler\\" zum Rookie des Jahres gewählt.', '1971 konnte Roussimoff durch Fürsprache von Adnan Al-Kaissie zwei Matches mit diesem im Irak bestreiten, bei welchem der spätere Präsident Saddam Hussein zugegen war. Dies war nicht ganz unproblematisch, befand sich der Irak gerade in einer heißen Phase der Revolution. So bedrohte Hussein im Falle eines Sieges Roussimoff mit dem Tod. Letztlich wurden die Matches so arrangiert, dass Al-Kaissie Match und Re-Match gewinnen durfte. Roussimoff lernte am Rande des zweiten Matches auch Hussein persönlich kennen. Beide Matches, das erste im al-Shaab-Stadion und das zweite in Kut, waren ausverkauft und verliefen ohne Zwischenfälle. Lediglich die Salutschüsse irakischer Kommandos nach dem Sieg erschreckten Roussimoff, der sich unter dem Ring versteckte.', '1972 durfte er eine Fehde mit Don Leo Jonathan, dem Mormon Giant, bestreiten. Gegen den mit 1,98 Meter recht großen Wrestler ergab sich eine Traumpaarung, die am 31. Mai 1972 in einem Main-Event im Montreal-Forum vor mehr als 20.000 Zuschauern gipfelte. Die als \\"Battle of the Giants\\" („Kampf der Giganten“) und \\"Match of the Century\\" („Kampf des Jahrhunderts“) angepriesene Veranstaltung war Roussimoffs erster Hauptkampf. Der Kampf endete mit einem Disqualifikationssieg von Don Leo Jonathan. Zum Ende verlor Roussimoff seine Beherrschung und versuchte Jonathan zu erwürgen. Zahlreiche Wrestler kamen Jonathan zu Hilfe, die jedoch alle von Roussimoff niedergestreckt wurden. Die Inszenierung definierte das Image von Roussimoff als netten und zuvorkommenden Riesen, der jedoch auch austeilen konnte, wenn man ihn reizte. Dem gegenüber stand Roussimoffs Image in Japan, wo er wie viele \\"Gaijin\\" (Ausländer) als gefürchteter \\"Heel\\" („Bösewicht“) eingesetzt wurde.', 'WWF (1973–1983).', 'Um seine weitere Karriere in die richtigen Wege zu leiten, vermittelte Frank Valois ihm ein Treffen mit Vince McMahon Sr., dem damaligen Präsidenten der World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, heute WWE). In Kanada war Roussimoff nun über mehrere Jahre als Sensation eingesetzt worden und es zeigten sich erste Abnutzungserscheinungen. Im Gegensatz dazu war er in den Vereinigten Staaten ein unverbrauchtes Talent. Am 26. März 1973 hatte er sein erstes Match als \\"André the Giant\\", ein Name, der für das US-amerikanische Publikum passender erschien als das Wortspiel mit einem französischen Volkshelden. Sein erster Auftritt fand im Madison Square Garden vor 16.000 Fans gegen Buddy Wolfe statt. Diese von der WWWF gern gebuchte Halle war damals das Kernstück der in New York City angesiedelten Organisation.', 'Kurz danach nahm ihn Vince McMahon Sr. unter Vertrag und agierte als sein Agent. Frank Valois wurde als Roadmanager verpflichtet. Vince McMahon Sr. buchte ihn nicht nur für die WWWF, sondern verlieh ihn für Gastauftritte an andere Organisationen, wie die National Wrestling Alliance und die American Wrestling Association. Außerdem durfte Roussimoff weiter in Japan antreten, da die McMahons mit Antonio Inokis New Japan Pro Wrestling kooperierten. Dort trat er nun auch als André the Giant auf. Vince McMahon Sr. verdiente an jedem dieser Auftritte mit. Dadurch wurde garantiert, dass sich die Auftritte von André the Giant nicht abnutzten, da er in mehreren Territorien eingesetzt werden konnte. Dabei achtete Vince McMahon Sr. besonders darauf, dass sein Schützling bei diesen Gastauftritten niemals verlieren durfte, es sei denn durch Disqualifikation, Auszählen oder als Teil eines Tag-Teams. Außerdem arbeitete er weiter für Grand Prix Wrestling, die als Vermittlungs-Promotion jedoch keine zusätzlichen Kost: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Filmschauspieler, Franzose, Riesenwuchs, Akromegalie, Wrestling, WWE Hall of Fame, Kindheit, Karriere, Japan, Vince McMahon Sr."},{"instruction":"Schreibe mir folgenden Text ausführlicher und bringe ihn mit Moos in verbindung: Das Erste Portal wird von einem Architekturgewebe eingefasst und bildet so die Trennung von öffentlich und privat.

Um diesen Eindruck zu verstärken, entscheiden sich viele Architekten für besondere Gestaltungselemente, die das Portal umrahmen und es von anderen Gebäuden differenzieren. Ein beliebtes Designelement ist das Architekturgewebe, das aus einem feinen Maschenwerk aus Metall- oder Kunststofffäden besteht und oft als gezielte Sichtschutzlösung eingesetzt wird. Das Architekturgewebe hat auch einen anderen praktischen Vorteil: Es fügt sich nahtlos in die Umgebung ein und ermöglicht eine transparente Erschließung des Gebäudes, ohne jedoch die Privatsphäre einzelner Bewohner zu gefährden. Eine besondere Nutzung erfährt das Architekturgewebe, wenn es als Sichtschutz Vorhang bei Theaterbühnen in Kombination mit Lichtern verwendet wird um Animationen auf den Bühnenhintergrund zu projizieren. In Bezug auf Moos könnte man argumentieren, dass dieses Material ebenfalls zur Gestaltung von Gebäuden und Eingangsportalen verwenden werden kann. Besonders in grüne Städten, wie zum Beispiel Berlin, wird das Moos auch als lebendes grünes Dach genutzt, um Gebäude und Fassaden zu begrünen und somit das städtische Klima zu verbessern. So könnte man sich auch vorstellen, dass man das Architekturgewebe als Gerüst für das Moos nutzt, um eine einzigartige und nachhaltige Gestaltungslösung zu schaffen. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass das Architekturgewebe ein vielseitiges und nützliches Gestaltungselement ist, das nicht nur für die Eingangsportale von Gebäuden sondern auch für andere Zwecke genutzt wird. Obwohl es auf den ersten Blick nicht offensichtlich ist, besteht auch eine interessante Verbindung zwischen dem Architekturgewebe und Moos, die in der Zukunft noch weitere interessante Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten ermöglichen könnte."},{"instruction":"can youspeak chines","output":"Yes, I can understand and speak Chinese.

Es erreichte nur eine Rennteilnahme, die ohne Zielankunft endete. Der Rennstall baute auf dem früheren Formel-1-Team Coloni auf.', 'Andrea Modas Geschichte ist gekennzeichnet von organisatorischen und finanziellen Mängeln, fehlenden sportlichen Erfolgen und Skandalen, die in der Verhaftung des Teamchefs gipfelten und dazu führten, dass das Team als einziger Rennstall der Formel-1-Geschichte zweimal innerhalb eines Jahres von der Weltmeisterschaft ausgeschlossen wurde.', 'Überblick über die Teamgeschichte.', 'Der „König der Nichtqualifizierten“ wird übernommen.', 'Andrea Moda Formula wurzelte in dem italienischen Rennstall Coloni, der von 1987 bis 1991 an 14 Formel-1-Rennen teilgenommen hatte. Das finanziell und technisch sehr schwach aufgestellte Coloni-Team war 1991 für die Presse das „Gespött der Formel 1“ gewesen und galt, nachdem es zweieinhalb Jahre in Folge zu keinem Weltmeisterschaftslauf die Startberechtigung erhalten hatte, als „König der Nichtqualifizierten“. Ab Sommer 1991 stand Coloni vor der Zahlungsunfähigkeit. Nach dem erfolglosen Versuch, mit dem ebenfalls leistungsschwachen, indirekt mit Lamborghini in Verbindung stehenden Modena Team („Lambo Formula“) zu fusionieren, verkaufte der Teamgründer Enzo Coloni seinen hoch verschuldeten Rennstall im September 1991 für angeblich 8 Mio. US- an den 31 Jahre alten italienischen Unternehmer Andrea Sassetti, der primär in der Modebranche tätig war. Zu den letzten beiden Rennen des Jahres 1991 trat das Team noch unter der alten Bezeichnung Coloni Racing an; ab 1992 meldete Sassetti den Rennstall dann als Andrea Moda Formula.', 'Über Andrea Sassettis Motivation, an der Formel 1 teilzunehmen, gab und gibt es zahlreiche Mutmaßungen. Die meisten Quellen sprechen Sassetti ein ernsthaftes Interesse am Motorsport ab. Einige sehen in Andrea Moda Formula den – gescheiterten – Versuch, in Anlehnung an die Entwicklung Benettons die Öffentlichkeitswirksamkeit des Motorsports zu Werbezwecken für sein Modeunternehmen zu nutzen, andere halten es nicht für ausgeschlossen, dass das Formel-1-Engagement dem Zweck der Geldwäsche diente.', 'Andrea Moda = Coloni?', 'Die sportrechtliche Stellung des Andrea-Moda-Teams war zu Beginn der Saison 1992 umstritten und sorgte für den ersten von zwei Ausschlüssen des Rennstalls von der Weltmeisterschaft.', 'Anknüpfungspunkt dieses Streits war die Frage, ob Andrea Moda Formula mit dem bisherigen Team Coloni Racing identisch war oder ob es bei sportrechtlicher Betrachtung ein neuer Rennstall war. Für neue Teams enthielt das Reglement der Sportaufsichtsbehörde FISA eine Reihe von Einschränkungen und Auflagen. Dazu gehörte die Verpflichtung, vor dem ersten Rennen eine Sicherheitsgebühr („deposit“) in Höhe von 100.000 US- zu hinterlegen; zudem durfte ein neues Team kein Chassis melden, das zuvor bereits von einem anderen Rennstall verwendet worden war.', 'Teamchef Andrea Sassetti behauptete, sein Rennstall sei in jeder Hinsicht als Nachfolger von Coloni Racing anzusehen, so dass er dessen Auto(s) nutzen durfte und keine Sicherheitsleistung erbringen musste. Die FISA hingegen war der Ansicht, dass Andrea Moda Formula ein neues Team war. Sie stützte ihre Auffassung darauf, dass Andrea Sassetti im Herbst 1991 lediglich Rennwagen und technisches Zubehör von Coloni Racing gekauft hatte, nicht aber dessen Startberechtigung für die Formel-1-Weltmeisterschaft („entry“).', 'Andrea Moda Formula erfüllte zu Saisonbeginn nicht die Anforderungen, die an ein neues Team gestellt wurden: Einerseits hatte Sassetti keine Sicherheit geleistet, andererseits hatte er beim ersten Saisonrennen für sein Team den Coloni C4B gemeldet, ein Auto, das unter der Bezeichnung C4 in technisch ähnlicher Ausstattung bereits im Vorjahr von Coloni eingesetzt worden war. Dass der C4 1991 mangels Erfolgen in der Vorqualifikation tatsächlich kein einziges Rennen bestritten hatte, änderte aus Sicht der FISA nichts an der Regelwidrigkeit seiner (neuerlichen) Meldung.', 'Zwei Ausschlüsse.', 'Da der Streit über die Stellung des Teams im Vorfeld des Großen Preises von Südafrika 1992 nicht beigelegt werden konnte, schloss die FISA Andrea Moda Formula vor Beginn der Vorqualifikation in Kyalami am 28. Februar 1992 von der Teilnahme an der Weltmeisterschaft aus. Der Teamchef erklärte daraufhin zunächst, er wolle den Rennstall unverzüglich schließen. In den folgenden Wochen kam es allerdings zu einer Einigung zwischen Sassetti und der Sportaufsicht. Nach Entrichtung der Sicherheitsgebühr wurde Andrea Moda Formula zu den weiteren Läufen der Weltmeisterschaft zugelassen. Bedingung war, dass das Team künftig mit einem neuen, zuvor noch nicht gemeldeten Rennwagen an den Start ging. Das führte zum Aufbau des Andrea Moda S921, der den alten Coloni C4B im Frühjahr 1992 ablöste. Das Ausbleiben des Teams beim Großen Preis von Südafrika und dem folgenden Rennen in Mexiko wurde als höhere Gewalt qualifiziert und blieb deshalb für das Team folgenlos.', 'In den folgenden Monaten meldete sich Andrea Moda zu neun Großen Preisen, qualifizierte sich aber nur zu einem Rennen. Von März bis September 1992 kam es neben sportlichen Misserfolgen zu Aufsehen erregenden Zwischenfällen, zu denen der Verlust von Motoren, Schlägereien unter den Teammitgliedern und die Verhaftung des Teamchefs gehörten. Daraufhin schloss die FISA Andrea Moda Formula im September 1992 zum zweiten Mal von der Weltmeisterschaft aus. Die Entscheidung beruhte auf Art. 166 des Reglements. Danach konnte ein Team von der Weltmeisterschaft ausgeschlossen werden, „wenn es dem Standard der Formel 1 nicht genügt oder diese in Misskredit bringt“.

Einige Quellen sahen ihn als Angehörigen einer wohlhabenden Familie von Schuhherstellern, nach anderen Angaben war er durch einen hohen Gewinn bei einem Pokerspiel zu Reichtum gekommen. Wieder andere vermuten, dass Sassetti illegale Geschäfte betrieb und Kontakte zum organisierten Verbrechen hatte. Es gibt Berichte, wonach Sassetti und Teammitarbeiter im Laufe des Jahres 1992 mehrfach in bewaffnete Auseinandersetzungen verwickelt waren. Im Internet kursiert die Abschrift eines Interviews, das Sassetti im Frühjahr 2012 telefonisch gegeben haben soll und das biografische Details sowie Einzelheiten zur Entwicklung von Andrea Moda Formula enthält.

Die Berichterstattung über das Team griff diesen Umstand frühzeitig auf und betonte dies durch wiederholte und zum Teil sehr plakative Beschreibungen von Sassettis anderweitigen Tätigkeiten. Bezeichnungen wie „Schuhmagnat“, „Boss eines Schuhindustriekonzerns“ oder „italienischer König des Prêt-à-porter“ fanden und finden sich noch immer regelmäßig in Darstellungen des Rennstalls. Mit fortlaufender Dauer der Saison und Distanz erhielten die Charakterisierungen auch abwertende Züge. So wurde er als „Dilettant“ oder „zwielichtige Gestalt“ („shady person“) beschrieben.

Der Wechsel zu Andrea Moda Formula fand im Mai 1992 statt; er wurde von Bernie Ecclestone angeregt, der dem italienischen Team einen erfahrenen Organisator an die Hand geben wollte.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro sti ll is not free; one hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination; one hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity; one hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was the promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in so far as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.” But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy; now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice; now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood; now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content, will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the worn threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy, which has engulfed the Negro community, must not lead us to a distrust of all white people. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of Civil Rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality; we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one; we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating “For Whites Only”; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote, and the Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No! No, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. “I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi. Go back to Alabama. Go back to South Carolina. Go back to Georgia. Go back to Louisiana. Go back to the slums and ghettos of our Northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.” I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I HAVE A DREAM TODAY! I have a dream that one day down in Alabama — with its vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification — one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I HAVE A DREAM TODAY! I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.” This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brother-hood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father died, land of the pilgrim’s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that. Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and mole hill of Mississippi. “From every mountainside, let freedom ring.” And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.” Source: Martin Luther King, Jr., I Have A Dream: Writings and Speeches that Changed the World, ed.

Make sure that the correct version of Report Builder is installed and referenced in your Delphi project. If you are using an older version than what the project was originally built with, this could cause compatibility issues. 2. Check to see if any required DLL files are missing or not registered on your system. You can use a tool like Dependency Walker to identify any missing dependencies and take the appropriate action to resolve them. 3. Try recompiling your project or rebuilding the Report Builder components to ensure that all the necessary files are included and up-to-date. 4.

Check to see if the package you're trying to install is compatible with your version of Delphi. Ensure that the package supports Delphi 10.3 and that the package file is not corrupted. 2. Verify that all dependent packages are already installed. Delphi requires all dependent packages to already be installed in order to successfully install a new package. Check the \\"Requires\\" section in the package description for details on dependencies. 3. Try running Delphi as an administrator. If Delphi does not have sufficient permissions to access or modify the registry and system files, the package installation may fail. 4. It's possible that the Delphi installation itself has become corrupted. Try repairing or reinstalling the Delphi installation, and then attempt to install the package again. 5. It's also possible that there may be conflicts with other installed packages. Try uninstalling or disabling any other installed packages within Delphi that could conflict with the package you're trying to install.

近代中国是一个充满动荡和变革的时期，这个时期涵盖了19世纪末到20世纪初的一段时间。 在这段时期内，中国遭受了大量来自外部的压迫和侵略。其中，资本主义和帝国主义的入侵对中国的影响最为明显和深远。本文将探讨资本主义-帝国主义的入侵对中国的影响，包括经济、政治、文化和社会方面的影响。 经济影响 资本主义-帝国主义的入侵对中国经济造成了破坏性的影响。 19世纪末和20世纪初，列强开始向中国输出廉价工业品并进口昂贵的中国商品。这使得中国的商品价格下降，尤其是纺织品和银器等手工业产品。同时，从中国引进的进口货物价格上升。 由于这种“不平等贸易”，中国的贸易逆差急剧增加，资源流失严重。 在中国的沿海城市，外国势力极其强大。 这些列强通过明里暗里的方式，把中国的大量资源开采出口到自己的国家， 尤其是矿物资源和农产品等资源。列强还在中国建立了自己的工业和商业公司，从而排挤了中国本土的公司。 此外，由于西方强烈要求中国开放市场，中国逐渐成为西方国家在亚洲的运输和通讯中心。 西方国家与中国通商使得中国的经济 成为了西方资本主义国家利润的来源。 这种不平等贸易和经济的剥削使得中国逐渐变成了世界上最贫穷的国家之一。 政治影响 资本主义-帝国主义的入侵和对中国的政治影响也同样显著。 首先，中国的领土和主权遭到了侵犯。19世纪80年代到90年代初，列强通过侵占领土和订立不平等条约使得中国失去了辽宁半岛、台湾和澎湖群岛等领土。此外，列强向中国强迫提供休息站和贸易口岸，使得列强在中国拥有特权和利益，而中国却缺少相应的政治和财政权利。 资本主义-帝国主义的入侵和对中国的政治影响还表现在它在中国上半部分的传统社会结构和政治制度的颠覆上。在清朝衰落的过程中，外来势力利用一些社会现象来危害中国社会秩序，使得中国社会变得不稳定。 此外，西方列强通过向中国宣传西方的文化和信仰，使得中国人民的传统文化和信仰逐渐丧失，并进一步削弱了中国人民的自信和民族意识。 文化影响 资本主义-帝国主义的入侵和对中国的文化影响同样巨大。这种影响主要表现在对中国传统文化和信仰的破坏和对西方文化的渗透。引进的西方文化在中国得到了广泛的传播， 文化进程中逐渐取代了中国传统文化和信仰。 由此，中国的本土文化和民间文化元素就被左右了。 在这场文化战争中，西方势力尤其注重传教、媒体宣传和教育。 他们致力于在中国散布基督教的教义，攻击中国的传统文化和信仰。 为了增强对中国文化的渗透，他们还在中国建立了许多教育机构、印刷工厂和图书馆等文化机构，并购买了许多中国的古董和文物，将这些文物运往国外。这些做法严重挖掘了中国本土文化的根基，对中国的人才和文化的发展形成了威胁。 社会影响 资本主义-帝国主义的入侵对中国社会结构带来深刻的影响。 与传统的农村社会相比，资本主义和帝国主义的入侵加剧了中国城市化和工业化进程。 在这个过程中，外国资本和技术逐渐注入中国，中国的社会制度和结构随之发生了变化。 在此同时，由于政府失去了对外商和外资的控制，许多外国资本家及其同伙十分固执，肆意剥削中国劳动力，给中国的社会造成了深刻的悲剧。 资本主义-帝国主义的入侵对中国的社会结构和文化习俗带来了重大影响。在中国名下，外国资本家建立了大量的工厂和商业公司，并从中国本土劳动力中获得了源源不断的劳动力。 在这个过程中，大量的农民和手工业者逐渐成为了城市劳动者，完成一些简单的制造业和文化行业的工作。 这种人与土地的联系的破裂，以及对传统职业的忽视，导致了贫富悬殊的增加和社会不公的加剧。 结论 资本主义-帝国主义的入侵对中国造成了极为深刻和持久的影响。在经济、政治、文化和社会方面，外部势力的掠夺、侵占和影响留给了中国许多负面影响。 然而，中国人民和政府最终通过自我修复和内生发展找到了一种民主社会的模式， 因此可以说，外部势力对于中国的经历既是一个末日之灾，也是给中国带来决定性转变的契机。 这个时期的中国还定义和塑造了中国的身份认同和全球位置，这在20世纪的事件中具有持久性的保存。"},{"instruction":"写一篇关于资本-帝国帝国主义的入侵对中国的影响的论文，3000字","output":"引言 二十世纪初，在中国这个古老而又复杂的文明国家，资本主义和帝国主义的入侵将中国推向了巨大的动荡和变革。这次入侵和变革的后果，让中国的许多相关方面都受到了深刻和广泛的影响。本文将探讨这种影响的方方面面，从而让我们更好地理解中国和法国的历史和文化发展。 经济影响 资本主义和帝国主义的入侵对中国的经济有着深刻的影响。在19世纪末和20世纪初的时期，西方列强进入了中国市场。 在那个时候，中国的出口公司已经跌入了一个相对萎靡的状态，而外国货物不但便宜且质量高。这种情况推动了中国对外买入货物和商品的比例不断增加。 从那时起，西方列强成为了中国经济发展的主导因素。在西方列强的掌管下，中国经济成为了被剥削、掠夺和荒废的对象。 在中国的沿海城市，外国势力异常强大。 这些列强通过各种方式占领中国大量资源，尤其是矿物和农产品等重要资源。而本土的中国企业也受到了外国企业的排挤。不仅如此，列强还在中国建立了自己的工业和商业公司，从而影响了中国的经济自主和民族产业的发展。 此外，由于西方强烈要求中国开放市场，中国在亚洲已经成为了西方国家的主要中转站之一。这也意味着中国的经济成为了西方资本主义国家的利润来源。由于这种不平等贸易，中国的贸易逆差急剧增加，资源流失严重，最终滋生了社会不平等、贫富差距和社会矛盾。 政治影响 资本主义和帝国主义的入侵对中国的政治和主权同样具有破坏性的影响。

Психофизическая проблема","output":"Природа, генезис и структура сознания - это основные вопросы, рассматриваемые в рамках психологии и философии. Сознание - это совокупность всех наших мыслей, чувств и восприятий, которые существуют в нашем уме в любой конкретный момент времени. Однако существует много разных точек зрения относительно того, каким образом сознание возникает, какова его природа и как он связан с нашим физическим телом. Психофизическая проблема заключается в поиске объяснения для того, как сознание связано с физиологическими процессами в мозге человека. Эта проблема существует уже много лет, и до сих пор не получено окончательного ответа на этот вопрос. Ряд исследований показывает, что физиологические процессы могут оказывать влияние на сознание. Например, нарушения функционирования мозга могут приводить к изменениям в сознании, таким как потеря памяти или изменение характера личности. Однако трудность в том, чтобы понять, как именно физиологические процессы создают сознание, являются главными причинами, почему психофизическая проблема до сих пор остается открытой. Современные исследования психологии и нейронауки предлагают несколько разных теорий, которые предполагаются объяснить, как сознание может быть создано физиологическими процессами. К ним относятся монистические теории, которые предполагают, что сознание и физиология являются одним и тем же; и дуалистические теории, предполагающие, что сознание и физиология представляют собой два отдельных феномена, которые взаимодействуют между собой. В целом, природа, генезис и структура сознания остаются основными вопросами в психологии и философии, требующими дальнейших исследований и разработки более убедительных теорий."},{"instruction":"Мышление и язык.

Язык служит основным инструментом для выражения наших мыслей и идей, а мышление - для работы с этой информацией, ее обработки и анализа. Рассудок и разум - это два понятия, которые могут быть использованы, чтобы описать процессы нашего мышления. Рассудок обычно связан с более конкретными, ограниченными формами мышления, например, логическими выводами и анализом, в то время как разум обычно связан с более широкими, абстрактными формами мышления, например, требующих воображения или интуиции. Проблема рациональности в философии связана с поиском определения и способа измерения рациональности и того, как мы можем применять рациональное мышление к нашей жизни и принятию решений. Это связано с тем, что рациональность может интерпретироваться по-разному в различных контекстах, например, в науке, этике и политике. Типы научной рациональности включают четыре основных подхода, определенных философом Максом Вебером. Они включают технический, эмпирический, аналитический и критический подходы. Технический подход заключается в использовании технологии и инструментов для решения научных проблем. Эмпирический подход связан с использованием опытных данных в научном исследовании. Аналитический подход заключается в использовании анализа и логики для решения научных проблем.

Наука призвана объяснять законы и принципы, лежащие в основе природы, общества и человеческой психологии. Многие социологи и философы рассматривают науку как одну из форм культуры, которая взаимодействует социально, экономически и политически с другими формами культуры. Специфика научного знания заключается в том, что оно должно быть основано на эмпирических данных, полученных с помощью методов научного исследования. Это знание должно быть подтверждено путем повторяемых экспериментов и обладать строгой логикой и систематизацией. Научное исследование - это процесс, включающий разработку гипотез, эксперименты, наблюдения, анализ данных и выводы. Этот процесс помогает установить тесную связь между теоретическими предположениями и эмпирическими данными, которые подтверждают или опровергают гипотезы. Научная картина мира - это философская концепция, которая пытается объяснить, как научные открытия формируют нашу картину мира.
