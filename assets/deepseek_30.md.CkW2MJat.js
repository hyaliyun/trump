When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"It seems that the suggested answer does not directly address the question about the age of a child in relation to pedophile crimes. Let me provide you with a more suitable answer.  The term pedophile refers to an adult who has a sexual preference for prepubescent children, generally ages 13 or younger. A pedophile crime occurs when an adult engages in sexual activities with a child under the legal age of consent as specified by a country's laws. The age of consent varies from country to country, but it typically ranges from 16 to 18 years old. In some cases, the age may be lower if certain conditions are met.

Article: Supporters of Chen Guangcheng have warned that his family and friends in China are still at risk after the blind activist arrived in New York to begin a new life in the United States.      Chen — whose daring escape from house arrest last month prompted a diplomatic crisis — arrived on Saturday night to cheering crowds, and used his first speech to press for greater rule of law in the country he left behind.      \\"I hope everybody works for me to promote justice and fairness in China,\\" Chen said through an interpreter, ahead of his enrolment for a fellowship in the US-Asia Law Institute at New York University School of Law.      He was also careful to thank the Chinese government, knowing the wellbeing of relatives and associates could be influenced by an upcoming shift in the Communist party leadership. Instead, he criticised the provincial authorities in Shandong for years of persecution, including 18 months of house arrest, beatings and harassment of his relatives.      Chen said \\"acts of retribution may not have abated\\" in his village of Dongshigu, which was still under lockdown. \\"We hope to see a thorough investigation into these events,\\" he said.      The figurehead of the rights movement suggested his own role will temporarily diminish. \\"I am requesting leave of absence and I hope they will understand,\\" he said. \\"For the past seven years, I have never had a day's rest so I have come here for a bit of recuperation for body and spirit.\\"      He Peirong – who played a key role in the escape by driving Chen from Shandong to Beijing – said she sympathised, even though the reverberations of Chen's flight remain unclear. \\"I support any decision made by Chen, but it's too early to say whether his departure is a good thing for China's rights movement. Things are not settled. Problems are not solved. His family is still in China. The people who helped him escape are still in China.\\"      He – who was detained for several days after Chen's escape and remains under surveillance – spoke of her admiration for Chen.      \\"He has done more than you could expect from any individual … Although he has experienced so much injustice and so many threats, he sticks to his beliefs. He is like a piece of jade: always smooth and warm.\\"      Others supporters, relatives and lawyers, including Guo Yushan and Liu Weiguo, were not answering their phones. Several have been told not to speak to the foreign media. Zeng Jinyan, who met Chen before he took refuge at the US embassy, said her computer had been hacked and infected with a virus that made it difficult to communicate.      Chen's nephew has been arrested and charged with attempted murder after using a kitchen knife to fight off local officials who intruded into his home.      The activist's brother has described how he was chained to a chair and beaten for three days. His lawyer and friend, Jiang Tianyong, was punched so powerfully by state security officials that he lost his hearing. He said police continued to impose tight restrictions on rights activists and he expected the pressure to intensify ahead of a key party congress this autumn.      \\"There won't be any big changes for us now that Chen Guangcheng has left. There are still many reasons to keep up control and stability preservation,\\" Jiang told Reuters.      A supporter in Shandong told the news agency the authorities were unlikely to ease pressure any time soon. \\"The Communist party doesn't want to set a precedent over this case by easing up after a dissident has escaped detention,\\" said Sun Wenguang, a retired professor, who is monitored 24 hours a day by security officers.      Although supporters in the US say Chen is now free to \\"speak truth to power'\\" it is far from clear that his voice will be any easier to hear in his homeland. In the past, Chinese dissidents who sought exile in the US have found their influence muted by distance and Beijing's \\"Great Firewall\\" – which filters internet content from overseas.      Few are allowed to return. Last week, Wu'er Kaixi – the student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests – was refused permission to return to China to see his ailing parents.      Nonetheless, Chen's escape could make a difference in China because of the timing. The ability of a blind man to evade dozens of guards raises awkward questions for party hardman Zhou Yongkang, who has a bigger budget for internal security than the People's Liberation Army has to protect China's borders. Zhou is due to step down this autumn.      Chen's arrival in New York could also play in US politics and diplomatic strategy. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney had criticised the Obama administration's handling of the case when it was unclear whether Chen would leave China.      But the Democrat former House speaker Nancy Pelosi described Chen's flight to the US as \\"a milestone in the cause for human rights in China\\".      \\"The courage of Chen Guangcheng to risk his life and livelihood to advocate for disadvantaged people in China is an inspiration to freedom-seeking people around the world,\\" she said.      Human rights campaigners warned against complacency.      \\"Chen's departure for the US does not and should not in any way mark a 'mission accomplished' moment for the US government or any other government which values human rights and rule of law in China. The fact is that getting Chen Guangcheng and his family on a plane is the easiest part of this saga. The harder, longer term part is ensuring his right under international law to return to China when he sees fit,\\" said Phelim Kine, senior Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. ||||| The trip to New York ended an improbable journey that began in late April, when despite his lack of sight, Mr. Chen scaled the walls around his house, sneaked past the guards who held him captive and was whisked to Beijing by a human rights activist. American officials agreed to provide at least temporary shelter, but the pickup almost went awry: Chinese security cars trailed their vehicle, forcing them to sweep Mr. Chen into their car from another vehicle and race through the streets of the capital to the embassy.      But the drama did not end there. Mr. Chen decided more than a week later to stay in China, only to change his mind several hours later when American officials left him at a hospital and friends expressed fears for his safety. That led to renewed negotiations and eventually to Saturday’s release.      Now, after years of isolation — his every move at his home recorded by surveillance cameras — and serving time in a Chinese jail, Mr. Chen found himself at the center of a media frenzy generated by his release.      Photo      But the sudden ability to speak out was bittersweet, which he acknowledged in an interview on the plane. China has a pattern of allowing some especially vocal dissidents to leave the country in order to minimize the impact of their activism at home, and it is unclear if he will be able to effect change as easily from so far away, while he studies at New York University.      “I don’t really feel that happy, but rather sentimental,” he said in the brief interview. “After all the suffering for years, I don’t have those tearful moments anymore, but I do feel something inside.”      He looked calm, but his hands shook as he talked about leaving a country he has tried to change from within for years.      “I’m very clear what kind of role I’m playing right now,” he said. “Opportunity and risk exist at the same time.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In Washington, the State Department praised the Chinese government in a statement that reflected the United States’ handling of the case from the start: understated and nonconfrontational, despite the emotions and high stakes involved for both countries. “We also express our appreciation for the manner in which we were able to resolve this matter and to support Mr. Chen’s desire to study in the U.S. and pursue his goals,” the State Department’s spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said.      Her statement referred to the complex understanding — the Chinese were loath to call it a deal — in which Mr. Chen will be allowed to attend law school on a fellowship rather than seek asylum, which the authorities in Beijing would have considered an affront. School officials said they had already stocked a faculty apartment with Chinese food and new furniture for him.

His departure from Beijing — after two weeks of waiting — avoided a major embarrassment for the Obama administration, which was criticized by Chinese activists and some Republicans in Congress who accused the administration of releasing Mr. Chen too quickly into Chinese custody and, they said, seeking an expedient solution to a nettlesome problem ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s visit to China in early May. Since then, activists have been mainly supportive of the United States’ efforts to help Mr. Chen.      On Saturday, Mr. Chen left Beijing with his wife and two children, and like most events surrounding his case, the departure was shrouded in secrecy. Mr. Chen and his family said they did not know they were leaving the country until several hours before the flight, and it was only on their way to the airport that they learned where they were heading. The passports they had been awaiting were delivered by Chinese officials shortly before the family got on the United Airlines plane.      Once on board, flight attendants promptly drew a curtain around their business class seats and barred other passengers in the cabin from using the bathroom while the plane was on the runway.      Photo      Speaking by cellphone before he boarded the flight, Mr. Chen told friends that he was excited to leave China but was worried about the fate of relatives left behind. Bob Fu, president of ChinaAid, a Christian advocacy group in Texas that championed Mr. Chen’s case, said, “He’s happy to finally have a rest after seven years of suffering, but he’s also worried they will suffer some retribution.”      Mr. Chen and his family were driven directly to Beijing International Airport by employees of Chaoyang Hospital, where Mr. Chen had been treated for intestinal problems and for the foot he broke during his escape. .      Mr. Chen, a self-taught lawyer blinded by childhood illness, was once toasted by the state news media for his advocacy of the disabled and the disenfranchised.      But in 2005, he ran into trouble with the authorities by organizing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of thousands of women in Shandong Province who had been subjected to forced abortions and sterilizations. A year later, a local court sent him to prison for more than four years on charges that were widely seen as spurious.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Although technically a free man after his release in September 2010, Mr. Chen ran up against local officials who, with the backing of provincial authorities, turned his home into a makeshift prison, with hired guards and cellphone jamming equipment.      In a homemade video that was smuggled last year out of the village where he lived and posted on the Internet, Mr. Chen and his wife detailed the indignities of their detention. Local officials responded with a vicious round of beatings.      The cordon of security also kept out visitors, including journalists, diplomats and freelance Chinese activists, who were violently repelled when they tried to enter the village.      Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher based in Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch , offered tempered praise on Saturday for the Chinese government’s handling of the episode but said he would reserve further judgment until the day Mr. Chen sought to return to China.      Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who helped arrange Mr. Chen’s fellowship, said he thought Beijing would be eager to blunt the domestic impact of Mr. Chen’s departure. “The last thing they want,” he said, “is for this deal to symbolize a way out of China for dissidents.” |||||Summary:","output":"Supporters of Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese activist who recently arrived in New York, have warned that his family and friends in China are still at risk.

Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). On August 9, 1995, at 4:23 am, eight days after his 53rd birthday, Garcia was found dead in his room at the rehabilitation clinic. The cause of death was a heart attack. Garcia had long struggled with drug addiction, weight problems, sleep apnea, heavy smoking, and diabetes--all of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that upon hearing of Garcia's death, \\"I was struck numb; I had lost my oldest surviving friend, my brother.\\" Garcia's funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Belvedere. It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends, including former basketball player Bill Walton and musician Bob Dylan. Deborah Koons barred Garcia's former wives from the ceremony.  On August 13, approximately 25,000 people attended a municipally sanctioned public memorial at the Polo Fields of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Crowds produced hundreds of flowers, gifts, images, and a bagpipe rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" in remembrance. In the Haight, a single white rose was reportedly tied to a tree near the Dead's former Ashbury house, where a group of followers gathered to mourn.  On the morning of April 4, 1996, after a total lunar eclipse earlier that day, Weir and Deborah Koons, accompanied by Sanjay Mishra, spread half of Garcia's ashes into the Ganges River at the holy city of Rishikesh, India, a site sacred to Hindus. The remaining ashes were poured into the San Francisco Bay. Koons did not allow former wife Carolyn Garcia to attend the spreading of the ashes.

And the answer is?","output":"The acronym for the organization that was set up in 1950 to coordinate the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is SHAPE, which stands for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. SHAPE is the central command and planning center for NATO's military operations and is responsible for the overall strategic direction and guidance of NATO's military components. NATO was founded in 1949 as a military alliance between North American and European countries to provide collective defense against potential aggression from the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. In December 1950, SHAPE was established as an integral part of NATO to improve the integration and cooperation among the member countries' armed forces. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was a key figure in the success of the World War II-era Allied forces, was appointed as the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) to lead SHAPE and the integrated military structure of NATO. Today, SHAPE continues to play an essential role in maintaining the readiness and efficiency of NATO's armed forces, working closely with its member nations to execute a broad range of missions, including crisis management, cooperative security, and collective defense. The current headquarters of SHAPE is located in Mons, Belgium, and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe is responsible for commanding NATO's military forces across an area of responsibility that spans three continents, including Europe, America, and Africa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 0 = -14*y - 74*y - 107*y - 1170 for y. Solve this problem.","output":"Alright, so first let's simplify the equation. It looks like there are three different places where you have \\"y\\". We've got \\"-14*y\\", \\"-74*y\\", and \\"-107*y\\". If we add all of these together, it's like we're gathering all your y's in one place. This is our first step. So, let's add -14, -74, and -107 together. When we do that, we get -195. So, our equation now looks like this: 0 = -195*y - 1170. Now, in order to solve the problem, we have to isolate \\"y\\". To do this, we should move \\"-1170\\" over to the other side of the equation. This is similar to if you were to move a toy from one side of your room to the other. Instead of taking away -1170, you're going to add 1170 to both sides, because if you add something, it's like moving it to the other side. So, we get 1170 = -195*y. Next, we divide both sides of the equation by -195 to isolate \\"y\\". This is just like if you have 195 pieces of candy and you want to divide it evenly among your friends, you'd figure out how many each friend would get.  So when we do that calculation, we find that -1170 divided by -195 equals 6. So, the solution to the equation is y = 6. This means that if you replace \\"y\\" in your original equation with \\"6\\", both sides of your equation will be equal, just like how both sides of a seesaw are level when they're balanced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: It is part of new measures to provide basic protection for some seven million domestic workers long excluded from Brazil's stringent labour laws. Employers can now be reported and fined several hundred dollars each time they break part of the code. A constitutional amendment limits domestic workers to a 44-hour week. It defined other rights as well - basic entitlements such as an eight-hour working day, the right to the minimum wage, a lunch break, social security and severance pay. Most of these changes have been implemented, but there are still challenges around the government severance fund into which employers have to pay  8% of their employee's total salary each month. If the employee is fired without just cause, the employer has to pay a lump sum worth 40% of the pot, plus an added 10% for the government. Discussions are continuing around how many months' pay workers will be entitled to if they are made redundant. The regulation of working hours has had a big impact. The new legislation has led to many families employing more people to do alternate shifts and some employers are doing more work themselves. But there are other factors too affecting the domestic worker labour market. The number of women choosing to go into domestic service is shrinking. This is because of better access to education and job opportunities particularly in the poor north-east of the country from where many people travelled in search of work. Domestic workers are asking for higher wages so for many in the middle class the live-in maid is no longer feasible. People are employing staff by the day and more household chores are being done by middle-class men and women who are also now buying more household appliances. Brazil has around 7m maids according to the International Labour Organisation, more than any other country in the world. Summary:","output":"New measures have been implemented in Brazil to provide basic protection to seven million domestic workers who were previously excluded from the country's strict labor laws. Employers can be reported and fined for breaking the code, and a constitutional amendment now limits domestic workers to a 44-hour work week, with rights such as an eight-hour workday, minimum wage, lunch breaks, social security, and severance pay. There are ongoing challenges surrounding the government severance fund and discussions about redundancy pay. The new legislation has led to changes in employment practices, with many families hiring multiple people for alternate shifts or taking on more work themselves. The number of women entering domestic service is decreasing due to improved access to education and job opportunities, leading to higher wage demands and a shift toward employing staff by the day and increased use of household appliances.

Essential oils can cause skin irritation and rashes if used directly on bare skin, so always dilute your oils first.  If you've never used essential oils before, you may want to use diluted oils on a small portion of your skin. Watch for a reaction before massaging them elsewhere on your body.

Title: Men in Black II Movie plot: Five years after the retirement of Agent K (Jones) from MIB, the secret New York City-based agency that monitors and regulates extraterrestrials residing on Earth, Agent J (Smith)âK's former partner and hand-picked replacementâis called to investigate the murder of an alien at his pizzeria. The waitress, Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), tells him that the murderers were Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), a shapeshifting Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad (Johnny Knoxville). Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MIB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories of the aliensâand of him. J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent Kâwho was neuralyzed when he retired, and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the town's postmaster, J explains this, and convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MIB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed; fortunately, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but it's not enough: Years before, he neuralyzed himself, specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returnedâbut as a precaution, he left himself a series of clues. At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with the worm aliens from the first movie. The key opens a locker in Grand Central Station where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card.

We have this equation: -44*r - 266 = -398 Now, we want to find the value of \\"r\\". Here's what we'll do: 1. First, we need to get rid of the -266 on the left side. So, we'll add 266 to both sides. This will help us isolate \\"r\\".    So, we have: -44*r - 266 + 266 = -398 + 266 2. Now, the -266 and +266 on the left side will cancel each other out because they are opposite of each other. So, we'll have:     -44*r = -132 3. Now, we need to get \\"r\\" by itself. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -44, because -44*r means -44 times r.     So, we have: (-44*r) / -44 = -132 / -44 4. When we divide both numbers, -44 and -132, both negatives will cancel each other out (because a negative divided by a negative gives us a positive). So, we'll have:     r = 3 There you go! We found the value of \\"r\\", and it is equal to 3. Remember, we solved this puzzle by following steps, just like finding clues to solve a riddle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades - The shaft of the turbine spins - Shaft is connected to a generator - The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor - The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside - The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose low winds that day happens, how will it affect the rotor rotates more.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of wind turbine electricity generation. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that lower wind speeds on a particular day might impact the way the rotor rotates. Let's first understand the process in detail and then discuss the effects of low winds on the rotor and the electricity generation process. As mentioned in your description, when wind blows and passes through the turbines, it moves the blades, causing the shaft of the turbine to spin. The spinning shaft is connected to a generator or alternator, which is responsible for converting kinetic energy from the spinning motion into electrical energy. Typically, the generator consists of a rotor (rotating part) and a stator (fixed part). The rotor usually has one or more sets of magnets, while the stator has multiple wire windings or loops surrounding the magnets. When the rotor spins rapidly, it generates a rotating magnetic field inside the core. This magnetic field, in turn, induces an electric current in the coil windings of the stator. Now, let's discuss the effects of the perturbation hypothesis on this process: Direct Effect: Low wind speeds on a specific day will directly affect the rotation of the wind turbine blades, and consequently, the spinning speed of the shaft. This decrease in shaft rotation will, in turn, lead to a decline in the rotor's spinning speed. As the rotor relies on its speed to generate a strong magnetic field, low rotor speed would lead to a weak magnetic field. Consequently, the induced electric current in the stator coil windings will be lower, which will reduce the generated electrical energy. Indirect Effect: Apart from the direct effect on rotor rotation, low wind speeds could also influence factors such as the efficiency and stability of the wind turbine. Indirect effects include: 1. Efficiency: Modern wind turbines usually have an operational range, known as the cut-in and cut-out wind speeds. When the wind speed is too low, the turbine will not produce any electricity. On the other hand, when the wind speed is too high, the turbine will shut down to prevent any mechanical damage. It's important for the wind turbine to remain within this range to operate efficiently. Low wind speeds could impact the overall efficiency of the turbine in generating electricity. 2. Turbulence: Low wind speeds may cause turbulence and variability in wind conditions. This could lead to fluctuating power output, which may affect the overall rotor performance and, subsequently, the amount of electricity generated. 3. Maintenance and Load: When wind speeds change significantly, it causes stress on the mechanical components of the wind turbine. Consequently, the fluctuating load and stress may increase the maintenance requirements and impact the long-term reliability and lifespan of the turbine system. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does impact the wind turbine's electricity generation process directly by affecting the rotor's spinning speed and, consequently, the amount of electricity generated. Moreover, it indirectly affects the overall efficiency, stability, and maintenance of the wind turbine system. To mitigate the impacts of low wind speeds, modern wind turbines are designed with better aerodynamics, advanced control systems, and predictive wind behavior analysis to optimize their performances under varying wind conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

There was at least one comment received in response to the IRFA (Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis). The IRFA is a process to ensure that regulatory bodies assess the potential impact of their proposed actions, specifically on small entities. The existence of a comment in response to the IRFA confirms that there was public or stakeholder involvement in the process. 2. The comment was about the impact of the proposed rule on small entities that manage funds regulated under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974). ERISA is a United States federal law that governs and protects the retirement benefits of private-sector employees. The comment suggests that there were concerns about the potential consequences this specific rule might have on the management of such funds and, in turn, possibly affecting the employees relying on these funds for retirement. 3. Since the premise states that the comment was concerning ERISA-regulated funds, we can infer that the proposed rule had potential implications on pensions, retirement funds, or other benefit programs covered under ERISA. This also suggests that the commenter (or commenters) had an interest in the financial well-being and protection of private-sector employees, as per the ERISA guidelines. Given this information, the hypothesis \\"No comments were received in response to the IRFA\\" is false in the context of the provided premise. There was at least one comment received, addressing the impact of the proposed rule on small entities managing ERISA-regulated funds. This demonstrates that stakeholder participation contributed to the IRFA process in this instance, representing an effort to account for concerns and potential effects on the involved entities and individuals before finalizing the rule."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: Country is facing second snap election in a year after party in ruling coalition quits over alleged cover-up involving PM’s father      Iceland will face its second snap election in a year after one of the three parties in its ruling coalition said it was quitting because of a “serious breach of trust” over the alleged cover-up of a scandal involving the prime minister’s father.      The Bright Future party said on its Facebook page that it had “decided to terminate cooperation with the government”, effectively bringing down Bjarni Benediktsson’s administration barely nine months after it was formed.      The prime minister told reporters: “We have lost the majority and I don’t see anything that indicates we can regain that … I am calling an election.” He added that he would prefer the vote to take place in November.      The walkout follows reports that Benediktsson’s Independence party tried to conceal a letter written by his father, Benedikt Sveinsson, to help a friend convicted of child sexual offences have his criminal record cleared.      The justice minister, Sigridur Andersen, of the Independence party, told Benediktsson of the letter in July but the government did not publicly disclose its existence until forced to do so by a parliamentary committee this week.      Sveinsson’s letter recommended that his friend Hjalti Sigurjón Hauksson, sentenced to five years in prison in 2004 for repeatedly raping his stepdaughter for 12 years since the age of five, should have his “honour restored”.      The widely criticised Icelandic legal procedure restores the “civil standing” of people who have served sentences for serious offences – allowing them, for example, to apply for certain jobs – without erasing their criminal records. One requirement for the status is a letter of recommendation from a close friend.      The Reform party, the third member of the coalition formed after elections last year, triggered by the collapse of the previous government following the Panama Papers offshore tax revelations, also said it backed a fresh vote.      “In light of the situation, the Reform party believes the right thing to do is to call an election immediately,” it said in a statement.      Bright Future’s chair, Guðlaug Kristjánsdóttir, called the latest scandal “the last straw”.      Sveinsson confirmed on Friday that he had signed a letter supporting his friend’s application and said he had not discussed it with anyone. “I did not think of it as something that would justify Hjalti’s position,” he said. “I never considered ‘restored honour’ as anything but a legal procedure making it possible for convicted criminals to regain some civil rights.”      Sveinsson added: “I would like to apologise to all those who have been hurt because of the matter.” ||||| COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Iceland's president on Saturday accepted the resignation of the volcanic island's prime minister, who says a new election mostly likely will be held on Nov. 4.      Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson lost his nine-month-old, center-right coalition after one party quit over an attempt by the prime minister's father to help clear the name of a convicted pedophile.      President Gudni Th. Johannesson met Saturday with Benediktsson and was meeting with other party leaders later in the day.      A small centrist party, Bright Future, quit the ruling coalition Friday after it emerged that Benediktsson's father had written a letter urging a pardon for Hjalti Sigurjon Hauksson, who was convicted in 2004 of raping his stepdaughter almost every day for 12 years.      Under Iceland's judicial system, a person who has served a sentence for a serious crime can apply to authorities to \\"restore their honor\\" and seek employment again, meaning their criminal record is erased. For that, a letter of recommendation by a close friend or an associate is needed.      Benediktsson took office in January, uniting his Independence Party, the Reform Party and the centrists.      Together they held the slimmest of majorities — 32 of the 63 seats in parliament following the Oct. 29 election, which was called after the former prime minister resigned amid protests over his offshore holdings that were revealed in the Panama Papers leak.      When it emerged that some government members had kept information from the public about the letter seeking to clear Hauksson's record, Bright Future said it was quitting.      Benediktsson said Friday that some Icelandic laws were \\"completely out of sync with modern values,\\" according to the nation's largest newspaper Morgunbladid. He was quoted as saying he was \\"in shock\\" when he heard about the letter.      Benediktsson, a former finance minister, was also named in the Panama Papers as having held a stake in a Seychelles-based investment company.      Iceland is a wind-lashed island near the Arctic Circle with a population of 320,000. The country suffered through years of economic upheaval after its debt-swollen banks collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis but now is experiencing a surge in tourism by those eager to see its pristine glaciers, fjords and waterfalls and the Northern Lights. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Ok, let me explain this in simple words. Iceland, a country with big mountains and beautiful nature, has been having some problems with their leaders. A man named Bjarni Benediktsson was the person in charge of the country, called the Prime Minister. But his friends in the government found out that his father tried to help someone who did very bad things.  After they found out about this, Bjarni's friends didn't want to work with him anymore, so they left the group that was in charge. So now, they have to choose new leaders for the country, and they will do this by having people in Iceland vote for who they want.

Given the following passage  \\"Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya. His family came from a small, relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985), and his mother was named Aisha (died 1978); Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder. Nomadic Bedouins, they were illiterate and kept no birth records. As such, Gaddafi's date of birth is not known with certainty, and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943, although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940. His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life. He repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

How is \\"A Turkish house\\" said in Russian?","output":"In Russian, \\"A Turkish house\\" is translated as \\"Турецкий дом\\" (Turetskiy dom). Here, \\"Турецкий\\" (Turetskiy) means \\"Turkish,\\" and \\"дом\\" (dom) means \\"house.\\"  The Russian language is a Slavic language and is the most widely spoken one among the East Slavic languages. It uses the Cyrillic alphabet which is different from the Latin alphabet used in the English language. Therefore, when learning or translating words from one language to another, it is important to be familiar with the alphabet system being used to correctly write and pronounce the words in the target language. In terms of pronunciation, \\"Турецкий дом\\" (Turetskiy dom) can be pronounced as follows: - Турецкий (Turetskiy): \\"too-RETS-kee\\" - дом (dom): \\"dom\\" When speaking or writing in Russian, it is crucial to pay attention to grammar, case inflections, and the proper use of adjectives and nouns. For instance, adjectives in Russian agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. Since \\"дом\\" (dom) is a masculine noun, the adjective \\"Турецкий\\" (Turetskiy) should be in its masculine form as well. It is noteworthy that Russian is an inflected language, and due to its complex grammar system, it's important to pay attention to the context in which a word or phrase is used. The meaning and translation might change depending on the context. So, while \\"Турецкий дом\\" (Turetskiy dom) refers to \\"A Turkish house\\" in a general context, other words or grammar structures might be used depending on the specific situation and intended meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, we want to find out how many toys you have, which is k. We start with the equation to solve: 0 = 13*k - 6*k - 14 First, let's group the k toys together. We have 13 k toys and we want to take away 6 of them.  So, we get: 0 = (13-6)*k - 14 Now after taking away the 6 k toys, we have 7 k toys left: 0 = 7*k - 14 Now, we want to make the equation equal to 0. To do that, we need to find out how many toys (k) we need. We can add 14 to both sides of the equation: 14 = 7*k Next, we can find out how many toys (k) we have if we divide both sides of the equation by 7: k = 14 ÷ 7 So we see that: k = 2 That means you have 2 toys (k)."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Shinedown is an American rock band from Jacksonville, Florida formed by singer Brent Smith in 2001 after the dissolution of his previous band. Smith, still under contract with record label Atlantic Records, recruited the band's original lineup of Jasin Todd as guitarist, Brad Stewart on bass, and Barry Kerch on drums. Consistent for the first two album cycles, a few lineup changes followed in the late 2000s, eventually stabilizing with Smith and Kerch alongside Zach Myers on guitar and Eric Bass on bass. The group has released five studio albums: Work on a fourth studio album began in February 2011, with the band spending the first half of the year writing and demoing over 33 songs. The band again decided to work with Cavallo as a producer, but moved into a new sound and lyrical direction on the album, capturing a more of a message of \\"empowerment, perseverance, and inspiration\\", inspired by Smith's then-recent change of getting sober and living a healthier lifestyle, and the new band members contributing to the writing process for the first time on an album. The recording process wrapped up about a year later in February 2012, and the album, Amaryllis, was released the next month, on March 27, 2012, in 30 countries simultaneously, through a joint release between Atlantic and Roadrunner Records in countries Atlantic did not distribute into. Amaryllis debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 106,000 copies in its opening week. While the opening sales doubled the debut of The Sound of Madness, overall sales fell well short, with the album only being certified Gold, indicating a half million copies sold.  Five singles were released from the album: \\"Bully\\", \\"Unity\\", \\"Enemies\\", \\"I'll Follow You\\", and \\"Adrenaline\\". The band's singles once again fared well, albeit it slightly below The Sound of Madness singles; \\"Bully\\" and \\"Unity\\" topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Charts, \\"Enemies\\" and \\"I'll Follow You\\" peaked at number 2, and \\"Adrenaline\\" peaked at number 4. Additionally, only \\"Bully\\" managed to have any cross-over success, break into the Billboard Top 100 chart, at number 94. and eventually being certified Gold as well. Shinedown also contributed the non-album song titled \\"I'm Alive\\" to the soundtrack of the 2012 film The Avengers.  In November 2012, Smith announced in an NME interview that a follow up Shinedown album had already been recorded. Smith stated \\"We've actually, we have another record of material. It's actually recorded...It's still very massive, it still has an epic feel to it all, but the tempo is a little slower, and the subject matter is a little different. I would say it's actually a bit darker, a little bit more mischievous.\\" Despite the announcement, the band proceeded to move continue on with the Amaryllis touring cycle, touring through 2013 to complete another two year touring cycle. Shinedown and Three Days Grace embarked on a co-headlined tour beginning in February 2013, and went on another iteration of the yearly \\"Carnival of Madness\\" tour with Papa Roach in later 2013.  In April 2013, Smith and Myers recorded ten acoustic cover songs, selected out of a pool of over 4,000 fan requests, selecting a variety of different types of songs, from Metallica's \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" to Adele's \\"Someone Like You\\". The tracks were released across two separate EPs, Acoustic Sessions on January 28, 2014, and Acoustic Sessions Pt. 2 on March 28, 2014, with performance videos created for every track on the first EP. The band took much of 2014 off, a rarity for the band, which had pretty consistently moved back and forth between recording and touring for each album cycle. The time off was for the band to rest, specifically Smith, who had damaged his vocal chords and contracted oral thrush from the constant years of touring prior.

Question 2: Now that Modi govt has decided to stop circulation of Rs.500 & 1000 notes, how will this impact the Indian economy? Comparison: Both questions are asking about the impact of the ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes on the Indian economy. The only difference between them is that Question 2 provides context that this decision was made by the Modi government. Therefore, the answer is: 2). yes Now, let's move on to explaining the impact of this decision on the Indian economy: The ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes, also known as demonetization, was implemented by the Indian government with the intent to tackle the issues of corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency. Full analysis would require a deeper study of the subject, but here are some initial potential impacts on the economy: 1. Disruption in cash-based transactions: The sudden ban of these higher denomination notes caused a temporary shortage of cash in circulation. As India is predominantly a cash-driven economy, this affected both businesses and consumers. 2. Increased tax compliance: Demonetization forced people to deposit their high denomination currency notes into banks. This allowed the government to track income and wealth sources, leading to improved tax compliance and potentially higher tax revenue. 3. Shift towards digital payments: Demonetization created an environment where people were encouraged to adopt digital payment methods, reducing the dependency on cash transactions and pushing the economy towards digital transactions and financial inclusion. 4. Impact on GDP growth: The initial disruption from demonetization caused a short-term slowdown in India's economic growth. It was reported that GDP growth slowed in the immediate quarters following the announcement, but later recovered. 5. Inflation: There was a temporary decrease in inflation as cash was in short supply, but this effect was short-lived as liquidity was eventually restored to the market. While there are opposing viewpoints on the long-term benefits of demonetization, the immediate impact included short-term disruption in cash-based transactions, a push towards digital payments, and an increase in tax compliance. The effect on GDP growth and inflation was temporary and normalcy was restored in due course."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, continue to pray that God will help you look for signs that a person would be open to a spiritual conversation, and that He'll give you the courage to be a witness for Him. Jesus' message of hope, love, and forgiveness are extremely powerful, especially to someone who's struggling to find their place in life. If you're talking to someone who seems to be deeply sad, anxious, or fearful, even if they're cheerful on the surface, they might be open to hearing God's word.  For instance, you might hear a friend say something like, “I just don't know what I'm going to do with my life. My career didn't work out like I thought it would, and my relationships have all been disasters.” The message that God has a plan for their life might give them hope. You might also hear someone say, “I feel worried all the time and I don't know why.” In that case, the person might be open to God's message of hope and peace. Other conversations that might lead to a discussion of God could include comments about what happens after people die, feeling a lack of connection to the world around them, or even who created nature or mankind. Sometimes, it can seem insensitive if you quote Scripture as a blanket answer to someone's struggles, especially if they're opening up to you in a vulnerable and candid way. Try to talk to the individual in a way that's personal and sympathetic, allowing them to feel God's love through you. That will be much more effective than saying, \\"The Bible says that God loves you.\\" If a friend or loved one is severely depressed and you're concerned they might hurt themselves, call for emergency help. Once they're out of danger, you may be able to share your faith as a way to help them heal their inner pain, but it's important to have professionals help someone who's in crisis.

As with any type of conversation, the exact way you'll do this will depend on what you and the other person are talking about. Try to let the conversation develop organically, and pray for guidance, wisdom, and sensitivity as you move forward.  In the case of the friend who's concerned about their career and failed dating attempts, you might say something like, “I really believe that God has a plan for your life. It might not seem like it now, but He can do great things in your life if you trust Him.” If you're talking to your friend who's always worried, you might say, “My relationship with God has really helped me handle all the stress in my life. I still get overwhelmed sometimes, but praying gives me a lot of peace. Is it okay if I share my story with you?” While you're sharing Jesus' story of resurrection and redemption, remember to treat the other person with respect. Don't talk down to them, belittle their beliefs, or discount their opinions, whether you agree with what they're saying or not. Instead, open yourself to learning from their struggles and experience, while remaining firm in your own faith. Leave it up to God to show the person which of their specific behaviors are sinful. Avoid judging the person or criticizing the way that they live, although you can point out that they—like everyone else—have likely committed a sin or two throughout their lives. Unfortunately, some people are predisposed to be closed off to God's message. They may have had hurtful encounters with religious people in the past, or they may simply have a negative view of the church. If you sense that the person is hostile towards your message, gently change the subject.  You're more likely to leave the person with a good impression by handling the situation with grace and kindness, rather than by trying to force them to listen to what you have to say. If the person seems receptive to your message, or if they have a neutral response, you can move forward with sharing your witness. God's message of forgiveness is a beautiful story, although a frank discussion of sin can be very uncomfortable. Try to channel God's love for the person as you're talking to them, keeping the focus on the story of redemption and sacrifice.  You might say something like, “I believe that God sent His son Jesus to earth, and Jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins. I get a lot of peace from my relationship with God, and I'd love to share that with you.” Then, tell them more about Jesus' life and death, based on your studying of the Scripture. It can often be very effective to share your own story of how you were saved, rather than just explaining the message in an abstract way. Avoid using in-depth theological terms the person might be unfamiliar with. Instead, stick to simple, everyday language.   Try to approach every opportunity to witness with humility, patience, and kindness. Once you've presented the story of Jesus to the other person, it's up to the Holy Spirit and that person whether they're going to accept. If they do want to repent of their sins and follow Jesus, you can lead them in a simple prayer. However, keep in mind that your intention is just to be a vessel for God to work through, so don't take it personally if they say no.  If they do want to pray, ask them to say something like, “Dear Lord, I know I am not perfect. I want to turn my life over to Jesus and have a personal relationship with God. Thank you for loving me, and please forgive me for my sins. Amen.” After the person prays, encourage them to get baptized and start attending a church where they feel comfortable.","output":"This article talks about how to start a conversation with someone about your faith in a gentle and respectful way. It says that it's important to first have a normal, friendly conversation with the person, and then look for signs that they might be open to talking about spiritual things. If they seem to be struggling or worried, they might be more open to hearing about your faith. When talking about your faith, try to be kind, loving, and humble. Don't judge or criticize the person, but instead show them God's love. If they want to learn more, share your own story of how your faith has helped you in your life.

Let me provide a detailed breakdown of this sentence to demonstrate why this is the case: 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"Martha,\\" a proper noun that denotes a specific person. Proper nouns begin with capital letters, which is true in this instance. The subject is crucial in a sentence as it specifies who or what the sentence is about. In this case, the sentence is about \\"Martha.\\" 2. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"climbed,\\" which is an action verb portraying the action performed by the subject. The verb is in the simple past tense, indicating that the action has already taken place. The subject-verb agreement is proper in this sentence: \\"Martha\\" is singular, and the verb \\"climbed\\" is congruent with the singular subject. A correct verb tense and a proper subject-verb agreement are important aspects of a grammatically sound sentence. 3. Prepositional phrase: \\"Up the mountain\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides additional information about the action (verb) in the sentence. In this case, it gives more details about where the climbing occurred. The preposition \\"up\\" introduces the prepositional phrase, and \\"the mountain\\" is the object of the preposition. The phrase as a whole serves as an adverb modifying the verb \\"climbed.\\" Prepositional phrases are useful in adding context and specificity to a sentence. 4. Punctuation: The sentence ends with a period, which is appropriate for a declarative sentence that makes a statement or provides information. The period signals the end of the sentence, allowing the reader or listener to absorb the information before proceeding. In summary, the test sentence \\"Martha climbed up the mountain.\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence as it contains a clear subject, a proper subject-verb agreement, an accurate verb tense, a prepositional phrase that adds context, and appropriate punctuation. The sentence is concise, coherent, and easily understood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The charity said there were a further six confirmed or probable cases in the town of Isiro. The outbreak, involving the Bundibugyo strain, was first reported last week after one person had died. Last month an outbreak of a more deadly ebola strain in neighbouring Uganda killed 16 people. The DR Congo outbreak occurred in Oriental province, which shares a border with Uganda. Medicins sans Frontieres (MSF) has said that the two outbreaks may not be related. It is not clear when exactly the deaths in Isiro occurred. A medical coordinator for MSF, Anja de Weggheleire, told the BBC the Bundibugyo strain was still dangerous, if less fatal than the one detected in Uganda. \\"It is normally less mortal and less virulent then the one we have seen in other places... But still it stays a very dangerous and mortal disease... we expect normally figures around 25 to 35% mortality,\\" Ms Weggheleire said. The charity says its staff in the affected area in north-east DR Congo are taking measures to locate and isolate anyone who has been in contact with those infected. Experts have said that Isiro's position as a transit point could make an outbreak more challenging to control. The virus, which is transmitted to humans from both monkeys and birds, causes massive internal bleeding and has a very high mortality rate. It is one of the most virulent diseases in the world and is spread by close personal contact. There is no vaccine for the virus and symptoms of infection include a sudden onset of fever, weakness, headache, vomiting and kidney problems.

It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind.

It is the disease that is now responsible for one in four deaths in the Western world. Now, what may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500-year-old skeleton. Archaeologists say that a Siberian man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer, as revealed by tell-tale marks on his bones. Earliest victim? What may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500-year-old skeleton (pictured). Archaeologists say that a Siberian man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer, as revealed by tell-tale marks on his bones. The early Bronze Age man's remains were exhumed from a small hunter-gatherer cemetery in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia. ‘This represents one of the earliest cases of human cancer worldwide and the oldest case documented thus far from Northeast Asia,’ said Angela Lieverse, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Older skeletons believed to be between 5,000 and 6,000 years old have yielded similar discoveries, but cancers were unconfirmed or tumours were found to be benign. Analysing the Russian remains with Daniel Temple from George Mason University in Virginia and Vladimir Bazaliiskii with Irkutsk State University in Russia, Dr Lieverse discovered that the cancer had riddled the ancient man’s bones with from head to hip, including his upper arms and upper legs, and virtually all points between. As he lay dying, severe pain and fatigue would have been his constant companions, punctuated by periods of panic as he struggled to breathe, she said. The man's age, sex and lesions on his bones point to lung cancer ( a magnified human lung cancer cell is shown) or possible prostate cancer for his cause of death. Experts found the cancer had riddled the ancient man’s bones with from head to hip, including his upper arms and upper legs, and virtually all points between. The man’s community buried him in a foetal position in a circular pit after he died, according to the research published in the journal, Plos One. The cancer victim was buried with an ornamental bone and a bone spoon, intricately carved with a winding serpent handle. Ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare, leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles. However, this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis. Dr Lieverse suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies, cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed. ‘As we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton, the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase,’ she said. He is thought to have been between 35 and 40 years old when he died. This burial differed from most men’s of the period, who were typically laid to rest on their backs with fishing or hunting gear. The researchers performed a battery of tests on the man, as if he had died recently and ruled out the possibility that he had died from tuberculosis or fungal diseases. They said that the most likely culprit was metastatic carcinoma – cancer that starts in one part of the body and spreads. ‘It’s clear the disease had progressed considerably, metastasising far beyond its original location in the body and contributing to his death,' Dr Lieverse said. ‘His age and sex and the lesions on his bones point to lung cancer or possibly prostate cancer.’ The early Bronze Age man's remains were exhumed from a small hunter-gatherer cemetery near Lake Baikal (shown on the map) in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia. Ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare, leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles. The Bronze Age man lived in a mountainous region with freshwater lakes and would have eaten a healthy diet of fish, game and fresh seasonal plants. However, this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis. Dr Lieverse suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies, cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed. ‘As we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton, the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase,’ she said. ‘A related example is scurvy. Once we knew what scurvy does to the skeleton and became familiar with the signs, identification of the disease increased. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1. The oldest case of cancer may have been discovered in a 4,500-year-old skeleton belonging to a Siberian man who suffered from either lung or prostate cancer, as identified by marks on his bones. This find challenges the idea that cancer is a recent phenomenon caused by modern lifestyles. 2. The skeleton was unearthed from a small hunter-gatherer cemetery in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia. Bioarchaeologist Angela Lieverse from the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, stated that this could be one of the earliest cases of human cancer worldwide and the oldest documented case from Northeast Asia. 3. Older skeletons (between 5,000 and 6,000 years old) have yielded similar discoveries, but cancers in those cases were unconfirmed or tumors were benign.  4. The cancer had spread throughout the ancient man's bones from head to hip, causing severe pain and fatigue as he struggled to breathe. The man is believed to have been between 35 and 40 years old when he died. 5. There is a possibility that cancer may have been more common in ancient times than generally presumed, considering factors such as longer life expectancies. As researchers become more familiar with the appearance of metastatic carcinoma in the skeleton, the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research could potentially increase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By encouraging her to sing \\"Hound Dog\\". Answer:","output":"Title: The Soulful Redemption Introduction: In a small town in Georgia, amidst the 1950s, music and self-expression are considered the ultimate form of freedom. Many passionate musicians gather at the town's community center to express themselves, but for Lewellen (played by Emma Stone), singing was a dream never dared to chase due to her controlling and abusive father. Charles (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a talented musician and the lead singer of the community center's band. It all takes a turn once Charles crosses paths with Lewellen and recognizes her hidden passion for singing. This sparks a deep connection between them, and Charles stands firm on a mission to rescue her from her sordid life. Plot Outline: 1. The film opens with Charles and his band performing at the community center. The atmosphere is electric, and the crowd is immersed in the music. An air of pure joy and passion floats through the room. Afterwards, the musicians interact with each other discussing their dreams and exchanging experiences. 2. Lewellen watches her first live performance from a distance, without her father knowing. She is captivated by Charles and the world of music, envying the freedom and happiness it brings. On her way back home, she secretly hums the tunes she heard, which catches the attention of Charles, who is leaving the community center. 3. Charles and Lewellen strike up an unlikely friendship as they bond over their shared love for music. Charles recognizes the hidden talents in Lewellen, as she softly hums to the tunes he plays on his guitar, and he feels a strong urge to help her break free from her confines and realize her dreams. 4. Lewellen's father (played by John Goodman) is a strict and domineering man who despises music and punishes Lewellen every time he catches her humming along to a tune on the radio. He controls every aspect of her life, leaving her shattered and caged. 5. Charles decides to enter the town's annual talent show with his band and wants Lewellen to sing as the lead vocalist. Although initially hesitant, Lewellen finally agrees to practice for the show in secret. Charles introduces Lewellen to the songs they would be performing, including Elvis Presley's iconic \\"Hound Dog.\\" As they practice, Lewellen's confidence skyrockets, and her passion for singing is reignited. 6. As the talent show approaches, Lewellen's father grows increasingly suspicious of her clandestine behavior. He follows her to her secret practice spot – an abandoned barn – and catches her singing along with Charles. Furious, he drags her back home, restricts her movements, and warns her of the impending doom if she disobeys him again. 7. During the final rehearsals for the talent show, Charles and the band members notice Lewellen's absence. The bandleader (played by Billy Bob Thornton) convinces Charles to give up on Lewellen, stating that they could find another singer. However, Charles refuses and ventures into the talent show alone, uncertain about Lewellen's fate. 8. It's the night of the talent show, and the audience eagerly awaits the performance of Charles and his band. As Charles steps onto the stage, he announces that they will be singing \\"Hound Dog\\" and dedicates the night's performance to Lewellen. As the band starts playing, Lewellen, who has escaped her father's clutches and made her way to the show, hears her cue and rushes to the stage. 9. With a newfound confidence and determination to reclaim her life, Lewellen grabs the microphone and starts singing, much to the audience's delight. Her powerful voice and stage presence make her an instant hit, and her father, standing in the crowd, watches in shock as his control over her withers away. 10. The film concludes with Lewellen's triumphant performance and the town celebrating their victory at the talent show. Charles's unwavering belief in Lewellen's musical abilities and his encouragement to sing \\"Hound Dog\\" has finally led to her rescue, breaking free from her father's grasp. As they leave the stage and embrace, their lives seem intertwined, and the prospects of newfound freedom and dreams chase away the shadows of Lewellen's past. \\"The Soulful Redemption\\" blends the spirit of an uplifting musical with the heartfelt journey of one woman's struggle and eventual redemption. The story showcases the healing power of music and the unmatched strength of human connection, illustrating how a song can change lives and, in Lewellen's case, save one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; Timperley Civil Parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. The new borough was granted armorial bearings which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education,...  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the authority whose responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs?

Summarize the following: If you are already friends and want to take things to the next level, then ignore this step. However, if you just met or are only casual acquaintances, spend time together in a group or ask her out indirectly. This might require you to have a good opener or conversation starter.  Start with a pre-opener: whenever you see her, make eye contact, smile, and say “hi”. Next, start a general conversation. Compliment her on her achievements, or ask about her interests (music, movies, books, hobbies, etc.). Use this general conversation as a starting point for developing a closer relationship based on common interests and/or shared goals.  Be patient. Some girls are naturally more open about themselves and talkative, whereas others might be more shy or hesitant at first. Never use cheesy pick-up lines. Not only does this set a bad impression, but it can also be offensive. You can be upfront and ask her out directly, or use a more indirect approach such as asking what she is doing this weekend and if she has any plans.  Which approach you choose depends on the situation and personalities. Other indirect examples include: asking whether she's been to a certain restaurant, and wondering if she wants to check it out with you; or phrase it as an opportunity, such as “we are both free this weekend and the weather looks nice, so why don't we do something together”.  Remember, at this stage you are only asking her to go on a date (to a movie, concert, dinner, etc.), not if she wants to be your girlfriend.  Make it clear you just want to hang out. Don't talk about relationships or ask her to be your girlfriend. Do not corner a girl or make her feel trapped (physically) when asking her out. She might say no because she feels uncomfortable and intimidated.  If she seems reluctant to go on a date with you, invite her to do something with a group of friends. Organize a picnic or go to a dinner and a movie with a couple friends. On your first date (or first time you hang out), your goals should be to make sure she has a good time, you express your feelings in a way that are clear but not over the top, and you do not try anything too extravagant, expensive, or romantic. Go on a group date or do something in a public place rather than inviting her to spend time with you alone. Take the lead in deciding what you will do and where you will go on the date. Do your homework – ask her if she has any food preferences, make reservations if necessary, and avoid places that are upscale and pricey.  Make an effort with your appearance – wash and comb your hair, brush your teeth, do not wear too much cologne, and wear clean, unwrinkled clothes. Do not overindulge in alcohol, be considerate, and practice good manners. These involve not dominating the conversation, turning off your phone and giving her your full attention, and be kind to others.  Avoid discussing controversial topics, such as politics, old relationships, complaining about your job, or sex. Instead, focus on good topics such as the news (and her opinion on current events), family, travel (either places you've been or want to go in the future), or your thoughts on love and what makes a good relationship. Summary:","output":"To progress from acquaintances to a closer relationship, begin by establishing a connection through general conversation, discussing interests, achievements, and shared goals. Be patient, as some individuals may be more hesitant to open up. Avoid cheesy pick-up lines, and choose a direct or indirect approach when asking her out, depending on the situation and personalities involved. Initially, focus on group dates or public activities to make her feel comfortable, taking the lead on planning and ensuring her preferences are considered. On the date, maintain a clean appearance and practice good manners, providing your full attention while refraining from discussing controversial topics. Focus on establishing a connection and ensuring she has a good time, without putting too much pressure on defining the relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the most common atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations. Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom.

Write a summary based on this article: Mexican authorities said they hope the arrest of a former police chief who had been a fugitive for more than two years will help them solve one of the country’s most notorious human rights cases: the disappearance and presumed murder of 43 students.      Felipe Flores Velazquez, 58, was arrested Friday without incident in Iguala, the town in Guerrero state where the students were last reported alive in September 2014. At the time, he was the police chief there.      Renato Sales Heredia, head of the National Security Commission, said at a news conference Friday in Mexico City that Flores was detained after visiting his wife in Iguala.      He is being held on suspicion of organized crime and kidnapping, Sales said. “The investigations indicate that this person was one of those responsible with coordinating the operation that turned into aggression against the students,” he said.      In a Twitter message, Mexican Atty. Gen. Arely Gomez said the arrest and the prospect of testimony from the ex-chief should help “clarify the facts of Iguala.”      Flores’ arrest adds to a growing roster of detentions in a case that has become an extreme embarrassment for the administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto.      Officials say they have arrested 131 people in connection with the mass disappearance, mostly local police and suspected drug gang members. The former mayor of Iguala and his wife are also among those detained. Some detainees have alleged torture by Mexican authorities.      Still, despite all the arrests, court cases, testimony and publicity surrounding the case, there is still no definitive answer as to what happened to the students on that evening. Many in Mexico fear that their precise fate will never be known.      The students, from a teachers’ school in the rural town of Ayotzinapa, had hijacked several buses and were planning to join a protest. But they were detained by police in Iguala on the evening of Sept. 26, 2014. They have not been seen since.      Not long after the students disappeared, so did the police chief. He was long seen as a key figure in piecing together what happened.      Various theories have surfaced, some contradictory.      Mexican authorities have said the students were picked up by police and handed over to a drug gang, which executed them and set their remains ablaze.      But families of the students, forensic experts, an international investigative commission and others have questioned the official findings. The bodies have never been found.      While the federal government has repeatedly denied any cover-up, the case has come to symbolize a corrupt system in which criminals and cops work hand in hand.      Cooperation between local police and drug traffickers and other organized crime groups has been documented in Guerrero state and elsewhere in Mexico.      patrick.mcdonnell@latimes.com      Cecilia Sanchez in The Times’ Mexico City bureau contributed to this report.

This article was originally published at 2:30 p.m. ||||| (CNN) One of the \\"probable masterminds\\" of the disappearance of 43 Mexican students was arrested Friday morning after being on the lam for more than two years , according to Mexican officials.      The announcement was made by Mexico's National Security Commission via Twitter.      \\"(We) have executed the arrest warrant against Felipe Flores, former Iguala police chief,\\" the commission tweeted.      The attorney general offered a reward of up to 2.5 million pesos (about 134,392 dollars) last year for any information that led to his capture.      How the arrest happened      Felipe Flores Velázquez was captured as he was visiting his spouse in Guerrero, the state where the students went missing in 2014, National Security Commissioner Renato Sales Heredia said at a news conference.      Mexican federal authorities made the arrest in coordination with the attorney general's office, the country's navy and the Center of National Investigation and Security, an intelligence-gathering agency.      No shots were fired.      How did the students go missing?      Authorities say he wanted to prevent the students from disrupting an event by his wife the night they went missing.      The mayor then turned the students over to a gang who killed them, burned their bodies in a landfill and tossed some their remains into a nearby river, Karam added.      Tomás Zerón de Lucio, the head of Mexico's Criminal Investigations Agency, said two months later that the incident was a case of mistaken identity.      He said the criminal group accused of executing the students thought they belonged to a rival gang, also operating around the city of Iguala where the students were last seen.      \\"We can conclude that the motivation was consistent (with the theory that) the students were identified by the criminals as members of an organized crime rival group that operated in the region. That was the reason why they were deprived of their freedom, initially, and then of their lives,\\" Zerón de Lucio said in early 2015.      There is no indication that the mayor wanted all of the students dead , authorities said, but the gang mistook them for a rival group and executed them.      What was the role of the former chief?      Flores Vasquez helped protect city's police officers who were connected with the students' disappearance, authorities said.      He also colluded with the city's mayor to persecute and attack the students and ordered local police to stop them from attending the protest.      The former chief is being charged with organized crime and kidnapping, officials said Friday.      Some 130 others have been arrested in connection with the case, Sales Heredia, added. |||||","output":"The former chief of police in Iguala, Felipe Flores Velazquez, has been arrested in connection with the notorious disappearance and presumed murder of 43 students in the Mexican town in 2014.

For the first time of the season, 15-year wide receiver Troy Brown was active; he saw action early in the game, returning a Dolphins punt on their first drive 10&#160;yards. The Patriots' second first down of their first possession was their 349th of the season, breaking their 1994 franchise record. Six plays later, Brady connected with Moss for an 11-yard touchdown and a 7-0 Patriots lead. After three punts, the Patriots' third drive of the game began on the final play of the first quarter, a 51-yard Maroney rush to give the Patriots the ball at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. After a successful third-down conversion, Brady threw his second touchdown pass of the game to Moss from a yard out to give the Patriots a 14-0 lead. The Dolphins' punted again on their next drive, and the Patriots opened up a 21-point lead with a 59-yard Maroney touchdown run while also setting the franchise record for net yards on a season, breaking the record of 5,965 set in 1978. After the Dolphins' fourth three-and-out of the game, a 38-yard Brandon Fields punt was muffed by Troy Brown and recovered by the Dolphins, who punted again three plays later. After moving the ball from their own 20-yard line to the Dolphins' 48-yard line, Brady completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to Gaffney on the Patriots' 71st touchdown of the season, breaking the NFL record of 70 set by the 1984 Dolphins. The Dolphins drove the Patriots' 4-yard line with 21&#160;seconds remaining in the half, but Tedy Bruschi batted down a Lemon pass on fourth down intended for Justin Peelle to preserve the Patriots' 28-0 lead heading into halftime. On the opening drive of the second half, Welker caught his 101st pass of the season, tying the Patriots individual franchise record Brown set in 2001. On the next play, Brady was intercepted by Jason Allen the end zone on a pass intended for Moss. After a 22-yard Chatman rush began the Dolphins' ensuing drive, the Dolphins punted for the seventh time three plays later. On third down from their own 28-yard line, Brady threw his second interception of the game, this time picked off by linebacker Derrick Pope on a pass also intended for Moss. The Dolphins moved the ball on their next drive from their own 46-yard line to the Patriots' 1-yard line, where Lemon scrambled out of bounds short of the end zone on 4th and goal. The Dolphins challenged the ruling, which was upheld after review. The play gave the Patriots the ball from their own 1-yard line, where a three-and-out set up a 64-yard Hanson punt from the end zone, his longest of the season. A 22-yard Lorenzo Booker rush on the Dolphins' next possession helped bring the Dolphins' to the Patriots 21-yard line, where Lemon connected with Greg Camarillo to cut the Patriots lead to 28-7. The Patriots committed their fourth turnover of the game when Brady was strip-sacked by Joey Porter to give the Dolphins the ball at their own 28-yard line. Four punts and a scoreless fourth quarter later, the Patriots picked up their 15th win of the season as they improved to 15-0 and became the first 15-0 team in NFL history. The Patriots' 15th win matched the win totals of the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, 1998 Minnesota Vikings, 1985 Chicago Bears, and 1984 San Francisco 49ers, while their 15-0 regular season start was a first in NFL history. The Patriots' 6-0 record against division opponents was a franchise first.

The premise states that a woman is standing by a building, wearing a short coat, with another building in view. This premise offers limited information about the woman's attire and the surrounding environment. The key elements of the premise are: 1. Woman standing by a building - This statement informs us that there is a female individual next to some sort of architectural structure.  2. Wearing a short coat - The woman is wearing a coat that is presumably not covering her entire body. However, it is important to notice that the premise states she is wearing a short coat, which implies that there is some clothing on her.  3. Another building in view - There is a secondary building visible in the background, which provides context for the location, but not specifically the woman's attire. Now, let us examine the given hypothesis: The woman is naked. For this hypothesis to be valid, the woman in the given scenario would have to be nude or not wearing any clothing. However, the premise does indicate that the woman is wearing a short coat. While it is not clear what other garments she may or may not be wearing beneath the coat, the fact that she is clothed to some extent contradicts the hypothesis that she is naked. We can infer that the woman isn't completely naked, as she is wearing a short coat. To conclude that the woman is naked with the given information is both a leap in logic and an assumption based on insufficient details.

In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day.

Primarily intended to be performed and enjoyed live, EDM has captured the imaginations of both music producers and listeners worldwide. Key elements of this music typically include repetitive, synthesized beats, bass-heavy rhythms, and catchy melodic hooks. The origins of modern EDM can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when disco, funk, and soul music began to influence a new generation of artists experimenting with synthesizers and electronic equipment. As these artists pushed the boundaries of what was possible with technology, new and distinct musical genres began to emerge. Over the past few decades, EDM has evolved into several sub-genres including house, techno, trance, dubstep, drum and bass, and many others. EDM often features prominent DJs and music producers who use digital tools and sound equipment to mix, blend, and create unique tracks. A DJ's role in the dance music scene might involve live performances, creating original compositions, or remixing existing works. EDM producers might also collaborate with vocalists, musicians, or other creative individuals to craft catchy and memorable tunes. The global appeal of EDM has grown exponentially in recent years. Several large-scale music festivals like Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival, and Electric Daisy Carnival cater exclusively to fans of EDM, drawing tens of thousands of attendees annually. Additionally, EDM has enjoyed commercial success, with many artists frequently topping music charts and earning prestigious awards.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Do this only if you have experience with fasting. The liver flush itself can cause nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting. If you're not used to fasting, these effects may be amplified.  If you are an experienced faster, consider doing a three to seven day juice fast before the liver flush. Apple juice is rich in malic acid and liminoid, which can help break down gallstones. You will drink a total of 1 cup of citrus juices. This mixture will be 50% grapefruit juice, 25% orange juice, and 25% lemon juice. Squeeze the grapefruits, oranges, and lemons separately and do not mix the juices at first. You will need 1/2 cup of grapefruit juice, 1/4 cup of orange juice, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Mix them together well, then split the mixture up into separate glasses, each filled with 1/4 cup of juice. You will also need 1 cup of olive oil separated into four doses of ¼ cup each. Wait until about an hour before you plan to go to bed. Take 1/4 cup of the citrus mixture, followed by 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil. Repeat this process every 15 minutes, until it's time to go to bed. Lay on your right side when you go to sleep.

His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.  He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter.  Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role.  Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word.  He also starred in They Came to Cordura (1959), with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth. Sidney Lumet starred him opposite Sophia Loren in That Kind of Woman (1959).

Help as much as you can. Definition: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraphs, some supporting facts and an answer of a question. Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Input: Context_1 : In mathematics, specifically in local class field theory, the Hasse–Arf theorem is a result concerning jumps of the upper numbering filtration of the Galois group of a finite Galois extension. A special case of it when the residue fields are finite was originally proved by Helmut Hasse, and the general result was proved by Cahit Arf. Context_2 : Cahit Arf (] ; 11 October 1910 – 26 December 1997) was a Turkish mathematician. He is known for the Arf invariant of a quadratic form in characteristic 2 (applied in knot theory and surgery theory) in topology, the Hasse–Arf theorem in ramification theory, Arf semigroups, and Arf rings. Context_3 : Yahya ibn Umar ibn Yahya ibn Husayn ibn Zayd ibn Ali Zayn al-Abidin ibn Al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Murtada was an Alid Imam. His mother was Umm al-Husayn Fatimah bint al-Husayn ibn Abdallah ibn Ismail ibn Abdullah ibn Ja\`far ibn Abī Tālib. In the days of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta'in, he marched out from Kufa and lead an abortive uprising from Kufa in 250 A.H. (864-65 C.E.), but was killed by the Abbasid forces led by Hussain ibn Isma’il, who had been sent to deal with him. Context_4 : Habīb ibn Madhāhir al-Asadi (Arabic: حبيب بن مظاهر الأسدي‎ ‎ ) was of the Banu Asad clan, and one of the companions of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. He was one of the people of Kufa who sent letters to Husayn ibn Ali (grandson of Muhammad) and invited him to Kufa. Though, when he realized that people of Kufa have broken their allegiance to Husayn, he left Kufa, joined Husayn, and was martyred at the age of 75 while fighting in Husayn's army, in Karbala. Context_5 : Bibi Pāk Dāman (Urdu: بی بی پاکدامن) is the mausoleum of Ruqayyah bint Ali located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies from Muhammad's household (Ahl Al-Bayt). Ruqayyah bint Ali ibn Abu Talib was the daughter of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abu Talib with his wife Umm al banin bint Huzaam. Ruqayah bint Ali was the full sister of Al-Abbas ibn Ali and also the wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel (emissary of third Shi'a Imam Husayn ibn Ali to Kufah). Others are said to be Muslim ibn Aqil's sister and daughters. It is said that these ladies came here after the event of the battle of Karbala on the 10th day of the month of Muharram in 61 AH (October 10, AD 680). Bibi Pak Daman, which means the \\"chaste lady\\", is the collective name of the six ladies believed to interred at this mausoleum, though it is also (mistakenly) popularly used to refer to the personage of Ruqayyah bint Ali alone. They were among the women who brought Islam to South Asia, preaching and engaging in missionary activity in the environs of Lahore. It is said that Data Ganj Bakhsh, considered a great Sufi saint of the South Asia, was himself a devotee of the Bibi Pak Daman shrine and received holy knowledge from this auspicious shrine. Context_6 : Abbas (Abbass, Arabic: عباس‎ ‎ means \\"lion\\" in Arabic The name traces back to Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib (an uncle of Muhammad) and Abbas ibn Ali, a son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, who participated in the battle of Karbala alongside his half-brother Hussain ibn Ali. Abbas ibn Ali is revered by Shia Muslims, some of whom are named Abbas in remembrance and tribute to him. There is an Arabian tribe of the same name, the Banu Abbas. In Arabic language it literally means \\"grouchy face\\" or \\"frown\\" referring to a Mean-spirited or a Stern person mainly male. Context_7 : People with the surname Zaidi trace their origins to the Islamic Holy City of Mecca, located in present-day Saudi Arabia. Descendants of Zaid ibn Ali are known as Sayyid, an honorific title bestowed upon to the descendants of Muhammad. The Zaidi surname is derived from Zaid ibn Ali, the son of Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin, who was the great grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. Descendants of Zaid ibn Ali who chose to move away from the Arabian Peninsula and have the surname Zaidi are commonly located in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Context_8 : This is a simplified family tree of Husayn ibn Ali. For the ancestors of ibn Ali see the family tree of Muhammad and the family tree of Ali. People in \\"italics\\" are considered by the majority of Shia and Sunni Muslims to be \\"Ahl al-Bayt\\" (\\"People of the House\\"). Twelver Shia also see the 4th to 12th Imamah as Ahl al-Bayt. \\"(Ali is an imam in Mustaali but no number is assigned for this position, and Hasan ibn Ali is not an imam in Nizari Imamah.)\\" Context_9 : In the mathematical field of knot theory, the Arf invariant of a knot, named after Cahit Arf, is a knot invariant obtained from a quadratic form associated to a Seifert surface. If \\"F\\" is a Seifert surface of a knot, then the homology group H(\\"F\\", Z/2Z) has a quadratic form whose value is the number of full twists mod 2 in a neighborhood of an imbedded circle representing an element of the homology group. The Arf invariant of this quadratic form is the Arf invariant of the knot. Context_10 : He is known to have translated and modified the Zij al-Sindhind. The Zij al-Sindhind was the first astronomical table ever introduced in the Muslim World. As a mathematician Sind ibn ʿAlī was a colleague of al-Khwarizmi and worked closely with Yaqūb ibn Tāriq together they calculated the diameter of the Earth and other astronomical bodies.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself.

Q:Given the below context:  The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a 75-mile (121 km) loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its 9,700 feet (2,957 m) of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add 30 miles (48 km) to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail \\"passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer\\".Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered \\"some of the best hunting land in the state\\".

In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Swaddling is believed to create a tight, warm environment similar to the womb. Even snugly wrapping your little tyke in a blanket and holding them close to your chest should help quickly calm them down. Get them warm and snug and start rocking. You can lay the baby on their side after swaddling. It better mimics the feeling of the womb and calms them faster. Just be sure to maintain constant supervision if you place the baby on their side. A pacifier or your finger is perfect. Sucking actually steadies a baby's heart rate, relaxes their stomach, and calms flailing limbs. This might be the ticket to a quiet, contented infant. If your baby is crying while struggling to fall asleep, you can remind them that you’re there with gentle touch. Lightly pat the baby’s back or rub gentle circles between their shoulder blades. You could even hold their tiny hand in your own. Any of these option can help soothe a baby enough to stop crying. Walk at a slow steady speed. Babies love rhythmic motion, and the lack of light will slowly make them sleepy. If you can, go outdoors—the change to fresh air may help them calm down. Gentle, calming movements are all that matters. Babies love to be touched, so slow, consistent massaging might slow them down and quiet their lungs. Play some peek-a-boo. Lie them on their back and rotate their feet like they were riding a bike. Make silly faces and talk to the child. Just being a distracting, stimulating influence may be enough to get them to stop crying. Babies need to be entertained, so entertain them! If you're out of options, it is time to look for help. The following numbers will help you calm down and provide potential solutions for your exact situation:  24-Hour Parent Helpline: 1-888-435-7553 Crying Baby Hotline: 1-866-243-2229 Fussy Baby Hotline: 1-888-431-BABY If your baby won't stop screaming despite a clean diaper, full belly, and general comfort, you should call your pediatrician for advice. There is no reason to fear anything—but you should verify your specific situation with a professional.  If the crying is high-pitched, random, and the baby seems tense, they may have colic, a crying disorder. Luckily, colic tends to go away by the time your baby is 12-14 weeks old. Note when a baby cries to find patterns—right before a nap, after waking up, after eating certain foods, etc. Pay attention to your baby's signals to prevent future outbursts. Baby's crying usually peaks around 6 weeks, but it eases off afterward.","output":"Swaddling is like wrapping your baby in a cozy blanket to make them feel safe, warm, and calm like they are in mommy's belly. When a baby cries, you can help by holding them, rocking, giving them a pacifier or your finger to suck on, or gently touching them. You can also take them for a walk, give them a soft massage, or play games like peek-a-boo. If the baby still cries a lot, it's okay to ask for help from a doctor or call special phone numbers for advice. Sometimes, babies cry because of something called colic, but it usually goes away when they grow a little older. Always pay attention to when and why your baby cries to learn how to make them happy again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Frank offered to accompany the children , because he wanted to see Aslan himself . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing is the act of restating or rewording a statement or passage to express the same meaning using different words. In both sentences, the essential meaning is the same: Frank wishes to accompany the children to see Aslan personally. Although there are slight variations in the wording and sentence structure, the overall meaning remains unchanged. The first sentence uses \\"proposed\\" while the second sentence uses \\"offered,\\" and the word order is subtly altered between the sentences. However, these differences do not change the main idea being conveyed. Here's a more detailed look at the two sentences: 1. Frank proposed to accompany the children because he wanted to see Aslan himself. - \\"proposed\\" suggests that Frank put forward an idea or plan - \\"accompany the children\\" indicates that Frank wants to go with the children - \\"because he wanted to see Aslan himself\\" explains the reason behind Frank's proposal, which is his own desire to see Aslan 2. Frank offered to accompany the children, because he wanted to see Aslan himself. - \\"offered\\" suggests that Frank is volunteering or willingly suggesting going with the children - \\"accompany the children\\" again shows that Frank wants to be with the children for this activity - \\"because he wanted to see Aslan himself\\" remains consistent in expressing Frank's underlying motivation to see Aslan In summary, despite the minor differences in word choice and structure, both sentences convey the same meaning and can be considered paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states: \\"This fruit market is not busy yet.\\" The hypothesis states: \\"The fruit market isn't busy.\\" Step 2: Compare the information in the premise and hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis suggest that the fruit market is not busy. The main difference between them is the word \\"yet\\" in the premise, which implies that the market might become busy in the future. Step 3: Determine if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true. Since both the premise and the hypothesis indicate that the fruit market is not busy, we can conclude that the information provided in the premise supports the hypothesis.

Step 3: Compare the premise to the hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis describe Beresford doing the same action, speaking or talking. Step 4: Evaluate the options (I) yes: This option suggests that if the premise is true (Beresford is speaking), then so is the hypothesis (Beresford is talking).

Q: The single circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in what, but instead occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell?    Choices:  - atom  - molecules  - protons  - nucleus  A: A:","output":"The single circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus. Instead, it occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell. To provide more detail, bacterial cells lack the membrane-bound organelles typically found in eukaryotic cells, such as the nucleus. Bacterial DNA is not surrounded by a nuclear envelope, which is characteristic of the enclosed DNA chromosomes in eukaryotes. In a bacterial cell, the nucleoid is a region in the cytoplasm where the single, circular DNA chromosome can be found. The nucleoid is not a membrane-bound structure. Instead, it is a dense, irregularly shaped area within the cell where the DNA chromosome, as well as various proteins associated with its organization and maintenance, are found. The bacterial chromosome typically consists of a single, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule. This DNA is organized into a compact structure known as a supercoiled DNA, which allows the chromosome to fit within the small bacterial cell. Various proteins play a vital role in maintaining this supercoiled organization, including DNA gyrase and topoisomerase. Unlike eukaryotic cells, bacteria do not possess histone proteins that aid in the packaging of DNA. However, they do have histone-like proteins called nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) that help condense, fold, and organize the DNA within the nucleoid region. These NAPs aid in various processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, and recombination, that are essential for the bacteria to function and grow properly. In addition to the nucleoid, bacterial cells contain other essential components, such as ribosomes and plasmids. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, whereas plasmids are small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that exist independently of the bacterial chromosome and can carry genes that provide the bacteria with advantageous traits. In summary, the single circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead, it exists within a nucleoid region in the bacterial cell. The nucleoid is a dense area in the cytoplasm where the DNA chromosome and various associated proteins can be found, allowing the bacteria to carry out the necessary processes for growth and survival."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant: The energy from sunlight is absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules in the plant, which is the driving force for photosynthesis. 2. The sunlight's energy is trapped: Chlorophyll molecules trap this energy, which initiates a series of chemical reactions within the plant cell. 3. The plant takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment: The plant absorbs water through its roots and carbon dioxide from the air through small pores on the leaves called stomata. 4. Glucose is formed: Using the energy from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, the plant undergoes a series of chemical reactions to produce glucose (a simple sugar) and oxygen. 5.

(Photo: Jewel Samad, AFP/Getty Images)            FERGUSON, Mo. -- A white police officer will not face charges for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager in a case that set off violent protests and racial unrest throughout the nation.      CLOSE Protestors, angry over the grand jury decision not to indict Michael Brown, take to the streets in cities across the nation.      A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict officer Darren Wilson, 28, for firing six shots in an August confrontation that killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch said Monday night.      Crowds of protesters filled streets near the Ferguson police station following the announcement. A police car and stores were set on fire, other stores were looted, gunfire was heard and bricks were hurled. Police said they had been fired on and responded with smoke bombs and pepper spray before using tear gas.      Police later said they came under heavy automatic weapon fire, and some buildings were left to burn because of the danger. County police said an officer suffered a gunshot wound, but it was unclear if it was because of the protest violence.      Protests sprang up in cities from New York to Los Angeles and remained mostly peaceful. At least half a dozen commercial airline flights into St. Louis were diverted out of concerns about the unrest.      The Federal Aviation Administration at 11:15 p.m. ET said it had restricted flights into and out of Lambert International Airport in St. Louis to \\"provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.\\" The restriction lifts at 5:15 a.m. ET.            The grand jury's decision had been long awaited and followed earlier Ferguson rioting that resembled war-zone news footage in this predominantly black suburb of St. Louis.      PROTESTS: Demonstrators hit streets across nation      FAMILY: Michael Brown's mom screams, sobs at decision      In Washington, President Obama appeared before TV cameras. \\"We need to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make,'' he said in calling for peaceful protests. But Obama said the Ferguson case \\"speaks to broader challenges that we still face as a nation.''      Prosecutor McCulloch made the announcement in an unusual nighttime presentation in a courtroom. He spoke at length about media coverage of the case and what he called the unreliability of eyewitness accounts. He said the grand jury weighed evidence and testimony before concluding there was no probable cause to indict the officer.      \\"The duty of the grand jury is to separate fact from fiction,'' McCulloch said.      He said prosecuting attorneys presented five potential indictments to the grand jury, and all were rejected.      \\"The jury was not inclined to indict on any charges,'' Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said after being informed of the decision by authorities.      In grand jury testimony released by prosecutors Monday night, Wilson, the officer, described the confrontation and said that Brown refused his instructions to stop walking in the street. He said Brown cursed him, then slammed the officer's car door shut as he was trying to exit his vehicle.      He said Brown appeared to be trying \\"almost like to intimidate or overpower me.'' They scuffled and Brown hit the officer, Wilson testified.      \\"When I grabbed him, the only way I can describe it is I felt like a five-year-old holding Hulk Hogan,'' Wilson said.      He had no Taser weapon and felt his mace spray would not work, Wilson said: \\"So the only other option I thought I had was my gun.\\" He drew it, he said, and told Brown to \\"get back or I'm going to shoot you.\\" He said Brown grabbed the gun with his right hand and twisted it, pushing it down into Wilson's hip, before the officer fired.      Brown's family attorneys received a call from McCulloch shortly before the announcement that there would be no charges against the officer. Crump took the call and and delivered the news to Brown's family in an area hotel.      REACTION: Legal and advocacy groups sound off      APOLOGY: Peter King sorry for 'indictment' tweet      Lesley McSpadden, Brown's mother, cried and shouted when Crump told her there was no indictment and that the prosecutor was willilng to meet with the family.      McSpadden began crying and shouting. Her body vibrated with pain as she jumped to her feet.      \\"I do want to meet with him right now,\\" McSpadden screamed. \\"What do you mean no indictment?!\\"      She then ran out of a hotel room followed by family members.      Brown's family later released a statement saying, \\"We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions.'' They urged others who share their pain to \\"channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change.''      Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, called for calm after calling up National Guard troops to stand by in case of unrest. Speaking before the decision was announced, he urged that \\"regardless of the decision, people on all sides show tolerance, mutual respect and restraint.''      Crowds gathered around the Ferguson police headquarters in anticipation of the announcement at the courthouse in Clayton, Mo., another St. Louis suburb.      The 12-person grand jury had been considering whether probable cause existed to bring charges against Wilson, 28, the white officer who fatally shot Brown, an 18-year-old black man, after their Aug. 9 confrontation. The shooting inflamed tensions in a largely minority community that is patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force.      Brown's lifeless and bleeding body lay for more than four hours in a Ferguson residential street after the shooting, prompting dismay and anger as a crowd gathered. Protests turned into rioting and looting the following night, and police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas, triggering a nationwide debate over police tactics.      The grand jury, including nine whites and three African Americans, had been meeting in secret for months, hearing evidence and weighing whether Wilson's should face charges that could have ranged from involuntary manslaughter to murder.      Brown's family joined thousands of protesters to demand Wilson's arrest in the weeks after the death of their son. As anger at official inaction grew following Brown's death, protesters clashed with police, who began patrolling the streets with military-grade weapons and armored vehicles.      Wilson has been on paid leave and largely invisible since the shooting.      While the grand jury met in secret to hear evidence in the case, two starkly different versions of the events leading to the shooting emerged in media accounts.      Police have said a scuffle broke out after Wilson asked Brown and a friend to move out of the street. Wilson told investigators he shot Brown only after the teenager reached for the officer's gun. Some witnesses said Brown had run away from Wilson, then turned and raised his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender before he was shot in the head and chest.

(Photo: Nick Oza, USA TODAY)      The unusual timing of the grand jury's announcement, after darkness had fallen, was a decision of prosecutors, Nixon said.      St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay acknowledged the case \\"has deeply divided us'' but said \\"turning violent or damaging property will not be tolerated.''      \\"The world will be watching us,'' Slay said.      The death of Brown touched off weeks of protests, and the decision by the grand jury on whether to bring charges prompted extraordinary precautions by law enforcement and the community.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about the coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a protÃ©gÃ© of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world. Jake is also financially assisting his mother (Susan Sarandon), who has begun a new career selling real estate. When the recession of 2008 hits, Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he cannot handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company. A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts, then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward. Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton's career to seek revenge for Zabel's suicide. Jake, aided by Gekko, learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In revenge, Jake spreads rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field...

As the frosty chill of winter settled in the air, Jessica noticed that her friend Katrina was shivering, her hands visibly trembling, and her fingers turning an icy shade of blue. Jessica, well-prepared for the winter weather, had brought along a pair of gloves. As much as she would have liked to keep them for herself, she realized that her friend was in dire need of some warmth and comfort. Upon noticing Katrina's discomfort, Jessica's empathy and care for her friend prompted her to take decisive action. So, without a second thought, she removed her gloves, revealing her own hands. Though Jessica had been wearing the gloves to keep her hands warm, she understood that Katrina's need was far greater than hers at that moment. Handing the gloves over to Katrina, Jessica watched as her friend's face lit up with gratitude and relief. Slipping the gloves onto her frostbitten hands, Katrina began to feel the warmth seeping back into her fingers. The gloves were well-insulated, designed to retain heat and shield the hands from the cold winds and harsh elements of winter. As the two friends continued their journey, Katrina's hands began to regain their natural color and dexterity. The act of kindness displayed by Jessica not only provided her friend with the warmth she so desperately needed but also served to strengthen their friendship further. It reminded them both that sometimes, even the smallest acts can make a significant difference in the lives of the people around us. Though option I would suggest that Jessica initially took off the gloves because her hands were cold, it would not make much sense for her to give the gloves to Katrina under that circumstance. Instead, Jessica's altruistic act was motivated by her desire to provide comfort to her friend, making option II the more fitting choice to complete the sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: By of the      Six fake Democratic candidates put up by the Republican Party to buy time for Republican state senators subject to recalls accomplished that job Tuesday, but none of them did the unexpected and knocked off a real Democrat.      Candidates backed by the Democratic Party won all six Senate primary elections, all but one of them by substantial amounts. They'll all go on to face the Republican incumbents on Aug. 9, in an attempt by Democrats to regain control of the state Senate and put the brakes on Gov. Scott Walker's agenda.      That the primaries were held at all is a function of the twists and turns of political strategy played out in recent months as the state broke into warring camps over Walker's attempt to restrict collective bargaining for public employees.      The Republican Party forced the primaries to give its six senators facing recall another four weeks before facing a Democratic challenger, in order to allow them to take their case to the voters and argue that their work on the budget was good for the state.      The winners Tuesday:      Former Brown County Executive Nancy Nusbaum of De Pere defeated Otto Junkermann of Allouez, a one-time Republican state representative and past supporter of Sen. Rob Cowles (R-Allouez).      Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) easily defeated Gladys Huber, a Republican Party stalwart from Mequon. Pasch will face Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills).      Shelly Moore, a teacher and official in the state teachers union from River Falls, defeated Isaac Weix of Menomonie, a hardware store owner and former failed candidate in Republican Party primaries for state Assembly. She'll face Sen. Sheila Harsdorf (R-River Falls) in the general election. Weix did the best of all the Republican-backed candidates.      Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo) defeated Republican Rol Church of Wautoma for the right to face Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon).      Jessica King, former deputy mayor of Oshkosh, defeated John Buckstaff of Oshkosh for the right to face Sen. Randy Hopper (R-Fond du Lac).      Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) defeated James D. Smith, a hospital technician in La Crosse, for the right to face Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse).      State Republican Party officials maintained in the weeks leading up to the primaries that their only purpose in mounting the protest Democrats was to buy time for their candidates.      But there was some activity in the final week to turn out voters for those candidates.      One of the most prominent efforts was in Harsdorf's 10th Senate District, where Jesse Garza, chairman of the St. Croix County Republican Party, sent out an email urging recipients to vote Tuesday, telling them a vote for Weix was the same as a vote for Harsdorf.      Moore was probably the Democrat most vulnerable to this tactic, as she didn't have the name recognition the other Democrats did - all of them having run for or held a major office in their districts.      Calls urging votes for the fake Democrats were reported in three other Senate districts last week - Olsen's, Hopper's and Kapanke's - with a piece of literature sent out in Hopper's. It said voting for protest Democrat Buckstaff over King was a way to express support for Walker.      The primaries set up major faceoffs in the six districts, with national attention on the races, and massive amounts of money and national advertising flowing into the state.      The recalls against the Republicans were launched last March over their backing of Walker's collective bargaining measure.      Democrats call the move an attack on the middle class. Republicans say it was necessary to balance the state's budget, which they accomplished last month.      Political heat will rise      With the final election less than a month away, the heat of that debate is likely to pick up fast.      Already the conservative Club for Growth and a liberal coalition called We Are Wisconsin, supported by contributions from national unions, are active in the state. The conservative Americans for Prosperity, which has been connected with the national tea party movement, is operating a phone bank in Kenosha County this week.      In addition to the outside money, both Democratic challengers and Republican incumbents have substantial campaign war chests of their own - with the most money likely to be spent in Darling's Milwaukee-area district. Darling and Pasch have raised nearly 1.4 million between them, with Darling collecting the lion's share, some 958,000.      There's also what politicians call a strong ground game in operation in many of the districts - plenty of people out knocking on doors.      David Kreisman, Pasch's campaign manager, said campaign representatives have knocked on 20,000 doors in the Senate district since last Friday. We Are Wisconsin is also out in the district.      In a statement after her victory, Pasch said, \\"I am proud that the people of the 8th state Senate District have stood up to the cynical ploys of my opponents.      \\"I look forward to holding honest, insightful debates on the issues with Senator Darling in this summer's recall election.\\"      Conventional wisdom is that Kapanke, who serves an increasingly blue district, and Hopper, whose marital problems have received a wide airing, are the Republicans most vulnerable to being ousted by their Democratic rivals, and that Darling and Cowles are the least likely to fall.      Darling has said she takes the recall election very seriously, and a statement from her Tuesday night says she's proud of her record of balancing the budget without raising taxes.      The recall elections of the six Republicans are just part of the state's unprecedented recall picture.      Democrats facing recalls      Three Democratic state senators also face recall elections, with the first of that voting to start next week.      The recalls of the Democrats were launched in February, after 14 Democratic senators fled the state for three weeks to delay a vote on the collective bargaining measure. Their opponents fault them for leaving their jobs and shirking their duties.      Elections in the recalls of the Democrats are July 19. Two of those races will be Republican primaries; the third, between Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) and Republican challenger David VanderLeest of Green Bay, is a general election.      The other two general elections will be Aug. 16.      All of the recall winners will have to run again in November 2012, at least some of them in districts changed by redistricting.      Meg Jones and Larry Sandler of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report. ||||| All six Wisconsin Democrats won their recall primaries today, easily fending off challenges from “protest” candidates put forward by Republicans to delay the general elections.      All six official Democrats have been projected as winners by the Associated Press. Only one race was at all close, the one between schoolteacher Shelly Moore (D) and 2010 Republican Assembly candidate Issac Weix in the primary to take on Sen. Sheila Harsdorf. Every other Democrat is projected to win by double-digits.      After recall elections were triggered against six Republican state senators over the state’s contentious collective bargaining law, Republicans launched “protest” candidates in each primary to give their incumbents more time to campaign. The general elections were pushed back from today to Aug. 9.      “The voters of Wisconsin have rejected the Republicans’ dirty tricks, despite their best efforts to turn out voters in these primaries for fake candidates,” said Democratic Party spokeswoman Gillian Morris.      In the race to take on Sen. Robert Cowles, former Brown County executive Nancy Nusbaum defeated retired GOP assemblyman Otto Junkerman. In the race to take on Sen. Alberta Darling, state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D) defeated Gladys Huber. In the race to take on Sen. Dan Kapanke, state Rep. Jennifer Schilling defeated young Republican activist James Smith. In the race to take on Sen. Randy Hopper, Deputy Oshkosh Mayor Jessica King (D) defeated retiree John Buckstaff. In the race to take on Sen. Luther Olsen, state Rep. Fred Clark (D) defeated Rollin Church.      Several Republican candidates and local parties were at least hoping for an upset. Wisconsin has open primaries, so it was possible for Republicans to vote for the “protest” candidates in these races. But the state GOP maintained from the outset of the recalls that the only purpose of the “protest” challenges was to delay — not prevent — a race.      “Now that self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives have set 500,000 of taxpayer money on fire in fake primaries that served no purpose beyond their ‘do-anything’ quest to maintain power, voters will have a chance to put the brakes on Scott Walker and his extreme agenda in legitimate elections on August 9th,” said Kelly Steele, a spokesman for the pro-union PAC We Are Wisconsin, in a statement.      Three Democratic state senators also face recalls this summer. Next Tuesday is the general election against state Sen. Dave Hansen (D) and Republican primaries to take on Democratic state Sens. Robert Wirch and Dave Hansen. If Democrats net three wins, they will take back the state Senate. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In recent recall elections, six Republican-backed faux Democratic candidates were defeated by officially endorsed Democratic contenders. The \\"protest\\" candidates were initially put forth as a strategic measure by the Republican party to buy time for the incumbent Republican state senators facing recall to engage with their constituents and argue their case. The winners were former Brown County Executive Nancy Nusbaum, Rep. Sandy Pasch, teacher and union official Shelly Moore, Rep. Fred Clark, former deputy mayor Jessica King, and Rep. Jennifer Shilling.  These winners will face Republican incumbents on August 9 as Democrats aim to regain control of the state Senate and challenge Gov. Scott Walker's agenda. The state is currently divided due to Walker's attempts to limit collective bargaining for public employees, a move causing massive amounts of money and national attention to flow into Wisconsin's political scene.  In addition to the six targeted Republicans, three Democratic state senators are facing recall elections, with voting starting next week. The winners of these recall elections will have to run again in November 2022, possibly in redistricted areas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible A: garage, white house, synagogue, hospital, demonstration  Why is \\"garage\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Garage\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because of the following reasons: 1. Context: The question provides context by mentioning tools and oil cans, which are items commonly associated with mechanic work, repairs, or maintenance activities. 2. Association: Garages are places where people typically perform these mechanic tasks, such as working on vehicles or storing tools and equipment. 3. Relevance: Out of the possible options given (garage, White House, synagogue, hospital, demonstration), a garage has the closest relation to the context of the question. People would not commonly associate tools and oil cans with the other options. 4. Familiarity: Most people have some familiarity with garages as places where tools and oil cans might be found, either from personal experience or media portrayal. 5. Exclusion: By considering each of the other possible answers, we can rule them out due to lack of association with tools and oil cans. The White House is the residence of the U.S. president (political context), synagogues are places of worship (religious context), hospitals are for medical care (healthcare context), and demonstrations are usually public gatherings for expressing opinions (social context).

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie involves several interconnected stories that converge at 11:14 p.m. The connections between the events are not apparent at first, but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding flashbacks:Jack (Henry Thomas), who has been drinking, is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone. The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it's no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she 'never uses' and because she is friends with the chief of police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack, and noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test. Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded. When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the 2 people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) and Buzzy (Hilary Swank), to move over so that Jack will fit. While Hannagan argues with Buzzy, who refuses to move over, Jack is able to pull his pocketknife out of his pocket, cut the cable tie, and escape. Hannagan pursues, leaving the cruiser door open,...

Q:The answer to the question: What nationality does the concentration camp survivor use as a ruse? is inside the article: After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family. Gradually, however, he begins to settle in. Karni finally tracks Hans down and tries to take him into custody. Hans panics again and barricades himself in Ya'el's room with her rifle, but Ya'el and Karni get him to admit he needs help and to give himself up., can you guess it ?

We have: -6123 * h = -4489 * h - 4902 We can think about it like: h multiplied by -6123 must be equal to h multiplied by -4489 minus 4902. To find out the value of h, we first need to get all the parts with h on the same side. So, let's move the -4489 * h to the left. We'll do that by adding 4489 * h (the opposite) to both sides: -6123 * h + 4489 * h = -4902 Now, let's see how many h's we have on the left: (-6123 + 4489) * h = -4902 Which is: -1634 * h = -4902 Next, we need to find the value of h. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -1634: h = -4902 / -1634 When you divide two negative numbers, you get a positive number: h = 3 So there you go! The value of h is 3!

On the positive side, the reviewer gives credit to the bean dip and the queso fundido, highlighting that these items were enjoyable, indicating a positive sentiment in this regard. They express appreciation for these specific dishes and even award two 'stars' for them, which typically conveys approval and satisfaction. However, the majority of the comments lean towards the negative side of the sentiment spectrum. The reviewer conveys dissatisfaction with the price point, suggesting they believe the food is overpriced for the quality and authenticity offered. They also criticize the chilaquiles, a specific dish, labeling it as terrible. Furthermore, the staff are described as not entirely present or attentive, indicating an unsatisfactory service experience. Additionally, the reviewer declares they have never been a fan of the Lindo chains and states that they are consistently disappointed by them. These comments collectively represent a negative sentiment. Also, the use of words like \\"ridiculously high\\", \\"terrible\\", \\"fail\\", \\"disappoint\\" denotes strong negative sentiment towards their experience at this establishment. So, while there are aspects they enjoyed, the negative comments outweigh the positive ones, painting a mixed but overall more negative picture of their sentiment towards the restaurant.  The major emphasis of the review lies in the criticism, therefore one might conclude that the overall sentiment of the review tends towards negativity. Yet, the mention of some positive elements does not allow us to classify the review as entirely negative, hence the mixed sentiment classification. It would be significant for the management of this restaurant to consider both the praised and the criticized elements to improve the overall dining experience and potentially shift the sentiment of such reviews in a more positive direction in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Se emplea como una metáfora para describir la importancia del corazón como un símbolo de amor, comprensión y devoción en nuestras vidas. En este sentido, se puede decir que se llama \\"altar del corazón\\" no sólo porque funciona como una representación simbólica en el ámbito emocional y espiritual, sino también por la experiencia física y sensorial que puede llegar a sentir una persona al tener pensamientos que influyen de manera notable en su estado emocional y espiritual.

However, the hypothesis you mentioned says: \\"Everyone agrees on the known cause of global warming.\\" That's not exactly what they are saying. They're just disagreeing with someone who says we don't understand global warming.

DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit, the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border. There were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co-written by The Wild Bunch's Walon Green, Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Valerie Perrine), Tony Richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then)  but now it doesn't even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption, with Nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism, until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and, sadly, the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original, nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers. While that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low-key Nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film, it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint, then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him, one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooder's beautiful title song, Across the Borderline, says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the film's real crime, it's completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he can't make an impression, you know something's really wrong. All in all, all too easy to remember why I found this so forgettable at the time. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Thomas Lawton was born on 6 October 1919 to Elizabeth Riley and Thomas Lawton senior in Farnworth, Lancashire. His father was a railway signalman of Irish extraction, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents' home in Bolton. Elizabeth's father, James Hugh \\"Jim\\" Riley, became Lawton's surrogate father. Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935, and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the age of 16. After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his \\"keen and fearless\\" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3-1 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935-36 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games.  Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League.

Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other. It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox.

Here are possible answers to this question: - dry mouth - whispering - being heard - eye contact - not listening  I believe the correct choice is \\"not listening\\", here's why: A:","output":"Talking to someone is indeed pointless if they're not listening. Here's why: Communication is a two-way process that involves the exchange of messages between two or more parties and requires both speaking and listening to be effective. When someone is not listening, they are not engaged in the conversation, and mutual understanding becomes difficult or impossible to achieve. Here's a brief analysis of the other options provided: - Dry mouth: While someone with a dry mouth may have difficulty speaking clearly, it does not inherently make communication pointless. The person can still listen and comprehend the other party's message. - Whispering: Although whispering might make it harder to hear the conversation, it doesn't make the exchange pointless. Whispering could be interpreted as a sign of being secretive or discreet, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the person is not engaged in the conversation. - Being heard: This option might create an ambiguous statement. If a person is being heard, it implies that they are talking and someone is listening, making the conversation meaningful. Conversely, if a person cannot be heard, it may hinder effective communication, but it doesn't imply that the person is not listening. - Eye contact: While maintaining eye contact is an essential aspect of non-verbal communication, it does not solely dictate the effectiveness of a conversation. A lack of eye contact may suggest disinterest or distractions, but it doesn't always mean that the individual is not listening to the conversation. In conclusion, out of the given options, \\"not listening\\" is the correct choice because it directly affects the communication process and renders the conversation futile.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The process you've described is a natural process, specifically it is weathering which pertains to the breakdown of rocks due to various environmental factors such as water, temperature changes, and more. On the other side, loading dishes directly into the dishwasher after use is a distinctly separate process that pertains to household chores and hygiene management. In considering these two processes, it may initially be difficult to identify a clear link or influence between them, but for argument's sake, let's delve a little deeper for analysis. The loading of dishes into a dishwasher doesn't seem to have a direct or indirect impact on the weathering process you described. Here's how it impacts, or rather doesn't impact each step: 1. Water seeps into rocks - This part of weathering relies on natural forms of water like rain or groundwater, and not water used within a dishwasher. The water usage in the household doesn't impact the amount of water available to seep into rocks. 2. The water freezes and thaws - This process describes the natural mechanism of temperature variation, which again is not influenced by the action of a dishwasher. A dishwasher might heat and cool internally, but this has no bearing on external temperatures affecting rocks. 3. Cracks form in the rocks - The physical action of the dishwasher doesn't impact rocks in the environment. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The heat produced by a dishwasher is local to the dishwasher itself and won't increase the overall temperature in a way that could speed up the formation of cracks in rocks. 5. The rocks slowly break down - This eventual breakdown is a result of the previous steps, none of which are impacted by the dishwasher operation. The energy or substances used by the dishwasher won't be interacting with rocks in such a way as to hasten their breakdown. In conclusion, loading dishes directly into the dishwasher after use does not seem to have any direct or indirect impact on these steps that lead to weathering. Therefore, the supposed perturbation here would fall under 'not impacting any steps of the process.'  It's crucial to note that while individual actions can have minor environmental impacts, they usually don't influence larger-scale natural processes like weathering, except perhaps in the case of significant environmental disruptions. But in the specific scenario described in your question, loading dishes directly into the dishwasher after use would not accelerate or increase weathering."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Mia De Graaf. Crammed full of dusty syringes, bottled antidotes, and rattling equipment - with a half-smoked pipe on the table - the owner of this doctor's surgery could have just popped out. But in fact it has lain derelict for more than a decade - and gathered a thick layer of dust over the years. Abandoned in mysterious circumstances, the mansion in Virton, Belgium, still has semi-full glasses of wine on the tables, and meticulously ordered equipment in antique glass cabinets smothered in cobwebs. Bygone era: The equipment in this old doctor's surgery in Virton, Belgium, was left in perfect order when it was abandoned in 1980 - despite slight decay. Ghost-like: The doctor's unfinished cigar, glasses and newspaper were left on the table as if he were half-way through his morning reading. French photographer Matti Decaux, 27, who found the home, said: 'This one is a strange for me, as it seems to be part home, part office and part surgery. 'It really felt odd wandering around, as it was as if the owner had just left for a paper and would return at any moment - the only way to tell otherwise was the layer of dust covering the contents of the property. 'The surgery area was very interesting as there was old equipment left behind, and it was all neatly laid out. Historic: The medicines cluttered around the house look ancient compared to our plastic packets today. Syringes and scalpels lie sprawled over glass-topped desks. Not quite the NHS: Patients would recline in a king size bed with plush blue satin sheets and a gold wooden frame facing the open windows. Mysteriously, open bottles and half-filled glasses remain on the tables, with coats slung on the back of the beautiful, velvet chairs. 'But, to be honest, with it being a. multi-use building there was much to see, all of which seemed as though. it was very well cared for when the owner was still there.' Seemingly abandoned at some point in the 1980s, the house in the south of Belgium has been dubbed 'Dr Pepito's mansion' and is made up of three stories - part residential and part surgery. Mr Decaux, 27, says: 'I receive a very mixed reaction from people who see these photographs. 'Some love to see them and hear the tales of what once may have gone on in there. Although, some will just never understand why I find these places interesting. 'I really enjoy capturing places that once were loved but now have been left for Mother Nature to reclaim.' The house has become local legend, with many stories circulated about what could have happened to the family that left without notice or trace. French photographer Matti Decaux discovered a home 'reclaimed by Mother Nature' as he was investigating the myth of 'Dr Pepito's Mansion' Classic: A typical doctor's briefcase gathers dust on a chair in the corner of an office. Memories: Boxes of photographs all over the house span generations, including the family's landmarks events like weddings, births and birthdays.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The average parent will spend £51,000 on their child before their 18th birthday but one mother has decided to spend almost half of that elsewhere. Kerrie Williams,33, has spent over £20,000 on just seven lifelike dolls, while refusing to spend anything but the necessary on her two daughters. Kerrie a mother-of-two from Darlington, Country Durham has spent thousands on clothes, toys and accessories including a £1,000 pram for her collection of 'reborn' dolls. Kerrie Williams has spend £20,000 on her collection of re-born babies. The hyper-realistic toys are made from vinyl and designed to resemble human babies. And they don't come cheap with each doll costing between £150 and £400. Kerrie now owns seven of the dolls, who each have an enviable collection of accessories, and her expensive habit has left her with little spare cash for her two real daughters Karina, 13 and Jade, 12. Kerrie admits that she has to scrimp on what she buys for her daughters in order to spoil her fake babies and that Karina and Jade are becoming increasingly jealous of the attention their mother lavishes on her toys. Kerrie's two daughters Jade (left) and Karina (right) have had to go without new clothes in order to fund their mum's habit. 'My daughters are always asking me for new clothes. I tell them it's a waste of money because they will grow out of them' says Kerrie. The part-time carer's collection of doll's clothes and accessories includes designer labels such as Ralph Lauren and converse. 'Karina wanted a pair of Vans trainers and was furious when I told her I couldn't afford them. 'She gets jealous because I bought the reborns the same pair - but they can wear them forever.' Kerrie began collecting reborn dolls to cope with a miscarriage she suffered in January 2012. She says that her fake babies helped to comfort her when no one else would. 'I was 12 weeks pregnant when I miscarried and I hit rock bottom afterwards. I just desperately wanted another child. As well as the dolls Kerrie has spent thousands of pounds on accessories including clothes, shoes and prams. Kerrie's clothing collection includes designer labels such as Ralph Lauren, Converse and Doctor Martins. 'My daughters were too old for my hugs and attention. They preferred to go out with their friends instead. 'I love my daughters so much, but babies are completely dependent on their mums, and all I wanted was another little one to hold.' The doting mum saw a picture of a reborn on Facebook and instantly fell in love with the child's angelic plastic features and mistook it for an actual baby. 'He had perfect blonde hair and looked so peaceful. All I wanted was to scoop him up in my arms. I was so shocked when I discovered the baby, named Owen, was a reborn. 'He looked so realistic, so I called the manufacturer straight away to place an order.' The first fake addition to Kerrie's family arrived in May 2012, but her daughters and now ex-partner Paul, 35, were unimpressed. Kerrie says that their mother's new interest left the family a little confused. 'I hoped the baby could replace the child we had lost - but instead my family said Owen was weird.' Undeterred, she handpicked another six dolls over the course of the next year - splashing out on Serenity, Wynter, twins Corey and Cody, and vampire babies Lillith and Lilliana. The mum also sold her first reborn, Owen, after deciding he no longer looked realistic when compared to her other dolls. Last December she added a reborn named Till, who was designed to look like the child she lost. Kerrie began collecting the dolls after a miscarriage left her at rock bottom. Kerrie mistook her first doll Owen (pictured) for a real child when she saw a photo on Facebook. Kerrie now has seven of the re-born dolls. Following her purchase of Owen Kerrie picked out a further six dolls over that year including the twins (left), Corey (right) Cody. Kerrie has baby Till designed to look like the child she lost. Kerrie has also purchased two 'vampire babies' complete with fangs Lillian (left) and Lillith (right) 'I provided the designer with my features and Paul's too' says Kerrie who adds that rather than solving her marital issues Till drove her and her partner further apart. 'I hoped Till would bring us closer together, but instead Paul became very uncomfortable with the dolls and banned them from sleeping in our bedroom. 'We split up soon after Till arrived.' Single Kerrie often takes her babies out in one of their four pushchairs, visiting the local park, or ASDA superstore to try on baby clothes. Despite the babies being entirely fake Kerrie says that the public like to interact with them. 'I love getting the babies dressed up and taking them shopping around town with me. 'Most of the time people are lovely to them - they like to ask me how they're getting on.' Occasionally Kerrie is met with harsh criticism from people who find her obsession odd. 'Usually people believe they're real babies unless I tell them otherwise but sometimes I hear strangers laughing at me. 'They taunt the babies and say they look like dead children, but I think my babies are beautiful.' One set of Kerrie's dolls have even began to frighten her daughters as they take the form of a Halloween character. 'I have two vampire babies, named Lillith and Lilliana. The moment I saw them I knew they had to live with me. Kerrie often takes her dolls to the supermarket in their prams and says that many people mistake them for real babies. Kerrie had a doll designed to look just like her eldest daughter Karina (right) but Karina says she thinks it looks scary. Serenity has been designed to look as though she is laughing. 'My daughters find them scary but they're as special to me as real children.' With four moses baskets, four prams and more than 50 pairs of shoes, Kerrie's daughters have had to get used to sharing their home. 'I know the girls are jealous because I've spent twice as much on the babies.' But the reborn addict's plan to help her daughter Karina fall in love with her plastic brothers and sisters failed. Kerrie purchased a new baby, named Saffron, in July designed to look exactly like her eldest daughter, which she hoped would bring the family closer, however Karina was unimpressed. 'I designed a special doll to look just like Karina did as a baby and I hoped she'd bring us closer together as a family. 'But Karina doesn't like her and thinks she's ugly.' However this has not deterred Kerrie who is now in the process of designing her latest doll to look like her younger daughter Jade. Kerrie says that although she spends more on her fake babies they will never be more loved than her actual daughters, however this is not going to stop her spoiling them. 'Reborn babies can never replace how special my real children are, but I still love my dolls - no matter what anyone thinks. 'They're always worth spoiling - babies this perfect are worth every penny.' Although the dolls already take up all the spare room in her house, Kerrie has plans to expand her plastic brood and in December, doll Megan will join the clan. It was her interest in dolls that eventually led to the break down of her marriage with her husband leaving shortly after she bought home Ti. Although Kerrie says that her dolls will never make up for what she lost they have provided her with some comfort when no one else could.

We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams. And a single train can carry goods which no plane or motorcar could ever do. Far from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modern railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey.

Question: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Q: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

Information:  - Siberia is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia. Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 17th century.  - Central Asia or Middle Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north. It is also colloquially referred to as \\"the 'stans\\" (as the six countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix \\"-stan\\", meaning \\"land of\\") and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent.  - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The term is analogous to \\"state\\" or \\"province\\".  - The Bolsheviks, originally also Bolshevists or Bolsheviki (derived from  \\"bol'shinstvo\\", \\"majority\\", literally meaning \\"one of the majority\\") were a faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) which split apart from the Menshevik faction at the Second Party Congress in 1903. The RSDLP was a revolutionary socialist political party formed in 1898 in Minsk(Belarus) to unite the various revolutionary organisations of the Russian Empire into one party.  - The All-Russian Central Executive Committee ((VTsIK)), was the highest legislative, administrative, and revising body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR) from 1917 until 1937. Although the All-Russian Congress of Soviets had supreme authority, in periods between its sessions its powers were passed to VTsIK.  - Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov (known by pseudonyms \\"Andrei\\", \\"Mikhalych\\", \\"Max\\", \\"Smirnov\\", \\"Permyakov\\";  16 March 1919) was a Bolshevik party administrator and chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.  - A dictator is a ruler who wields absolute power. A state ruled by a dictator is called a dictatorship. The word originated as the title of a magistrate in the Roman Republic appointed by the Senate to rule the republic in times of emergency (see Roman dictator and \\"justitium\\").  - Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel or Vrangel (\\"Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Vrangel\\" April 25, 1928) was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later commanding general of the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Southern Russia in the later stages of the Russian Civil War. After his side lost the civil war in 1920, he left Russia and became one of the most prominent exiled White émigrés.  - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.  - The Green armies, Green Army (Russian: \\" \\"), or Greens (Russian: \\"\\") were armed peasant groups which fought against all governments in the Russian Civil War of 191722. They fought to protect their communities from requisitions or reprisals carried out by third parties. At times associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (by far the largest grouping of the Russian Constituent Assembly elected in 1917), the Green Armies had at least tacit support throughout much of Russia. However, the Green Armies' primary base, the peasantry, were largely reluctant to wage an active campaign during the Russian Civil War. Its strength during the civil war has been measured at 40,000 men.  - An uyezd was an administrative subdivision of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Russian Empire, and the early Russian SFSR, which was in use from the 13th century. For most of Russian history, uyezds were a secondary-level of administrative division.  - Secret police (sometimes called political police) are intelligence services or police and law enforcement agencies which operate in secrecy. Therefore, they have little to no transparency, accountability or oversight. A secret police organization is often used beyond the law by totalitarian states to protect the political power of an individual dictator or an authoritarian (autocratic) political regime.  - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin (  21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets. The new government called elections for the Constituent Assembly and...  - The Red Terror was a campaign of mass killings , torture , and systematic oppression conducted by the Bolsheviks after they seized power in Petrograd and Moscow in 1917 . Soviet historiography describes the Red Terror as having been officially announced in September 1918 by Yakov Sverdlov and ending about October 1918 . However , the term was frequently applied to political repression during the whole period of the Russian Civil War of 1918 -- 1922 . The Cheka ( the Bolshevik secret police ) conducted the mass repressions . Estimates for the total number of people killed in the Red Terror range from 50,000 to 140,000 to over one and a half million .  - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Cheka (    \\"chrezvychaynaya komissiya\\", Emergency Committee) was the first of a succession of Soviet state security organizations. It was created on December 20, 1917, after a decree issued by Vladimir Lenin, and was subsequently led by Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat turned communist. By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had been created in various cities, at multiple levels including: oblast, guberniya (\\"Gubcheks\\"), raion, uyezd, and volost Chekas, with Raion and Volost Extraordinary Commissioners. After 1922, Cheka groups underwent a series of reorganizations, with the NKVD, into bodies whose members continued to be referred to as \\"Chekisty\\" (Chekists) into the late 1980s.

What went so wrong with Trump sons that they could kill this beautiful creature pic.twitter.com/L1gquLQrRz — mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) May 13, 2015 In the heat of the campaign – and during a particularly brutal week for their father — Donald Trump’s two sons suddenly disappeared. Donald Jr. and Eric, according to reports, left the country on a hunting trip. Beyond that, curiously little is known. Bloomberg Politics reported that the trip was a fundraiser for a foundation run by family members of Tyrone Woods, a Navy SEAL slain in the Benghazi, Libya, attack. Various political reporters heard that they fled to the Yukon, a favorite hunting location of Donald Jr. He then posted an Instagram photo of himself with his son, which showed them in Canada for a “Father son trip” — but in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The campaign didn’t respond to requests for more information. Their media silence could very well be just mean they’re on a needed vacation. But it could also be a way to dodge the uncomfortable subject of the Trump sons’ well-documented love of hunting — a subject that stalks them on social media like one of the very large predators they have killed for sport. [The death of Cecil the lion and the big business of big game trophy hunting] It all started in 2012, when photos of the sons with big-game trophies leaked to an animal rights group, and then exploded on social media. Gothamist reported that the photos showed the men posing with “a dead elephant, kudu, civet cat and waterbuck while on a big game safari in Zimbabwe.” In one shot, Gothamist said, “Donald Jr. proudly holds a dead elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other. In another, the brothers are seen standing beside a 12’8″ crocodile hanging from a noose off a tree.” It was a time when big-game hunting became a fresh cause for social media shaming (see GoDaddy CEO Bob Parsons, and his notorious elephant video). The photos have regularly resurfaced ever since. The GOP.

They outfitted journalists in camo and took them on pheasant hunts in Iowa, where the sport remains popular. That possibly humanized the Trumps, making them seem less Cartier, more Carhartt. [Hunting pheasants with the Trump sons] Still, a November Marist poll showed that Americans are nearly split when it comes to hunting animals for sport — 56 percent said they oppose it — and they are particularly against big-game hunting. Eighty-six percent of respondents said they disapprove of it, and six out of 10 said they believe it should be illegal. Donald Jr. spoke in exhaustive detail about his love of hunting for the enthusiast site Bowsite earlier in the year. He explained that he learned to hunt as a boy from his maternal grandfather during summers spent in Czechoslovakia. He said he has been an active hunter throughout his life, that his preferred form is bowhunting, and that he frequently employs it during the weekends to hunt whitetail deer in New York. “Almost every weekend I’m out doing something,” he said. He talked of hunting not just as a pastime, but as an important influence on his character. “I owe the outdoors way too much to try to do the usual apologize and hide thing,” Trump Jr. said. “It’s kept me out of a lot of other trouble I probably would’ve gotten into.” What might the Trumps be hunting in Canada? “Caribou, moose, muskox, bison, wolves, polar bears, grizzly bears, black bears and Dall’s sheep” are all available to hunt, with the proper licenses. But so far, they’re keeping quiet about it. Possibly, in our post-Cecil the Lion era, they sense it as too big of a political weakness. If it is, then Hillary Clinton has already picked up on the scent. When animal rights protesters interrupted a speech Thursday, she didn’t seem to miss a step. “Apparently, these people are here to protest Trump,” she said. “Because Trump and his kids have killed a lot of animals, so thank you for making that point.” Secret Service agents surrounded Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after animal-rights protesters created a disturbance at a rally in Las Vegas on Aug. 4. Clinton later joked the protesters must be looking for Republican rival Donald Trump's children, who are currently on a hunting trip.

When students were reading S.E. Hinton's novel in their regular classroom, Peterson helped them write a 30-minute play with scenes from the book. Then they chose three Broadway tunes that focused on race, equality and social justice, the themes of the book. Peterson composed two other sons herself after classroom discussions about the play and the book. The honor means a lot to residents of Granie Falls. It's inspiring to know that people from small towns can even win national honors. As national teacher of the year, Peterson will spend the next year outside classroom, as a national and international spokeswoman for education. Not surprisingly, she is a big believer in the value of arts education. She said it's essential for schools to offer classes such as art or music and physical education because for some kids one of those subjects is the only thing that motivates them to come back to school day after day.

I threw the glass against the wall and it broke because the","output":"force of my throw was too great for the fragile material to withstand. The shattering sound echoed throughout the dimly lit room, reminding me of the severity of my anger and desperation. A kaleidoscope of emotions washed over me, piercing like the very shards of glass that now lay scattered across the cold, wooden floor. As I stared at the wreckage, I could feel the heat rushing through my veins, the adrenaline surging through my body, and the tempest of my anguish swirling uncontrollably within me. My thoughts turned to the source of my pain – the relentless, inescapable misery that had left me shattered, just like the remnants of the glass in front of me. It started off subtly, an insidious force creeping into my life without my even noticing it. A word, a glance, a careless action or inaction – that's all it took for the roots of despair to start embedding themselves within my very being. Gradually, it infiltrated every aspect of my life, tainting everything with its darkness. My once vibrant relationships, the simple joys of everyday adventures, even the quiet sanctuary of my most introspective moments – everything had been contaminated by this pervasive sense of hopelessness, self-doubt, and unyielding sorrow. Seeking solace, I tried reaching out, confiding in those I trusted most. But their words failed to penetrate the impenetrable fortress I had built around myself. Their understanding, their sympathy – it was all like a predesigned script they were playing out, and I was left feeling even more isolated and misunderstood. I couldn't blame them, though. How could they possibly fathom the sheer breadth and depth of the darkness that had taken hold of me? It was then I realized the futility of my attempts to find relief. There would be no comforting embrace to save me from my demons, no enlightening words to chase away the shadowy fog of desolation. I was adrift in a churning sea of torment, spiraling deeper and deeper into the abyss with no lifeline in sight. The breaking point came on a night much like any other, my heart heavy with the weight of unexpressed emotion. It was then when I found myself staring at the empty glass beside me, and the culmination of all my repressed anger and pain propelled me into violent action. The shards of glass now before me were a tangible reflection of my fragmented soul. In that moment, something within me shifted. The echoing sound of the shattering glass seemed to slice through the oppressive silence that had defined my existence for so long. Amid the chaos and ruin, a sliver of clarity dawned on me. Perhaps the destruction of the glass was not just a physical manifestation of my emotions but was also symbolic of something more significant – a catalyst for change, for healing. Could I dare to believe that beneath the broken shards of what once was, there lay the potential for growth and transformation? That maybe it wasn't too late to rebuild and reshape my world, my perceptions, and myself? Only time would tell. But as I stood amidst the wreckage, a mix of trepidation and cautious hope coursing through me, I resolved to salvage the shattered pieces of my being and strive to forge a new way forward.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Scientists are closely concerned with the structure of buildings and with the quality of building materials. The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation   measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation   products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important.   Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde  . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air.   Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible  fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material. As early as 1931, however, public health officers in the prefix = st1 /United Kingdomrevealed the connection between breathing in asbestos dust and such diseases as lung cancer.   The land on which a building is sited may also contribute to pollution. Some kinds of granite or similar rocks contain traces of radium. As it breaks down, this naturally radioactive element produces some kind of radioactive gas that goes through tiny cracks in walls, floors and building materials, and makes its way into the building and the rooms. The better the homes are insulated, the more is the dangerous gas in indoor air. The main effect of this dangerous gas on health is to increase the risk of lung cancer. Question: Why should we be careful about the land on which a building is to be sited? - To determine whether the land is firm enough for a building to be sited on. - To make sure that the land contains no radioactive material. - To make certain that the land releases no formaldehyde or other gases. - To check whether it contains any combustible materials.","output":"We should be careful about the land on which a building is to be sited to make sure that the land contains no radioactive material.

Rod Daily announced via Twitter that he had tested positive for HIV. less than two weeks after Bay made her announcement, he advocated for. further precautions to be taken. 'Drumroll. please!!

The group said it could not yet confirm whether Daily truly had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, but it warned his partners to be tested. The Free Speech Coalition were the ones to confirm on August 22 that the actress who goes by the name of Cameron Bay was also infected with HIV. Daily has been linked romantically to Bay on the adult film industry website XBiz.com. California Assemblyman Isadore Hall, who has been trying for months to get a bill passed in the state Assembly mandating the use of condoms in sex scenes, said Daily's reported infection shows the need for such a regulation. 'This is the second individual within a week and a half to contract HIV in the industry,' said Hall, a Democrat. 'There will probably be more.' The multibillion-dollar adult film industry is centered in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. Distraught: Cameron Bay's agent says his client, whose recent HIV diagnosis has brought the porn industry to a standstill, is 'distraught' over the news. Risk: Xander Corvus, left, who played Weiner in. the movie with Sydney Leathers, had unprotected sex with Cameron Bay,. right, a few weeks ago - who has just been told she has HIV. Debut: Sydney Leathers porn movie was released yesterday where she stars alongside Xander Corvus. The industry has vigorously opposed. efforts to require condom use on set, protesting against a 2012. voter-approved measure requiring condoms to be used in Los Angeles. County and successfully arguing against an earlier effort for such. regulation at the state level that would be specifically geared to film. productions. The Free Speech. Coalition said in an email to Reuters that Daily acted in gay and. transsexual sex movies in which condoms were used. After Bay tested positive, production was shut down for about a week. Medical signs: Daily said that the test suggests he contracted HIV in the past month. But as of early evening on Tuesday, no order to cease shooting sex scenes had been issued. In. a series of Twitter postings, Daily cited this brief moratorium as an. example of how the industry is unwilling to change- to the detriment of. it's actors. 'That does not change anything though. A week later people are back at it shooting without condoms. 'I have also learned that people can be so well medicated that they test negative. Scary, the test everyone relies on. 'Magic Johnson has HIV, and can infect other people but his test comes up negative. Is that so impossible for anyone else to do the same? NO. 'Just sayin be careful because that test ain't shit without a condom strapped up with it.' Daily appears to be taking a positive approach to the news, staying optimistic by saying: 'Had to pinch myself a few times no doubt. But the sun still shines on my face and its warm. Can't take my heart ever. I love life, blessed.' 'I felt bad for the guy who had to read me my first test result. His face turned to stone, I wanted to give him a hug and say it will be ok.' Bay's scare resonated outside of the porn industry, as it was revealed that she had recently had sex with the male performer who later appeared in a video starring Sydney Leathers, disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting partner.","output":"A third adult entertainment performer has tested positive for HIV, increasing concerns over an outbreak among the industry. Two other stars, Cameron Bay and Rod Daily, have publicly announced their positive diagnoses, while the third individual remains anonymous. According to Radar Online, around a dozen female performers have been quarantined following the third case, which has renewed concerns for the health of porn stars. Rod Daily, aged 32, revealed his diagnosis of acute HIV on Twitter, indicating a recent infection. He urged further precautions to be taken in the industry. A trade group representing pornographic film producers in Los Angeles, the Free Speech Coalition, advised that any of Daily's sexual partners be tested, though did not call for a film production moratorium. The Coalition had previously confirmed fellow performer Cameron Bay's HIV infection on August 22. California Assemblyman Isadore Hall, advocating for the use of condoms in adult films, stated that further cases may arise. The industry has resisted efforts to require condom use on set, and production continues despite Bay testing positive. Rod Daily calls for greater caution and condom use in response to the flawed HIV tests that other infected stars have passed."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage  \\"Not all of these cultural elements characteristic of the Neolithic appeared everywhere in the same order: the earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery.

As he helped the Queen to open the new British Embassy in Berlin in 2000, the royal was memorably overheard describing the building as 'ghastly'. Now the Duke of Edinburgh is set to make a return to the city - and the embassy -  after Buckingham Palace announced that the prince  will travel with the Queen to Germany this summer. The tour, which will be the Queen's first to the country since 2004, follows an invitation from President Joachim Gauck, a former East German dissident. On her travels: Buckingham Palace has announced that the Queen and Prince Philip will visit Germany. Visit: The Queen's last visit abroad was in June 2014 when she made a state visit to France. Remembrance: The visit was to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy Landings on the 6th June 1944. Mr Gauck and his partner, Daniela Schadt, were the guests of the Queen and Duke at a lunch at Buckingham Palace in November 2012. Buckingham Palace said in a short statement: 'The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will make a state visit to the Federal Republic of Germany from 24 to 26 June. 'Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Joachim Gauck.' The tour will be the first international visit undertaken by the 88-year-old monarch since the state visit to France for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings last year. Meeting: The Queen was invited by President Gauck (left) but is likely to meet with Chancellor Merkel as well. Regular visitor: The Queen, who last travelled to Germany in 2004, has made several visits to the country. Warm welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip wave to well-wishers in Potsdam during their 1992 visit. Partition: The Queen also visited during the Cold War in 1978, at the request of then President Walter Scheel. First trip: The Queen travelled to West Germany 10 years after the end of WW2. She is seen here in Stuttgart. During that trip, the Queen took part in a ceremony at Sword Beach, the scene of 683 British deaths, alongside David Cameron, Germany's Chancellor Merkel and President Obama. She also took the opportunity to reiterate her admiration for the men who fought during the Normandy campaign during a speech at the Élysée Palace, telling France's President Hollande:. ‘The true measure of all our actions is how long the good in them last. Each year has compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War. 'Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in 700 years as they do after 70.' Her Majesty has remained in the UK since returning from that visit, although the Duke of Edinburgh has made several trips to the Athlone Barracks in the German village of Sennelager near Paderborn. Regular visitor: The Duke of Edinburgh regularly visits the Athlone Barracks and the Queen's Royal Hussars. Colonel-in-chief: He last visited the regiment in November and handed out Afghanistan campaign medals. Meeting: Angela Merkel is likely to meet the royal couple and last met the Queen in February 2014 in London. His most recent trip was in November, when he welcomed home members of the Queen's Royal Hussars, who were among the last soldiers to leave Afghanistan. Prince Philip is the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief and regularly visits the men, as well as handing out combat medals to veterans. While it is not known whether a visit to the Barracks will be included in the itinerary for June's tour, a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel is almost certain. The 60-year-old politician has met the Queen several times, most recently during a state visit to Britain that she made in February 2014. Welcomed by the monarch to Buckingham Palace, the German premier offered Her Majesty an awkward handshake in front of the cameras before being whisked away for a private afternoon tea. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In 2000, Prince Philip made headlines when he referred to the new British Embassy in Berlin as \\"ghastly\\" during its official opening with Queen Elizabeth II.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person's water has molecules moving faster?  Hint: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

I heard that Kai went back to my house to find their wallet, but it wasn't there.  And I was wondering How would Kai feel afterwards? Pick from: i. afraid his wallet was stolen; ii. kind of excited; iii. somewhat worried; Answer:","output":"Kai would likely feel somewhat worried after searching your house and not finding their wallet. This is because wallet misplacement can lead to various concerns and potential complications. Firstly, a wallet typically contains a person's essential personal identification, such as driver's licenses, ID cards, or passports. Losing track of these items may make it much more difficult for a person to prove their identity when required to do so. Additionally, replacing these documents can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Consequently, Kai's inability to locate their wallet might intensify their concerns about undergoing these processes. Secondly, a wallet usually stores financial information, credit and debit cards, or cash. If Kai's wallet has gone missing, they may worry about being left without immediate access to funds. This could have a large impact on their short-term ability to make purchases, go out to eat, or pay their bills. Moreover, once they realize the wallet is missing, they will have to shoulder the responsibility of contacting banks and credit card companies to cancel their cards and protect their accounts from potential fraudulent transactions. Lastly, sentimental items may also be kept in wallets, such as photos, notes, or small tokens. Losing irreplaceable personal mementos is disconcerting and might add an emotional component to Kai's concerns. While Kai may experience varying degrees of stress depending on the contents of their wallet, it's reasonable to assume that their current emotional state would be characterized by some worry. Rather than immediate fear or excitement, they would probably remain vigilant and continue their search while hoping that the wallet resurfaces or hasn't been stolen.

Throngs of demonstrators filled Barcelona's streets Tuesday in a regional independence protest fueled by Spain's economic crisis. September 11 is known as Catalonia's national day, and for years there have been demonstrations pushing for independence in the northeastern region. But Tuesday's turnout was larger than expected, Spanish newspapers reported. Hours before, Artur Mas, the president of Catalonia's regional government, attended official ceremonies commemorating the day. Later, he issued a warning: if Spain's central government in Madrid doesn't give the region more control over its tax dollars, independence could be an option. \\"If we do not reach a financial agreement with the central government, the path to freedom for Catalonia is open,\\" he said. \\"If you compare the money we send to Madrid every year and the money we get back from OPTIONS: - Artur Mas, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Barcelona, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Catalonia, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Madrid, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Spain, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Spanish, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June.","output":"Spain, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. This discontent over the allocation of tax dollars has long been an issue between Catalonia and the central government. Pro-independence politicians argue that the region contributes more to the Spanish economy than it receives in return, and they believe that Catalans should have more control over their own resources. The heightened pressure from the economic crisis has only amplified these grievances. In response to the massive demonstrations, the central government in Madrid called for dialogue with Catalonia's regional government. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy expressed a willingness to discuss the region's fiscal grievances but maintained that constitutional changes would be necessary for any alterations to the current system. However, the pro-independence movement has grown increasingly skeptical of Madrid's willingness to engage in meaningful negotiations. As a consequence, Catalonia's regional government announced plans to hold a referendum on independence from Spain in the following months, further escalating tensions between the two sides. This move alarmed both the European Union and the Spanish central government, who warned against any unilateral actions that might endanger regional stability and European integration. In the lead-up to the referendum, the central government continued to emphasize the importance of unity and negotiation, employing legal challenges and political pressure to try to block the vote. On the other hand, pro-independence leaders in Catalonia remained undeterred, framing the referendum as a fundamental expression of democratic rights. Ultimately, the clash between the central government and Catalonia resulted in a controversial and contested vote, with both sides claiming victory in their respective narratives. While the immediate outcome remained uncertain, what was clear was that the tensions between Catalonia and Madrid would persist, further complicating the broader economic and political landscape in Spain and the European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is?","output":"Blue Castello cheese, also known as Castello Danish Blue or simply Castello Blue, is made in Denmark. Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe, known for its highly skilled dairy industry, rich history, and delicious cheeses.  The history of Blue Castello dates back to the early 20th century when Danish cheesemaker Rasmus Tholstrup established his first dairy in the village of Fåborg. In 1969, Rasmus's grandson, Erik Tholstrup Michael, created the Blue Castello cheese, which quickly gained popularity for its unique taste and texture. Nowadays, Blue Castello is produced by Arla Foods, a prominent dairy cooperative in Denmark. Blue Castello cheese is a mild, creamy, and slightly tangy blue cheese made from cow's milk. The cheese is characterized by its soft and crumbly texture, distinctive blue-green veins due to the presence of Penicillium Roqueforti, and an edible mold rind. The flavor profile of Blue Castello is a perfect balance of creaminess and mild pungency, making it a favorite among blue cheese lovers and those who are new to the world of blue cheeses. In terms of pairing, Blue Castello is versatile and can be paired with various food items and beverages. It goes well with fresh fruits like apples, pears, and grapes, as well as dried fruits like figs and apricots. Bread and crackers also make excellent accompaniments for this cheese. To complement the flavors of Blue Castello, one can pair it with sweet dessert wines, full-bodied red wines, and even beers such as Porters and Stouts. In conclusion, Blue Castello cheese is a delectable and flavorful Danish blue cheese created in the 1960s and is a testament to the rich dairy traditions of Denmark. Its balanced taste, creamy texture, and stunning look make it a popular choice for cheese enthusiasts and a proud representation of Danish cheese craftsmanship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  and the situation: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Answer the following question: Which group of larvae had more somatic mutations? Answer:","output":"Group L had more somatic mutations, as they displayed all kinds of mutations while group D did not show any mutations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Bees first secure the perfect spot, such as hollow areas of trees - Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells -   Question: suppose an ideal spot is not found happens, how will it affect more honey is produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If an ideal spot is not found for a hive, it can lead to less honey being produced. The reason for this is that bees require a suitable, well-protected environment to store nectar and pollen, as well as to raise their young. In an unsuitable location, the bees may be more exposed to predators and harsh weather conditions, which can affect their ability to collect nectar and properly maintain the hive. Since the second effect mentioned is about worker bees continuing to chew and soften wax from within, the perturbation of not finding an ideal spot might have a negative impact on this process as well. Bees might have to spend more time and energy on maintaining the hive and defending it against threats rather than focusing on these essential tasks. As a result, there might be less chewed-up wax available for hive expansion, which could further limit honey storage capacity and lead to even less honey being produced. In summary, if bees do not find an ideal spot for their hive, it can lead to less honey being produced and negatively affect the process of worker bees chewing and softening wax for hive expansion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

The text describes corn smut as a plant disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis, which affects maize and teosinte plants. While the fungus causes damage to the corn plant by forming galls on all above-ground parts, it has been utilized as a culinary ingredient for centuries in Mexican cuisine.  The fungus is commonly known in Mexico as huitlacoche or \\"corn truffle,\\" and it is considered a delicacy. Its flavor is described as earthy, sweet, and savory, with some people likening it to mushrooms. Due to its distinctive taste, huitlacoche is sought after and used as a filling in various traditional Mexican dishes like quesadillas, tacos, tamales, and other tortilla-based foods. It can also be incorporated into soups, adding an extra layer of flavor and texture.  The popularity of huitlacoche is not limited to Mexico, as interest in using unique and exotic ingredients in the culinary world has grown in recent years. Chefs and foodies worldwide have started experimenting with this edible fungus, incorporating it into both traditional and fusion recipes. In addition to its culinary appeal, huitlacoche also offers nutritional benefits. It contains essential amino acids (lysine, tryptophan, and methionine), minerals (specifically potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc), and vitamins (B1, B2, B3, and B6). This makes huitlacoche a valuable addition to a healthy diet.  Therefore, it is accurate to say that some people like to eat the fungus that grows on corn, as evidenced by its longstanding use in Mexican cuisine and its growing popularity worldwide.

The narrow passage, carefully constructed to give a sense of mystery and adventure, was now casting elongated shadows as the sun started to set. Magi Locke and the group proceeded cautiously, curious about the urgent announcement and the reason behind the assembly. The northern part of the grounds was known for its beautifully crafted gardens and carefully pruned tree sculptures. It was a place cherished by the school members as a calming sanctuary. The maze that now lay before them only added to the students' excitement. The intricate web of plants was an architectural wonder, designed to guide those who entered it towards enlightenment and self-discovery.  As they passed through the maze, they couldn't help but marvel at the dazzling variety of plant life that surrounded them. Many of these plants were actually rare magical flora, collected from all corners of the world. There were Whispering Willows whose leaves softly hummed melodies, and the ever-popular Glittering Gladiolas that emitted a soft, shimmering glow at twilight. This unique collection of plants was a testimony to the school's dedication to preserving magic in all its forms. Upon reaching the side entrance of the main building, Magi Locke paused for a moment to catch his breath. His face was etched with worry, as the announcement through the loudspeakers had been abrupt and out of the ordinary. The group exchanged uneasy glances before following Magi Locke into the building. The corridors echoed with the distant footsteps of faculty and students alike, all hurrying towards the main audience hall. The main audience hall itself was an architectural marvel, designed to accommodate the entire school population. The grand room boasted high, vaulted ceilings adorned with stunning murals depicting the history of magic. Beautifully carved wooden benches, reminiscent of great oak trees, stood in neat rows, waiting to be filled by the school's inhabitants. At the far end of the hall, a grand stage made of polished marble silently awaited the bearer of news. As the hall filled with the chatter of curious faculty and students, Magi Locke guided the group to their designated seats. The air was thick with anticipation, and whispers reverberated as everyone tried to guess the purpose of this unexpected assembly. Some wondered if it was related to a magical discovery, while others speculated that a prominent figure was planning to visit the school. Regardless of what the rest of the students thought, Magi Locke's frown grew deeper, revealing his fears that the news might not be positive. Finally, when everyone had taken their seats, the headmaster stepped onto the stage. His tall, imposing figure, coupled with his traditional, ornate robes, silenced the chatter in the room almost instantly. With a solemn expression, he began to speak, addressing the concerns that flickered like a quiet flame in the hearts of everyone in the audience hall. His strong, resonant voice filled the space, and the entire school held their collective breath, waiting to hear the news that had interrupted their daily lives so unexpectedly. And so began the pivotal moment when Magi Locke, the students, and faculty would be faced with an unforeseen challenge, one that would test their resilience and magic as never before.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site.

Background: Joe Tex was born Joseph Arrington, Jr. in Rogers, Texas, in Bell County to Joseph Arrington and Cherie Sue (Jackson) Arrington. He and his sister Mary Sue were initially raised by their grandmother, Mary Richardson. After their parents divorced, Cheri Arrington moved to Baytown. Tex played baritone saxophone in the high-school band and sang in a local Pentecostal church choir. Context: Tex recorded his first hit, \\"Hold On To What You've Got\\", in November 1964 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He was unconvinced the song would be a hit and advised Killen not to release it. However, Killen felt otherwise and released the song in early 1965. By the time Tex got wind of its release, the song had already sold 200,000 copies. The song eventually peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Tex's first number-one hit on the R&B charts, staying on the charts for 11 weeks and selling more than a million copies by 1966.  Tex placed six top-40 charted singles on the R&B charts in 1965 alone, including two more number-one hits, \\"I Want To (Do Everything For You)\\" and \\"A Sweet Woman Like You\\". He followed that with two successive albums, Hold On To What You've Got and The New Boss. He placed more R&B hits than any artist, including his rival James Brown. In 1966, five more singles entered the top 40 on the R&B charts, including \\"The Love You Save\\" and \\"S.Y.S.L.J.F.M.\\" or \\"The Letter Song\\", which was an answer song to Wilson Pickett's \\"634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)\\".  His 1967 hits included \\"Show Me\\", which became an often-covered tune for British rock artists and later some country and pop artists, and his second million-selling hit, \\"Skinny Legs and All\\". The latter song, released off Tex's pseudo-live album, Live and Lively, stayed on the charts for 15 weeks and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in January 1968. After leaving Atlantic for Mercury, Tex had several more R&B hits including \\"Buying a Book\\" in 1970 and \\"Give the Baby Anything the Baby Wants\\" in 1971. The intro saxophone riffs in his 1969 song, \\"You're Right, Ray Charles\\" later influenced Funkadelic's \\"Standing on the Verge of Gettin' It On\\".  Tex recorded his next big hit, \\"I Gotcha\\", in December 1971. The song was released in January 1972 and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks, staying at number two on the Hot 100 for two weeks and sold more than 2 million copies, becoming his biggest-selling hit to date. Tex was offered a gold disc of the song on March 22, 1972. The parent album reached number 17 on the pop albums chart. Following this and another album, Tex announced his retirement from show business in September 1972 to pursue life as a minister for Islam. Tex returned to his music career following the death of Elijah Muhammad in 1975, releasing the top-40 R&B hit, \\"Under Your Powerful Love\\". His last hit, \\"Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)\\", was released in 1977 and peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100 and number 2 in the UK.  His last public appearances were as part of a revised 1980s version of the Soul Clan in 1981. After that, Tex withdrew from public life, settling at his ranch in Navasota, Texas, and watching football games by his favorite team, the Houston Oilers. Question: Did the song do well for him? Answer:","output":"Yes, the song \\"Hold On To What You've Got\\" did very well for Joe Tex. It became his first number-one hit on the R&B charts, peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, stayed on the charts for 11 weeks, and sold more than a million copies by 1966."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to find the longest common subsequence in the lists A and B. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Here's how to approach the task: 1. Understand the given lists:    List A: ['u', 3629, 'A', 2837, 'i', 'd', 'Z', 'y', 421, 'N', 'L', 6323, 'n', 567, 3387, ...]    List B: ['U', 'c', 8073, 5143, 'i', 7461, 3821, 'g', '9019', 'p', 'V', '6489', 'v', '6153', ...] 2. Recognize that you're looking for the longest common subsequence in both lists, which means you need to find the largest set of elements that appear in the same order in both lists. 3. To do this, you can use a dynamic programming approach that compares elements in both lists and keeps track of the longest subsequence found so far in a matrix. Here are simple steps to find the answer: Step 1: Create an empty matrix with dimensions (length of List A + 1) x (length of List B + 1). Step 2: Iterate through each element in List A (rows) and List B (columns). Step 3: For each element, compare if the current elements in both lists are the same. Step 4: If the elements are the same, fill in the current cell in the matrix with the value of the previous diagonal cell incremented by 1. Step 5: If the elements are not the same, fill in the current cell in the matrix with the maximum value between the cell above and the cell to the left. Step 6: Continue iterating through the lists and filling the matrix until all elements are compared. Step 7: The final cell in the matrix (bottom-right) will hold the length of the longest common subsequence. Step 8: To find the actual subsequence, backtrack from the bottom-right cell of the filled matrix going either upwards, diagonally-up-left, or left depending on the cell values. Step 9: When backtracking diagonally-up-left, append the current element from List A or List B (since they are the same) to the common subsequence. Step 10: Continue this backtracking process until you reach the first row or column in the matrix. Step 11: The collected elements during backtracking will form the longest common subsequence. Make sure to reverse the order of the collected elements to obtain the correct subsequence.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

To do this, we need to subtract 266*i from both sides: (189 * i - 1968) - 266 * i = (266 * i + 958) - 266 * i Simplifying the equation, we get: 189 * i - 266 * i - 1968 = 958 Step 2: Combine 'i' terms on the left side: (189 - 266) * i - 1968 = 958 which simplifies to: -77 * i - 1968 = 958 Step 3: Move constant terms to the right side of the equation. To do this, we need to add 1968 to both sides: -77 * i - 1968 + 1968 = 958 + 1968 Simplifying the equation, we get: -77 * i = 2926 Step 4: Solve for 'i' by dividing both sides by -77: i = 2926 / -77 Simplifying further, we find the value of i: i = -38 So, the answer is i = -38."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is apparent that the narrator misses having their ex as a partner, as they cannot help but think about them. They might wonder what could have been, had the relationship not ended. The saying \\"breaking up is hard to do\\" further emphasizes the emotional struggle that often comes with the dissolution of a once-valued partnership. The narrator acknowledges the pain and difficulty associated with the process of breaking up, which could mean that they are still in the process of healing from the emotional turmoil and loss surrounding their relationship. The reminiscing about their ex could also be triggering feelings of regret, questioning if the breakup was truly the best decision or if there was something more they could have done to save the relationship. We can also infer a sense of sadness from the narrator, since they are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they will not be celebrating their birthday with their ex as they might have done in the past. Additionally, the thought of their ex might also evoke bittersweet memories, contrasting the happy moments of their relationship with the pain of the eventual breakup. They could be experiencing moments of happiness when remembering the good times but also feel the weight of knowing that those moments have come to an end. In conclusion, the narrator is likely feeling a complex mix of emotions about their ex, such as nostalgia, sadness, longing, and perhaps regret. Their upcoming birthday has served as a catalyst for these feelings, as they are confronted with the reality of turning another year older without their once cherished partner by their side. The journey towards healing and moving on from a breakup can be challenging, as the narrator grapples with the bittersweet mixture of happy memories alongside the pain of having to let go."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No thanks The contents list of some properties these days can read like a user manual for the Battlestar Galactica. Lutron lighting and Cat 6 cabling, fingerprint entry systems and hydraulic car lifts. Baths that fill themselves – sometimes from the ceiling. Hobs that heat up instinctively, depending on where you’ve put your pan. The iPad didn’t even exist six years ago. Now we can control our entire homes from one, even when we’re thousands of miles away. But some buyers have had enough. They’re going retro, back to the old days of proper light switches, gadgets you can control manually and doors that require a key. “The rebirth of the dimmer switch is a wonderful thing,” says Marlon Lloyd Malcom of Lurot Brand. He thinks 11 Coleherne Mews in Earl’s Court – on sale for £1.95m – is a great example of the perfect mews house that’s “focused on the quality of finish, not gadgetry. What is more important, it seems, is the space and light of a property.” Mark Pollack, director of Aston Chase, is also seeing a genteel rebellion against unnecessary high-techery. He gives 138 Hamilton Terrace – on sale for £10.95m – as an example of a high-luxury but not high-tech home. “Many buyers are visibly withdrawing from the stereotypical contemporary look found in glossy lifestyle magazines. They’re yearning for an authentic home of genuine character without the impractical gadgets which one has come to expect from prime London developers,” he comments. Home-owners who over-indulge their passion for gadgetry may find their future prospective buyers are more traditionally-minded. The owners of one £4m Surrey mansion spent two years designing their home with every cutting-edge gimmick conceivable from keyless entry pads to mood-changing rooms. Beside the bed was a touch screen that could carry out a multitude of tasks including running the bath, opening the front gates and closing the blinds. The house took five years to sell. “The guy was an engineer, so he loved it. Prospective buyers were just daunted,” says the agent who, for obvious reasons, wishes to remain anonymous. Some central London developers are also realising that luxury doesn’t have to mean high-tech. Great Minster House, Barratt London’s redevelopment of an old government building in Westminster, has a feel of establishment elegance to it. They call it “colonial contemporary” and “modern traditional”, but what they are referring to are features such as heavy, three-metre high doors, high ceilings with feature flourishes and parquet floors in the flats, which cost from £975,000 and penthouses from £4.5m. The lack of smart technology isn’t deterring the iPad generation though; the first buyer was a 20-year-old app designer. Lighting effects and clever home automation have their place, but they can soon become outdated “and when these systems go wrong, it is spectacularly so,” says Roarie Scarisbrick, partner at Property Vision. A recent client of his was vehemently anti-iPad lighting. Instead, he installed hand-crafted, bespoke bronze light switches. Those with the biggest budgets also tend to have the keenest eye for identifying where every penny is spent – and high-tech often spells high premium. “The ability to create different moods in a room at the flick of a switch is hugely appealing, but there are now far simpler, more cost-effective ways to do it. It’s the same with AV equipment, with brands such as Sonos making the likes of Linn and Lutron look unnecessarily expensive and unduly complicated,” says Mark Pollack. It’s a similar situation with interior design. Those buying for pure investment or as a central London pad they’ll use once a year may be happy with the set menu of billionaires’ furniture packages. But buyers who want to create a genuine home want something more personal and less prescriptive. Developers and design company Fenton Whelan like to do that with chandeliers. They’ve just crafted 450kg of dangling crystal that descends three storeys of a Mayfair mansion on sale for £24m. Aneliese Dean, interiors architect for Landmark Lofts, says personalising a property isn’t something that can be done overnight. “It takes years to create the depth and character of a beautifully-conceived family home. It’s crucial to add to interiors over time to resist the overly staged effect created by many interior designers that was de rigueur a few years ago,” she comments. Just as “sophisticated” buyers balk at the premium asked for a high-tech home, they’re also wary of the inflated prices that come with branded interior-designed properties, says Camilla Dell from Black Brick buying agency. Although her services certainly don’t come cheap, one designer that Dell considers to have returned to “old school” design – “timelessly elegant rather than bling bling,” she says – is Rose Uniacke, the Beckhams’ designer of choice for the £5m revamp of their £31.5m Holland Park mansion. It’s rather more sophisticated than going back to basics, but who knew the good old light switch could command such devotion – and high prices? Summary:","output":"The luxury property market is seeing a nostalgic shift away from high-tech gadgetry toward more traditional designs and practical features. Homeowners and buyers are now seeking properties with genuine character, as opposed to the contemporary, high-tech designs of recent years. Some central London developers, such as Barratt London, have ditched smart technology in their properties, instead opting for elegant interiors, high ceilings and parquet floors.

Write an article based on this \\"The fraud case against former SNP MP Michelle Thomson has been dropped due to an absence of sufficient evidence.\\"","output":"Title: Fraud Case Against Ex-SNP MP Michelle Thomson Dropped Due to Insufficient Evidence Introduction: A fraud case against former Scottish National Party (SNP) MP Michelle Thomson has been dropped due to a lack of substantial evidence. Thomson faced allegations regarding a property transaction in 2010, surrounding the sale and purchase of real estate properties. However, the recent decision has put an end to the investigation and legal proceedings. The following article delves into the facts and reasons behind the dismissal of the case against the former MP. The Allegations: 1. In 2014, the property case involving Michelle Thomson first surfaced. She was accused of being involved in potentially unethical and fraudulent transactions in her capacity as a director of a property company. 2. The allegations centered around a series of property transactions between 2010 and 2011, where Thomson's company allegedly made rapid purchases and sales of properties at artificially inflated prices, allowing them to profit at the expense of the original owners. Such activities were claimed to potentially involve mortgage fraud. 3. These events led to the suspension of Michelle Thomson's membership in the SNP as well as the resignation of her legal advisor, Christopher Hales, after he was deemed unfit to practice law. The Investigation: 4. The Scottish Crown began its investigation into the alleged fraud case in 2014, following the allegations and legal implications surrounding the transactions. Michelle Thomson, along with several co-accused parties, faced intense scrutiny as the focus of the investigation. 5. The process of gathering evidence involved interviews, examining transaction records, and building a case around the potentially illegal activities carried out by Thomson and her associates. The Decision to Drop the Case: 6. After years of thorough investigation, the Scottish Crown has arrived at the decision to drop the fraud case against Michelle Thomson, citing a lack of sufficient evidence to prosecute. 7. This decision illustrates the challenges faced by prosecutors when trying to accumulate tangible evidence and formulate strong legal arguments, particularly in cases where financial transactions and alleged unlawful activities have taken place years prior. 8. Given the absence of substantial evidence, it becomes impossible to hold Thomson accountable for the allegations she faced, thus leading to the dismissal of the case.  Conclusion: The dismissal of the fraud case against former SNP MP Michelle Thomson marks the end of years-long legal proceedings and investigations. With the insufficiency of evidence rendering any potential prosecution invalid, Thomson will no longer face the allegations in court. While such cases emphasize the importance of thorough and efficient investigations, they also highlight the challenges prosecutors face in building a strong legal case against individuals accused of financial misconduct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(AOL Autos) -- With car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right, it's important to remember that today's automotive titans started out as tiny startups, not unlike Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.  General Motors was almost called International Motors Co.  Names like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Porsche call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today.  But behind every brand name, there is a flesh-and-blood inventor, entrepreneur or industrialist. Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with.  David Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble.  Buick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars.  Durant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it \\"Boo-ick,\\" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car.  In another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the \\"Hupp\\" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s.  What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What company was almost call International Motors? 2. Who invented the overhead valve engine? 3. What company did he found? 4. Who took over the company? 5. When did this happen? 6.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the Reserve that was renamed the Cascade National Forest in 1907?  The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Some apps such as WhatsApp use end-to-end encryption, making messages unreadable if intercepted. Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned that encrypted messaging apps could be used by criminals and terrorists. But security experts say strong encryption protects citizens' privacy. Many countries, including Australia, have laws in place that can force messaging services to hand over a suspect's communications to police with an appropriate warrant. However, messaging companies cannot hand over messages that have been end-to-end encrypted because they do not receive a legible copy. This encryption means ordinary citizens' messages cannot be intercepted by criminals or spies as they travel across the internet. But some people worry that terrorists and criminals can communicate secretly this way. \\"I think most people agree that there is a problem,\\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University. \\"The trouble is trying to force companies to decrypt via legislation is the very reason end-to-end encryption was introduced - particularly by US-based firms post-Snowden - to give their global customer base confidence that no government could get them to do what the Australians now propose.\\" Mr Turnbull said encryption meant online messages were \\"effectively dark to the reach of the law\\", which he said was \\"not acceptable\\". He said companies had to \\"assist the rule of law\\" and provide law enforcement with access to encrypted messages. \\"For this to work, the companies will have to change their technical architecture or somehow weaken the encryption,\\" said Prof Woodward. \\"Either is a bad idea.\\" Some politicians have called for apps to build a \\"back door\\" into their systems, to allow law enforcement access to unencrypted messages. But such a system could also be exploited by criminals, defeating the purpose of encryption. Mr Turnbull said he was not seeking a \\"back door\\" and wanted communications handed over in \\"the usual way that applies in the offline world\\". Prof Woodward said modern encryption methods had not been cracked. But Mr Turnbull said Australian law would prevail over the laws of mathematics. He told journalists: \\"The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\\"","output":"The debate over end-to-end encryption of messaging apps, like WhatsApp, revolves around privacy and security. End-to-end encryption is a system wherein only the communicating users can read the messages. In theory, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation. This feature enhances the privacy of users but presents a challenge for authorities when it comes to terror investigations and criminality. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commented on the issue, stating his concern that encrypted messaging apps could serve as tools for criminal and terrorist activities. Therefore, he believes it is intolerable for these encrypted communications to remain beyond the reach of the law. Despite this, numerous security experts argue that strong encryption is vital for protecting citizens' privacy. They believe any attempt to create \\"back doors,\\" or methods allowing law enforcement authorities to bypass encryption and access the contents of communications, would undermine the security of all users, as criminals could also potentially exploit these methods. Current laws in many countries, including Australia, can compel messaging services to provide a suspect's communications if an appropriate warrant is obtained. However, this has limitations as companies cannot provide messages that have been end-to-end encrypted, given they are unable to obtain a legible copy. Herein lies the conflict between the desire for security and the protection of privacy. Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University, noted the complexity of the situation. He pointed out that forcing companies to decrypt messages through legislation would essentially defeat the purpose of introducing end-to-end encryption, which arose primarily to instill confidence in a global customer base post-Snowden that no government could force a company to do what the Australians are proposing. Turnbull insists that even though he respects the laws of mathematics, the Australian law must be prominent. While he does not demand a 'back door' into these systems, he expects companies to cooperate with authorities and allow access to encrypted messages in order to uphold the rule of law. This task, however, would require changes in the technical architecture or a weakening of the encryption, both of which are deemed unsuitable solutions by Prof. Woodward due to their potential risk and the resultant compromise on privacy and data security.  On the whole, the conversation around encryption highlights the struggle between ensuring national security and preserving individual privacy rights in our increasingly digital world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Feminism and Success of Saudi TV Show 'Sponsored Women' At first glance, the four stars of a new Saudi television drama, “Mubta’ethat” or “Sponsored Women,” look a little mis-matched. There’s Salma, a chic tomboy with short hair and red lipstick, Raghad, a glam-girl with confident strides and princess curls, Sara, a feisty hijabi with colorful clothing, and Alia, a cautious girl who wears a black niqab (covering of the hair and entire face, with only slits for the eyes). But they have one thing in common: They’ve each got a U.S. visa page in their green passport. It is their golden ticket to leave their homes in Saudi Arabia to pursue an education in Philadelphia. The show highlights how these Saudi women fluidly adapt to a Western world while maintaining their Eastern ideals. They enroll in English classes, move into their own apartments and learn how to drive a car. They all steer their own lives for the first time. The script plays with the obvious contrasts inherent in the plot–the girls are almost as different from each other as their culture is from the one they’ll encounter in the United States. It manages to also dig into stereotypes about America or women in veils. During the 30 episodes, the women are forced to identify with each other and confront their own biases. Their friendship can be compared to that of a certain all-female cult HBO show from the 90s. The now classic formula of bringing together very different girls with strong personalities and courageous adventures still works. This time, with a Saudi accent. The program debuted on June 17, the first day of Ramadan, and was broadcast in Saudi Arabia every night through the Holy month which ended in mid-July. The show enjoyed a steady viewership over the course of the month. Each night, the episode would be uploaded on YouTube after it airs, and the comment section would quickly populate. “These girls don’t represent any Saudi girl I know and I’m a sponsored student,” reads a comment. “This is an amazing series, can’t wait for the next episode,” reads another. The positive reviews seem to outweigh the negative ones. Since it is broadcast during the Holy Month, this revolutionary show is representing millennials in a way that Saudi TV hasn’t otherwise seen. The show has an impressive pedigree: Directed by Oscar-nominated Saudi superstar, Haifaa Al Mansour and written by her sister, Noura Al Mansour, it was produced by Rotana Khalejia, a company that is partially owned by Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal. The characters are from key parts of Saudi and represent different lifestyles and social temperaments. Surely, young girls in Saudi can identify with qualities found in every one of these women. Salma is from the liberal West Coast, Raghad is from the luxurious capital, Sara is from the moderate East Coast and Alia is originally from conservative Al Qassim. Each family reacts differently to the departure of their daughter to the faraway continent. And while each girl has at least one family member closely watching over them in Philadelphia, letting go is still nerve wrecking for the families. In one comical scene, Alia’s mother is seen stealthily stuffing stacks of (imported) ramen noodles and sacks of rice into her daughter’s luggage before departing from Saudi. “They have that food in America!” her frustrated husband protests. “No! It’s laced with drugs there!” the exasperated mother replies. They are nervous about sending their only child, a daughter, to the unknown. “It smells like freedom! Of course, it tastes like nicotine,” Salma, says on the phone, as she cautiously drags a puff from a cigarette upon arrival to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Despite being a few continents away, she maintains the Saudi fear of being seen smoking in public. Actress Noor Al Badr who plays Salma, is a doctor in real life. She got “the randomest call” from Al Mansour who asked her to join the cast. Five days later, Al Badr was on the plane to Bahrain, where they shot most of the show. “Of course, most people thought I was crazy. I was a doctor! According to most people in our society, acting is not something to be proud of. I think I’m the first Saudi girl to smoke on TV. I wanted to break the taboo,” Al Badr said. No Saudi feminist show would be complete without the subject of the hijab. The irony is not lost on the characters. Two of the characters don’t cover their hair and two do. In one scene, Salma says of Alia, “She can see everyone but nobody can see her.” Alia, played by actress Zara Albaloshi, repeats how her covering is the ultimate feminist statement. Perhaps most surprising of all, Alia falls in love with a non-Muslim American, Jason, who lives in her building. He becomes interested in Islam and converts. By the end of the series, Alia, the girl who only reveals her eyes to the world, gives her heart to Jason. The show’s U.S. location is also telling: Philadelphia is central to the American Dream. It is where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. The women are in the U.S. on an academic scholarship, called the Saudi Scholarship. They are “sponsored,” hence the title of the show. Saudi Arabia has been funding Saudi students in the U.S. since 1960, but the late King Abdullah’s Scholarship Program, which launched a decade ago, was the largest push in encouraging female citizens to study abroad. In just five decades, Saudi girls went from not knowing how to read or write to a 97 percent literacy rate, according to UNICEF. Although the image of Saudi women has changed over the generations, the outdated impressions haven’t yet caught up with reality. The show makes a point of addressing these issues. “With 150,000 men and women studying abroad, why is Saudi considered to be a ‘developing country?’ In reality, it is quite developed,” Sara, played by actress Maram Abdulaziz, asks her classmates in one scene. Actress Noura Assar’s character, Raghad, has her camera at the ready to document the trials and triumphs of her Saudi female friends. An aspiring actress and director, Raghad’s quiet rebellion comes in the form of selecting that area of study. There is no such industry in Saudi Arabia today. Assar thinks the show is starting a different conversation. “I am proud to say that the image of Saudi women has come a long way from what it used to be; strong Saudi women always existed, however, the image was very much attached to a certain stereotype. The scholarships, I’d say, participated in this change due to the ‘face to face’ method of dealing with others, where people in other countries saw for themselves what these ladies can achieve and become,” she said. “Just because we can’t drive doesn’t mean we can’t fly and reach for the stars. Hope the show will continue next Ramadan!” Al Badr said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"\\"Sponsored Women\\" is a Saudi TV show about four different girls from Saudi Arabia who get the chance to travel to the United States to study in Philadelphia. The show is popular and it shows how these girls learn new things, make friends, and have adventures while keeping their own traditions from home. The characters are strong and brave, breaking some stereotypes about women from their country. It helps to show people how smart and independent Saudi Arabian girls can be, even though their society may be seen as very different and traditional."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You may have heard the term \\"the American Dream\\".In 1848, James W.Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams.That 19th century \\"American Dream\\" motivated  the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \\"Golden State\\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next.People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets.But most.instead, worked as railroad laborers.They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare . Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley.People poured their energy into the Internet.

Plausibility: Among the given options, \\"loss of oxygen\\" is more plausible as a cause of brain injury. Climbing at high altitudes can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels, which can affect the brain and lead to injury. 2. Relation to climbing: \\"Loss of oxygen\\" is directly related to the activity of climbing, especially when climbing at high altitudes. As the altitude increases, the air becomes thinner and there is less oxygen available. This can cause harm to those who are not acclimatized or prepared for such conditions. 3. Elimination of other options: The other options provided are either less likely to cause a brain injury or are not directly related to climbing as a cause.    - \\"Getting higher\\": While this option could be related to the activity of climbing, it is vague and doesn't specifically mention a reason for the brain injury.        - \\"Falling\\": While falls can cause brain injuries, the question specifically asks about the \\"eventual\\" cause. In this context, it implies that the injury comes from a cumulative effect of climbing, rather than a single fall.        - \\"Blisters\\": Blisters are a common occurrence during climbing, but they typically affect the feet and hands, not the brain. As a result, blisters are not a plausible cause for a brain injury.        - \\"Ascending\\": This option is somewhat similar to \\"getting higher\\" and doesn't specify any particular reason for the brain injury.

She's a 46-year-old mother of three wonderful kids. One day, 11 years ago, Lisa went to see the doctor because she wasn't feeling well. The doctor took some tests and they found out that Lisa had a sickness called acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and is not fun to have.  To help Lisa get better, the doctors decided that she needed something called a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow is a squishy and important stuff found inside our bones. It helps our bodies make blood cells, like the ones Lisa's body wasn't making the right way. Now, they needed to find someone who had the same kind of bone marrow to give to Lisa, kind of like sharing a toy with a friend who needs it. In a faraway place, a kind man named Neil Munro saw an advert (like a poster) asking for help to find someone with the right bone marrow. Neil thought he could be that person, so he went ahead and got tested. Guess what? Neil was a perfect match for Lisa! So, Neil shared his bone marrow with Lisa, and after a successful transplant, Lisa started to feel much better. Now she could be healthy and happy with her kids again. Years passed, and one day, Lisa found Neil's contact information and they started talking to each other. They wanted to finally meet in person and thank each other for their kindness. So, Lisa and Neil, along with their families, got together for a lovely reunion. They have now become friends who keep in touch regularly, like pen pals exchanging letters.

A lo largo de la historia, Grecia ha tenido una gran importancia en el desarrollo de la cultura, la filosofía, la democracia y las artes. Sin embargo, en los últimos años, ha enfrentado numerosas dificultades económicas y políticas, lo que ha provocado una situación de desesperación y resignación en la población. Desde el inicio de la crisis económica mundial en 2008, Grecia ha experimentado una recesión profunda que ha llevado a un aumento significativo en los niveles de desempleo, la pobreza y la deuda pública. A pesar de los esfuerzos del gobierno griego y la ayuda financiera proporcionada por la Unión Europea y el Fondo Monetario Internacional, el país sigue enfrentando serias dificultades para recuperarse y crecer económicamente. Ante esta situación, muchos ciudadanos griegos se sienten desesperados y resignados. La desesperación proviene de la falta de oportunidades laborales, el estancamiento de la economía y la incertidumbre sobre el futuro. La resignación, por otro lado, es resultado de la percepción de que, a pesar de los esfuerzos realizados, la situación no parece mejorar y las soluciones a los problemas económicos y políticos parecen estar fuera de su alcance. Además, la situación en Grecia ha llevado a un aumento en la emigración, principalmente de jóvenes altamente educados en busca de mejores oportunidades en otros países europeos.

Ask a question about List of numbered streets in Manhattan.","output":"What is the significance of the list of numbered streets in Manhattan, and how did they become an essential aspect of the urban layout and navigation system within New York City? The list of numbered streets in Manhattan is an essential part of the urban layout and navigation system within New York City. Dating back to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, these systematically numbered streets played a significant role in organizing and shaping the growth of Manhattan by establishing a gridiron network of streets and avenues stretching from Houston Street in the south to 155th Street in the north. The origin of this systematic arrangement can be attributed to the Commissioner's Plan of 1811, which outlined a visionary and ambitious design to accommodate and foster Manhattan's rapid population growth and urban development. The key architects behind this design were John Randel Jr., a surveyor, and the Commissioners, Gouverneur Morris, Simeon De Witt, and John Rutherfurd, who were appointed by the New York State Legislature to develop the layout. The numbered streets run east-west across Manhattan, starting with 1st Street in the East Village and ascending northward to 220th Street in Inwood. These streets intersect the north-south avenues, which are also numbered but follow a separate numbering system that starts with 1st Avenue on the east side of Manhattan and runs up to 12th Avenue on the west side. This organized grid system was adopted to make it easier for residents and visitors to navigate the city and find locations by using simple street and avenue numbers. The numbered streets also facilitated urban development, allowing for the orderly construction of buildings, parks, and other infrastructure elements. Moreover, the numbered streets have played an essential role in preserving Manhattan's historical identity. Most of the original streets and avenues from the 1811 plan remain part of the city's street network. For instance, Broadway retains its unique diagonal path, which predates the grid, and Central Park lies between 59th and 110th Streets, conspicuously disrupting the numbered streets' continuity. In addition to serving practical navigation and urban planning purposes, the Manhattan numbered streets also contribute to the city's vibrant cultural scene. Many street names are synonymous with the neighborhoods they cross and the landmarks they encompass. For example, 42nd Street is home to iconic tourist spots like Times Square, the Theater District, and New York Public Library, while 34th Street features popular shopping destinations like Macy's Herald Square department store. In conclusion, the list of numbered streets in Manhattan is a vital aspect of the city's urban layout and navigation system. Originating from the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, these systematically organized streets and avenues have effectively accommodated New York City's exponential growth and development over the past two centuries, while also preserving its historical essence and contributing to its rich cultural tapestry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Emily Allen PUBLISHED: 10:37 EST, 11 July 2012 | UPDATED: 12:32 EST, 11 July 2012 An executive fighting a £300,000 battle to make insurers pay up for a fire that gutted his home has denied that his boyfriend started the blaze while having a 'hissy fit.' Jonathan Smyth returned home from work on the evening of Tuesday, January 22 2008, to find his house in Margaret Street, Brighton, ablaze with police and firefighters in attendance. The fire, which started in a basement bedroom, made the £350,000 house uninhabitable and caused huge damage to the contents - as well as killing three pet cats. However, Mr OPTIONS: - Brighton denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Emily Allen denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Howe denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Jonathan Smyth denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Margaret Street denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Tony Bear denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Tony Howe denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire.","output":"- Jonathan Smyth denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. Emily Allen is the author of the news story, so it would be illogical for her to be directly involved in the incident. Brighton is a location, and Margaret Street is the street name where the house was located, so neither of those can be relevant to denying any involvement, as they are geographical references, not individuals. Tony Bear is not mentioned in the text and has no connection to the story provided, so it doesn't make sense as a completion. Though Tony Howe is not directly mentioned in the text, he is the likely boyfriend referenced in the beginning.

Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished.  Hint: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. Answer:","output":"Bank island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce. This is because Bank island experienced severe drought, which caused a diminished food supply. Birds with smaller beaks could only eat the smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks could eat seeds of all sizes. Due to the limited food supply, many small-beaked birds died during the drought, and as a result, the birds with bigger beaks were more likely to survive and reproduce.

He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases.  and the situation: Brian has two identical containers of the same gas sitting on his kitchen table. He has a device that allows him to increase the pressure of any container he wants. He brings the device up to container B but decides not to use it. He then goes over to container A and activates the device to increase the pressure.  Answer the following question: Which container's gas has more volume? Answer:","output":"Container B's gas has more volume. Since Brian increased the pressure in container A and according to Boyle's law, the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant, the volume of gas in container A would decrease. Therefore, container B would have a greater volume of gas as its pressure remains unchanged."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

President-elect Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisers and speechwriters are wrestling with one of the most important speeches of his presidency, his inaugural address. One of their toughest conceptual challenges is how to describe and recast what the Bush administration has consistently termed the \\"war on terror.\\" The dean of military strategists, Carl von Clausewitz, explains the importance of this decision-making in his treatise \\"On War\\": \\"The first, the supreme, the most decisive act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish...the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature.\\" Clausewitz's excellent advice about the absolute necessity of properly defining the war upon which a nation is about to embark was ignored by Bush administration officials who instead declared an open-ended and ambiguous \\"war on terror\\" after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. Bush took the nation to war against a tactic, rather than a war against a specific enemy, which was obviously al Qaeda and anyone allied to it. When the United States went to war against the Nazis and the Japanese during World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and his congressional supporters did not declare war against U-boats and kamikaze pilots, but on the Nazi state and Imperial Japan. The war on terror, sometimes known as the \\"Global War on Terror\\" or by the clunky acronym GWOT, became the lens through which the Bush administration judged almost all of its foreign policy decisions. That proved to be dangerously counterproductive on several levels. The GWOT framework propelled the Bush administration into its disastrous entanglement in Iraq. It had nothing to do with 9/11 but was launched under the rubric of the war on terror and the erroneous claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The theory was that he might give such weapons to terrorists, including al Qaeda to whom he was supposedly allied, and that he therefore threatened American interests. None of this, of course, turned out to be true. The Bush administration's approach to the war on terror collided badly with another of its doctrines, spreading democracy in the Middle East as a panacea to reduce radicalism. It pushed for elections in the Palestinian territories in which, in early 2006, the more radical Hamas won a resounding victory, propelled to power on a wave of popular revulsion for the incompetence and corruption of the Fatah party that had dominated Palestinian politics since the 1960s. Imprisoned by its war on terror framework, the Bush administration supported Israel in a disastrous war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. Hezbollah is not only a terrorist group but is also part of the rickety Lebanese government and runs social welfare services across the country, yet for the Bush administration its involvement in terrorism was all that mattered. As is now widely understood in Israel, the war against Hezbollah was a moral and tactical defeat for the Israeli military and government. Events in the current Israeli incursion in Gaza will determine whether history repeats itself. Under the banner of the war on terror, the Bush administration also tied itself in conceptual knots conflating the threat from al Qaeda with Shiite groups like Hezbollah and the ayatollahs in Iran. In 2006, for instance, President Bush claimed that \\"the Sunni and Shiite extremist represent different faces of the same threat.\\" In reality, Sunni and Shiite extremists have been killing each other in large numbers for years in countries from Pakistan to Iraq. The groups have differing attitudes toward the United States, which Sunni extremists attacked in 1993 and again on 9/11, while Shiite militants have never done so. So, how to reconceptualize the GWOT? Contrary to a common view among Europeans, who have lived through the bombing campaigns of various nationalist and leftist terror groups for decades, al Qaeda is not just another criminal/terrorist group that can be dealt with by police action and law enforcement alone. After all, a terrorist organization like the Irish Republican Army would call in warnings before its attacks and its single largest massacre killed 29 people. By contrast, al Qaeda has declared war on the United States repeatedly -- as it did for the first time to a Western audience during Osama bin Laden's 1997 interview with CNN. Following that declaration of war, the terror group attacked American embassies, a U.S. warship, the Pentagon and the financial heart of the United States, killing thousands of civilians without warning; acts of war by any standard. Al Qaeda is obviously at war with the United States and so to respond by simply recasting the GWOT as the GPAT, the Global Police Action Against Terrorists, would be foolish and dangerous. What kind of war then should the United States fight against al Qaeda? For that we should learn some lessons from the conceptual errors of the Bush administration. Nine days after 9/11, Bush addressed Congress in a speech watched live by tens of millions of Americans in which he said that al Qaeda followed in the footsteps \\"of the murderous ideologies of the 20th century...They follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism,\\" implying that the fight against al Qaeda would be similar to World War II or the Cold War. For the Bush administration, painting the conflict in such existential terms had the benefit of casting the president as the heroic reincarnation of Winston Churchill and anyone who had the temerity to question him as the reincarnation of Hitler's arch-appeaser, Neville Chamberlain. But this portrayal of the war on terror was massively overwrought. The Nazis occupied and subjugated most of Europe and instigated a global conflict that killed tens of millions. And when the United States fought the Nazis, the country spent 40 percent of its gross domestic product to do so and fielded millions of soldiers. In his inaugural address, Obama should say that the United States is indeed at \\"war against al Qaeda and its allies,\\" but that as Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1933, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. If Americans are not terrorized by terrorists, then the U.S. has won against them. Al Qaeda and its allies are threats to the United States and Americans living and working overseas, but they are far from all-powerful. Barring an exceptional event like September 11, 2001, in any given year Americans are more likely to die of snake bites or lightning strikes than a terrorist attack. Despite the hyperventilating rhetoric of Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda's amateur investigations into weapons of mass destruction do not compare to the very real possibility of nuclear conflagration that we faced during the Cold War. There are relatively few adherents of Binladen-ism in the West today, while there were tens of millions of devotees of communism and fascism. Obama should also make it clear that instead of the Bush formulation of \\"Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,\\" the Obama administration doctrine will be, \\"Anyone who is against the terrorists is with us.\\" After all it is only al Qaeda and its several affiliates in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Algeria and allied groups such as the Taliban that kill U.S. soldiers and civilians and attack American interests around the globe. Everyone else in the world is a potential or actual ally in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates, because those organizations threaten almost every category of institution, government and ethnic grouping. This is the first of two commentaries on the war on terror. Read the second piece, Peter Bergen's commentary on what principles Barack Obama should follow in waging war against al Qaeda and its allies, Friday, January 9 on CNN.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This sounds like a really big story! But don't worry, I'll tell you the most important parts in a way that's easy to understand: 1. Barack Obama, who is about to become the President of the United States, and his team are trying to decide how to talk about something called the \\"war on terror.\\" That was a name used by the previous president, George W. Bush, to describe the fight against people who want to harm others and create fear, mainly a group called al Qaeda.  2. The story says that Bush's decision to call it a \\"war on terror\\" might not have been the best idea. He was treating it like a war against a specific way of doing harmful things, instead of a specific group of bad people. It's kind of like he was saying we're fighting against every way people could scare us, instead of against the people who are actually trying to scare us.  3. This approach led Bush's team to make a lot of important decisions about how to deal with other countries. Some of those decisions didn't work out very well, like going to war with Iraq, a country in the Middle East. 4. Now, Obama and his team need to figure out a better way to talk about and deal with this big problem. They want to make sure people understand that al Qaeda is a really dangerous group that wants to hurt Americans, but they also want to show that it's not as all-powerful or scary as some people might think. 5. Instead of saying, \\"you're either with us or against us,\\" as Bush did, Obama wants to say, \\"if you're against these bad guys, you're with us.\\" That means there are a lot of potential allies around the world who can help in the fight against al Qaeda and similar groups.  And that's the main idea of this long article!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Here is a news article: CLOSE President Trump made an announcement from the White House, keeping his campaign promise, that the United States would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. John Fritze reports. John Fritze, USA TODAY      President Trump arrives to participate in first lady Melania Trump's \\"Be Best\\" initiative launch event in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday. (Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE)      WASHINGTON – As he announced Tuesday that he would no longer abide by the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump sent a not-so-veiled message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.      \\"Today's action sends a critical message: The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them,\\" Trump said.      Even as he spoke, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to the Korean Peninsula to lay the groundwork for talks about North Korea's nuclear program. \\"Plans are being made; relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen,\\" Trump said.      The very same issues that caused Trump to pull out of the Iran agreement will also be hurdles in North Korea talks — and in some cases, those hurdles will be higher. Unlike Iran, North Korea already has nuclear weapons.      \\"Ripping up the Iran deal will demonstrate to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that a deal with the United States can't be counted on. And it will give Kim Jong Un less incentive to make important concessions,\\" said Robert Einhorn of the Brookings Institution, a former State Department adviser on arms control during the Obama administration.      Einhorn said Trump's position on the Iran deal could box him in on negotiations with North Korea. On sanctions relief, human rights and missile technology, Trump may be setting a standard on Iran that could be impossible to reach on a North Korea deal.      Trump has four major problems with the Iran deal, which was negotiated by President Obama and five other world powers and is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.      More: What is the Iran nuclear deal? Key questions and answers about the deal and its future      •The JCPOA didn't address Iran's ballistic missile program.      •It didn't stop Iran's misbehavior in the Middle East.      • Provisions of the agreement expire after 10 to 15 years.      •It rewarded Iran by unfreezing its assets frozen by years of U.S. sanctions.      Trump is moving quickly toward a historic summit with Kim in the coming weeks, bypassing the years of lower-level talks that preceded the Iran nuclear deal. \\"The location is picked — the time and the date, everything is picked,\\" Trump said.      An Obama-era law requires Trump to make a decision on Iran sanctions every 120 days. The previous time he faced that deadline, Trump waived the sanctions. Tuesday, he signed a presidential memorandum to pull out of the agreement, allowing him to impose the sanctions.      \\"They're not formally linked, but clearly, they’re linked in many people's minds. They're two rogue regimes on different parts of the timeline toward developing a nuclear program,\\" said Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst on North Korea now at the conservative Heritage Foundation.      Because North Korea is further along on that timeline — it's suspected of having a nuclear stockpile of as many as 60 warheads — Iran and other potential nuclear states will watch to see what Kim can get away with.      \\"The Trump administration has set a very high bar for success and painted itself into a corner through its very strong opposition — to not just the JCPOA but other agreements with North Korea,\\" Klingner said.      An agreement in 1994 with North Korea, negotiated by the Clinton administration and known as the Agreed Framework, slowed North Korea's nuclear program for eight years. The pact collapsed during the George W. Bush administration — in part because of North Korean provocations, but the United States didn't live up to its promise to help North Korea develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.      \\"One would think that the U.S. pulling out of the Iran deal would undermine North Korea's perception that it could trust the U.S. to maintain any kind of agreement with it,\\" Klingner said. \\"The North Koreans already think that the U.S. political system is fickle. We change our policy every four to eight years.\\"      That cuts both ways. Just as Iran learned that a U.S. president might not maintain an agreement his predecessor made, both countries may calculate that the next U.S. president might give them a better deal.      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2I1NfE4 ||||| In this photo released by an official website of the office of the Iranian Presidency, President Hassan Rouhani attends a meeting with officials and industrialists, at a petroleum conference in Tehran,... (Associated Press)      TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — President Hassan Rouhani warned Tuesday that Iran could restart enriching uranium \\"without any limitations\\" within weeks, after President Donald Trump pulled America out of the nuclear deal, though he said world powers still in the accord could potentially save the pact.      Rouhani's speech, broadcast live on state television within minutes of Trump's announcement, marked a doubling-down for the cleric who has seen his signature foreign policy achievement threatened by Trump for years. Trump's announcement from the White House marked potentially the worst-case scenario for the relative moderate, as the country's economy continues to reel despite the deal and may further worsen.      Stressing that the accord remained a \\"multilateral\\" one, and not just with the U.S., Rouhani said he'd be sending Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the countries still in the deal — China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom.      Iran hopes the European Union will pass laws to protect European firms from any potential U.S. sanctions. EU officials have suggested they'll do what they can to salvage the agreement.      Still, Rouhani made a point of stressing that Iran, at any time, could resume its nuclear program.      \\"So if necessary, we can begin our industrial enrichment without any limitations,\\" the Iranian leader said. \\"Until implementation of this decision, we will wait for some weeks and will talk with our friends and allies and other signatories of the nuclear deal, who signed it and who will remain loyal to it. Everything depends on our national interests.\\"      During the live broadcast, Rouhani also made a point of reeling off examples of American meddling in Iran, including the 1953 coup that deposed its elected prime minister and the U.S. Navy shooting down of an Iranian commercial airliner in 1988.      Iranian state television did not broadcast Trump's announcement live, but carried his remarks in a crawl at the bottom of the screen and later recounted some of them.      Earlier Tuesday, Rouhani had stressed that Iran wants to keep \\"working with the world and (pursue) constructive engagement with the world.\\" That appeared to be a nod to Europe, which has struck a series of business deals with Iran since signing the landmark 2015 nuclear accord.      Trump and the United States also came under fire from Iran's first vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri, a popular reformist politician who has been suggested as a possible presidential contender in Iran's 2021 election.      \\"Today, the biggest power in the world is yelling that it does not accept\\" the deal, Jahangiri said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency.      Only \\"naive individuals would accept to enter talks with such a country,\\" he added. \\"We are ready and have a plan for managing ... under any circumstance.\\"      Jahangiri's comments suggest a potential political turn against any rapprochement with the West in response to the Trump pullout, especially as he is a reformist — a politician who advocates for change to Iran's theocratic government. It also comes as Trump is set to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later this year, where negotiations will undoubtedly include talks about that country's atomic weapons program.      Iran's 2015 nuclear deal imposed restrictions on the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in return for the lifting of most of the U.S. and international sanctions against Tehran.      However, the deal came with time limits and did not address Iran's ballistic missile program or its regional policies in Syria and elsewhere. Trump has repeatedly pointed to those omissions in referring to the accord as the \\"worst deal ever.\\" However, proponents have said those time limits were meant to encourage more discussion with Iran in the future that could eventually address other concerns.      Many in Tehran and elsewhere in the country are worried about what Trump's decision could mean for Iran.      Already, the Iranian rial is trading on the black market at 66,000 to the dollar, despite a government-set rate of 42,000 rials. And many say they have not seen any benefits from the nuclear deal.      Iran's poor economy and unemployment sparked nationwide protests in December and January that saw at least 25 people killed and, reportedly, nearly 5,000 arrested.      Still some hard-line Iranian politicians welcomed the U.S. pullout.      \\"The U.S. pullout from the deal is the best achievement for Iran since it shows the real face of the U.S.,\\" said hard-line lawmaker Ahmad Alirzabeigi. \\"We should not rely on the U.S., nor on Europe.\\"      \\"We will face hard sanctions following the U.S. pullout, but they will not remain in place since the global community needs Iran,\\" added another hard-line lawmaker, Jabbar Kouchakinejad.      ___      Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.      ___      AP coverage on the Iran nuclear deal: https://apnews.com/tag/Irannuclear . ||||| President Trump has been criticized for lacking even a shred of cohesion in his decision making, but there has been one unifying theme over his first 15 months in office: torching the legacy of Barack Obama. The latest of his predecessor's accomplishments set for incineration is the Iran deal, which Trump announced plans to abandon today. The withdrawal comes after months of campaigning from experts, administration officials and the international community to preserve the deal, which Trump has been decrying as \\"one of the worst\\" ever since the 2016 campaign. The president wasn't swayed, remaining convinced he can renegotiate a better arrangement despite Iran's refusal to do so.      Related What's Lurking Inside Trump's War Cabinet? With Mike Pompeo and John Bolton whispering in Trump’s ear, we are one step closer to war      While announcing the United States' removal from the \\"decaying and rotten\\" agreement Tuesday afternoon, Trump said it's \\"fine\\" that Iran is refusing to negotiate a new deal, and that he will be ready to talk when the nation does decide to discuss new terms. In the meantime, Trump says he will work to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and that if the regime resumes its development of a weapons program, \\"it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.\\"            He continued: Today’s action sends a critical message ... the U.S. no longer sends empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them.\\"      Negotiated in July 2015, the deal, officially dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, stipulated that Iran rid itself of nuclear fuel if the United States waived sanctions that had been crippling the nation's economy. As part of the deal, a UN nuclear agency would monitor Iran’s fidelity to the agreement and, thus far, the agency has determined that Iran has complied. After 10 years, restrictions on research and development would lighten, and after 15 years, Iran would be able to produce nuclear fuel, but not in service of a weapons program. Along with the lack of a provision preventing Iran from testing ballistic missiles, this \\"sunset clause\\" has been pointed to by Trump as one of the principle reasons the deal is a \\"disaster.\\"            Most supporters of the deal have acknowledged its flaws, but have advocated working to amend the terms rather that starting from scratch. Trump's insistence on blowing the deal up may prove problematic, though, as Iran has stated that it is not willing to start negotiating an entirely new deal. This leaves the United States with no agreement, and leaves the rest of the world – the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China all signed onto the deal, as well – fearing the worst. \\"We would open the Pandora’s box,\\" French President Emmanuel Macron recently told German paper Der Spiegel of the impact of the U.S. pulling out of the deal. \\"There could be war.\\"            Here are three immediate takeaways from Trump's decision today.            1. Iran is now free to build a nuclear bomb            Since the deal took effect in October 2015, the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has kept close tabs on the degree to which Iran has upheld its promise to suspend its nuclear weapons program. The nation's former uranium enrichment plants are monitored constantly, dust samples are collected that are then analyzed for traces of nuclear activity and tips are investigated as to sites of suspicious activity within Iran. This element of oversight was a lynchpin of the agreement, as it has ensured there is virtually no way for Iran to even begin developing a nuclear weapon. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has called the verification process \\"robust.\\"            The IAEA offers an unprecedented degree of transparency into the Iran's nuclear capabilities, an invaluable safeguard considering Iran's history as an untrustworthy adversary. With this safeguard removed, Iran would be free to renew its nuclear weapons program, and the United States would have no way of monitoring whether they are developing weapons. As some have pointed out, this could pave the way for an invasion.      The Iran deal provides substantially more provision for verification of denuclearization & ongoing monitoring of such than will exist in this new post-Iran-deal reality. Watch arguments for war in the coming months take the shape of \\"we can't be sure Iran isn't building a bomb.\\" — Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) May 8, 2018      Part of what has emboldened Trump to renege is the departures of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster – who both encouraged the president to uphold the deal – with Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, respectively, who have both been critical of it. Bolton was involved in an eerily similar situation 15 years ago before the United States invaded Iraq.      15 years ago, Bolton + Netanyahu justified their demand for a confrontation with Iraq by claiming the weapons inspectors there were being duped. Now they're peddling the same story about the inspections in Iran. Why can't America learn from its mistakes?https://t.co/JraoV4kb4c pic.twitter.com/gNHHzywuB5 — Peter Beinart (@PeterBeinart) May 8, 2018      Iran’s capability to build a bomb would also incentivize other Middle Eastern nations to pursue nuclear weapons programs. \\"What has been gained from the nuclear deal? Imagine all the mutually contaminating civil wars and internecine conflicts that rage across the Middle East today. Then turn the dial and add the possibility of a regional nuclear arms race triggered by Iran dashing for a bomb,\\" wrote British foreign secretary Boris Johnson in a recent op-ed for the New York Times. \\"That is the scenario which the agreement has helped to prevent.\\"            2. Trump's decision will likely alienate allies            Though brokered by the Obama administration, the Iran deal is very much an international accord, and the implications of Trump's refusal to waive sanctions on Iran come the May 12th deadline will be wide-ranging. In recent weeks, representatives from the United Kingdom, France and Germany have all visited the U.S. in an effort to convince Trump to preserve the deal, acknowledging its flaws but pleading with the president to consider working to fix or amend the agreement rather than dissolving it entirely. Boris Johnson even attempted to appeal to Trump by saying that a Nobel Peace Prize could be a possibility if the president were able to fix the Iran deal and negotiate something similar with North Korea.      France, Germany, and the UK regret the U.S. decision to leave the JCPOA. The nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 8, 2018      Though Trump has removed the United States from the deal, allies in Europe have committed to upholding it, and the reinstatement of sanctions may result in tension between the U.S. and those it relies on most. It could also cause a rift with China and Russia, who have also encouraged the United States to remain in the deal, warning of the geopolitical insecurity that would ensue should the deal be scrapped. As was the case when Trump removed the United States from the Paris Accords last summer, scrapping the Iran deal would be a significant blow to its standing as an international leader.            3. The abandonment may hinder an impending deal with North Korea            Reimposing sanctions on Iran would be Trump’s most consequential foreign policy maneuver yet, but a meeting with Kim Jong-un looms large. For Trump to pull out of a deal that by all accounts, Iran is complying with, it could make North Korea wary of entering into a similar deal with the United States.            \\"North Korea could not claim the U.S. abrogates agreements without cause and would be more likely to negotiate and end to its nuclear program,\\" wrote the National Coalition to Prevent an Iranian Nuclear Weapon, a bipartisan collection of over 100 national security veterans, a in a letter published last month. \\"Efforts to limit nuclear proliferation would be strengthened.\\"            Trump has used every superlative in the book in criticizing the Iran deal. If he wants to broker an agreement that would result in the denuclearization of North Korea, he’s going to have to devise something even more advantageous for the U.S. than the Iran deal that North Korea will also agree to. This seems far fetched, to say the least. \\"The man who wrote The Art of the Deal has staked out a position that the Iran deal was the worst one in history,\\" Robert S. Litwak, author of Preventing North Korea's Nuclear Breakout recently explain to the New York Times. \\"And now he has to show that he can do much better, with a far harder case.\\"            Trump ran on his dealmaking prowess, but there have been few examples of it through his first 15 months in office. Hopefully, for the sake of humanity, he's just been saving up all his negotiating acumen for his upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. He's going to need it.            Along with his Tuesday afternoon announcement that the United States would remove itself from the Iran deal, Trump told the nation that newly minted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to North Korea to work on the terms for the president's upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. \\"Plans are being made, relationships are building, and hopefully a deal will happen,\\" Trump said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"President Trump has announced that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was negotiated by Obama administration and five other world powers.

The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Crust punk (or simply crust) is a form of music influenced by hardcore punk and extreme metal. The style, which evolved in the mid-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills.

Es importante también cultivar la humildad y la sinceridad en nuestra interacción con el maestro espiritual, ya que un enfoque genuino y de corazón abierto ayuda a fortalecer nuestra conexión. Parte 3: Establecer límites adecuados Al relacionarnos con un maestro espiritual, es fundamental establecer límites adecuados. Esto implica respetar la privacidad y la autonomía del maestro, así como también nuestras propias necesidades y límites personales. Debemos ser conscientes de la diferencia entre la dependencia emocional y la guía espiritual genuina. Un maestro espiritual está aquí para enseñarnos y guiarnos, no para resolver nuestros problemas emocionales o personales. Mantener límites saludables es clave para evitar la dependencia y para asegurar que nuestra relación con el maestro espiritual sea beneficiosa para ambas partes. Parte 4: Cultivar la confianza mutua La confianza es un componente esencial en cualquier relación, y la relación con un maestro espiritual no es una excepción. Ambas partes deben ser honestas y transparentes en sus interacciones. Como estudiantes, debemos tener la confianza en que nuestro maestro espiritual tiene nuestras mejores intenciones en mente y que su conocimiento y experiencia pueden ayudarnos en nuestro camino. Por otro lado, el maestro espiritual debería sentir que podemos ser confiables y que estamos comprometidos en seguir sus enseñanzas con sinceridad y dedicación. Parte 5: Ser pacientes y comprometidos en el proceso El crecimiento espiritual es un viaje a largo plazo que puede incluir tanto desafíos como logros. Por lo tanto, es vital ser pacientes y comprometidos en nuestra relación con nuestro maestro espiritual. No debemos esperar cambios drásticos o resultados inmediatos; en cambio, debemos estar dispuestos a invertir tiempo y esfuerzo en el proceso y a aplicar sus enseñanzas con perseverancia y determinación. También es importante recordar que nuestra relación con nuestro maestro espiritual puede cambiar y evolucionar a lo largo del tiempo, y debemos estar abiertos a la posibilidad de adaptarnos a los cambios a medida que crecemos y aprendemos juntos. En conclusión, la relación con un maestro espiritual es una parte valiosa y crucial en nuestro camino espiritual. Al establecer una conexión auténtica, estableciendo límites adecuados, cultivando la confianza mutua, y siendo pacientes y comprometidos en el proceso, podemos formar una relación saludable y enriquecedora con nuestro maestro espiritual que nos ayudará a crecer y desarrollarnos en nuestra búsqueda espiritual."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: brick Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of obtaining a brick, there are two main ways to consider: 1. Purchase a brick: Step 1: Determine the type and size of the brick required based on your needs. Bricks can be made from various materials such as clay or concrete and come in different sizes. Step 2: Research local hardware stores or building supply stores that sell bricks. This can include large chain stores or local specialty stores. Step 3: Compare prices between different suppliers to find the most cost-effective option for your needs. Step 4: Visit the chosen store or place an online order for the brick, ensuring that the selected type and size match your requirements. Step 5: Pick up the brick from the store or wait for it to be delivered if ordered online. 2. Make a brick yourself: Step 1: Gather materials required to make a brick, such as clay or concrete mix. Additionally, gather other necessary supplies like a mold, water, and a mixing tool. Step 2: If using clay, knead and shape the clay into the desired brick size and shape. If using concrete, mix the concrete using water and a mixing tool following the manufacturer's instructions, and then pour the mixture into the brick mold. Step 3: Allow the clay or concrete to dry or cure. This could take a few hours to several days, depending on the type of material and environmental conditions. Step 4: Once the brick has dried or cured, carefully remove it from the mold, clean up any rough edges or excess material, and let it continue to dry if needed. In conclusion, choosing between these two options depends on factors such as time, cost, and personal preferences. If you need a brick quickly and have access to a store that sells them, purchasing might be the more efficient option. However, if you want to create a custom brick or have the time and materials to make one yourself, creating a brick could be a more satisfying and cost-effective solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria wants to learn how to run apps on android so she asks Mary for an advice, because","output":"Mary is known for her extensive knowledge of Android operating systems and applications. Mary has been an Android enthusiast for years, having learned the ins and outs of various Android versions, mobile devices, and how different apps work and interact with each other. Victoria knows that consulting with her friend would provide her with the best information to understand and operate Android apps successfully. Mary is happy to help Victoria and begins by explaining the basics of Android applications. She tells Victoria that there are two primary ways to install and run apps on an Android device: through Google Play Store and by sideloading apps from external sources. First, Mary explains the process of installing apps through the Google Play Store. She advises Victoria to follow these steps: 1. Locate and open the Google Play Store app on the Android device. The Play Store comes preinstalled in most Android devices and is the official marketplace for downloading and updating apps. 2. Sign in using a Google account. For those who don't have one, they can create a new account by registering with their email address. 3. Using the search bar at the top, search for the desired app or browse the various categories available in the store's home page. 4. After finding the app, tap on it to open its individual page with detailed information such as developer, description, and user reviews. 5. Click on the 'Install' button, and the app would start downloading and installing automatically. 6. Upon completion, the app can be launched from the device's app drawer or home screen. Next, Mary discusses sideloading apps from external sources. She explains that Android allows users to install apps from other sources outside the Google Play Store, but there could be potential risks involved, such as malware and security issues. However, if Victoria wishes to sideload apps, Mary suggests the following steps: 1. Enable 'Unknown sources' or 'Install unknown apps' in the device's settings. This option is under 'Security' or 'Apps & notifications' depending on the Android version and device. 2. Find a trusted source to download the desired app's APK file, which is the Android package file used for app installation. 3. Download the APK file to the Android device, making sure to verify the source's legitimacy to avoid potential risks. 4. Using a file manager app or the device's native file explorer, locate the downloaded APK file and tap on it. 5. Allow any permissions requested by the app installer, and the installation process should begin. 6. Once the installation is complete, the app could be launched similarly as apps installed from the Play Store. Mary also teaches Victoria about app updates and managing apps on her Android device. She informs her that: 1. Regularly updating apps is crucial, as updates often include security patches, bug fixes, and new features. 2. App permissions can be managed from the device's settings, enabling or denying access to different device functions. 3. Unused apps should be uninstalled to free space and maintain a clutter-free device. Victoria is grateful to Mary for her comprehensive advice and guidance on running apps on her Android device. With Mary's help, Victoria can now confidently navigate her way through the Android ecosystem and start enjoying the various apps available to enhance her smartphone experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest. People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off.  Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… Question: Who is the author? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The author is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Love on the high seas: Where to get romantic on your next cruise Cruising is by nature a group experience, full of mixing, mingling and meeting new friends. But that doesn't mean it's totally devoid of romance. There's plenty of opportunities to affirm the bond between the two of you, strolling under the stars, staring into each other's eyes during a romantic dinner and otherwise experiencing the cruise ship scene from a perspective of amore. Here are some places on cruise ships where you can up the romance quotient. The smokestack: Smooching at night under the ship's smokestack is a time-honored tradition, but be careful not to get too frisky — there are security cameras watching. The karaoke bar/piano bar: What's more romantic than a serenade? Whether Metallica's Nothing Else Matters or Al Green's Let's Stay Together, show your love in song at the karaoke bar, such as those on Royal Caribbean and Crystal Cruises ships. If you can't sing, head to the piano bar and make a request of the piano player (Billy Joel tunes are particularly popular). The spa: Turn to mush with a side-by-side couple's massage. Two therapists do the rubbing and kneading. If you book your treatment in a spa villa, as available on some Princess Cruises and Disney Cruise Line ships, you may have opportunity to linger afterwards with a bubble bath for two. The promenade: During the day, passengers walk the outdoor deck area for exercise, play shuffleboard and otherwise enjoy the ocean breezes. At night, you can take a stroll arm in arm and look at the stars, often without anyone else in sight. Specialty bars: Snag a corner table and make a toast your love at the champagne bar, martini bar or wine bar. On Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Epic, Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway you can bundle up in a parka and rub your cold noses together in the Svedka Ice Bar, where the temperature is always 17 degrees. Dance clubs: Clubs and lounges give couples the chance to dance to live bands and DJs. Show your ballroom skills backed by a big band on Cunard, dance the night away to scratch-n-spin masters trained by DJ Irie on Carnival Cruise Lines or do salsa at Boleros on Royal Caribbean ships. If there's an outdoor party – as on warm-weather itineraries of Seabourn, SeaDream Yacht Club and Windstar Cruises ships – take advantage of the opportunity to swing together under the stars. Specialty restaurants: Small luxury ships such as those of Silversea and Seabourn will accommodate a request for a table for two in the main dining room. But on mainstream ships, the best way to assure your own table is to book a specialty restaurant for a romantic date night. You get the bonus of upgraded cuisine and a more intimate atmosphere (a fee will be involved). Your cabin: While tight interior accommodations can be endearing in a shabby chic kind of way, couples seeking a romantic getaway may want to splurge on a larger stateroom with views. Upgrade to a balcony or veranda cabin for a \\"private\\" (others may be able to see you) lounging spot. Book a cabin with a tub if you're a bath lover (splurge on a suite and you may get a Jacuzzi). Your balcony: If you book a balcony cabin, take full advantage of your very own ocean views by staying in your bathrobe and ordering room service breakfast or dinner, served outdoors. Lines including Regent and Oceania will even deliver your meal course by course. Private cabanas/spaces: On some ships there is a hidden hot tub or patch of deck that few passengers discover, so it pays to read the deck plans carefully when looking for places to be at least semi alone. You can assure a degree of privacy by heading to the adults-only sundeck (a fee may be involved). Lines including Princess, Holland America Line and Celebrity Cruises also have open-air cabanas available to rent at the pool or elsewhere – the perfect place to listen to the ocean as you romantically hide away. Summary:","output":"Cruises offer various opportunities for couples to enjoy romantic moments together. Some of the most romantic spots on cruise ships include the smokestack for night smooching, the karaoke or piano bar for serenades, the spa for couple's massages, the promenade for stargazing strolls, specialty bars for toasting to love, dance clubs for dancing together, specialty restaurants for intimate dinners, cabins with balcony or veranda for private lounging, and private cabanas or spaces for secluded relaxation.

Google unveils new ‘Nexus 6′ smartphone, tablet and media player Google on Wednesday introduced a new lineup of gadgets showing off a new smartphone, tablet and streaming media player. The ambitious release takes on many of Google's top competitors ahead of the holiday season. The Nexus 6, made by Motorola, has a 6-inch screen that gives it a bigger profile than the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus that Apple introduced earlier this summer. The phone has a 13-inch megapixel camera and a battery life feature that will keep the phone running for six hours on just 15 minutes of charging time. The phone also has dual front-facing speakers that Google boasts will be good for watching video and playing games -- two of the fastest-growing uses for large-screen smartphones. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular will carry the phone. It will be available for pre-order on Oct. 17 and hit store shelves on Nov. 3, the company said. The phone will cost 649 for a 32GB version and 699 for a 64 GB version. In the tablet space, Google also introduced the Nexus 9 by HTC. The tablet, which has an 8.9-inch screen, lands somewhere between the size of a full-sized iPad and an iPad mini. Google is marketing it not only as a recreational device, but also as a stand-in for users's laptops, offering a separate keyboard accessory -- for \\"real work,\\" the company said in a blog post. That may be appealing to businesses, or just business people, many of whom are looking to tablets as portable work devices. That puts it squarely in the same category as Microsoft's Surface, which is heavily billed as a laptop replacement. The Nexus tablet will cost 399 for a 16GB version and 479 for a 32 GB version when it comes on on Oct. 29. LTE connectivity ups the price to 599. Google also introduced the Nexus Player, a streaming media console similar to a Roku or Apple TV. It's the first Google device to use its Android TV platform that the company introduced in June. In addition to carrying streaming video channels such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Google's own YouTube, the player also has a strong focus on games -- an quality also emphasized by Amazon for its Fire TV. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) The Nexus Player will cost 99 and comes with a voice-activated remote; its optional game controller costs 40. Finally, Google also took the wraps off the name for its latest operating system, previously only known as \\"L\\" -- which it's calling Lollipop. Google always names its operating systems after sweet treats and in alphabetical order. Lollipop, also known as Android 5.0, follows Android KitKat, which was released last year. The new operating system is designed to work on a number of devices including phones and tablets, as well as next-generation gadgets such as smart TVs and smart cars.

Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" From the very beginning, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" promised to provide a captivating and evocative cinematic experience but unfortunately fell well short of both expectations and its own hype. As a critic, I find myself hard-pressed to detail the numerous ways in which its narrative flounders, its characters falter, and its themes confuse rather than enlighten. The film's plot attempts to weave together an intricate tapestry of personal drama, social commentary, and thought-provoking questions, but the result is instead an indecipherable mess of lackluster scenes, tangents, and half-baked motivations. The pacing is noticeably inconsistent, sluggishly meandering in some points while frantically rushing key emotional moments in others, effectively diminishing their emotional resonance. Regarding the performances, it's unfortunate to report that the actors' talents are underutilized, as the subpar script does little to inspire. Many of the dialogue-heavy scenes resemble a choreographed reading rather than an impassioned display of realistic human relationships, despite the well-known names headlining the production. The chemistry between the leads is utterly unconvincing, and the array of secondary characters feels more like an afterthought than an essential part of the story. Visually, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" proves to be no saving grace. The uninspired cinematography, replete with cliche shots and predictable framing, does little to maintain the viewer's interest. Moreover, the special effects, which could have provided some level of stylistic excitement, are all too obviously low-budget and not up-to-par with contemporary film standards. The film's score likewise falls flat, consisting of a generic mix of sound design elements that detract from already weak sequences rather than imbuing them with any sense of atmosphere or urgency. One might even argue that the music runs counter to the film's purported themes, undermining the seriousness of the subject matter by its apparent incongruity with the visuals and narrative at play. Ultimately, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" is a film that is better left unheard and unseen, as it offers a lackluster experience to those who would seek an engaging, substantial time at the movies. Spectators who have encountered its promising trailers and marketing campaign will undoubtedly lament the wasted potential and money spent on what could have been a powerful study of the human condition. Instead, we are left with a poorly-executed production that leaves a bitter aftertaste, serving as a stark reminder of the need for quality storytelling, craftsmanship, and passion in filmmaking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vessel - A vessel usually refers to a container or a hollow structure for holding something, or a ship, boat, or other craft. It doesn't serve as a communication device like a radio. B. Box - A box here is unrelated to communication devices and serves primarily as a container to store or transport items. C. Transistor - A transistor radio is a type of radio that primarily relies on transistors as its primary electronic component for receiving and amplifying signals. Transistor radios are lightweight, portable, and can operate on low power, making them ideal for communication over moderate distances. Often, these radios are used in team activities or events where quick communication with a base or headquarters is essential. D. Submarine - A submarine is a watercraft capable of operating independently underwater. It is not a type of radio used for communication with a base. E. Lamp - A lamp is a device for producing artificial light, typically by using electricity. It is not a form of radio equipment or a communication device. By eliminating the unrelated choices, it becomes clear that a transistor radio is the appropriate choice for someone to use to reach base effectively."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: The Flintstones is light-hearted, and very entertaining, and sometimes that is all films are meant to do, entertain!

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: At a Sunset Boulevard mansion, the body of Joe Gillis floats in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death. Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware that he is the author. Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in a comeback. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor. Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who tells him Norma is subject to depression and has made suicide attempts. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. He tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party, he again meets Betty, who he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When Joe phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma. Norma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director, Cecil B. DeMille, at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole, but petulantly...

Given those answer options, answer the question: Question: what president made decision to buy louisiana? Would \\"At the time, the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought to be unconstitutional .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"While the provided answer choice briefly touches on some aspects of the Louisiana Purchase, it does not directly answer the question about which President made the decision to buy Louisiana. A more appropriate and detailed response would be: The President who made the decision to buy Louisiana was Thomas Jefferson. He was the third President of the United States, serving from 1801 to 1809. The Louisiana Purchase took place in 1803 when President Thomas Jefferson's administration secured a deal with France to acquire the territory of Louisiana, which was vast and stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, and from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. This land acquisition doubled the size of the United States at the time and was one of Thomas Jefferson's most significant achievements during his presidency. The total cost of the purchase was approximately 15 million. Although the answer choice you mentioned does not directly answer the question, it is crucial to address the constitutional concerns that arose during that time. The decision to buy Louisiana faced domestic opposition as some believed that the purchase went against the United States Constitution. They argued that nowhere in the Constitution was the federal government granted explicit power to acquire new territory. Nevertheless, President Jefferson decided to interpret the Constitution in a more flexible way, invoking the government's authority to negotiate treaties and make land deals. Despite the initial controversy surrounding the purchase, the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory proved to be a turning point in American history. It facilitated westward expansion, provided fertile land for agriculture and settlement, and led to significant economic growth. The Louisiana Purchase has been since regarded as one of the most consequential and far-reaching actions in the early history of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following was one of the ideals of Hellenistic art: sensuality, idealism, or stoicism? Context: Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.","output":"Step 1: Identify the question: The question is asking which of the following ideals was exemplified in Hellenistic art: sensuality, idealism, or stoicism.

Choices:  - optical device - garden patch - blender - pantry - vegetable stew  The rationale to choose \\"vegetable stew\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The potato becomes softer in a \\"vegetable stew\\". The rationale behind choosing \\"vegetable stew\\" as the answer is that a potato softens when cooked, particularly in a moist environment such as a stew. The heat from cooking in a stew breaks down the potato's cell walls, allowing the starch granules to absorb the liquid, swell and gelatinize, resulting in the potato becoming soft and tender. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices are not suitable: - Optical device: This is a completely unrelated category, which refers to any device that uses light, such as lenses, prisms, or mirrors, to manipulate the path or properties of light. It will not affect the texture of a potato. - Garden patch: This refers to a designated area of soil where plants, including potatoes, are grown. The potato may grow larger when it is still a part of a living potato plant, but it will not become softer in a garden patch. - Blender: A blender is a kitchen appliance used for blending, mixing, or puréeing food ingredients.

How is \\"Am I immediately nominated when I submit my blog?\\" said in Russian?","output":"In Russian, the question \\"Am I immediately nominated when I submit my blog?\\" can be translated as \\"Буду ли я немедленно номинирован, когда отправлю свой блог?\\" Here is a detailed breakdown of the translation:  1. \\"Am I\\" - \\"Буду ли я\\" (pronounced: budu li ya): In this context, \\"буду\\" is the first person singular form of the verb \\"to be\\" in future tense, which indicates that the subject (I) will be in a certain state. \\"ли\\" is a particle used in asking questions, similar to the English question mark. \\"я\\" means \\"I\\" and is the subject of the sentence. 2. \\"immediately\\" - \\"немедленно\\" (pronounced: nyemiedlyenno): This adverb is used to indicate that the action or event occurs right away, without any delay. It can be translated more precisely as \\"without delay\\" or \\"instantly.\\" 3. \\"nominated\\" - \\"номинирован\\" (pronounced: nominirovan): This word is derived from the verb \\"номинировать\\" (nominirovat'), which means \\"to nominate\\" or \\"to propose someone for a job, position, reward, etc.\\" In this case, \\"номинирован\\" is the passive past participle form in masculine gender, which is translated into English as \\"nominated.\\" 4. \\"when\\" - \\"когда\\" (pronounced: kogda): This conjunction connects two parts of a sentence and indicates the time of an action or event. In this case, it is used to link the main clause (\\"Буду ли я немедленно номинирован\\") with the subordinate clause (\\"когда отправлю свой блог\\"). 5. \\"I submit\\" - \\"отправлю\\" (pronounced: otpravlyu): This word is the main verb of the subordinate clause and is derived from the verb \\"отправлять\\" (otpravlyat'), which means \\"to send\\" or \\"to submit.\\" \\"Отправлю\\" is the first person singular form in future tense, which means \\"I will send\\" or \\"I will submit.\\" 6. \\"my\\" - \\"свой\\" (pronounced: svoi): This is a possessive pronoun that indicates ownership or possession. In this case, it refers to the speaker's blog, so it can be translated as \\"my.\\" 7. \\"blog\\" - \\"блог\\" (pronounced: blog): This word refers to a personal website or online journal where an individual can express their thoughts, ideas, etc. In Russian, the word \\"блог\\" is borrowed from English and is used in the same meaning. So the entire sentence \\"Буду ли я немедленно номинирован, когда отправлю свой блог?\\" can be understood as \\"Am I going to be nominated immediately when I submit my blog?\\" in English."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" elected president of in March 1863?, using the article: In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"In March 1863, the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. This man is Bedřich Smetana, an influential Czech composer who aimed to create operas that reflected the Czech national character."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

Question: suppose the directions are being read wrong happens, how will it affect If more water filters into the rocks.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If more water filters into the rocks than initially described in the process, it will have a \\"more\\" effect on the second effect mentioned, which is \\"The water freezes and thaws\\".  Justification: 1. More water seeping into the rocks means there's a greater volume of water available to freeze and thaw. The freezing and thawing process results in an expansion and contraction effect which applies pressure on the rock. 2. If there is more water present, the water when freezes will expand more, creating larger or more numerous cracks in the rocks during the freezing and thawing process. 3. This potentially accelerates the rate at which the rocks can crack and break down because of the increased pressure exerted by the larger volume of freezing and thawing water. 4. Additionally, the possibility of the cracks being filled with more water also increases, further enhancing the process of rock breakdown.  So, the supposed perturbation of more water filtering into the rocks would likely increase the effect of the water freezing and thawing process, leading to more cracks and quicker breakdown of the rocks."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

What is the answer?","output":"The only letter in the game of Scrabble that scores five points is the letter K.  Scrabble is a well-known board game that has enjoyed worldwide popularity since its first appearance in 1938, designed by Alfred Mosher Butts. The game revolves around forming words by placing lettered tiles on the board, with more points awarded for using less common letters. In Scrabble, each letter has a different point value. The scoring system is designed to balance the frequency of a letter in the English language and the difficulty in using it to form words. The letter K is assigned a relatively high score of five points because it is a less common letter and can be more challenging to use in word formation compared to other high-frequency letters. The point values for all the letters in Scrabble are as follows: - 1 point: A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, and U - 2 points: D and G - 3 points: B, C, M, and P - 4 points: F, H, V, W, and Y - 5 points: K - 8 points: J and X - 10 points: Q and Z While playing Scrabble, players are also awarded points based on the placement of their tiles on bonus squares that multiply the value of the letter or the entire word. Utilizing these squares strategically, in combination with high-scoring letters, maximizes players' scores."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In August 2015, it was announced that Bowie was writing songs for a Broadway musical based on the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon series. Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to The Times: \\"Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day. On 15 January, Blackstar debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart.

In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday.

With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

This article: In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

It is bordered on the north by Lake Huron, which is drained by the St. Clair River, the county's western border and part of the Canada-United States border. To the south is Lake Saint Clair and Chatham-Kent, another county in Ontario. Lambton County's northeastern border follows the Ausable River and Parkhill Creek north until it reaches Lake Huron at the beach community of Grand Bend. The county seat is in the Town of Plympton-Wyoming.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - The Huronian glaciation (or Makganyene glaciation) was a glaciation that extended from 2.4 billion years ago (Ga) to 2.1 Ga, during the Siderian and Rhyacian periods of the Paleoproterozoic era. The Huronian glaciation followed after the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), a time when increased atmospheric oxygen decreased atmospheric methane. The oxygen combined with the methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which does not retain heat as well as methane does.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Nunavut (from Inuktitut:  ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.  - Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States. The other four Great Lakes are shared by the U.S. and Canada. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. Lake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\". In the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found in addition to that of \\"Michigan\\".  - Lake MichiganHuron (also HuronMichigan) is the combined waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, which are joined through the wide, 20-fathom (120 ft; 37 m) deep, open-water Straits of Mackinac. Huron and Michigan are technically a single lake because the flow of water through the straits keeps their water levels in near-equilibrium. (Although the flow is generally eastward, the water moves in either direction depending on local conditions.) Combined, Lake MichiganHuron is the largest fresh water lake by area in the world. If Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are considered two separate lakes, Lake Superior is larger than either.  - The St. Clair River is a river in central North America which drains Lake Huron into Lake St. Clair, forming part of the international boundary between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan. The river is a significant component in the Great Lakes Waterway, with shipping channels permitting cargo vessels to travel between the upper and lower Great Lakes.  - Kettle Point 44 is an Indian reserve 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) northeast of Sarnia , Ontario , Canada , on the southern shore of Lake Huron . The reserve serves as the land base for the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nations . There are two nations on this reserve , Chippewas of Kettle Point , and Chippewas of Stony Point . Its area is 895.7 ha . They are two of 42 Anishinaabeg First Nations in Ontario , and belongs to the Union of Ontario Indians .  - Lake Huron is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. Hydrologically, it comprises the easterly portion of Lake MichiganHuron, having the same surface elevation as its westerly counterpart, to which it is connected by the , Straits of Mackinac. It is shared on the east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the west by the state of Michigan in the United States. The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region. The Huronian glaciation was named due to evidence collected from Lake Huron region. The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay. The main inlet is the St. Marys River and the main outlet is the St. Clair.  - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada. At a land area of approximately and a 2011 population of 41,462, it is the second largest and most populous of the three territories in Northern Canada. Its estimated population as of 2016 is 44,291. Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission.  - Le Griffon (\\"The Griffin\\") was a 17th-century barque built by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in his quest to find the Northwest Passage to China and Japan.  - The Indian Act (\\"An Act respecting Indians\\"), is a Canadian Act of Parliament that concerns registered Indians, their bands, and the system of Indian reserves. First passed in 1876 and still in force with amendments, it is the primary document which governs how the Canadian state interacts with the 614 First Nation bands in Canada and their members. Throughout its long history the Act has been an ongoing source of controversy and has been interpreted in many ways by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. The legislation has been amended many times, including \\"over twenty major changes\\" made by 2002.  - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.  - The Straits of Mackinac is a narrow waterway in the U.S. state of Michigan, between Michigan's Lower and Upper Peninsulas. The Straits of Mackinac connect two of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The straits are wide and deep. Hydrologically, the two connected lakes can be considered one, which is called Lake MichiganHuron. Historically, the region around the Straits was known by the native Odawa people as Michilimackinac.  - In Canada, an Indian reserve is specified by the Indian Act as a \\"tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.\\"  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis.  - Southwestern Ontario is a secondary region of Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario, centered on the city of London. It occupies most of a peninsula that is bound on three sides by water: Lake Huron, including Georgian Bay, to the north and northwest; the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River, to the west; and Lake Erie to the south. To the east, on land, Southwestern Ontario is bounded by Central Ontario and the Golden Horseshoe. The region had a population of 2,504,878 in 2011.  - Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and had a 2011 population of 72,366. It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River, which forms the Canada-United States border, directly across from Port Huron, Michigan. The city's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle, who named the site \\"The Rapids\\" when he had horses and men pull his barque \\"Le Griffon\\" up the almost four-knot current of the St. Clair River on 23 August 1679.  - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area.  - Georgian Bay (French: \\"Baie Georgienne\\") is a large bay of Lake Huron, located entirely within Ontario, Canada. The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island. To its northwest is the North Channel.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Suspect in Russian Spy Case Felt Unappreciated by Handlers For years, Richard Murphy lived a seemingly cushy life: a stay-at-home dad living in a suburban house allegedly paid for by the Russian government, and apparently producing remarkably little espionage. Yet court documents paint Mr. Murphy as a whiny, disgruntled spy-agency employee even while he served as a ringleader, passing cash and computer equipment to his alleged co-conspirators. Suspects Richard and Cynthia Murphy, in an undated photo, picnic at the apartment building where they formerly lived in Hoboken, N.J. Mr. Murphy was set to leave the country Sunday, possibly for good, said people familiar with the investigation. Authorities feared losing Mr. Murphy, triggering the arrest of the alleged \\"deep cover\\" spy ring they had been shadowing for at least a decade. All but one of the 11 members of the alleged ring remain in federal custody. One suspect apparently jumped bail Wednesday. Christopher Metsos, who the Federal Bureau of Investigation said shuttled between Moscow and the U.S. to coordinate the spy network, had been arrested Tuesday in Cyprus while preparing to board a flight to Budapest, Hungary. He posted bail as the U.S. sought extradition on charges of conspiracy to conduct espionage and money laundering \\"After he failed to show up at the police station by 8:00 p.m., we sought him at his hotel to see if he was okay, and there we determined that he had fled,\\" said a senior Cyprus police official speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr. Murphy's lawyer declined to comment. Ms. Murphy's attorney did not respond to messages. Mr. Metsos' lawyer could not be identified. Mr. Murphy was one of 10 people arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to act as unregistered agents of a foreign government; nine have bail hearings scheduled for Thursday and the tenth on Monday. Read more about the spy suspects and allegations against them in the complaints. Businesswoman Anna Chapman, arrested earlier this week on suspicion of being a spy for Russia, speaks about her fledgling enterprise at a conference for entrepreneurs in New York in April. Mr. Metsos was one of those who fielded Mr. Murphy's complaints. In 2002, for example, the FBI says it recorded a testy exchange between the two suspects. Mr. Murphy let loose with a litany of frustrations, to which Mr. Metsos acidly replied, \\"Well, I'm so happy I'm not your handler.\\" Just three months ago, Mr. Murphy, known to the FBI as \\"defendant #2'' and to his alleged spy handlers as \\"A,'' griped to another suspect that their bosses back home didn't appreciate the difficulties they faced. \\"They don't understand what we go through over here,'' Mr. Murphy said during a covert meeting in Brooklyn, according to FBI court papers. And in the summer of 2009, according to the FBI, Mr. Murphy and his wife, Cynthia Murphy, got into a dispute with their bosses at an intelligence headquarters known as \\"Center,\\" over whether they should buy their New Jersey home. Their handlers allegedly insisted the spy agency own the home. Court documents portray Mr. Murphy as the biggest fish in the group of alleged spies living in the U.S. under false identities. He met regularly with Mr. Metsos, the group's contact from Center, taking bundles of cash and splitting it up with other members of the group, according to the FBI. Earlier this year, Mr. Murphy flew to Moscow for a week with a laptop Center had told him to buy: an Asus EE PC 1005HA-P. He returned to the U.S. with the same model laptop, giving it to one of his alleged co-conspirators to communicate with Center, according to the FBI. Mr. Murphy and his wife, Cynthia Murphy, appear to have been the operation's most productive members, according to documents released by authorities. Ms. Murphy, who worked at Morea Financial Services, a firm in lower Manhattan that offered tax advice, allegedly met several times with an unnamed New York financier who was identified by authorities as a political donor and friend of a sitting cabinet official. Financier Alan Patricof said in a statement Wednesday that he met with Ms. Murphy a few times and spoke with her frequently on the phone since retaining Morea Financial Services 2½ years ago to handle his personal accounting and tax services. \\"We never—not once—discussed any matter other than my finances and certainly she never inquired about, nor did we ever discuss, any matters relating to politics, the government, or world affairs,\\" Mr. Patricof said. \\"Since I understand she was employed by Morea approximately ten years before I became a client, I highly doubt that I could have been an intended target by her.\\" Ms. Murphy's financial job put her in regular contact with wealthy people. Former employees at her company, and at Morea & Schwartz, a law firm in the same building that was run by the husband of Ms. Murphy's boss, described her as a sweet, unassuming woman who spoke with an accent; one former co-worker thought she was from Belgium. \\"There was nothing out of the ordinary about her,\\" said Aliza Herzberg, 40 years old, who worked at Morea & Schwartz. Another employee, who did not want to be named, said Ms. Murphy was shy when she began working there but gradually opened up.—except when it came to her husband. \\"Anything having to do with her husband was completely off limits,\\" this person said. Ms. Murphy had urged her husband to \\"improve his information-collection efforts,\\" according to court documents. Yet both she and their alleged Moscow bosses advised Mr. Murphy against taking a job that would require an extensive background check, according to the FBI. That reluctance to penetrate the U.S. government epitomizes one of the biggest mysteries of the alleged spy ring: It did not appear to garner many U.S. government secrets. Indeed, from information released so far, none of the alleged spies worked for the government, though some moved in elite circles. Accused spy Anna Chapman lived for several years in London, where she attended elite charity balls and worked at places such as Barclays PLC. Another suspect, Donald Howard Healthfield, graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and ran a consulting firm targeting governments and businesses. One of the Murphys' neighbors, who asked not to be named, also noticed \\"unusual\\" traits. \\"He clearly was Russian with a name of Murphy—I thought it was weird,\\" said the neighbor, who lived near their home in Montclair, N.J., which records show the Murphys purchased in August 2008 for 481,000. When news broke of their arrest, this person said, \\"I just wasn't that surprised.\\" Write to Evan Perez at evan.perez@wsj.com and Alkman Granitsas at alkman.granitsas@dowjones.com Summary:","output":"Richard Murphy, a suspect in a Russian spy case, was reportedly unhappy with his spy handlers.

The statement talks about the eventual dominance of the Babylonian Empire in the south of Mesopotamia, rather than the specific dynasty of Ur that signaled the last great Sumerian renaissance. To answer your question, the Third Dynasty of Ur, also known as the Neo-Sumerian Empire or Ur III, was the last great Sumerian renaissance. The Third Dynasty of Ur emerged in the late 21st century BC (circa 2112-2004 BC) and marked a period of significant political, cultural, and economic revival in the region. During the reign of the Third Dynasty of Ur, the Sumerian civilization expanded its territory and influence significantly. The kings of this period, such as Ur-Nammu, Shulgi, and others, were highly effective rulers. They enacted administrative, legal, and economic reforms that resulted in the growth and stability of the empire. Sumerian art and architecture also witnessed a revival, with the construction of several magnificent temples and palaces, and the creation of intricate works of art. However, the Third Dynasty of Ur experienced a decline around the 21st century BC, due to external pressures from neighboring civilizations and internal conflicts. Following the fall of the Third Dynasty, Mesopotamia entered a period of political fragmentation, with the emergence of various regional powers, ultimately leading to the rise of the Babylonian Empire in the south, as described in the statement provided.

And shortly after that what ensues is a cringe-worthy combination of fiction and truth where the late Parsons girlfriend, Kaufman's girlfriend, Parsons stone-faced father, and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock (so to speak) in trying to catch Kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch Parsons body!  The film's incompetent direction, bad acting, and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the Titanic. And not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place. The accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies, as far as I've heard them, include: number 1., Parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child, so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriend's and the chasing and whatnot?, number 2., Kaufman's drugged-out buddy was a known willing participant (unlike what the movie attempts to portray) in the disposing of Parson's body, and finally number 3., Gram Parsons real-life father died when he was just a boy, and so it was Parson's step-father (who could have honestly cared less about Gram Parsons when he was still alive) in real-life that took care of the body after it was torched! Altogether though, what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real Phil Kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story. And yet still, the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind, frankly!  Also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned it's lead character, played by the ultra-grating Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman), is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie, and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical, brain-dead, or seem utterly clueless as to what they're actually doing there in the first place! Overall, if you like Johnny Knoxville and or really dig the so-bad-they're-not-even-good buddy flicks then I suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie! But, if you're like me and are a fan of the late Gram Parsons, enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they're based on an actual real-life story, and or you just like good films, be-them road movies, or fictional slice-of-life stuff, you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise. I obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place, but since it was made I would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did, unfortunately! Maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of Gram Parsons life...not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it. But, until that time comes all we as an audience, and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an all-around terrible memorial (of sorts) to the musical legacy that Gram Parsons was known to have left behind. It should also be noted that they did actually use Parsons music, and a few others as well in the flick, but not surprisingly though, you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit. (Turkey-Zero Stars)","output":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the film's inaccuracies, bad acting, incompetent direction, and offbeat tone. They describe the movie as a waste of film and a terrible memorial to Gram Parsons' musical legacy, ultimately giving it a rating of zero stars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film. But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \\"gun rights\\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.

Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would Kenya have less or more organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania?  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. The answer to this question is:","output":"Kenya would have less organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Lucas is accused of killing Elliana Lucas-Jamason and attempting to kill the 10-year-old brother of the girl before investigators said she tried killing herself.            A newly released arrest report reveals the alleged suicide note police found in a word document in an open computer at the scene.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Quality Street, a 1937 period film made by RKO Radio Pictures, was based on the 1901 play of the same name by what Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan? Answer:","output":"Quality Street, a 1937 period film produced by RKO Radio Pictures, was based on the 1901 play of the same name by the renowned Scottish novelist and playwright Sir James Matthew Barrie, better known as J.M. Barrie. Born on May 9, 1860, in Kirriemuir, Angus, Scotland, Barrie achieved immense success as a playwright and author during his lifetime. His most famous and enduring creation, Peter Pan, has captivated the hearts and imaginations of millions of readers and theatergoers for over a century. The play Quality Street was first performed on March 11, 1901, at the Vaudeville Theatre in London. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and revolves around two sisters, Phoebe and Susan Throssel, who fall in love with the same man, Dr. Valentine Brown. When Brown leaves to serve as a soldier, news of his purported engagement to a beautiful heiress breaks Phoebe's heart. To regain his attention, Phoebe creates a younger, flirtatious alter ego, \\"Miss Livvy,\\" which leads to various complications and ultimately a happy resolution for the sisters. The transition from stage to screen took place in 1937 with the release of the film adaptation, directed by George Stevens. The movie starred Katharine Hepburn as Phoebe Throssel, Franchot Tone as Valentine Brown, and Fay Bainter as Susan Throssel. The film makes use of the features and techniques available in cinema to enrich the storytelling, offering viewers a visual representation of the characters, settings, and emotions that were originally crafted for live theater. The film earned both critical acclaim and commercial success in its time. J.M. Barrie’s wide-ranging body of work cemented his reputation as a skilled playwright and storyteller, but it is undoubtedly his creation of Peter Pan, the boy who wouldn't grow up, that has left the most enduring impact on popular culture. First introduced in the 1902 novel The Little White Bird, Peter Pan eventually became the protagonist of Barrie's most famous play, Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, written in 1904. This was later adapted into the novel Peter and Wendy in 1911. Peter Pan explores themes of childhood, innocence, and the fleeting nature of time while continuing to inspire numerous adaptations, sequels, and reinterpretations in literature, film, television, and theater. In summary, the 1937 period film Quality Street was based on the 1901 play of the same name by the illustrious Scottish novelist and playwright J.M. Barrie. While Barrie may be best remembered for his creation of Peter Pan, his other works like Quality Street demonstrate his mastery of storytelling, engaging characters, and the exploration of deeper themes and emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mixture of negative emotions, mainly annoyance and pain, with a touch of humor. Let me break this down further: 1. Negative emotions: The user is clearly expressing their discomfort by stating that they've been hit in the face with a bouncy ball, followed by the interjection \\"OUCH.\\" This communicates that the experience was unpleasant and painful. Additionally, they mention \\"curse my brother,\\" suggesting annoyance or frustration with their sibling who is presumably responsible for the incident. 2. Humor: Despite the negative emotions being communicated, the tweet also possesses a light-hearted undertone. The use of multiple exclamation points, the casual tone, and the mention of a bouncy ball (instead of a more dangerous object) imply that the situation is not extremely serious or harmful, and that the user is willing to laugh about it. This adds a humorous element to the tweet, showing that even though they are upset, the user can still view the incident in a lighthearted manner. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is primarily negative due to the user's expression of pain and annoyance. However, the addition of a humorous element indicates that the user is not deeply upset by the incident and can still find some amusement in the situation. This makes the overall sentiment a blend of negative emotions and humor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

(April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) God and Lucifer are engaged in a war for the souls of humanity; a standing wager for the souls of all mankind. Angels and demons are forbidden to manifest on Earth, but they are allowed to possess and influence humans, and half-breeds are used to peddle influence. Exorcist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see angels and demons. At age 15, he committed suicide to escape his visions, but he was revived after spending two minutes in Hell, though John explains that since time moves differently in Hell 2 minutes feels like a full lifetime. Consequently, his soul is bound for Hell when he dies for the sin of taking his own life. John exorcises a girl possessed by a soldier demon trying to break through to Earth, something that should not be possible, as demons cannot take their true physical form on the mortal plane. John seeks an audience with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton). He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer; but Gabriel declines, telling John that his motives for exorcising demons are selfish and will not earn him entry into Heaven. After he leaves Gabriel, John repels an attack by a full demon out in the open. This encounter prompts him to meet with former witch doctor Papa Midnite (Djimon Hounsou) who informs him that all of Hell is waiting for him to die and that he is the one soul Lucifer would come to collect himself. There, John also encounters half-breed demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale). Midnite refuses to become involved, wanting to retain the balance between Heaven and Hell.

The 22nd film, previously known only as \\"Bond 22\\", will be called \\"Quantum of Solace\\". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming. Can we infer the following? The name was based on a short story by Ian Fleming.","output":"Yes, we can infer that the name of the 22nd James Bond film, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" was based on a short story by Bond creator Ian Fleming. The eponymous short story was part of the collection titled \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" which comprises various narratives featuring the iconic British secret agent James Bond. EON Productions, the company responsible for producing the Bond films, made the announcement regarding the film's title at Pinewood Studios, where the movie had been in production since the previous year. The decision to derive the title from a short story within Ian Fleming's work is a homage to the original source material and demonstrates the filmmakers' intention to draw inspiration from the essence of the Bond character that Fleming created. By connecting the film to the literary origins of James Bond, the choice of title also serves to reinforce the relationship between the movie series and its roots, potentially attracting both new and old fans of the franchise. The \\"Quantum of Solace\\" short story itself is not a typical action-oriented Bond narrative but rather an introspective exploration of empathy and human relationships. The story focuses on a conversation about the importance of a \\"quantum of solace,\\" meaning a minimal level of comfort and reassurance, as a fundamental requirement for healthy relationships. The incorporation of this subtle yet powerful theme into the storyline of the film suggests a more nuanced and layered portrayal of the James Bond character than seen in previous adaptations. By choosing this title for the 22nd film in the series, EON Productions and the creative team behind \\"Quantum of Solace\\" may have been signaling a certain level of depth, character development, and narrative complexity that could add an additional dimension to the longstanding James Bond film series. This could indicate that, while the contemporary Bond may be engaged in extraordinary situations and intense action sequences typical of the franchise, the film may also delve into intriguing themes derived from Ian Fleming's literary work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that composed the four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent?, using the article: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971,...

News article: A DECISION by an Islamic seminary for women to name its library after former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden has caused a controversy in Pakistan's capital.      Maulana Abdul Aziz of the Red Mosque, known for its alleged links to militant groups, renamed the school's existing library Maktbah Usama bin Laden Shaheed - Urdu for Osama bin Laden, the martyr.      Aziz said the main objective of the initiative was to show \\"respect\\" for bin Laden.      \\"He is our hero, and we do not care if the world calls him a terrorist,\\" the cleric said.      The library is situated in the centre of Islamabad, about half a kilometre from the headquarters of Pakistan's intelligence agency, which has been accused of protecting the former al-Qaeda chief before he was killed by the US military in 2011 during a raid in Pakistan.      Commentators have referred to the renaming of the library as inappropriate and have branded it an embarrassment for the government and its security institutions, which have come under fire for failing to curb the activities of extremist groups.      \\"It is a huge embarrassment,\\" security expert Hasan Askari Rizvi said.      \\"It shows that the government is confused, and it does not have a clear policy towards the groups who cherish al-Qaeda ideology.\\" ||||| ISLAMABAD (AP) — Most didn't notice the new library at this Islamic seminary for girls near Pakistan's capital, until locals saw the paper sign in Urdu posted on its wooden door: \\"Library of Osama bin Laden, the Martyr.\\"      Maulana Abdul Aziz, left, head cleric of a Pakistani seminary, talks to visitor in a library named after slain al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, Friday, April 18, 2014 in Islamabad, Pakistan. A controversial... (Associated Press)      Cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz, a radical preacher who runs the Jamia Hafsa madrassa, wanted to honor the memory of the al-Qaida leader, killed in a May 2011 raid by U.S. Navy SEALs on his hiding place in Abbottabad, a garrison town about 125 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital, Islamabad.      But while the library's name has garnered attention across Pakistan, a country where public opinion remains strongly anti-American and religious students today still idolize the man behind the Sept. 11 terror attacks, his image increasingly has faded from public view in recent years. As Pakistan has seen thousands killed in its own war against its local Taliban, a public that once named its own children after the Saudi millionaire has grown increasingly angry with militant violence.      Pictures of bin Laden and stores bearing his name once dotted the countryside of Pakistan, where U.S. drone strikes against militants have grown increasingly unpopular over civilian casualties. Islamists held small rallies across Pakistan after the raid to denounce his killing, which embarrassed the country's military for not detecting it. The slain al-Qaida chief is still regarded as a hero by most students at Islamic schools, or madrassas.      But this image spread as a symbol in part because at the beginning of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, many supported the Taliban there. But since there were no images of its leader, Mullah Omar, they adopted the bearded images of bin Laden instead.      As Pakistani authorities began arresting Taliban leaders and associates of bin Laden, the public grew increasingly scared about showing his image. Those that remained up slowly faded away in the sun or washed away in torrential, seasonal rains.      Aziz's naming of the library is the first public remembrance of bin Laden in some time, capturing the attention of local media. For Aziz, bin Laden is an icon, the cleric's spokesman Tehsin Ullah told The Associated Press on Friday.      \\"Aziz thinks that Osama bin Laden is a hero and he is a martyr and that is why he selected Osama bin Laden's name for the library,\\" Ullah said.      The madrassas are an important aspect of education in the predominantly Muslim Pakistan, and tens of thousands of students study there. Most of the religious schools provide free food, tuition and even board for students who come from other parts of the country. Some also serve to radicalize youth to join militants. Aziz's students have joined anti-American protests put on by the hard-line cleric.      Aziz is a prayer leader at Islamabad's Red Mosque — a former militant hideout that the army on orders from then-President Pervez Musharraf raided in 2007. The raid killed dozens of extremists and others and unleashed a wave of retaliatory militant attacks across Pakistan.      Aziz was arrested by police during the raid when he tried to escape wearing a burqa. Later freed, he began running a boy's and girl's school connected to the mosque.      The newly constructed, one-room library is located inside the school compound, next to a computer room and Aziz's office. There were no visible books or portraits of bin Laden inside the library when Associated Press journalists visited Friday. Abdul Rehman, the school's administrator, said it only will carry books about the teachings of Islam.      Rehman refused to discuss bin Laden, saying girls at the school also learned computer skills. However, Rehman stopped journalists from speaking to students, saying Islam doesn't allow men who are not family members to interact with female students or teachers.      ___      Associated Press writers Riaz Khan in Peshawar, Pakistan, and Rebecca Santana contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A school for girls in Pakistan decided to name its library after Osama bin Laden, a man who was once the leader of a group called al-Qaeda.

This is hard to do in a world with so many competing demands. Good parents consciously plan and devote time to parenting. They make developing their child’s character their top priority. Once you're a parent, you have to learn to put your priorities below your children's, and to make the sacrifice. Of course, you shouldn't neglect yourself completely, but you should get accustomed to the idea of putting your child's needs first.  If you have a spouse, then you can take turns caring for the child so each of you can have some \\"me time.\\" When you plan your weekly routine, your child's needs should be your primary focus. Try to unplug from the digital world and other non-familial obligations when you're spending time with your children. Your 15 year old will particular appreciate this. Helping to nurture a love for the written word will help your child to develop a love for reading later on. Set a time for reading for your child every day -- typically around bedtime or nap time. Spend at least half an hour to an hour reading to your child each day, if not more. Not only will your child develop a love for words, but your child will have a better chance of both academic and behavioral success. Studies show that children that were read to on a daily basis demonstrate less bad behavior in school.  Once your child starts learning to read or write, let your child take over. Don't correct his or her mistakes every two seconds, or your child will get discouraged. It's fine to reread your child's favorite stories. This can help them develop fluency if your child enjoys what you're reading. One of the most dangerous trends in the modern family is the dying of the family meal. The dinner table is not only a place of sustenance and family business but also a place for the teaching and passing on of our values. Manners and rules are subtly absorbed over the table. Family mealtime should communicate and sustain ideals that children will draw on throughout their lives.  If your child is a picky eater, don't spend dinner time criticizing your child's eating habits and watching what he or she doesn't eat like a hawk. This will lead your child to have a negative association with family meals. Get your child involved in the meal. Dinner will be more fun if your child \\"helps\\" you pick out food at the grocery store or helps you set up the table or to do small food-related tasks, such as washing the vegetables you will cook. An older child can obviously handle more than vegetable washing. Involve all the family in menu planning for the family. Keep dinner conversation open and light. Don't give your child the third-degree. Simply ask, \\"How was your day?\\" This is also the time to model sharing details about your day. Doing so will help you get more detailed information from your child without being overbearing. Try serving family-style meals, where your children get to choose portions and what meal components are on their plate. This is a great chance to teach them healthy eating habits that can last a lifetime. Though your child doesn't have to go to bed during the same five-minute stretch every single night, you should set a bedtime routine that your child can follow and stick to it. Studies show that children's cognitive abilities can drop two full grade levels after just one missed hour of sleep, so it's important that they get as much rest as they can before you send them to school.  Your routine should include some winding-down time. Turn off the TV, music, or any electronics, and either talk to your child softly in bed or read to them. Don't give your child sugary snacks right before bed or it'll be harder to get them to sleep. Though you don't have to sign your child up for ten different activities each week, you should find at least one or two activities that your child loves to do and incorporate them into your child's weekly routine. This can be anything from soccer to art class -- it really doesn't matter, as long as your child shows a talent or a love for something. Tell your child what a great job he's doing and encourage him to keep going.  Taking your child to different lessons will also help him or her socialize with other children. Don't get lazy. If your child complains that she doesn't want to go to piano lessons, but you know she likes it deep down, don't give in just because you don't feel like driving over there. \\"Play time\\" does not mean having your child sit in front of the TV and suck on a building block while you do the dishes. \\"Play time\\" means letting your child sit in his room or play area and to actively engage with stimulating toys while you help him explore their possibilities. Though you may be tired, it's important that you show your child the benefits of playing with his toys so he gets the stimulation he needs and so he learns to play with them on his own. It doesn't matter if you don't have 80 million toys for your child to play with. It's the quality, not the quantity of the toys that counts. And you may find that your child's favorite toy of the month is an empty toilet paper roll.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of prioritizing a child's needs, maintaining consistent routines, and engaging in interactive activities to support their overall development, academic and behavioral success, and long-lasting family bonds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The soft sediment helps to preserve the remains, while the water protects them from scavengers and disturbances that can damage the remains. As more layers of sediment build up over the remains, the pressure from the overlying layers compresses the sediments, preserving the original shape and structure of the remains. As decomposition takes place, the organic components of the remains break down, leaving behind trace amounts of the original material. Over time, these traces are replaced by minerals that seep into the remains through groundwater and chemical processes. This gradual replacement of organic material with minerals leads to the formation of a fossil. If more animals die and sink underwater, it will result in more fossil formation. This is because the process of fossilization tends to be more effective underwater, where remains can be rapidly covered with sediment, preventing disturbances from natural factors such as wind, weather, and scavengers. Additionally, underwater conditions often create anaerobic (low-oxygen) environments that slow the decomposition rate, allowing for better preservation of the remains and increasing their chances of becoming fossilized. However, it is essential to note that not all remains that end up underwater will eventually become fossils. Factors like the rate of sedimentation, the nature of the surrounding environment, and the type of species dying and being buried in the sediment all play a role in determining how many fossils will be formed. But overall, an increase in animals dying and sinking underwater would likely increase the likelihood of more fossils forming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What best describes the role of humans in a food web containing these plants?","output":"In the context of a food web containing plants like corn and peas, humans play the role of primary consumers, secondary consumers, and ecosystem influencers. It is important to understand the concept of a food web and how it illustrates the complex interactions between different living organisms at various trophic levels in an ecosystem. A food web consists of multiple food chains, which depict the transfer of energy through the consumption of one organism by another. In a typical food web, there are primary producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and decomposers. Primary producers, such as corn and pea plants, are autotrophs that convert sunlight, water, and nutrients into food energy through photosynthesis. These plants produce seeds as a means of reproduction, and humans consume these seeds in the form of food. As primary consumers, humans directly consume the plants' seeds. The role of humans in this case is closer to that of herbivores in the food chain, like rabbits, deer, or insects that feed on plant matter. By consuming the seeds, humans gain the energy that was stored by the primary producers. However, humans can also be secondary consumers, depending on the type of diet they follow. For example, if a human consumes chicken that has been fed with corn or peas, the human is acting as a secondary consumer. In this case, the energy is channeled from the primary producer (the corn or pea plant) to the primary consumer (the chicken), and finally to the secondary consumer (the human). As ecosystem influencers, humans impact the growth and population size of these plants and other organisms in the food web. This influence occurs through various agricultural practices, such as farming, irrigation, and the use of pesticides, as well as other human activities like deforestation, urbanization, and industrial pollution. These human-induced changes can lead to the alteration of natural habitats, availability of resources, and distribution of species, thereby affecting the overall equilibrium of the food web. In summary, humans play a multifaceted role in a food web containing corn and pea plants. They act as primary consumers by directly consuming these plants' seeds and as secondary consumers when they consume organisms that have fed on corn and peas. However, their influence extends beyond simple consumption, as humans also have a significant impact on the ecosystem through various practices and activities that shape the structure of the food web and the interconnectedness of its organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic-book style animation, aesthetically similar to what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller achieved with 'Sin City (2005),' but this film employed motion capture with live-actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format. Presented in stark black-and-white, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of Paris looms ominously above us. Directed by French filmmaker Christian Volckman, in his feature-length debut, 'Renaissance' draws significantly from other films in the science-fiction genre, and the tech-noir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before, but, from a technical standpoint, it is faultless. The year is 2054. The city of Paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths, the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings. The city's largest corporation, Avalon, achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth, and the company's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process. Ilona Tasuiev (voiced by Romola Garai in the English-language version, which I watched) , a brilliant young scientist, is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work, and so it falls to legendary detective Barthélémy Karas (Daniel Craig) to uncover her current whereabouts. Possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is Bislane (Catherine McCormack), Ilona's hardened elder sister, whose trustworthiness is in question, and Jonas Muller (Ian Holm), the dedicated medical doctor who adored Ilona as his own daughter. The eerie, dimly-lit city of Paris is reminiscent of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner (1982),' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from Tom Cruise in 'Minority Report (2002)' {which was, coincidentally, also set in the year 2054}. However, despite this familiarity, Volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit. Blending classic film-noir and science-fiction, the result is an eye-catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows, which, I should warn, occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes. The dialogue is a little banal at times, and the story, though engaging, doesn't offer anything strikingly original {except for the ending, which I thought was a bold twist on the usual formula}, but 'Renaissance' is intended to work best as a visual treat, and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied.","output":"[+] positive"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was in trouble because he was involved in helping a group of people, called a drug cartel, move lots of illegal drugs from Mexico to Detroit.

In court, Leo said he was very sad about what he did and said he didn't want to live if he had to go to prison.  His lawyer tried to help him by saying that Leo has a brain problem called dementia which made him make bad choices. The lawyer also talked about how brave Leo was during a big war called World War II, when he fought against really bad people called Nazis. However, the judge didn't think it was a good excuse, because many people have dementia and they don't break the law. So, the judge decided that Leo must go to prison for three years.

Here's what you need to consider: 1. **Local Tap Water Quality**: If your local tap water is safe for human consumption, it's generally safe for dogs as well. Make sure to check local water quality reports if you're concerned about contaminants. Some owners prefer to use a water filter to remove any potential contaminants from tap water before giving it to their pets. 2. **Sensitive Dogs**: Some dogs may have sensitive stomachs or health issues that make them more susceptible to problems from water contaminants. In such cases, providing filtered or bottled water might be better for your dog. 3. **Travelling**: If you're traveling with your dog, especially to places where the tap water quality is questionable, bottled water is a safer option to prevent gastrointestinal upset or exposure to harmful contaminants. 4. **Environmental Considerations**: Using bottled water can have a negative environmental impact due to plastic waste. You might want to consider a more sustainable option, like filtering tap water. 5. **Cost**: Bottled water can be significantly more expensive than tap water over time. 6. **Emergency Situations**: In situations where there is a warning about tap water safety (like after natural disasters or during water treatment failures), bottled water is a necessary alternative for both humans and pets. If you decide to give your dog bottled water because of specific concerns about your tap water quality, regularly check for updates on your local water quality and consider whether those concerns remain relevant. It's always a good idea to talk to your veterinarian if you have concerns about the best type of water for your dog, especially if your dog has any health issues or dietary needs."},{"instruction":"If I give my dog bottled water that people drink, will he get stones?","output":"The formation of urinary stones (uroliths) in dogs depends on a variety of factors and is not solely determined by the type of water they drink, whether bottled or tap. Here are a few factors that contribute to the risk of stone formation in dogs: 1. **Diet**: Dietary factors, such as high levels of certain minerals (like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium) and proteins, can contribute to the development of stones. Commercially prepared dog foods are usually formulated to maintain a balance of these nutrients, but some dogs may require special diets if they have a history of stone formation. 2. **Genetics**: Some dog breeds are genetically predisposed to developing urinary stones, regardless of whether they drink bottled water or tap water. 3. **Urine pH**: The pH level of a dog's urine can influence stone formation. Some stones form in acidic urine, while others form in alkaline urine. The water they drink is only one of many factors that can affect urine pH. 4. **Water Intake**: Adequate water intake is important to prevent stone formation, as it helps to dilute the urine and reduce the concentration of minerals that can form stones. Whether the water comes from the tap or a bottle, the key is that the dog drinks enough of it. 5. **Underlying Health Issues**: Certain health problems, such as urinary tract infections and metabolic disorders, can increase the risk of stone formation. If you're concerned about the risk of urinary stones in your dog, the best approach is to provide fresh, clean water at all times, whether it's from a safe tap source or bottles, and to work with your veterinarian to manage your dog's diet and health to minimize risk factors. If your dog has a history of urinary stones, your veterinarian may recommend a prescription diet or supplements to help prevent recurrence. In summary, giving your dog bottled water in and of itself is unlikely to cause stone formation. Instead, focus on the overall diet, health management, genetics, and ensuring your dog remains well-hydrated with clean water."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

into piercing, slashing, and impact for an rpg?","output":"The division of physical damage into subtypes such as piercing, slashing, and impact (or bludgeoning) in an RPG (Role-Playing Game) is a common system used by many tabletop RPGs, video games, and other interactive experiences to add depth and strategy to combat. However, whether this system is too complicated depends on several factors: 1. Target Audience: If your players are experienced gamers who are familiar with complex systems, they might appreciate the added strategic layer. For newcomers, it might be more of a barrier to entry. 2. Game Complexity: This type of damage system would add another layer of complexity. If your game already features a lot of systems and mechanics, adding more could potentially overwhelm players. Conversely, if your game is relatively straightforward, it could enrich the experience. 3. Game Balance: Implementing different damage types requires careful balancing to ensure no one type is overwhelmingly powerful or weak. It also means you'll need to design armor, spells, and abilities to interact meaningfully with these damage types. 4. Design Philosophy: Consider whether the addition of damage types aligns with the philosophy and goals of your game. If realism and tactical depth are priorities, this damage system might make sense. If the goal is fast-paced, easy-to-learn gameplay, it could be too cumbersome. 5. Flavor and Setting: Some settings lend themselves well to detailed damage types. For example, a fantasy RPG with a focus on arms and armor would be a great match. A sci-fi or abstract setting might not benefit as much from this level of detail. Here are some pros and cons to consider: **Pros:** - Adds tactical depth: Players need to consider the best type of attack for each enemy. - Enhances immersion: Differentiates between weapons and makes the game world feel more realistic. - Encourages diversity in player equipment and tactics, as they might carry various weapons to exploit weaknesses. **Cons:** - Increased complexity: More for players to learn and for designers to balance. - Potential information overload: Players might struggle to remember which enemies are vulnerable to which types of damage or what type of damage their attacks do. - Slower gameplay: Players may take longer to make decisions if they have to consider multiple damage types. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the desired complexity, playstyle, and what best serves the game's overall experience. If you do decide to implement this system, make sure to introduce it in a way that is clear and accessible to your players, with good reference materials and perhaps a tutorial segment."},{"instruction":"Physical damage seems a bit barebones in my rpg. There are different types of weapon (swords, axes, spears, daggers, ranged, and unarmed) and I attempted to give them more identity with special abilities depending on the class' usable weapons (for example, a hunter can use axes and ranged weapons) usable when a special gauge fills up. But looking at magic, which has 8 types of basic damage + more elements based on combinations of the original 8, I felt that physical damage needed a boost. Otherwise only magical classes would seem interesting and with a suitable complexity","output":"It’s great that you’re thinking about how to provide depth to your RPG combat system, especially concerning giving physical damage types more nuance to rival the complexity of the magical system. Differentiating physical damage types beyond special abilities can indeed make martial classes more interesting and provide a richer tactical experience. Here are some ideas you might consider: **1. Damage Type Specific Effects:** Each type of physical damage could have potential secondary effects. For example: - **Piercing:** High chance to critical hit or bypass armor. - **Slashing:** Can cause bleeding for damage over time. - **Impact/Bludgeoning:** Can stun or knockback enemies. **2. Environmental and Contextual Interactions:** Allow the environment or context to influence the effectiveness of weapon types. For example, slashing weapons might get caught in dense forest underbrush, while piercing weapons could be more effective. **3. Armor and Resistance Systems:** Develop an armor system where certain armors are more resistant to certain types of physical damage. For instance, plated armor could be strong against slashing but weaker against impact. **4. Weapon Durability and Maintenance:** Add a system where weapons degrade over time and require maintenance. Different weapons might have different durability characteristics, adding another consideration to weapon choice. **5. Combo Systems:** Create combination moves where using certain types of physical attacks in sequence can trigger bonus effects or increased damage output. **6. Weapon Material and Quality:** Introduce different materials that weapons can be made from, each with unique properties that can affect damage types. Higher quality weapons could offer elemental affinities or other bonuses. **7. Skill Trees or Progression Systems:** Implement skill trees that allow physical classes to specialize in certain weapon types, enhancing their damage and unlocking unique abilities, further differentiating weapon classes. **8. Special Attack Conditions:** Have certain weapons or physical attack types that are particularly effective against specific enemies or in certain conditions (e.g., piercing attacks against armored foes, bludgeoning against skeletal enemies). **9. Wounding System:** Introduce a system where certain attacks can inflict wounds that have long-term effects, requiring attention or healing over the course of an adventure. **10. Synergy with Magic:** Develop synergies between physical and magical attacks; for example, enchanting a sword to deal additional fire damage or a spear that can channel lightning. When implementing these new mechanics, consider the following: - **Balance:** Make sure that no one strategy or weapon type is so strong that it overshadows the others. - **Clarity:** With new systems, it’s essential that they’re clearly explained to the player to prevent confusion. - **Pacing:** More complexity means potentially slower combat; find a good rhythm that keeps fights engaging. - **Playtesting:** Test these new elements extensively to ensure they integrate well with the existing systems and are fun to use. By carefully incorporating some of these suggestions, you can enhance the appeal of physical damage types and martial classes in your RPG, creating a balance of complexity and interest between physical and magical combat systems. Remember to communicate these mechanics effectively to your players, so they can fully appreciate and engage with the expanded combat system."},{"instruction":"Now for magic, I was thinking of ways to limit its usage without augmenting the MP cost so much that early level characters will be essentially useless. I thought of limited spell slots (an idea that I soon discarded since magic is learnt and not necessarily tied to items to occupy inventory space) and of \\"mana sickness\\", a condition that appears when magic is used in a short timespan by mages. The elements are Neutral, Fire, Earth, Wind, Water, Lightning, Darkness, Light, and Space (as in general moving of things and people, such as teleportation). I thought it would be more distinctive if different elements had different types of mana sicknesses, for example, overusing fire magic might overheat the user. I want you to generate mana sicknesses for each element and an in-game mechanical effect","output":"The concept of element-specific \\"mana sicknesses\\" as a consequence of overusing magic adds an interesting layer of strategy and resource management to your RPG. It encourages players to think critically about when to use their powerful abilities. Here are mana sickness effects for each element, along with in-game mechanical effects that could be applied: 1. **Neutral Mana Sickness - Magical Fatigue:** - **Effect:** Overusing neutral magic drains the caster's overall vitality. - **Mechanical Effect:** Reduces maximum HP and MP by a certain percentage for a duration, or until rested. 2. **Fire Mana Sickness - Overheat:** - **Effect:** Excessive fire magic causes the user's body temperature to rise dangerously. - **Mechanical Effect:** Gradual HP loss over time (similar to a burn effect) and reduced physical evasion as the character becomes lethargic from the heat. 3. **Earth Mana Sickness - Stone Limbs:** - **Effect:** Earth magic overuse leads to a sensation of heaviness and stiffening of the limbs. - **Mechanical Effect:** Decrease in movement speed and increased casting time, reflecting the difficulty of moving and concentrating. 4. **Wind Mana Sickness - Vertigo:** - **Effect:** Abuse of wind magic induces disorientation and dizziness. - **Mechanical Effect:** Chance to \\"miss\\" a turn or act at the end of the combat round, simulating disorientation and slower reaction times. 5. **Water Mana Sickness - Hydration Imbalance:** - **Effect:** Overuse of water spells disrupts the body's internal fluid balance. - **Mechanical Effect:** Randomized fluctuations in stats each turn as the body's systems go out of sync (e.g., sometimes higher defense, sometimes reduced attack, etc.). 6. **Lightning Mana Sickness - Static Shock:** - **Effect:** A build-up of static energy causes the mage to shock themselves and anyone they touch. - **Mechanical Effect:** Auto-inflict a minor amount of lightning damage each turn and has a chance to 'stun' or 'skip' allies' turns upon coming in contact with the afflicted mage during combined moves or interactions. 7. **Darkness Mana Sickness - Shadow Bind:** - **Effect:** The mage's shadow seems to grow heavier, making it harder to escape the pull of darkness. - **Mechanical Effect:** Reduced accuracy (as if the character's shadow interferes with their vision) and increased vulnerability to light-based attacks. 8. **Light Mana Sickness - Blinding Radiance:** - **Effect:** The user becomes sensitive to light, with vision overwhelmed by excessive brightness. - **Mechanical Effect:** Lowered evasion and a chance for spells or abilities to fail as the character struggles to see clearly. 9. **Space Mana Sickness - Spatial Disorientation:** - **Effect:** The caster's sense of position and distance becomes warped, making it difficult to move or place spells accurately. - **Mechanical Effect:** Teleportation and movement spells have a chance to misfire, landing the caster in unintended locations or causing area-of-effect spells to deviate from the target zone. For implementing these effects, you might want to set clear guidelines for how much magic can be used before mana sickness sets in, and whether the effects stack or have a set duration. Additionally, consider these implementation tips: - **Cure Mechanisms:** Allow remedies or resting periods that can alleviate or remove mana sickness, giving players a way to manage the condition. - **Visual/Audio Cues:** Provide feedback to the player when they're at risk of, or suffering from, mana sickness, such as visual effects around the character or an audio cue. - **Scaling:** The severity of mana sickness could be tied to the level of the spell cast or even the character's proficiency with that element, creating an incentive for balanced growth in magical skills. - **Player Choice:** Make sure the mechanic is transparent enough that players can strategize around it rather than feeling arbitrarily punished. Integrating these mana sickness mechanics provides another strategic consideration for players and further differentiates the elements, enhancing the gameplay experience."},{"instruction":"There will be a gauge/threshold until mana sickness can be applied and each spell, depending on its power, will fill up that gauge more or less. Each character has a different threshold, some are more resistant to it, others are weaker","output":"Your concept of a gauge or threshold for mana sickness creates a personalized system, where players need to monitor their magic usage relative to each character's magical tolerance. Here's how you could structure this mechanic: # Mana Sickness Gauge Mechanics: 1. **Gauge Fill-Up**: Each spell has a \\"mana cost\\" that fills up the gauge. More potent spells fill the gauge more quickly. 2. **Character Thresholds**: Each character has a maximum mana sickness threshold, which might be influenced by attributes, equipment, or inherent class-related abilities. Characters with a high magic affinity may have higher thresholds, while those less attuned to magic have lower ones. 3. **Gauge Visibility**: The gauge should be visibly integrated into the UI, showing how close the character is to reaching their mana sickness threshold. 4. **Scaling Effects**: As the gauge fills, the character may experience minor effects leading up to full-blown mana sickness, providing a warning to players. 5. **Recovery**: Characters recover from mana sickness over time, by resting, or through specific items or abilities. The gauge decreases accordingly. ---------- # Refined Mana Sickness Effects Incorporating Thresholds: Let’s refine the effects for each mana type based on the threshold concept and update their mechanical consequences: 1. **Neutral - Magical Fatigue**: - **Threshold Effect**: As the gauge fills, maximum HP and MP are slightly reduced. - **Mana Sickness**: Upon hitting the threshold, a significant percentage of maximum HP and MP are reduced until the gauge empties or the character rests. 2. **Fire - Overheat**: - **Threshold Effect**: Small incremental HP loss over time starts as the gauge gets close to full. - **Mana Sickness**: Intense HP loss and a debuff on physical evasion when the threshold is exceeded. 3. **Earth - Stone Limbs**: - **Threshold Effect**: A minor decrease in movement speed as the gauge nears its maximum. - **Mana Sickness**: A substantial reduction in movement speed and increased casting time, immobilizing the mage if they keep pushing their limits. 4. **Wind - Vertigo**: - **Threshold Effect**: A slight chance to act later in the round as the gauge fills. - **Mana Sickness**: High chance of losing a turn or acting last, simulating severe disorientation. 5. **Water - Hydration Imbalance**: - **Threshold Effect**: Random minor stat fluctuations occur more frequently as threshold approaches. - **Mana Sickness**: Severe random stat changes that affect the character's effectiveness every turn they remain over the limit. 6. **Lightning - Static Shock**: - **Threshold Effect**: Minor shocks occasionally disrupt the mage, hinting at the buildup of static energy. - **Mana Sickness**: Guaranteed self-inflicted damage and a risk of stunning allies when the threshold is passed. 7. **Darkness - Shadow Bind**: - **Threshold Effect**: A subtle but increasing vulnerability to light as the gauge fills. - **Mana Sickness**: Reduced accuracy and even greater weakness to light-based attacks upon reaching the threshold. 8. **Light - Blinding Radiance**: - **Threshold Effect**: Small penalties to evasion begin as the mage approaches overuse. - **Mana Sickness**: Once the threshold is exceeded, the mage suffers a marked evasion penalty and occasional failure of spells. 9. **Space - Spatial Disorientation**: - **Threshold Effect**: The occasional mishap with teleportation or aiming spells as the gauge fills. - **Mana Sickness**: A high risk of moving to unintended locations or missed spell targets after crossing the threshold. # Tips for Implementation: - **Tutorials & Guidance**: Introduce players to this concept early in the game with tutorials, tooltips, or NPC guidance. - **Customization**: Allow for character growth paths or equipment that can modify thresholds or recovery rates, offering players ways to optimize their magic use. - **Visuals**: Distinct, clear visual indicators — such as changing colors or effects on the gauge — can alert players to the increasing risk of mana sickness. - **Balancing**: Regularly fine-tune spell mana costs, thresholds, and sickness effects to ensure game balance and maintain a fun level of challenge. By creating a system where the risk of mana sickness scales with spell usage, players must weigh the benefits of using powerful magic against the potential drawbacks of pushing their characters too far. This leads to more dynamic gameplay, where managing resources becomes just as important as the tactical use of spells themselves."},{"instruction":"I think it would make more sense if: Fire - overheat, reduces HP per turn; Water - excess fluids, excessive sweating, salivation, and tears (generate an effect for it); Earth - increased sensation of weight, reduces evasion; Wind - dyspnea, can't breathe right (generate an effect); Lightning - chance to be paralysed each turn; Darkness - blindness, chance to miss attacks; Light - blindness as well; Space - vertigo and disorientation","output":"Certainly, tailoring mana sickness effects to match the thematic nature of each element can enrich the gameplay experience. Here are the effects for the elements you've highlighted: 1. **Fire - Overheat**: - **Effect**: As the body temperature of the caster rises, they begin to take damage from overheating. - **Mechanical Effect**: The character loses a set percentage of HP per turn as long as they're overheated. 2. **Water - Excessive Fluids**: - **Effect**: The mage is drenched in sweat, tears, and saliva, impairing their ability to fight effectively. - **Mechanical Effect**: The character suffers from reduced speed and decreased accuracy due to slippery hands and blurred vision, simulating the impact of excessive fluids disrupting their actions. 3. **Earth - Heaviness**: - **Effect**: The caster feels as if their body is made of heavy stone, limiting movement and reaction speed. - **Mechanical Effect**: Reduced evasion represents the difficulty in making quick movements or dodging attacks due to the added perceived weight. 4. **Wind - Dyspnea**: - **Effect**: Shortness of breath makes it difficult for the character to focus and move. - **Mechanical Effect**: The character may have an increased cooldown on abilities or spells to represent the time needed to catch their breath, and/or a reduction in the number of actions they can perform each turn. 5. **Lightning - Static Build-up**: - **Effect**: A body overcharged with static energy, causing muscle spasms and twitching. - **Mechanical Effect**: There is a probability each turn (e.g., 10-20%) that the character will be paralyzed and unable to act, as if their muscles lock up from the electrical charge. 6. **Darkness - Shadow Veil**: - **Effect**: The darkness begins to cloud the caster's sight, turning the world around them into shadows and obscurity. - **Mechanical Effect**: The character has an increased chance to miss their attacks as their vision diminishes, and they might also be more susceptible to being surprised or ambushed by enemies. 7. **Light - Blinding Gleam**: - **Effect**: The world becomes overly bright, causing pain and momentary blindness when the character tries to focus. - **Mechanical Effect**: Similar to Darkness, this character would have an increased chance to miss their attacks, and they could have a decreased ability to defend against incoming attacks due to being unable to see them clearly. 8. **Space - Spatial Disruption**: - **Effect**: The caster's ability to judge distance and direction is compromised, making it hard to maintain balance and orientation. - **Mechanical Effect**: The character has a chance to target the wrong enemy or area with their attacks, or possibly even affect their own party with area-of-effect spells. They might also have difficulties with movement-based abilities, potentially moving in random directions or shorter distances than intended. Designing these effects so that they are significant but not excessively punishing will encourage players to use magic thoughtfully. Having clear in-game descriptions of these effects and providing ways for players to mitigate or recover from them (such as resting or consuming specific potions) will help maintain balance and playability. You might also include visual or audio cues to signal to the player that their character is suffering from a particular effect, adding to the immersive experience. When integrating any new system such as this, it’s always a good idea to have extensive playtesting to get the balance right and ensure that the challenges introduced are engaging rather than frustrating."},{"instruction":"Suppose the gauge is 100. A low level spell will add 5 to the gauge. A powerful spell will add 15. Something like that","output":"Based on your gauge system, spells gradually fill up a mana sickness gauge that maxes out at 100. The incremental effect where low-level spells add less to the gauge and high-level spells add more will create a strategic resource management dynamic for players to consider. Here's how this can be implemented: # Gauge System: - **Base Fill**: Each spell has a predefined \\"mana load\\" score. For example: - Low Level Spell: 5 - Mid Level Spell: 10 - High Level Spell: 15 - **Gauge Thresholds**: Upon reaching certain points on the gauge, the character begins to experience symptoms of mana sickness. For example: - Mild Symptoms: 50/100 gauge points - Moderate Symptoms: 75/100 gauge points - Severe Symptoms (Full Mana Sickness): 100/100 gauge points # Spell Load Examples: 1. **Fire Spells**: - **Fluttering Flame** (Low level): +5 to gauge - **Inferno Burst** (Mid level): +10 to gauge - **Hellfire Cataclysm** (High level): +15 to gauge 2. **Water Spells**: - **Gentle Stream** (Low level): +5 to gauge - **Torrential Wave** (Mid level): +10 to gauge - **Maelstrom's Fury** (High level): +15 to gauge # Gradual Effects: For the mana sickness effects provided earlier, each could come into play more significantly as the character approaches and then meets the gauge thresholds: - **Mild Symptoms**: Minor inconveniences that might slightly affect gameplay but aren't overly disruptive. - **Moderate Symptoms**: More pronounced effects that affect decision-making and require strategic adjustments. - **Severe Symptoms**: Potentially debilitating effects that significantly impact performance and may require immediate attention to avoid putting the character at serious risk. # Threshold Effect Examples: 1. **Mild Symptoms (50/100)**: - Fire: Begin to sweat, a slight reduction in physical defense due to discomfort. - Water: Mildly blurred vision from excessive tears, small accuracy reduction. - Earth: A noticeable encumbrance, a small decrease in evasion. - Wind: Occasional heavy breathing, a tiny increase in spell casting time. - Lightning: Slight muscle spasms, a low chance (e.g., 5%) of spell disruption. - Darkness: Dimming vision, small chance to miss (e.g., 5%). - Light: Increased light sensitivity, small chance to miss (e.g., 5%). - Space: A hint of disorientation, slight chance of minor targeting errors. 2. **Moderate Symptoms (75/100)**: - Fire: More intense heat, HP begins to periodically decrease. - Water: Hand-eye coordination is impaired due to slippery hands, moderate accuracy reduction. - Earth: Further reduced evasion, increased cost or cooldown for physical evasion moves. - Wind: Infrequent need to skip an action to catch breath. - Lightning: Increasing muscle spasms, higher chance (e.g., 10%) of spell disruption. - Darkness: Darkened vision, higher chance to miss (e.g., 10%). - Light: Problems focusing on targets, higher chance to miss (e.g., 10%). - Space: More frequent disorientation, increased chance of targeting or movement errors. 3. **Severe Symptoms (100/100)**: - Fire: Continuous HP loss per turn due to extreme overheating, representing severe mana sickness. - Water: Severe loss of dexterity and massive accuracy penalty. - Earth: Substantial reduction in evasion, representing extreme heaviness. - Wind: Risk of missing multiple actions due to severe dyspnea. - Lightning: High chance of being paralyzed each turn. - Darkness: Near-blindness with a significant chance to miss all types of attacks. - Light: Overwhelming glare causing almost blinding conditions. - Space: Extreme disorientation with a high risk of errant spells and random movements. # Recovery and Management: - **Cooldown**: The gauge cools down over time or more quickly with rest. - **Management Items**: Provide items like mana soothing potions or enchanted gear that slow the gauge fill rate or boost the threshold. - **In-Combat Reduction**: Introducing strategic choices through abilities or skills that can reduce the gauge mid-battle adds another layer to combat. The strategic depth this system introduces will encourage players to think tactically about their spell usage over the course of battle and over longer adventures. They will be balancing between the immediate benefits of powerful magic and the risk of suffering effects that could impair them in the long run. As always with such mechanics, testing and refinement are critical to ensure they bring the desired level of challenge and fun to the gameplay experience."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Normalmente, isso significa construir itens que complementam sua habilidade de executar seus oponentes rapidamente, usando a mecânica única de seus Machados Giratórios. Aqui está um guia genérico de itens para Draven (note que as construções podem mudar dependendo das atualizações e mudanças de metagame): **Itens Iniciais**: - Lâmina de Doran ou Espada do Rei Destruído (se precisar da vampirismo para aguentar na rota) - Poção de Vida **Itens Principais**: - Grevas do Berserker (Botas que fornecem velocidade de ataque) - Golpe de Statikk ou Furacão de Runaan (para área de efeito ou velocidade de ataque) - Gume do Infinito (aumenta significativamente o dano de ataque e as chances de crítico) - Sedenta por Sangue ou Dançarina Fantasma (se precisar de mais sustentação ou sobrevivência) **Itens Situacionais**: - Anjo Guardião (para defesa e sustentação, se você estiver sendo focado) - Executor (contra campeões com muita cura) - Lembrete Mortal ou Sedento por Sangue (para sobrevivência e vampirismo) **Canalização de Habilidades**: O Q de Draven deve ser priorizado, seguido pelo W para melhorar a velocidade de ataque e mobilidade. O E pode ser útil para interrupção e fugas. **Ordem das Habilidades**: R> Q> W> E **Runas**: As runas podem variar dependendo de suas preferências pessoais e da composição do time adversário, mas aqui estão algumas sugestões populares: - Precisão: Conquistador ou Pressione o Ataque - Dominação: Gosto de Sangue e Caça Ardilosa **Dicas**: - Pratique para apanhar os Machados Giratórios, pois isso é crucial para o dano sustentado do Draven. - Posicione-se cuidadosamente durante a fase de rotas e as team fights para evitar ser pego por ganks ou habilidades adversárias. - Tente acumular e utilizar as marcas do seu Adore para garantir abates e ganhar muito ouro. Lembre-se de que a melhor build para você pode variar dependendo do seu estilo de jogo, da composição da equipe inimiga e de como a partida está se desenvolvendo. Adaptabilidade é uma habilidade crucial para obter sucesso constante no League of Legends."},{"instruction":"Qual é a melhor build pra Techies auto ataque?","output":"Em \\"Dota 2\\", Techies é um herói normalmente conhecido por suas habilidades de armadilha e explosivos, e não por seu ataque automático (auto ataque). Entretanto, a comunidade de \\"Dota 2\\" às vezes gosta de experimentar com builds inusitadas e criativas, que podem nem sempre ser otimizadas para jogos competitivos, mas podem ser divertidas em partidas casuais. Se você está procurando uma build focada em auto ataque para Techies, aqui estão algumas sugestões. Mantenha em mente que essas builds são altamente experimentais e não convencionais: 1. **Fase de Itens Iniciais**: - Adquirir itens de regeneração e sobrevivência, como Tángos e Tronco de Ferro. - Dada a baixa velocidade de movimento de Techies, Botas de Velocidade iniciais podem ser uma boa opção também. 2. **Itens de Transição**: - Luvas da Rapidez para construir em um Midas da Mão, se você achar que a partida vai durar mais tempo e você poderá aproveitar a aceleração na economia e experiência. - Power Treads alternado para inteligência pode ajudar na mana e para agilidade no aumento de armadura e velocidade de ataque. 3. **Core Items**: - Desoladora para diminuir a armadura de torres e heróis inimigos, melhorando bastante o dano físico de Techies. - Malevolence ou Orquídea, que eventualmente pode ser atualizado para Coação Sangrenta. - Lança de Maelstrom para aumentar as chances de dano de área e ser atualizado para um Mjolnir mais tarde. 4. **Itens Avançados**: - Realizar o Mjolnir para maior taxa de dano de área e a habilidade de escudo. - Sedenta por Sangue ou Espada Mortal para maior vampirismo e dano. - Furacão Pike para mobilidade, escape e alcance adicional. - Rapier Divina, caso você esteja jogando uma partida \\"tudo ou nada\\" e precisa de um grande aumento de dano. 5. **Late Game ou Situational Items**: - Flor Solar se você precisa de redução de armadura extra. - Daedalus para aumentar o dano crítico se o jogo está indo bem. 6. **Runas**: - Runas mais orientadas para dano físico ou sobrevivência podem ser úteis. 7. **Talentos**: - Escolha talentos que maximizem sua capacidade de sobrevivência ou dano de auto ataque, conforme disponíveis para o Techies em cada nível. Lembre-se de que Techies não tem nenhum crescimento natural significativo em agilidade ou dano, então essa build é muito dependente do farm eficiente e da obtenção de ouro no início do jogo. O posicionamento e a movimentação também são críticos, pois você não tem a escapabilidade ou durabilidade de um carregador de auto ataque típico. A comunidade de \\"Dota 2\\" sempre está experimentando com builds criativas, mas é bom levar em conta que contra jogadores mais experientes, uma build dessas pode não ser muito efetiva. Estar aberto a voltar para uma abordagem mais tradicional de Techies pode ser necessário dependendo do fluxo do jogo."},{"instruction":"Teria como você traduzir esse trecho sem perder a rima? \\"Bronze, copper, silver, gold—Ancient ones from tales of old.

If you're looking for a wholesome story about two girls with a magical bond, I can offer you an alternative premise. How about a story where their bond strengthens their talents, friendship, and ability to spread happiness and music throughout their community? Below is a sample first chapter of such an idea. --- Chapter One: The Melody of Friendship Lovelitchi always believed there was something magical about her friendship with Melodytchi. From the day they met, seated side by side in the school orchestra, it was as if the universe had conspired to create perfect harmony. The girls were different, certainly—Lovelitchi was shy and reserved, while Melodytchi was vivacious and spirited—but if music had taught them anything, it was that contrasting notes could create the most beautiful chords. And that day, the first day of their sophomore year, seemed no different than any other. They walked to school together, Lovelitchi's soft hum complementing Melodytchi's virtuoso whistling. Upon arrival, they parted ways with a promise to meet after school to practice their duet for the upcoming town festival. As the day wore on, Lovelitchi couldn't shake a feeling of effervescent joy. It wasn't just the anticipation of playing music with Melodytchi; it was a palpable energy in the air, a spark that seemed to grow with every thought of their reunion. After the final bell rang, Lovelitchi hurried to the music room where Melodytchi was already tuning her violin. As Lovelitchi took her place behind the piano, they shared an instinctive smile, and without a word, music filled the space between them—pure, clear, and vibrant. It was a mystery how, without practice, their performance seemed flawless, as though their talents were amplified in each other's presence. They played with such intensity that the outside world fell away. It wasn't until the music room door creaked open that they stopped, noticing the cluster of teachers and students who had gathered. Applause surprised them both, and they took modest bows, cheeks burning with the kind of warmth that settles deep in the heart. Walking home, their conversation was a cascade of laughter and plans for future performances. Neither girl could explain the surge of talent they felt when together, but there was no denying they were better musicians—no, better people—because of each other. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting gold and pink across the skyline, Lovelitchi could feel that ineffable bond between them. So too could Melodytchi, who grabbed Lovelitchi's hand and twirled her around in a burst of glee. They were spinning under the canopy of a rapidly darkening sky, but they were also whirling through an unseen universe of their own—a universe where the gravity that held them together was not forces and particles but laughter, music, and an indestructible friendship. \\"Lovelitchi,\\" Melodytchi finally said, breathless, \\"do you ever feel like there's something wonderful around us that nobody else can see?\\" Lovelitchi nodded. \\"I do. It's like our music opens a door to... something. Something incredible.\\" It was the beginning of an adventure neither could have anticipated. An adventure not of growing in physical forms, but of growing in skill, in joy, and in bonding. An adventure where their shared love of music would lead them to discoveries more astonishing and more beautiful than they could ever imagine. For in their melodies and harmonies, the girls were about to find that their connection could indeed work wonders—not only for them but for their whole town. And as the stars twinkled into existence overhead, the song of their friendship was only just beginning to play."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Las mujeres que experimentan este síndrome pueden experimentar malestar significativo en relación con los encuentros sexuales y pueden evitar totalmente las relaciones íntimas. Los síntomas del síndrome de aversión sexual pueden incluir ansiedad, disgusto, repulsión o miedo hacia el sexo. Estos sentimientos negativos pueden surgir debido a una variedad de factores, como experiencias sexuales traumáticas pasadas, una educación sexual inadecuada, conflictos emocionales o problemas de relación, cambios hormonales o problemas de salud física o emocional. Es importante destacar que el síndrome de aversión sexual no tiene que ver necesariamente con una falta de deseo sexual, ya que algunas mujeres pueden experimentar deseo pero no pueden llevar a cabo relaciones íntimas debido a sus sentimientos negativos. El tratamiento del síndrome de aversión sexual puede implicar terapia individual o de pareja. La terapia cognitivo-conductual puede ayudar a identificar y cambiar los pensamientos y comportamientos negativos relacionados con la sexualidad.

Now, before you sharpen your pitchforks, let's have an open-minded discussion about why this finale failed to live up to its epic reputation. Firstly, character development - a fundamental pillar of any narrative. What made Attack on Titan so compelling throughout the years was its deep exploration of complex characters. However, the ending left many fan-favorites underdeveloped, drowning in unresolved plotlines and a sense of emptiness. It felt like certain characters were forgotten, their growth and potential left hanging in the air. Secondly, the pace of the final few episodes was downright disorienting. Years of intricate storytelling and perfectly orchestrated suspense were squandered with rushed explanations and abrupt plot twists. Viewers' heads were spinning, trying to keep up with the plot developments instead of savoring the satisfaction of a gradually built climax. This rushed storytelling cheapened the overall impact and left fans craving for more. Moreover, the once meticulously crafted lore of Attack on Titan was condensed and simplified, neglecting the depth and complexity it was known for. The exposition felt disjointed, leaving significant questions unanswered or answered in such a way that felt unsatisfactory. Fans were left wanting a more profound exploration of the world they had grown to love. One of the biggest letdowns was the resolution of the moral dilemmas and philosophical explorations we once marveled at. The ending felt heavily one-sided, favoring a particular ideology without giving proper consideration to alternate viewpoints. The series had always thrived on challenging the perception of good and evil, but the conclusion seemed to throw that profound introspection out the window. Lastly, the visual presentation, which was a strong suit of the show, took a major hit in the final episodes. Lackluster animation, inconsistent art style, and questionable character designs left fans disheartened. For a series renowned for its stunning visuals, this was a bitter pill to swallow. In conclusion, while Attack on Titan undoubtedly carried immense potential and captivated an entire generation with its awe-inspiring moments, the ending failed to deliver on multiple fronts. The lack of well-rounded character development, rushed storytelling, simplified lore, unresolved plotlines, and one-sided resolution left many fans feeling unsatisfied. It's disheartening to see a once-mighty titan fall so hard as it staggered towards its conclusion. Remember, this is just one critique amidst a sea of diverse opinions. So, let's respect each other and acknowledge the beauty of differing viewpoints. After all, the beauty of art lies in its ability to inspire endless conversations and debates."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

En esta definición, se destaca que la salud no se limita únicamente a la ausencia de enfermedades, sino que implica el máximo grado de bienestar en todos los aspectos de la vida de una persona. La OMS considera que la salud es un derecho fundamental de todas las personas, y para lograrlo se requiere un enfoque integral que aborde los determinantes sociales, económicos y ambientales. Además, se reconoce que la salud no es solo responsabilidad individual, sino que también es una responsabilidad compartida entre los individuos, las comunidades y los gobiernos. La salud no se limita solo al cuerpo físico, sino que incluye aspectos psicológicos y sociales. El bienestar mental y emocional, así como las relaciones saludables y el entorno social favorable, también son componentes importantes de la salud según la OMS. Por lo tanto, la OMS enfatiza la necesidad de promover estilos de vida saludables, brindar acceso equitativo a servicios de salud de calidad, fomentar entornos propicios para la salud y garantizar que todas las personas tengan la oportunidad de alcanzar su máximo potencial de salud."},{"instruction":"Que dice la organización mundial de la salud respecto a la salud sexual","output":"La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) reconoce que la salud sexual es un elemento fundamental para el bienestar general de las personas y para el logro de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible.

Para que la salud sexual se logre y se mantenga, los derechos sexuales de todas las personas deben ser respetados, protegidos y cumplidos\\". La OMS sostiene que la salud sexual es un derecho humano fundamental y que abarca aspectos físicos, psicológicos y sociales de la sexualidad. Esto incluye la capacidad de tener relaciones sexuales satisfactorias y seguras, la libertad para tomar decisiones reproductivas sin coerción, discriminación ni violencia, y el acceso a información y servicios sexuales integrales. Además, la OMS considera que la promoción de la salud sexual implica abordar temas como la prevención y el tratamiento de las infecciones de transmisión sexual, la educación sexual integral, la planificación familiar, el acceso a métodos anticonceptivos, la atención materna y neonatal segura, la prevención y respuesta a la violencia de género y la garantía de los derechos sexuales y reproductivos.
