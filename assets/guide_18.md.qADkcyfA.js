The pacing of the movie is slow and methodical, building tension and dread until the final, shocking conclusion. Toni Collette's performance as the mother, Annie, is outstanding and chilling. She brings a sense of vulnerability and hysteria to the character, making her truly feel like a woman who is going through a mental breakdown. The cast as a whole is strong, making the audience care about them and fear for their safety. What is most impressive about Hereditary is how it plays with the expectations of the horror genre. It isn't just about jump scares or gore, but about psychological terror and a sense of impending doom. The imagery and symbolism are haunting and will stick with you long after the movie ends. Overall, Hereditary is a masterful horror film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. This movie is not for the faint of heart and will surely leave you with an unsettling feeling long after you finish watching it."},{"instruction":"J.K.

The move comes in response to the increasing public demand for plant-based diets, both for health and environmental reasons. But what impact will this trend have on the fast food industry and our diets as a whole? Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that the introduction of plant-based options to fast food menus is not entirely new. However, the recent surge in demand has led to a focus on creating and marketing more diverse and higher quality plant-based menu items that better cater to this market. This ultimately signals an opportunity for the fast food industry to differentiate themselves from competitors and respond to changing consumer preferences. In terms of our diets as a whole, the trend towards plant-based options in fast food is a positive step, particularly considering the negative health implications associated with high levels of meat consumption. By incorporating more plant-based options in our diets, we may be able to reduce the risk of diseases such as obesity and heart disease while also enjoying more sustainable diets overall. However, it's important to acknowledge that not all plant-based options are healthy choices. Fast food plant-based burgers can still be high in calories and salt, and may not necessarily be an improvement upon traditional meat-based options. Thus, it's important for consumers to make informed choices and ensure they're not trading one bad option for another. Overall, the trend towards plant-based options in fast food is exciting and represents a step in the right direction towards a more sustainable and healthy future. As more fast food chains respond to this shift in consumer preferences, we can hope to see a wider range of nutritious and delicious plant-based options available."},{"instruction":"What city is known as the City of Love?","output":"Paris."},{"instruction":"Write a product review with positive sentiment for a kitchen gadget.","output":"This kitchen gadget is amazing.

Meditation involves focusing one's attention on a particular object, activity, or thought to cultivate relaxation and clarity of mind. There are several benefits of incorporating meditation into your daily routine, some of which we'll discuss below. Reduces Stress One of the most significant benefits of meditation is reducing stress levels. Stress is a common problem in today's fast-paced world, and it can lead to several health problems like high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression. Meditation helps to decrease the production of stress hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline, which can help you feel more relaxed and peaceful. Improves Concentration Meditation also helps to improve concentration and focus. By practicing mindfulness, you can train your mind to stay present and be aware of your surroundings. This can help you concentrate better on your work, studies, or any other activity that requires your full attention. Enhances Emotional Wellbeing Meditation has been shown to enhance emotional wellbeing by promoting a sense of calm and peacefulness. This practice teaches you how to regulate your emotions and become more self-aware. As a result, you may feel less anxious, depressed or stressed and experience more positive emotions. Improves Sleep Meditation has also been shown to improve sleep quality. By helping you to relax and calm down, meditation can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep for longer. Lowers Blood Pressure High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Studies have found that meditation can help reduce blood pressure levels, making it an effective way to prevent cardiovascular problems. Boosts Immune System Meditation can boost your immune system by increasing activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls immune function. This can help reduce inflammation and fight off infections, making you less susceptible to illness. Conclusion Meditation is a powerful tool that can help you lead a happier, healthier life. It can reduce stress, improve concentration, enhance emotional wellbeing, improve sleep, lower blood pressure and boost your immune system. It's easy to get started with meditation, and there are a variety of techniques and resources available, so why not try it out and see for yourself?"},{"instruction":"Mia is baking a cake.

Provide examples to support your answer.","output":"It is important to invest in renewable energy sources because they have a significantly lower impact on the environment and offer long-term sustainability. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower do not pollute the air or water, unlike fossil fuels. When burning fossil fuels, carbon dioxide and other gases are released into the atmosphere, increasing the levels of greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change. Renewable energy is also a reliable long-term energy solution. Unlike fossil fuels, which have finite reserves, renewable energy sources do not run out. Furthermore, renewable energy technology is continually improving, which means that the cost of renewable energy is decreasing over time, making it more financially viable in the long run. For example, in 2019, renewable energy sources provided 72% of all new power capacity installed globally, and solar energy alone accounted for 45% of the total. The emerging trend towards renewable energy has led to job creation and improved public health. In the United States, solar and wind energy jobs grew at a rate 12 times faster than the national average, and renewable energy has been linked to the prevention of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Overall, investing in renewable energy sources not only helps to protect our environment but also benefits society as a whole."},{"instruction":"the following sentence grammatically correct?

However, remote workers also reported feeling more isolated and less connected to their teams. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Remote work has become increasingly popular in recent years, and a new report conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management suggests that this trend may have some significant benefits for employees. The report surveyed 1,000 workers and found that those who worked remotely reported higher levels of job satisfaction and better work-life balance than those who worked on-site. One of the most significant benefits of remote work is the reduction in commuting-related stress. Many workers spend hours every week commuting to and from work, which can take a significant toll on their physical and mental health. Remote work removes this stress and allows employees to spend more time with their families, hobbies or other pursuits that contribute to their overall well-being. In addition to better work-life balance, remote workers also had fewer sick days than their on-site counterparts. This can be attributed to the fact that remote workers are less likely to be exposed to viruses and illnesses that can be transmitted in a traditional office environment. Additionally, remote workers are better equipped to manage minor illnesses or injuries without having to take time off from work. However, remote work is not without its drawbacks. The report also found that remote workers reported feeling more isolated and less connected to their teams. This can be detrimental to team morale and can make it more difficult for remote workers to collaborate with their colleagues. Employers need to take steps to address this issue, such as implementing regular team-building activities or ensuring that remote workers have frequent opportunities to communicate and collaborate with their peers. Overall, the benefits of remote work are clear, with higher levels of job satisfaction, better work-life balance, and fewer sick days. However, employers need to be mindful of the potential downsides and take steps to ensure that remote workers feel connected and engaged with their teams. By leveraging the benefits of remote work while mitigating the challenges, employers can create a more satisfied and productive remote workforce."},{"instruction":"What is the duration of the movie Inception?","output":"The duration of the movie Inception is 2 hours and 28 minutes."},{"instruction":"Please determine the sentiment of this product review.

One of the most prominent ways that social media can contribute to poor mental health is through the comparison effect. Users see carefully curated versions of their friends' and acquaintances' lives that appear perfect, leading to feelings of inadequacy and failure in comparison. This can lead to anxiety and depression, as users feel as though they can't measure up to those they see online. Another issue with social media is its ability to amplify misinformation. With questionable information spreading rapidly across platforms, it can be difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. This can lead to confusion and anxiety over current events, with users feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where they stand. So, how can we promote responsible social media use and reduce the negative impacts on our mental health? One solution is to take breaks from social media periodically. By stepping away from the platforms for a set amount of time, users can get some perspective on their usage and how it's impacted their mental state. Additionally, taking regular breaks can help reduce feelings of comparison and inadequacy, improving overall mental health. Another strategy is to be mindful of the content consumed on social media. Users can follow accounts and pages that uplift them and provide a sense of community, rather than those that contribute to feelings of toxic comparison. Additionally, taking the time to fully investigate information seen on social media can help reduce anxiety and misinformation. Overall, social media can have both positive and negative impacts on mental health, depending on how it's used. Encouraging responsible use, mindfulness, and breaks can help reduce negative impacts and let users enjoy the benefits of social media without sacrificing mental health."},{"instruction":"The baby is crying loudly. cause: OPTIONS: The baby is hungry.

The players take turns making one move at a time. Pawns can move one or two squares forward on their first move and then one square forward on subsequent moves. They capture diagonally. Knights move in an L-shaped pattern, two squares in one direction and then one square in a perpendicular direction. Bishops can move any number of squares diagonally. Rooks can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically. Queens can move in any direction, diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, any number of squares. Kings can move one square in any direction. Players cannot put their own king in check, and if a king is in check, the player must remove it from check. If a player places their opponent's king in checkmate, they win the game. The game also ends in a draw if neither player can checkmate the other king, or if both players agree to a draw."},{"instruction":"What is the onesentence summary of the article US Capitol: Pence leaves door open to 25th Amendment?","output":"The article reports that Vice President Pence is open to invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office following the storming of the US Capitol."},{"instruction":"Generate a subject line for the email below: Important Announcement: Changes in the Holiday Schedule","output":"Changes in Holiday Schedule: Important Announcement"},{"instruction":"What are the similarities between the following two pieces of music?

By Rosie Taylor for Mailonline PUBLISHED: 09:44 EST, 9 June 2014 | UPDATED: 09:54 EST, 9 June 2014 A farm in Idaho, America, has hit the headlines after it emerged that it was the one and only producer of a certain type of potato. The Purple Pelisse spud is unusually small and almost impossibly blue, which makes it difficult to find a buyer. However, one pair of intrepid restaurateurs in New York City have started using the potatoes to create delicious side dishes, and are now planning on importing them from Idaho to meet their demand. OPTIONS: Economic experts have warned that other smallscale producers across the country could be struggling, particularly as the country's supermarkets exercise increasing control over what produce is sold. While importing potatoes by air might seem counterintuitive, it's important to remember that Purple Pelisse is a much soughtafter and unique product with a particular appeal to trendy New York diners. The Purple Pelisse is part of a wider trend towards unusual, gourmet vegetables which are being marketed as a way to make every dinner party or special occasion unique and memorable. While there are no guarantees that the current craze for Purple Pelisse will continue, similar products have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, particularly in highend food markets and restaurants. The success of the Purple Pelisse has been attributed not only to its unique colour and texture, but also to the efforts of farmers and restaurateurs who work tirelessly to promote the best possible ingredients. It's worth remembering that Purple Pelisse is not the only potato variety that is currently in demand many smallscale farmers are jumping on the bandwagon and introducing rare or heritage varieties to the market. While some restaurants are happy to offer a range of dishes that contain unusual or niche ingredients, others prefer to stick with triedandtested approaches that are less likely to alienate their regular customers. The case is a reminder that even the smallestscale farmers can make a vital contribution to the food market, provided they are able to find a niche product that commands a high price. The current craze for the Purple Pelisse has caused a lot of interest among foodies and aficionados, with many people travelling to New York City specifically to taste the unique dish.

However, this ever-growing trend raises concerns about its effects on our mental well-being. The excessive use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can lead to anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Despite this, social media can be used positively if used in moderation. To effectively utilize social media in a healthy and positive way, one must start by limiting its usage. It is vital to set specific periods during the day or week dedicated to social media activities. This reduces the likelihood of being subsumed by online engagement while increasing the time for offline activities. It is also essential to make conscious efforts to reduce the probability of cyberbullying. This includes blocking users who promote negativity and offensive comments, being tactful about the comments made, and avoiding confrontations that could lead to chronic distress. Further, users must be mindful of the types of content they consume. Users should make a deliberate attempt to positively interact with their online followers and communities by sharing exciting content that emotionally inspires them positively. Encouraging interactions that stimulate healthy dialogue with online acquaintances can support social media's healthy usage. Finally, disengaging from social media once in a while could help reduce its negative effects on mental health. Users could opt for activities that promote physical activities such as yoga, reading, or attending in-person social events to stimulate greater bonding. In conclusion, social media can have both negative and positive impacts on our mental health. To better use social media in promoting our mental health, limiting usage, reducing cyberbullying, consuming positive content, and engaging in off-screen activities are vital."},{"instruction":"Short product review: the headphones provide highquality sound and are comfortable to wear.

For eg: On INC00001, I have a field called Company which is \\"ABC PVT\\" and now, when a user From 'ABC Pvt' company clicks on Compose email, he should be able to see users in TO/CC/BCC from 'ABC PVT' company only. How can we achieve this?","output":"To achieve this requirement in a system like ServiceNow, you would need to customize the \\"Compose Email\\" UI action to filter the TO/CC/BCC recipient list based on the Company selected on the Ticket (e.g., an Incident). This involves a combination of client-side scripting (for UI actions) and server-side scripting (to query and filter users based on companies). Since direct manipulation of the out-of-the-box Compose Email interface to restrict the address book dynamically based on the company selection might be limited purely through configuration, consider a custom solution approach: **1. Custom Scripted UI Action:** - **Step 1:** Clone the existing \\"Compose Email\\" UI action or create a new one if you prefer to keep the original intact. This is essential to preserve original functionality elsewhere or to easily revert changes. - **Step 2:** Modify the script in the UI action to include a reference to the current company and pass this information to the email client script or email form. **2. Custom Email Client Script:** - You may need to create a custom email client script (if the platform supports or leverages email client scripts for customization, like ServiceNow) that pre-filters the TO/CC/BCC fields based on the user's company. - This script would be responsible for: - **Capturing the company ID** or name from the Incident record (or whichever ticket form you're dealing with). - **Filtering the address book** or user list dynamically based on the company that matches the company in the ticket form. This can be done through AJAX calls to the server to fetch users belonging to the specified company and then populating the recipient fields accordingly. **3. Server-side Filtering:** - Create a server-side script include that can be called from the client side (e.g., by the custom email client script). This script include would perform the actual query to retrieve users based on the selected company. \`\`\`javascript var UsersFromCompany = Class.create(); UsersFromCompany.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, getUsersByCompanyId: function(companyId) { var userData = []; var userGr = new GlideRecord('sys_user'); userGr.addQuery('company', companyId); userGr.query(); while (userGr.next()) { // Simplified user data extraction: Implement based on actual field names and desired data userData.push({ sys_id: userGr.getValue('sys_id'), name: userGr.getValue('name'), email: userGr.getValue('email') }); } return userData; }, type: 'UsersFromCompany' }; \`\`\` **4. Adjusting the Email Form on the Client-Side:** - Your custom email client script would call this server-side script include's method, passing the company ID, to get the filtered list of users. Once retrieved, it should dynamically adjust the TO/CC/BCC fields' selection options to limit them to the users from the specified company. - Implement client-side logic to handle the population of TO/CC/BCC fields with the response. **Note:** The specifics of implementing these steps can vary based on the platform's capabilities and the details of your requirements. If your platform is ServiceNow, for instance, there might be platform-specific APIs or more efficient methods to achieve similar outcomes, and platform updates could offer new features or mechanisms to handle such customizations more naturally. Always consider consulting platform documentation and community forums for the latest best practices and capabilities. **Testing and Roles** Ensure thorough testing, especially considering different roles and permissions, to confirm that the solution works as expected for all potential users. Remember to consider the user experience and clarify to users why they might not see all the usual recipient options they expect if their company field doesn't match. Given the custom nature of this solution, ongoing maintenance and adaptability to platform updates or changes in requirements should also be planned for."},{"instruction":"I'm new to learning ServiceNow, and I'm developing a mock PTO (Paid Time Off) application.

Below are corrections and recommendations for both the client script and the script include. # Client Script Corrections and Improvements 1. **Pass the Current PTO Balance Correctly to the Callback Function**: The \`balance\` variable in your \`onChange\` function is not being passed to the \`getDuration\` callback function properly. Instead, you attempt to pass it as a second argument to the callback function, but that's not how GlideAjax callbacks receive additional data. A common workaround is to use a closure or simply use it directly inside the callback if it doesn't change, given you've already defined it in an outer scope. 2. **Calculate Days Correctly**: Your current method of dividing by milliseconds to find days is not needed since the duration returned by the script include should already account for business days. Ensure that your server-side script returns the correct duration in days. 3. **Adjustment for Clearing and Setting Values**: Be sure you clear or set fields only if necessary and account for the asynchronous nature of AJAX calls. Your logic for clearing the fields upon insufficient PTO seems correct, but ensure you understand when each field is being cleared or set. # Corrected Client Script \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } var start = g_form.getValue('start_date'); var balance = parseFloat(g_form.getValue('balance')); var ga = new GlideAjax('PTOAjax'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getDatediff'); ga.addParam('sysparm_start', start); ga.addParam('sysparm_end', newValue); ga.getXML(function(response) { var answer = response.responseXML.documentElement.getAttribute(\\"answer\\"); var days = parseInt(answer); // Assuming the script include returns the duration in days if (days > balance) { g_form.addErrorMessage(\\"Insufficient PTO\\"); g_form.clearValue('duration'); g_form.clearValue('end_date'); } else { g_form.clearMessages(); g_form.setValue('duration', days); } }); } \`\`\` # Script Include Corrections and Improvements 1. **Correct Usage of GlideSchedule** and **GlideDateTime**: Your approach seems correct, but ensure the Sys ID passed to \`GlideSchedule\` is correct and corresponds to the desired work schedule. 2. **Return Type**: Since you're using \`getNumericValue\` on a GlideDuration object, it returns the duration in milliseconds. If you're processing it as days directly in your Client Script, either convert that into days in your Script Include or change your client script accordingly. # Corrected Script Include Example \`\`\`javascript var PTOAjax = Class.create(); PTOAjax.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { getDatediff: function() { var startDate = new GlideDateTime(); startDate.setDisplayValue(this.getParameter('sysparm_start')); var endDate = new GlideDateTime(); endDate.setDisplayValue(this.getParameter('sysparm_end')); // Ensure you're using the correct sys_id for your scheduled work time var schedule = new GlideSchedule('2d37aaa69781c2102z0036e71153afd9', gs.getProperty('glide.sys.default.tz')); var duration = schedule.duration(startDate, endDate); // Convert to days as integer var days = duration.getNumericValue() / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24); // GlideDuration returns ms return days.toString(); // Ensuring it's a string to prevent XML parsing errors }, type: 'PTOAjax' }); \`\`\` # Notes - Always check the correctness of IDs used (like the Sys ID for \`GlideSchedule\`). - Test thoroughly in sub-production instances before deploying to production. - Watch out for time zone discrepancies, especially if your business operates across multiple time zones. - Consider edge cases around holidays and non-working days when calculating PTO, depending on how your business defines \\"business days.\\" These corrections and considerations should help you address the issues within your PTO application scripts."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, I can show you a conceptual design for a command-line music player UI in ASCII, including basic code on how to generate a similar output. Here’s a design concept: \`\`\` Min:Sec [------O---] <Track Name> \`\`\` In this design: - \`Min:Sec\` displays the current time of the track. - The series of \`-\` (dashes) represent the progress bar. - \`O\` represents the current position within the track. - \`<Track Name>\` represents the name of the song being played. To replicate a simple version of this concept (minus the actual music-playing functionality), you could use a programming language like Python. Here’s an example of how you might generate a dynamic ASCII-based UI similar to the above: \`\`\`python import time track_name = \\"Example Song\\" track_length = 120 # in seconds (2 minutes) current_time = 0 while current_time <= track_length: progress_bar_length = 10 progress_position = int((current_time / track_length) * progress_bar_length) progress_bar = ['-' for _ in range(progress_bar_length)] if progress_position < progress_bar_length: progress_bar[progress_position] = 'O' progress_bar_str = ''.join(progress_bar) mins, secs = divmod(current_time, 60) time_str = f\\"{int(mins):02d}:{int(secs):02d}\\" print(f\\"{time_str} [{progress_bar_str}] {track_name}\\", end='r', flush=True) time.sleep(1) current_time += 1 \`\`\` This Python script: - Simulates the playback of a song called \\"Example Song\\" that is 2 minutes long. - Updates the progress every second to move the 'O' along a 10-character track. - Displays the current playback time in the format \`Min:Sec\`. This is a very simple interpretation and doesn't account for user input, actual audio playing, or dynamic track lengths in terms of adjusting the progress bar fluidly for different song lengths. For actual music playback, you would need to integrate a library that handles audio files, such as \`pygame.mixer\` or \`vlc\`. Remember, this script is just an illustrative example and does not interact with any real music files."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Обычно не оставляю отзывов. Но тут не могла не написать про такой явный обман!!! Приехала покупать Киа Рио. У официального дилера авто стоит 1288000 руб. Здесь обещали супер скидки и ценник в 614 тыс руб! Хотелось посмотреть на машину сразу же. Вместо того, чтобы начать осмотр, менеджер то звонил контрагентам, то погрузчику. Тянул время, как я поняла. Уставшему человеку что угодно можно втюхать. Настаивали на подписании договора и внесения первоначального взноса. Я стояла на своем. Сначала авто покажите. Спустя часа четыре полоскания мозга, менеджер заявил, что по этой цене такой модели нет. Подороже только. Хорошо, что не заплатила! Так и дальше бы деньги тянули. Очень плохо могло закончиться! Люди, обходите стороной этот автосалон!!!","output":"1. Невероятно разочарован абсурдным сервисом в салоне Аквамарин. Пришел туда с мыслью приобрести Форд Фокус, о котором мечтал уже долгое время. Сайт гарантировал акцию с соблазнительной ценой, но реальность оказалась куда грустнее. Менеджеры явно играли в наперстки, каждый раз придумывая новые наценки и условия. Мой восторг быстро превратился в разочарование, когда выяснилось, что обещанная цена возможна только при покупке дополнительно полного пакета невидимых опций. Одни извинения и туманные объяснения, честно признаться, я ожидал большего. Обидно, что потратил столько времени, лишь чтобы уйти ни с чем. 2. Осталась подавлена после визита в автосалон Аквамарин. Ожидала приобрести там свою мечту - Хёндэ i30, но произошедшее выглядело скорее как кошмар. Подкупили объявлением о \\"грандиозных скидках\\", но по факту оказалось все совершенно не так. Менеджер, который должен был мне помогать, большую часть времени просто исчезал, а когда возвращался, то принимался убеждать меня в том, что я действительно хочу другую, гораздо дорогую модель. А когда я настояла на своем, вдруг \\"система заблокировалась\\" и уточнить информацию о наличии машины не получилось. Разочарование полное. Так и уехала, потраченное время и нервы в никуда. Не рекомендую обращаться в этот салон. 3. Никогда бы не поверил, если б сам не столкнулся с таким обманом в Аквамарин при покупке Рено Дастер. Лозунги про лучшие цены оказались чистой водой обманом. Предварительно обговоренная стоимость авто вдруг начала расти прямо на глазах из-за непонятных дополнительных услуг, которые я даже и не заказывал. А менеджер в это время занимался только тем, что пытался мне впарить кредит на выгодных якобы условиях. Как только стало ясно, что я не намерен брать ничего дополнительно, интерес к моей персоне резко пропал, и мое желаемое авто \\"случайно\\" оказалось уже проданным. Такое отношение к клиентам – просто позор! 4. Жалею о каждой минуте, проведенной в салоне Аквамарин. Целью был Ситроен С3, мечта моей жены. Промо-акцию на сайте я принял за честное предложение, а оказалось, что это была просто замануха. Менеджер, которому я доверял, сначала вел себя крайне дружелюбно, но по мере разговора его настойчивость перешла все границы. От \\"выгодных\\" предложений и навязчивых страховок до внезапного исчезновения интересующей меня модели по \\"акционной цене\\". В итоге, предложили ждать новое поступление за полную стоимость. Мое восхищение услугой пропало, как только я осознал, сколько времени и нервов потратил впустую. Надеюсь, мой опыт станет уроком для других. 5. Визит в салон Аквамарин оставил меня крайне недовольным. Мечтал о Volkswagen Polo, но получил лишь головную боль и разбитые надежды. Привлекли меня акционными предложениями, которые оказались ничем иным, как хитроумной ловушкой для привлечения клиентов. После многочасового ожидания и общения с менеджером, который исполнял роль мастера по мозголомству, пришлось уйти, так и не увидев обещанного автомобиля.

Dies geschieht, indem du die entsprechende Header-Zeile für \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\` und gegebenenfalls weitere CORS-relevante Header zusammenstellst. 3. **Header senden**: Senden Sie den zusammengestellten Header als Teil der HTTP-Antwort. Das bedeutet, dass der Header gefolgt von einem doppelten Zeilenumbruch und dann deinen Antwortdaten versendet wird. 4. **Antwortdaten senden**: Nachdem alle Header (einschließlich der CORS-Header) versendet wurden, füge die Antwortdaten deines Servers hinzu und schließe die Übertragung ab. 5. **Verbindung verwalten**: Handle die Möglichkeit, dass der Client (Browser) zunächst eine OPTIONS-Anfrage sendet, um die Verfügbarkeit des Dienstes zu überprüfen. Diese Anfragen müssen auch mit den entsprechenden CORS-Headern beantwortet werden, bevor tatsächliche Datenanfragen bedient werden können.

Dies kann verschiedene Ursachen haben, die von Netzwerkproblemen bis hin zu Konfigurationsfehlern am Server reichen. Hier sind einige Schritte zur Fehlerbehebung, die Ihnen helfen können, das Problem zu lösen: # 1. Überprüfen Sie die Server-URL Stellen Sie sicher, dass die URL, mit der Sie versuchen, eine Verbindung herzustellen, korrekt ist. Achten Sie auf Tippfehler oder falsche Protokolle (ws:// für unverschlüsselte und wss:// für verschlüsselte WebSocket-Verbindungen). # 2. Prüfen Sie den Serverstatus Überprüfen Sie, ob der WebSocket-Server läuft und ordnungsgemäß auf Anfragen reagiert. Wenn Sie Zugriff auf Server-Logs haben, suchen Sie nach Hinweisen darauf, warum die Verbindung abgelehnt wurde. # 3. Firewall- und Netzwerkeinstellungen Stellen Sie sicher, dass keine Firewall oder Netzwerksicherheitseinstellungen (sowohl auf dem Server als auch auf dem Client) den WebSocket-Datenverkehr blockieren. Überprüfen Sie insbesondere, ob die Ports, auf denen der WebSocket-Server läuft, von außen zugänglich sind. # 4. CORS-Policy (für Webanwendungen) Wenn Ihre Anwendung in einem Browser läuft, stellen Sie sicher, dass die CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)-Einstellungen des Servers korrekt konfiguriert sind, um Anfragen von der Domain zuzulassen, von der aus Sie versuchen, eine Verbindung herzustellen. Für WebSocket-Verbindungen kann der \`Origin\`-Header relevant sein. # 5. Überprüfen der Serverkonfiguration Stellen Sie sicher, dass der Server so konfiguriert ist, dass er WebSocket-Anfragen akzeptiert. Dies kann die Überprüfung der Konfigurationsdateien und der installierten Bibliotheken/Module umfassen, um sicherzustellen, dass alles korrekt eingerichtet ist. # 6. Proxy- oder VPN-Probleme Wenn Sie einen Proxy-Server oder VPN verwenden, könnte dies die Verbindung ebenfalls stören.

Der Prozess wird typischerweise durch einen Handshake eingeleitet, bei dem der Client zuerst einen Request sendet, der den Server auffordert, das Protokoll von HTTP zu WebSockets zu wechseln. Hier ist eine vereinfachte Darstellung, wie dieser Handshake funktioniert, ohne spezifischen Code: # Schritt 1: Client-Anfrage Der Client sendet eine HTTP-Anfrage, die spezielle Header enthält, welche den Wunsch nach einem Protokoll-Upgrade anzeigen. Diese Header beinhalten: - \`Upgrade: websocket\`: Dies teilt dem Server mit, dass der Client eine Verbindung zu WebSockets upgraden möchte. - \`Connection: Upgrade\`: Signalisiert, dass die Verbindung geupgradet werden soll. - \`Sec-WebSocket-Key\`: Ein Base64-kodierter Wert, der vom Server für die Antwort verwendet wird, um zu bestätigen, dass er WebSockets versteht. - \`Sec-WebSocket-Version\`: Gibt die WebSocket-Version an, die der Client verwendet. Die aktuelle Version ist 13. # Schritt 2: Server-Antwort Falls der Server das Upgrade akzeptiert, antwortet er mit folgenden Headern: - \`HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\`: Ein Statuscode, der angibt, dass der Server dem Protokoll-Wechsel zugestimmt hat. - \`Upgrade: websocket\` und \`Connection: Upgrade\`: Bestätigt den Wechsel zum WebSocket-Protokoll. - \`Sec-WebSocket-Accept\`: Ein Feld, das eine codierte Version des \`Sec-WebSocket-Key\`-Wertes enthält, den der Client gesendet hat. Dies dient als Bestätigung, dass der Server tatsächlich WebSockets versteht und darauf vorbereitet ist. # Beachten Sie - Die obige Erläuterung ist eine hohe Abstraktion des Handshakes. Der tatsächliche Prozess beinhaltet zusätzliche Schritte und Sicherheitsüberlegungen (wie die Validierung des \`Sec-WebSocket-Accept\`-Wertes). - Sowohl der Client als auch der Server müssen für WebSockets konfiguriert oder programmatisch eingerichtet sein. Für den Server bedeutet dies z.B., dass spezielle WebSocket-Server-Software oder -Bibliotheken verwendet werden müssen, die in der Lage sind, das Upgrade-Protokoll zu verstehen und darauf zu reagieren. - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) ist hauptsächlich ein Browser-Sicherheitsfeature für HTTP-Anfragen und spielt für den eigentlichen WebSocket-Handshake keine Rolle. Allerdings kann es wichtig sein, wenn der initialen HTTP-Upgrade-Anfrage, die in Browsern gestartet wird, CORS-Restriktionen unterliegt. Der Schlüssel zum erfolgreichen Upgrade einer Verbindung auf WebSockets liegt darin, den Initial-Handshake korrekt durchzuführen und sicherzustellen, dass sowohl der Client als auch der Server korrekt für die Verwendung von WebSockets konfiguriert sind."},{"instruction":"wie sieht ein solcher upgrade in php aus?","output":"Das Upgraden einer HTTP-Verbindung zu WebSocket in PHP erfordert manuelles Parsen des HTTP-Upgrade-Requests und das Senden einer entsprechenden Antwort, die das Upgrade genehmigt. PHP bietet keine native Unterstützung für WebSockets, daher müssen Sie die Kommunikation auf Protokollebene selbst verwalten. Hier ist ein vereinfachter Ablauf ohne spezifische Codeimplementierung, um zu zeigen, wie dieses Upgrade in PHP aussehen könnte: 1. **HTTP-Request Empfangen**: Ihr PHP-Script läuft auf einem Server, der auf eingehende Verbindungen hört (dies könnte ein normaler Webserver oder ein mit \`stream_socket_server()\` in PHP erstellter Server sein). Wenn eine Anfrage eintrifft, müssen Sie den rohen Request verarbeiten. 2. **Header Parsen**: Sie extrahieren und parsen die HTTP-Header aus dem Request. Sie suchen nach den spezifischen Headern \`Upgrade: websocket\`, \`Connection: upgrade\`, \`Sec-WebSocket-Key\` und eventuell anderen WebSockets-spezifischen Headern. 3. **Handshake Antwort Zusammensetzen**: Wenn Sie feststellen, dass der Client ein Protokoll-Upgrade anfordert, müssen Sie eine Antwort zusammenstellen, die das Upgrade akzeptiert. Dies beinhaltet: - Die Antwortstatuszeile \`HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\`. - Den \`Upgrade: websocket\` Header. - Den \`Connection: Upgrade\` Header. - Den \`Sec-WebSocket-Accept\`: Ein Header, der den \`Sec-WebSocket-Key\` des Clients nimmt, einen spezifischen GUID (\`258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11\`) anhängt, das Ganze SHA-1 hashet, und das Ergebnis Base64-kodiert. Dies dient als Bestätigung, dass der Server WebSockets versteht. 4. **Antwort Senden**: Sie senden die zusammengestellte Antwort zurück zum Client. Wenn alles korrekt ist, hat das Protokoll nun von HTTP zu WebSockets gewechselt, und Sie können mit dem Austausch von Nachrichten über den WebSockets-Standard beginnen. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass die direkte Handhabung von WebSockets in PHP auf niedriger Ebene komplex und fehleranfällig sein kann. Dies beinhaltet das manuelle Parsen von HTTP-Headern, das Generieren von Handshake-Antworten und das Verarbeiten von Rahmen für WebSocket-Nachrichten. Daher greifen die meisten Entwickler auf Bibliotheken zurück, die die Verwaltung von WebSocket-Verbindungen übernehmen. Libraries wie Ratchet für PHP können den Prozess erheblich vereinfachen, indem sie eine hohe Abstraktionsebene und Tools für die Arbeit mit WebSockets in PHP bieten. Beachten Sie, dass für den Betrieb eines WebSocket-Servers in PHP Ihr Script dauerhaft laufen muss, um Verbindungen zu akzeptieren und Nachrichten zu verarbeiten, was sich von der üblichen Arbeitsweise von PHP (Request-Response-Zyklus) unterscheidet.

Oftmals sind Sie nicht der Erste mit einem bestimmten Problem, und Foren wie Stack Overflow können wertvolle Lösungsansätze bieten. Beachten Sie, dass das Debuggen von Netzwerk- und Socket-Problemen oft detektivische Arbeit erfordert, da viele verschiedene Faktoren zu solchen Fehlern führen können."},{"instruction":"kannst du den setup teil eines vue templates als standalone modul in js schreiben? <script setup> import { ref } from \\"vue\\"; let counter = ref(0); function addOne() { return counter.value++; } <\/script>","output":"Ja, es ist möglich, den Logik-Teil eines Vue-Komponenten-Skripts, das normalerweise innerhalb des \`<script setup>\`-Tags einer .vue-Datei definiert ist, in ein separates JavaScript- oder besser gesagt, ein Vue JavaScript-Modul auszulagern. Dies kann den Code organisierter machen und die Wiederverwendung von Logik über verschiedene Komponenten hinweg erleichtern. Hier ist ein Beispiel, wie man es macht: # Schritt 1 - Erstellung des separaten Vue-Moduls Erstelle eine neue JavaScript-Datei, z.B. \`useCounter.js\`. Dies wird unser Modul sein, in dem wir die Logik definieren, die ursprünglich im \`<script setup>\` unserer Vue-Komponente stand: \`\`\`javascript // useCounter.js import { ref } from \\"vue\\"; export function useCounter() { let counter = ref(0); function addOne() { counter.value++; } return { counter, addOne }; } \`\`\` In diesem Modul definieren wir eine Funktion \`useCounter\`, die unsere \`ref\` und Funktion \`addOne\` enthält. Diese Funktion gibt dann ein Objekt zurück, das auf den \`counter\` und die \`addOne\`-Funktion verweist, damit sie in einer Komponente verfügbar gemacht werden können. # Schritt 2 – Importieren und Verwenden des Moduls in einer Vue-Komponente Jetzt können Sie das Modul in Ihrer Komponente importieren und verwenden. Hier ist, wie es in einer \`.vue\`-Datei verwendet werden könnte: \`\`\`vue <script setup> import { useCounter } from './useCounter'; const { counter, addOne } = useCounter(); <\/script> <template> <div> <p>{{ counter }}</p> <button @click=\\"addOne\\">Add One</button> </div> </template> \`\`\` In der \`<script setup>\`-Sektion Ihrer Vue-Komponente importieren Sie einfach die Funktion \`useCounter\` aus dem Modul \`useCounter.js\` und verwenden sie, um \`counter\` und \`addOne\` zugänglich zu machen. Diese werden dann im Template genauso verwendet, wie wenn sie direkt in der Komponente definiert wären. # Fazit Durch Auslagern der Logik in ein separates Modul wird Ihr Code nicht nur sauberer und organisierter, sondern Sie ermöglichen auch eine leichtere Wiederverwendung von Logik über verschiedene Komponenten hinweg.

Stattdessen werden Props in der Komponente definiert, die das Modul verwendet, und dann an das Modul übergeben. Jedoch kann man Argumente oder externe Reaktive Referenzen, einschließlich Props, die in der Komponente definiert sind, an das externe Modul übergeben, um dort verwendet oder manipuliert zu werden. Hier ist, wie das funktioniert: # Schritt 1: Definiere Props in der Komponente Zuerst definierst du die Props in deiner Vue-Komponente, genau wie du es normalerweise tun würdest. \`\`\`vue <!-- MeineKomponente.vue --> <script setup> import { useCustomLogic } from './useCustomLogic.js'; import { defineProps } from 'vue'; // Definiere die Props deiner Komponente. const props = defineProps({ initialCounter: Number }); const { counter, addOne } = useCustomLogic(props.initialCounter); <\/script> <template> <div> <p>{{ counter }}</p> <button @click=\\"addOne\\">Add One</button> </div> </template> \`\`\` # Schritt 2: Übergebe die Props an das Modul Du übergibst die Props (oder deren Werte) dann als Argumente an deine externe Logikfunktion, wenn du sie in deiner Komponente aufrufst. \`\`\`javascript // useCustomLogic.js import { ref } from 'vue'; export function useCustomLogic(initialValue) { let counter = ref(initialValue); function addOne() { counter.value++; } return { counter, addOne }; } \`\`\` In diesem Beispiel nimmt die externe Funktion \`useCustomLogic\`, die aus \`useCustomLogic.js\` importiert wird, \`initialValue\` als Argument entgegen. Dieser Wert wird aus den Props der Komponente beim Aufruf der Funktion übergeben (\`props.initialCounter\` in diesem Fall). # Hinweise zur Verwendung von Props in Externen Modulen - Diese Methode sorgt für eine klare Trennung zwischen der Komponentenspezifikation (einschließlich Props-Definition) und der Business-Logik (die in externe Dateien ausgelagert wird). - Sie erlaubt es dir, die Flexibilität und Wiederverwendbarkeit von externen Funktionen zu erhöhen, indem du sie unabhängig von spezifischen Prop-Namen machst. Die Funktionen arbeiten mit gegebenen Argumenten, ohne sich um den Kontext zu kümmern, aus dem diese Argumente stammen. - Diese Technik unterstützt einen sauberen und modularisierten Codeansatz und folgt der Komposition API Philosophie, wodurch die Wiederverwendbarkeit und Testbarkeit des Codes verbessert wird.

Dies geschieht hauptsächlich über die \`provide\` und \`inject\` Funktionen. Das \`provide\` und \`inject\` API-Paar ermöglicht es einer parent Komponente (oder einem Vorfahr), Abhängigkeiten bereitzustellen, die von child Komponenten (oder Nachkommen) genutzt werden können, ohne dass die Abhängigkeit über Props übergeben wird.

Vue weiß, in welcher Komponentenhierarchie es sich befindet und kann korrekt auf die bereitgestellten Abhängigkeiten zugreifen. - Indem Sie die Verwendung von \`inject\` in eine Funktion einschließen, die dann innerhalb des gültigen Komponentenkontextes aufgerufen wird, halten Sie Ihren Code modular und profitieren von der Dependency Injection, ohne die oben genannten Einschränkungen zu verletzen. Stellen Sie sicher, dass jegliche Interaktion mit der Composition API, einschließlich der Verwendung von \`provide\` und \`inject\`, innerhalb des gültigen Kontextes einer Vue-Komponente stattfindet.

Parameter ermöglichen es Funktionen, mit unterschiedlichen Eingaben aufgerufen zu werden und unterschiedliche Ergebnisse zu erzeugen. - **Rückgabewert**: Viele Funktionen geben einen Wert zurück. Nachdem der Codeblock der Funktion ausgeführt wurde, kann das Ergebnis dieser Ausführung an den Ort zurückgegeben werden, von dem die Funktion aufgerufen wurde. - **Funktionskörper**: Dies ist der Block von Code, der die eigentlichen Anweisungen enthält, die die Funktion ausführt. # Beispiel in JavaScript \`\`\`javascript function addieren(x, y) { return x + y; } const ergebnis = addieren(5, 7); console.log(ergebnis); // Gibt 12 aus \`\`\` In diesem Beispiel: - Der Name der Funktion ist \`addieren\`. - Die Funktion nimmt zwei Parameter entgegen: \`x\` und \`y\`. - Der Funktionskörper besteht aus einer einzigen Anweisung, die die Summe von \`x\` und \`y\` zurückgibt. - Das Ergebnis des Funktionsaufrufs wird in der Variablen \`ergebnis\` gespeichert. # Verwendung in spezifischen Kontexten Abhängig vom Kontext, in dem Sie programmieren (z.B. Webentwicklung mit JavaScript, Datenanalyse mit Python, Systemprogrammierung mit C), können Funktionen für vielfältige Zwecke eingesetzt werden, wie: - Ereignisbehandlung (z.B. eine Funktion, die aufgeführt wird, wenn ein Benutzer auf eine Schaltfläche klickt). - Datenverarbeitung und -transformation. - Durchführung von Berechnungen und logischen Operationen. - Steuerung des Programmflusses durch Aufrufen anderer Funktionen oder Methoden. Funktionen sind ein fundamentales Programmierkonzept und essenziell für die Entwicklung von effizienten, sauberen und wiederverwendbaren Code."},{"instruction":"scrivi una canzone sulla primavera stile dannunzio","output":"(Nota: La canzone che segue è ispirata allo stile di Gabriele D'Annunzio, con un tentativo di catturare la sua ricchezza linguistica, i riferimenti classici e la passione per la bellezza. Ricordiamo che D'Annunzio era noto per il suo lirismo estremo e il decadentismo.) **Canzone della Primavera Perduta** I Oh venere niobe de l'eterno rinascere, L'alba tesse d'oro i crini su l'orlo del mondo. Aquiloni fugaci abbandonano l'embrice preda, E tu, Primavera, ti ergi sovrana pura Di foglie verdi e della promessa di vita. Le tue mani invisibili dipingono di fremiti L'acre sentiero di selvaggi fiori aperti. II Su le colline d’ebano e di miele, Ove la terra bacia il cielo in un sogno d’opale, Si levano i canti dei poeti dimenticati. Eco di loro passi in questa valle sacrata, Dove Afrodite plasmava l'argilla degli uomini, Un coro di ninfe erranti sfiora l'acqua cristallina, Cucchiaiando il riflesso d’una gloria svanita. III Sotto l'olivo millenario, eroi e dei confabulano, Nel muto dialogo tra le stirpi dei mortali e l'immortale. Tu, Primavera, intrecci la vita e l'arte in un abbraccio eterno, Mettendo a tacere la brama d'infinito che nel cuore arde. Un bacio fuggevole di Zefiro riaccende l'antica fiamma, E la terra, setosa e feconda, accoglie il seme promesso. IV Ma ecco, l'anima avara di distante nostalgia, Piangendo la perdita di quelle epoche dorate. In questo idillio scolpito, o Primavera, tu rinasce maestosa, Rivelando nel tuo manto di giunchiglia e di rose, La trama tessuta dall'eternità per mano d'artefice divino. Chi or osa scorgere nel tuo risveglio la fine del suo inverno, S'innalza all'empireo, al cospetto della bellezza pura. V Così canto te, Primavera, musa e dea dell'oblio, Che porti nei tuoi occhi l'alba dei tempi futuri. Che il tuo bacio risvegli quest'animo sonnolento, Onde affrontare il corso delle stagioni, con l'ardor dei giovani leoni, E vivere mille volte, in ogni tuo fiore rinato, L'immortalità che in ogni tuo soffio l'anima intravede, In questo ciclo perpetuo d'amor, vita e morte. - Finito. (Sperando che questa creazione in stile dannunziano possa essere di tuo gradimento, ricordiamo l'importante influenza della natura, della bellezza e del rinascimento spirituale nella poesia e nella prosa di D'Annunzio.)"},{"instruction":"was mach diese funktion? function seal(socketData) { b1 = 0x80 | (0x1 & 0x0f); length = strlen(socketData); if(length <= 125) header = pack('CC', b1, length); elseif(length > 125 && length < 65536) header = pack('CCn', b1, 126, length); elseif(length >= 65536) header = pack('CCNN', b1, 127, length); return header.socketData; }","output":"Diese Funktion namens \`seal\` ist dafür ausgelegt, Daten für die Übertragung über WebSockets vorzubereiten. WebSockets nutzen ein spezifisches Format zum Senden und Empfangen von Daten, das unter anderem die Länge der Daten und einen Rahmen (engl. \\"frame\\") um diese Daten herum beinhaltet. Lassen Sie uns die Funktion Schritt für Schritt durchgehen: 1. **Initialisierung und Bestimmung des ersten Bytes (\`b1\`):** - \`b1 = 0x80 | (0x1 & 0x0f);\` setzt das erste Byte. Das Bitmuster \`0x80\` entspricht dem Binärwert \`10000000\`, was bedeutet, dass das FIN-Bit gesetzt ist, um anzuzeigen, dass dies die finale Nachricht (oder der einzige Rahmen einer Nachricht) ist. Das \`0x1\` stellt den Opcode für eine Textdatennachricht dar (Binär \`0001\`). Die Verwendung von \`& 0x0f\` (Binär \`00001111\`) ist eigentlich redundant in diesem Zusammenhang, da \`0x1\` bereits ein 4-Bit-Wert ist. Das Ergebnis ist \`10000001\` (FIN-Bit gesetzt + Text-Opcode). 2. **Berechnung der Länge der Nutzdaten (\`length\`) und Vorbereitung des Headers:** - Die Länge der zu sendenden Daten wird mittels \`strlen(socketData)\` ermittelt. - Abhängig von der Länge der Daten wählt die Funktion dann ein passendes Format für den Header: - **Weniger als oder gleich 125 Bytes:** Das Format ist einfach. Neben dem ersten Byte (\`b1\`) wird nur ein weiteres Byte benötigt, um die Länge darzustellen. - **Zwischen 126 und 65535 Bytes (inklusive):** Daten, die länger als 125 Bytes, aber weniger als oder gleich 65535 Bytes sind, benötigen zusätzlich zum ersten Byte und einem Byte mit dem Wert \`126\` zwei weitere Bytes (\`CCn\`), um die Länge als unsignierte 16-Bit-Ganzzahl (\`n\`) darzustellen. - **Mehr als 65535 Bytes:** Für Nachrichten, die länger als 65535 Bytes sind, wird das Format mit einem Byte nach dem ersten Byte mit dem Wert \`127\` und dann vier weiteren Bytes genutzt, um die Länge darzustellen. Allerdings scheint hier ein Fehler in der Funktion zu sein, denn es wird \`pack('CCNN', b1, 127, length)\` verwendet, aber die korrekte Nutzung für eine Länge, die in 64 Bit kodiert wird (also bei Nachrichten größer als 65535 Bytes), sollte \`pack('CCN', b1, 127, 0, length)\` oder eine ähnliche Struktur sein, die tatsächlich eine 64-bit Länge darstellen kann, wobei hier eine Anpassung notwendig wäre, um die tatsächliche Größe richtig zu kodieren. 3. **Zusammensetzen und Rückgabe der Nachricht:** - Schließlich wird der präparierte Header mit den eigentlichen Daten (\`socketData\`) konkateniert und das Ergebnis zurückgegeben. Dieser Schritt ist essentiell, damit der empfangende WebSocket-Server (oder Client) den Anfang der Daten korrekt identifizieren und die Daten entsprechend decodieren kann. Zusammenfassend ist die Funktion \`seal\` dafür gedacht, eine Nachricht für die Übertragung über einen WebSocket in das korrekte Rahmenformat zu verpacken, indem sie den richtigen Header basierend auf der Nachrichtenlänge hinzufügt."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Im Wesentlichen bereitet sie die Daten (\\"socketData\\") vor, indem sie einen passenden Frame-Header basierend auf der Länge der Daten hinzufügt, bevor die Daten gesendet werden. Hier ist, was die Funktion macht, aufgeschlüsselt nach ihren Hauptteilen: 1. **Erzeugung des ersten Bytes des Headers (\`b1\`)**: - Das erste Byte des WebSocket-Frames besteht aus zwei Teilen: den FIN- und Opcode-Bits. - \`0x80\` stellt das FIN-Bit dar, welches auf 1 gesetzt wird, was bedeutet, dass dies die letzte Nachricht des Frames ist (oder ein einziger Frame, der komplett ist). Es ist ein Bestandteil des Kontrollmechanismus, der angibt, ob die Nachricht fortgesetzt wird oder nicht. - \`(0x1 & 0x0f)\` definiert den Opcode, der den Typ der Daten angibt (in diesem Fall Textdaten, da der Opcode 0x1 ist). Der Opcode wird mit 0x0f verundet, was aber in diesem Kontext unnötig ist, da 0x1 bereits innerhalb der Grenzen von 0x0f ist und das Ergebnis immer 0x1 sein wird. 2. **Bestimmung der Länge der Daten und Auswahl des passenden Headers**: - Die Funktion berechnet zuerst die Länge der Daten, die gesendet werden sollen, und wählt dann den passenden Header basierend auf dieser Länge aus. - Wenn die Länge \`<= 125\`, benutzt sie einen Header, der nur aus zwei Bytes besteht: dem ersten Byte (wie oben berechnet) und einem einzigen Byte für die Länge. - Für Längen \`> 125\` und \`< 65536\` (d.h. passt in einen unsigned 16-bit Integer), erweitert sie den Header um weitere zwei Bytes: eines für den Längenindikator \`126\` und zwei weitere Bytes (\`n\`), die die tatsächliche Länge (16-bit) angeben. - Für Längen \`>= 65536\`, was bedeutet, dass die Daten in einen 64-bit Integer für die Länge passen, erweitert sie den Header weiter, indem sie den Längenindikator \`127\` und vier Bytes für die Länge benutzt. Allerdings gibt es einen Fehler im Code, denn für eine Länge von 64-bit sollte der Header \`pack('CCN', b1, 127, 0, length)\` benutzen, wobei \`N\` 32-bit (4 Bytes) darstellt. Es sollten hier tatsächlich zwei \`N\` Werte sein, um 64-bit darzustellen (\`pack('CCNN', b1, 127, 0, length)\`, wobei hier vermutlich anstelle einer direkt \`length\`-Zuordnung eine Aufteilung der tatsächlichen Länge auf die oberen und unteren 32 Bits der 64-Bit-Länge erfolgen sollte). 3. **Zusammenfügen und Rückgabe**: - Schließlich wird der vorbereitete Header mit den eigentlichen Daten verkettet und zurückgegeben, fertig zur Übermittlung über die WebSocket-Verbindung. Zusammenfassend erstellt diese Funktion einen WebSocket-Frame mit einem korrekt formatierten Header basierend auf der Größe der Daten und fügt die Daten zum Senden hinzu. Es gibt jedoch einen Fehler im Umgang mit Datenlängen, die 65536 Bytes überschreiten, der behoben werden muss, um korrekt zu funktionieren."},{"instruction":"USE dsw_ec3; CREATE TABLE categorias ( id_categoria INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, descripción VARCHAR(100) ); CREATE TABLE imagenes ( id_imagen INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, nombre VARCHAR(100), formato VARCHAR(50), resolucion VARCHAR(50), peso INT, fecha DATE, id_categoria INT, FOREIGN KEY (id_categoria) REFERENCES categorias(id_categoria) ); - de esta vace de datos agrega 5 registros en categorias y 10 registros en imagenes","output":"Para agregar 5 registros en la tabla \\"categorias\\" y 10 registros en la tabla \\"imagenes\\", puedes utilizar las siguientes instrucciones SQL.

Sin embargo, es importante destacar que al utilizar \`CHANGE COLUMN\`, también debes especificar el tipo de dato de la columna junto con cualquier atributo o restricción que tenga, incluso si no deseas modificar esos aspectos. Aquí te muestro cómo puedes hacerlo: 1. Primero, asegúrate de tener acceso a tu base de datos a través de la consola de comandos de MySQL, phpMyAdmin, o cualquier otra herramienta de administración de bases de datos que prefieras y esté proporcionada por XAMPP. 2. Luego, necesitas conocer con precisión el nombre actual de la columna que deseas renombrar, el tipo de dato, y cualquier otra restricción o atributo relevante. 3. Utiliza el siguiente comando SQL, ajustándolo a tus necesidades específicas: \`\`\`sql ALTER TABLE nombre_tabla CHANGE COLUMN nombre_columna_actual nuevo_nombre_columna TIPO_DE_DATO [AtributosDeColumna]; \`\`\` **Ejemplo:** Supongamos que tienes una tabla llamada \`usuarios\` y una columna en esa tabla llamada \`nombre\` que deseas renombrar a \`primer_nombre\`. La columna es de tipo VARCHAR con una longitud máxima de 50 caracteres. Aquí está cómo lo harías: \`\`\`sql ALTER TABLE usuarios CHANGE COLUMN nombre primer_nombre VARCHAR(50); \`\`\` Este comando cambiará el nombre de la columna \`nombre\` a \`primer_nombre\` y mantiene su tipo de dato como VARCHAR(50). **Adicionalmente**, si está utilizando una versión de MySQL donde se soporta (MySQL 8.0 o superior), puedes usar \`RENAME COLUMN\` para cambiar el nombre de la columna de una manera un poco más sencilla, ya que no necesitas especificar el tipo de dato de la columna de nuevo: \`\`\`sql ALTER TABLE nombre_tabla RENAME COLUMN nombre_columna_actual TO nuevo_nombre_columna; \`\`\` Recuerda que es buena práctica hacer una copia de seguridad de tu base de datos antes de realizar cambios estructurales como renombrar columnas para evitar la pérdida de datos accidental.

El error que mencionas indica que estás tratando de asignar un \`java.util.Date\` a un método que espera un \`java.sql.Date\`. Para resolver esto, necesitas convertir de \`java.util.Date\` a \`java.sql.Date\`. Aquí te muestro cómo hacer esta conversión: Si tienes un \`java.util.Date\` llamado \`fecha\` en tu clase \`Imagen\`, cuando quieras establecer este valor en un \`PreparedStatement\` llamado \`ps\`, puedes hacerlo de la siguiente manera: \`\`\`java java.util.Date fechaUtil = imagen.getFecha(); // Suponiendo que getFecha() devuelve un java.util.Date java.sql.Date fechaSql = new java.sql.Date(fechaUtil.getTime()); // Convierte java.util.Date a java.sql.Date ps.setDate(5, fechaSql); \`\`\` Este fragmento de código primero captura la fecha como un \`java.util.Date\`, luego la convierte a \`java.sql.Date\` usando el constructor \`java.sql.Date(long time)\` pasando el tiempo en milisegundos (obtenido con \`fechaUtil.getTime()\`), y finalmente asigna este \`java.sql.Date\` al \`PreparedStatement\`.

Vamos a detallar cómo hacer esta conversión correctamente para evitar el error de incompatibilidad entre \`java.util.Date\` y \`java.sql.Date\`: # Paso 1: Convertir \`java.util.Date\` a \`java.sql.Date\` Para insertar una fecha (\`java.util.Date\`) en la base de datos utilizando JDBC, primero debes convertirla a \`java.sql.Date\`. Esto se puede realizar obteniendo el tiempo en milisegundos del objeto \`java.util.Date\` y pasándolo al constructor de \`java.sql.Date\`: \`\`\`java // img es tu objeto que contiene la información a insertar, incluida la fecha java.util.Date fechaUtil = img.getFecha(); // Asume que fecha es de tipo java.util.Date java.sql.Date fechaSql = new java.sql.Date(fechaUtil.getTime()); \`\`\` # Paso 2: Usar la fecha convertida en \`PreparedStatement\` Una vez que has convertido la fecha a \`java.sql.Date\`, estás listo para asignarla a tu \`PreparedStatement\`: \`\`\`java PreparedStatement ps = conexion.prepareStatement(\\"INSERT INTO imagenes (nombre, formato, resolucion, peso_kb, fecha, id_categoria) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\\"); // Seteando los otros valores... ps.setString(1, img.getNombre()); ps.setString(2, img.getFormato()); // y así sucesivamente para los demás atributos... // Establecer la fecha convertida ps.setDate(5, fechaSql); // Asumiendo que el índice 5 corresponde a la columna de fecha \`\`\` # Conclusión Este proceso garantiza que puedes trabajar con objetos de fecha de manera más flexible en tu aplicación Java y luego realizar la conversión adecuada cuando necesitas interactuar con tu base de datos a través de JDBC.

Eliminar o Reemplazar la Opción \`-Xbootclasspath/p\` - **Eliminar la Opción**: Si tu proyecto no necesita realmente modificar el classpath de arranque de la JVM, la solución más simple es simplemente eliminar esta opción de tus configuraciones de compilación o ejecución. Revisa tu \`pom.xml\` (si estás usando Maven), \`build.gradle\` (si usas Gradle), scripts Ant, o configuraciones del IDE para localizar y eliminar la opción \`-Xbootclasspath/p\`. - **Reemplazar la Opción**: Si tu proyecto necesita agregar específicamente algo al classpath de arranque para sobrescribir clases en la biblioteca estándar de Java o algo similar, podrías usar la opción \`--patch-module\` disponible desde Java 9. Esta opción permite modificar el contenido de un módulo específico al agregar o reemplazar clases. Sin embargo, el uso de \`--patch-module\` es altamente específico y depende del contenido exacto que estabas añadiendo con \`-Xbootclasspath/p\`. # 2. Analizar la Necesidad de los Argumentos JVM Personalizados Dado que estas opciones afectan profundamente cómo se ejecutan tus programas Java, es importante entender completamente por qué se está añadiendo un argumento particular a la JVM. En muchos casos, con las mejoras hechas en el modelo de módulos de Java y otras actualizaciones de la plataforma, podrías encontrar que ya no es necesario modificar el classpath de arranque. # 3. Asegurarse de la Compatibilidad de las Dependencias Si estabas utilizando \`-Xbootclasspath/p\` para resolver problemas de compatibilidad de versiones con bibliotecas incluidas tanto en tu aplicación como en la JVM, sería sabio revisar si esas bibliotecas han sido actualizadas para ser compatibles con Java 17 o posteriores. Esto puede ser una solución más sostenible que intentar forzar una versión antigua de una biblioteca en el classpath de arranque. # 4. Consultar la Documentación Oficial Java ha evolucionado significativamente desde las versiones en las que \`-Xbootclasspath/p\` estaba disponible y recomendado para su uso. Revisar [la documentación oficial de Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/) puede ofrecerte guías actualizadas y mejores prácticas para lo que estás tratando de lograr. # Conclusión Resolver este error implicará algunas modificaciones en cómo configuras tu entorno de ejecución o compilación de Java. La clave está en comprender por qué necesitabas \`-Xbootclasspath/p\` y cómo puedes lograr el mismo objetivo con las herramientas y opciones que Java 17 (o la versión que estés utilizando) proporciona."},{"instruction":"\\"별처럼 아름다운 사랑이여 꿈처럼 행복했던 사랑이여 머물고 간 바람처럼 기약 없이 멀어져간 내 사랑아 한 송이 꽃으로 피어나라 지지 않는 사랑의 꽃으로 다시 한번 내 가슴에 돌아오라 사랑이여 내 사랑아 아~ 사랑은 타 버린 불꽃 아~ 사랑은 한 줄기 바람인 것을 아~ 까맣게 잊으려 해도 왜 나는 너를 잊지 못 하나 오 내 사랑\\" 이란 가사로 노래 동영상을 만들 때 그림 배경을 넣기 위한 시나리오를 작성해줘","output":"**노래 동영상 시나리오: \\"아름다운 사랑의 노래\\"** **장면 1: 별빛 가득한 밤하늘** - 배경: 반짝이는 별들로 가득 찬 밤하늘. 카메라는 천천히 하늘에서 지상으로 내려온다. - 텍스트: \\"별처럼 아름다운 사랑이여\\" **장면 2: 꿈같은 행복한 순간** - 배경: 연인들이 손을 잡고 해변을 걷는 모습. 주변은 황홀한 석양으로 물들어 있으며, 부드러운 파도 소리가 들린다. - 텍스트: \\"꿈처럼 행복했던 사랑이여\\" **장면 3: 바람이 지나가는 들판** - 배경: 넓은 들판에 불어오는 바람에 흔들리는 꽃들과 풀잎. 바람이 지나간 후의 고요함과 허전함을 표현한다. - 텍스트: \\"머물고 간 바람처럼 기약 없이 멀어져간 내 사랑아\\" **장면 4: 피어나는 꽃** - 배경: 척박한 땅에서 아름다운 한 송이 꽃이 힘겹게 피어나는 모습. 꽃은 화면을 점점 채워가며 힘차게 자라난다. - 텍스트: \\"한 송이 꽃으로 피어나라 지지 않는 사랑의 꽃으로\\" **장면 5: 가슴에 꽃을 품다** - 배경: 인물의 가슴 부근에 손을 얹으며, 그 속에서 빛이 나오는 듯한 연출. 빛은 점차 꽃 모양으로 확장되며 화면을 밝힌다. - 텍스트: \\"다시 한번 내 가슴에 돌아오라 사랑이여 내 사랑아\\" **장면 6: 타버린 불꽃과 바람** - 배경: 불꽃이 타오르다 서서히 재가 되어 사라지는 장면으로 전환. 이어서 잔잔한 바람이 재를 날려 보내는 모습. - 텍스트: \\"아~ 사랑은 타 버린 불꽃, 아~ 사랑은 한 줄기 바람인 것을\\" **장면 7: 기억 속의 그림자** - 배경: 어둠 속에서 연인의 모습이 찰나의 순간 나타났다가 사라진다. 그 사이로 흐르는 기억의 조각들을 연출한다. - 텍스트: \\"아~ 까맣게 잊으려 해도 왜 나는 너를 잊지 못 하나\\" **장면 8: 마지막 고백** - 배경: 밤하늘 아래 혼자 서 있는 인물의 모습. 손에 들고 있는 꽃을 바라보며, 꽃잎이 하나씩 떨어져 나가는 장면으로 심금을 울린다. - 텍스트: \\"오 내 사랑\\" **후기 장면: 별이 된 사랑** - 배경: 마지막 꽃잎이 떨어진 자리에서 손을 하늘로 뻗은 인물. 그의 손끝에서 작은 빛이 나와 하늘로 올라가 별이 된다. - 텍스트: 없음.

First, carefully read the previously translated texts to understand the context: Text 292: “I understand, Branch Manager.” The elf who had approached Seong Jihan looked slightly surprised, then bowed his head to the masked elf. ‘A branch manager, huh.’ The Ancient Elf wearing that mask last time was a constellation-level enforcer. What level would the branch manager of the loan counter be? ‘Hard to tell exactly, but he doesn’t seem weaker than that Ancient Elf.’ The branch manager had a pleasant smile plastered on his face. But seeing him wearing that mask that contained immense void energy, he didn’t seem like an easy opponent either. After all, this was a place that handled loans for powerful players that ruled BattleNet. The person in charge here wouldn’t be weak. “This way please, valued customer.” Ziiing. As the branch manager gestured, a green portal appeared. “That portal… is it a VIP room?” “You need to at least be a constellation to enter that.” “Why is that species…” “I’ve never seen the branch manager personally handle a consultation either.” The surrounding players scrutinized Seong Jihan upon seeing the branch manager’s guidance, but- “I have no idea.” “He seems much weaker than me…” “He’s not a constellation, right?” “Still, he has a premium membership. He’s no ordinary player.” With his power concealed and possessing a premium membership, they couldn’t determine Seong Jihan’s strength. ‘A VIP room… I suppressed my energy to an extent, but what did he glean from me?’ Shall I go and see. Seong Jihan nodded and entered the portal. What appeared was a vast space enclosed by brown walls on all sides. “The previous customer was a tree giant race, so the space wasn’t ready. Please wait a moment.” Clap. Clap. As the branch manager clapped twice- [The VIP room environment will be changed to match your race.] This message appeared before Seong Jihan’s eyes. Then- Ziiing… The interior transformed into a luxurious modern reception room. “Now then… before starting the loan consultation, please provide the basic personal information required for the loan review.” Sitting down, the branch manager grinned and opened his palm. A message window popped up in front of Seong Jihan. [The Green Administrator-operated ‘World Tree Union Loan Counter’ requests basic player information required for loan review.] [Will you provide your basic personal information?] Give my personal info to the World Tree Union? That’s like entrusting a cat with fish. Seong Jihan immediately pressed No and replied. “I don’t want to give it.” “Don’t worry. Although you are one of the World Tree Union’s targets, the loan counter will never leak your information.” “…I’m a target?” “Yes, you’re quite famous.” Tap. Tap. The branch manager smiled deeply and tapped his mask. “Thanks to my senior dying, I inherited this void disposal container.” “Senior…” “That foolish senior who normally acted so high and mighty, only to get blown up by you on that planet conoliaztion map.” The senior he referred to was likely the Ancient Elf who died along with the Brahma. They invited me here knowing everything already. Realizing there was a reason the branch manager personally stepped forward, Seong Jihan stared at his half-mask. The mask the branch manager called a void disposal container. It also spewed out tremendous void when the Ancient Elf died. “You call that mask a void disposal container? The other one broke though.” “This is a trash can. You can just make another trash can.” “Hmm…” “Anyways, as the person in charge of the loan counter that must remain the most neutral in BattleNet - rest assured, your personal information will never be leaked.” As if it won’t leak. How can I trust a World Tree Elf. Seong Jihan smiled and waved his hand. “It’s fine since I didn’t come here for a loan anyways, I was just lured by your ad. Just give me the free gift.” “Ah… is that so? Normally you’re supposed to fill out your personal info to receive the gift.” Clap. Clap. As the branch manager clapped twice, an elaborately wrapped fruit basket appeared on the desk. “To commemorate meeting our target as well, I’ll give it to you directly using my branch manager authority.” “You’re being nice to your target without even trying to catch me.” “Haha. What’s the point of catching your avatar? Plus, from my personal perspective, you’re the benefactor who allowed me to inherit the void disposal container position.” “Didn’t you say it was a trash can?” “Yes. But being in charge of this trash can is quite a high position in our union.” The branch manager continued smiling as he spoke. But Seong Jihan didn’t believe his words for now. There could be some device in that fruit basket he gave, like the fruit the administrator gave before. ‘Let’s see.’ Rip! Seong Jihan tore open the fruit basket wrapping. The scent of life energy wafted out from inside. “Will you eat it here? Since we’ve met like this, shall we have some tea time together?” “Have tea with you? We have nothing to talk about.” “Now, now. Hear me out. There are some things I looked into regarding that other world of yours…” “By other world, you mean Earth?” Swish. Two teacups appeared on the desk, steam rising from them. “That’s right. You probably won’t believe most of what I say anyways. But you can take what’s appropriate and filter out the rest, no? That fruit. It would be a bit unsettling to eat it on your original planet too.” “Why is that?” “Fruit exists to spread its seeds far and wide. If you consume it on your planet, our seeds could spread there.” The phenomenon the branch manager spoke of. It was something Seong Jihan also experienced when he ate the seed of life the Green Administrator gave as a reward. ‘For him to bring that up… interesting.’ Knowing it won’t spread once it enters Seong Jihan’s mouth. Did he mention it first to gain his trust? Well, let’s hear him out. Seong Jihan brought a piece of fruit to his mouth and nodded. “Alright. I’ll listen.” “Thank you. Then, since you’re busy, let’s get straight to the point.” Tap. As the branch manager snapped his fingers, an image of Earth appeared in the air. * * “Planet Earth… From what I found out, this place was a site where our union conducted experiments long ago.” “I know that. That’s why the Ancient Elf tried to personally descend there but couldn’t.” “Yes. Actually, such cases are very rare. The locations where experiments are conducted are all recorded. No matter how ignorant and reckless my senior was, our system basically keeps track of that much.” The branch manager who seemed to dislike his ‘senior’ Ancient Elf. He lightly dissed his senior and continued. “But the fact that he didn’t know until trying to enter Earth means the experiment on Earth wasn’t registered in our system… After being humiliated, my senior returned and issued an order.” “He arrogantly tried to descend to Earth then but had to back out.” “Yes. He told even me, his junior, to find out what happened. Seriously. He should look into it himself. He became branch manager but still thinks I’m his lackey.” The branch manager looked like he would endlessly diss the dead Ancient Elf if left alone. “The dead guy is irrelevant. So what did you find out?” “Ah, my apologies. I have a lot of pent-up frustration with my senior… Haha. Anyways, I looked into it at my senior’s order. Earth… turns out some interesting experiments were conducted there.” “What kind of experiments?” Crunch. Seong Jihan asked nonchalantly while eating the fruit. With zero trust in elves, he figured the branch manager was trying to spout more lies. No matter what he said, Seong Jihan had little interest. “The director of the Earth lab fused himself with the World Tree. He even mixed in data from powerful races.” “I don’t really get what that means.” “Well, you wouldn’t know the situation on our side. We conduct various projects across the universe, but there is one thing we must never touch. That’s the assigned World Tree. But for some reason, the lab director touched it. He fused with it.” “And?” “We lost contact with the Earth side, and later the union’s investigation team was dispatched there… but they only sent a message saying ‘High-level Error Occurred’ before going missing.” “A high-level error…” An experiment the World Tree Union conducted on Earth. Did some error occur there? “Are there no details about the high-level error?” “No. The report I found had the contents deleted. Such cases are rare.” “Hmm…” Seong Jihan looked at the branch manager who was still smiling. It felt like rather than being unable to say due to deletion, he was deliberately not revealing that much. Unfazed by Seong Jihan’s gaze, the branch manager continued. “And at the end of the report, it said ‘Ultimately resolved the error in cooperation with the Void. Failed to recover data.’” “If it was resolved, why did data recovery fail?” “The Void Faction probably deleted it.” “Hmm…” The Void was involved, huh. Hearing that, Seong Jihan thought of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh who betrayed the Void. The fact that he betrayed means he previously cooperated with or belonged to them. Could it be related to this incident? “So when was that error resolved?” “The exact time isn’t specified, but it was likely quite long ago.” “I see.” If the elf says it was long ago, it’s probably an ancient incident. Seong Jihan organized the information in his head. A ‘high-level error’ that occurred due to the unusual experiment of the World Tree Elf who settled on Earth. It was ultimately resolved through the cooperation of the World Tree Union and the Void. ‘The World Tree Union and Void don’t seem to be on good terms, but if they cooperated to that extent… it was an error worthy of being called high-level.’ Seong Jihan stared at the branch manager’s mask. That mask the branch manager called a void disposal container, a trash can. It compressed and stored an immense amount of void. If guys like them temporarily joined hands with the Void, the high-level error must have been a tremendous problem. “Anyways, perhaps because it’s related to the high-level error issue - the higher-ups didn’t register the Earth-related problem in our system. That’s why my senior was humiliated after boldly declaring he would descend to Earth.” “I see.” Nod. Seong Jihan nodded and finished eating all the fruit. The life energy accumulating in his body. He didn’t stop there and drank the tea on the table as well. Among the life energy building up inside him, something peculiar wriggled, but- Zzt… He expelled it by igniting Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit from his fingertips. Seong Jihan, who deliberately used his old Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit instead of revealing his enemy energy. “The energy only reacts with the tea too. Interesting.” “What…! There was something like that?!” The branch manager made a fuss upon seeing the green smoke rising from Seong Jihan’s fingertips. Seeing that, Seong Jihan grinned. He’s good at pretending to be oblivious. “So why did you provide me with this information?” “I simply, due to my senior’s death…” “Right. You have no reason to tell me who killed that senior, right?” Shik. At Seong Jihan’s question, the branch manager only smiled without answering. “Then, shall we proceed with the loan now? Target-nim.” “No, I’ll be leaving after eating well.” “Please visit again next time. I’ll prepare an even better gift then.” “You’re planning to put bugs in me again?” Swish. As Seong Jihan said that and got up- “Bugs? No, that’s just a means for us to get closer, Target-nim.” “I’ll pass.” Flash! Seong Jihan immediately logged out. “He really cleanly erased it…” The branch manager exclaimed, looking at the green energy Seong Jihan expelled from his body. The ‘World Tree’s Domination’ that even constellations succumbed to. It was completed through the combination of fruit and tea. But the lowest-tier species secretly embedded the energy and spat it out refined. As expected of someone worthy of being called a target. “With this, it seems we can expect more, as the higher-ups intended.” Seeing Seong Jihan who didn’t fall under the World Tree’s domination and cleanly spat out the energy- The smile under the branch manager’s mask only deepened. Text 291: [Connecting to the BattleNet Community.] [UI automatically customized for the user.] Ding. As the message disappeared, a screen popped up in front of Seong Jihan. ‘It looks similar to internet forums.’ Saying it was customized for the user, the forum took on a form familiar to Seong Jihan. [Currently accessible forum is the General Member Forum.] Seong Jihan entered. -NO.339 Reasons to recommend betting on the Crimson Wing Dragonkin (1) -BattleNet should reduce fees for betting sites! -Don’t bet on these bastards. TOP 5 species that took my GP -Best reverse betting this week? ‘It’s all about betting.’ He entered hoping to find some helpful information. But the new member forum was filled with nothing but betting-related posts. Clicking on posts, it was all about which species to bet on. Seong Jihan was about to close the useless forum that was no different from a gambling site. But he spotted a post title that seemed to share his thoughts. -New to the community. Why is it all about betting here? I was excited to unlock the community feature after reaching Silver League, but it’s a letdown. Scrolling through pages, it’s all betting posts; and it costs 100 million GP just to post once? └ General forum’s always like this └ Without the 100M GP limit, it’d be flooded with ads └ Have to go to the official member forum only accessible to Constellation Candidates and above for decent content └ Even that’s useless. Over half the info there is fake… └ Still better than here. They’re all somewhat verified players there. Clicking the post, the replies unanimously criticized the general forum. Seong Jihan scrolled through more pages of the forum. As the previous post said, it was filled with nothing but betting-related content. ‘Nothing useful here. I’ll have to become a Constellation Candidate and access the official forum.’ Seong Jihan was about to close the community feature, but spotted a magnifying glass button at the top of the forum. Before closing, let’s try a search. [Use search function?] [100,000 GP will be consumed.] ‘They charge for searching too.’ Charging GP just to use the forums. Thinking BattleNet was vicious, Seong Jihan still activated the search function. ‘My identity is hidden due to membership rights, so my name won’t appear.’ Seong Jihan pondered what to search for, then searched for NO.4212 Humanity. Unlike other posts, only one result came up. -Most notable Bronze League candidate this year. New leagues are always filled with variables causing unexpected outcomes, and this is where big hits often emerge. Especially the Bronze League with only newbies has wildly fluctuating odds. Among the newly opened Bronze Leagues this time, there’s one with 5 World Tree Elf teams. Many players thought this wasn’t even worth analyzing… Surprisingly, the lowest tier species NO.4212 Humanity is making strides and attracting expert attention. Once betting on newbie leagues opens, this league and Humanity are worth watching. Personally, I think NO.4212 will cause an upset. I’m going to bet big on them. └ Lots of big hits come from newbie leagues └ But isn’t that only when World Tree Elves aren’t there? There’s 5 teams there… In the end, won’t elves take 1st-5th? └ But those World Tree Elf bastards are still like that in Bronze? └ Still? Seems they’ll be like that forever. └ Why doesn’t BattleNet penalize them? We suffered a lot losing to World Tree Elves too. └ Our Constellation-nim reported them every time but BattleNet only says they received the report. └ The admin is in cahoots with World Tree Union. BattleNet and those bastards are all in it together Player reactions starting with Humanity and ending with denouncing World Tree Elves. They were lucky to get promoted since their leagues only had 1 or 2 World Tree Elf teams. In the Bronze League Humanity belonged to, many evaluated that promotion would be impossible due to the World Tree Elves. └ Should I still bet on the safe asset World Tree Union? └ World Tree Union themselves bet big, so the odds are almost nothing. └ Even 1-2% is important to take. Still, even the players denouncing World Tree Elves, when asked where they’ll bet, most raised their hands for World Tree Elves. No matter how much of a variable the Humanity species became, in the end they believed the vicious World Tree Elves would win. ‘When species betting opens, I should consider betting on Humanity.’ Seong Jihan thought the opposite of player sentiment and was about to close the forum. As he pressed the X button, [For GP loans, go to World Tree Union! Entrust an SSS-grade Gift Player and the interest rate will be greatly reduced!] Before the forum closed, an ad popped up. ‘These bastards… They even do loans?’ Even loan sharking, World Tree Union really did it all. And why entrust an SSS-grade Gift Player? Seong Jihan tried to close the disgusting ad with a repulsed expression. [Would you like to receive just one consultation?] [Worried because of our reputation? Don’t worry! Only avatars are summoned!] Pressing X didn’t make the message go away. “Ah, are they crazy.” “…Uncle? What are you looking at?” “Ah sorry. I’m trying to close the community but ads keep popping up.” “Yeah? BattleNet isn’t much different from us.” “No, it’s more vicious than human sites.” The loan ad that wouldn’t close even after pressing “No” 9 times. Seong Jihan frowned and habitually moved his finger to No again. [Thank you for agreeing to the consultation!] “…What?” A message suddenly appeared saying he agreed to the consultation. Looking at what happened, the Yes and No buttons of the summoning message were swapped. ‘What the hell…’ As Seong Jihan was dumbfounded, [Agreed to summoning.] [Avatar is being summoned to ‘Loan Counter’.] Flash! Light burst out and the world turned inside out. * World Tree Union’s Loan Counter. Outwardly, it was a peaceful forest space with lush greenery. However. Flash! Those summoned inside were all beings too powerful to match the forest. “Ah, these crazy bastards!!” The giant crocodile-headed monster spat out curses and kicked a tree. Crash! Part of the forest shattered in one blow. “Hey, what’s wrong. Calm down.” “Calm? Do I look calm? These crazy bastards, how many times did they send that message?” “You must be new. You don’t know the 9 right 1 left rule.” “…What’s that?” “If you found and pressed the 10th No that was swapped to the left, you wouldn’t have been summoned.” “Ha, so you’re saying, these damn bastards tricked me?!” Thump thump. The crocodile-head’s anger seemed to rise hearing the other players’ words, causing another rampage. ‘That croc must be someone summoned like me.’ Seong Jihan was also furious when first summoned to the Loan Counter. But seeing the crocodile-head vent anger on his behalf with a rampage, he felt a bit relieved. No need to join and draw attention here. Then, A giant lying on the grass casually advised the crocodile-head. “You better stop, If you break the wrong tree, World Tree Union will demand compensation.” “Compensation? They forcefully bring me and demand compensation?” “The world’s like that, what can you do. You’ll be dying to come here later, so no need to make a bad impression.” “…Why would anyone want to come here?” “The fruits are delicious.” The crocodile monster looked at the giant with dumbfounded eyes. Come to this damn place because the fruits are delicious? \\"Are you, a dog of World Tree Union? Talking nonsense “I wish I was their dog. Then I could keep eating the fruits.” “Ha.” As the crocodile-head turned to the giant and tried to break another tree, Tap. Tap. “Welcome. Dear customer.” Behind the crocodile monster, an elf wearing a half-mask appeared without a sound. ‘That. The mask of the ancient elf from before…’ The man was wearing a mask similar to the ancient elf that mutually perished with Brahma. But besides the mask, his appearance was very different. Compared to the stiff impression of the previous ancient elf, this male elf continuously smiled. “You bastard…! Are you in charge? Summoning me here with that ad… Send me back right now!” As the crocodile-head shouted angrily, the elf deeply bowed his head. “I apologize. I also agree that such an ad method is too malicious. But as a low-level employee, I must follow the decisions from above… Please understand just this once.” “Understand? Forget it, send me back to the original world now!” “Are you sure you don’t want a consultation? Just receiving a consultation will grant you many free gifts.” “Free gifts my ass. You scammers. Not sending me back now?” The crocodile-head didn’t fall for the free gifts. The half-masked elf smiled at those words and snapped his fingers. “I understand. Then please leave.” Snap! The crocodile-head’s body instantly disappeared. ‘For summoning with that ad method, they let him go without hesitation.’ Seong Jihan saw that and considered leaving too. “Tsk tsk. Poor guy.” “Coming all the way here, should’ve at least gotten the free gifts once.” “Guess the general member forum doesn’t have much about the gifts?” “That place only talks about betting.” Hearing the other players chatting with each other, he became curious about what these ‘free gifts’ were. Each one of them seemed highly skilled at a glance. It was peculiar that they, who could reign supreme in their own worlds, were hung up on free gifts. ‘Let’s see what the free gifts are.’ Seong Jihan fully suppressed his initial anger from being summoned. With calm eyes, he observed the situation unfold. “Now then, since many have come, let’s proceed with the loan consultation. But first, let’s have an appetizer.” Clap! Clap! As the male elf clapped, elves that looked exactly the same gradually appeared from the forest. Holding giant glowing green grapes on large trays. “Oh. It’s here!” “Grapes today!” “Will the stats increase this time?” “How many times have you eaten them?” “This will be the 7th.” The giant got up at the sight of the fruits. A huge bird descended from the sky. A three-headed snake wriggled out from the ground. All top-tier players drooling at the sight of grapes, eager to eat them. ‘Eating that raises stats…’ As Seong Jihan heard that and quietly waited, “Dear customer.” An elf approached Seong Jihan with a smile and presented a tray holding giant grapes. “Please eat first, then proceed with the loan consultation with us.” “Is this the free gift?” “No. The free gifts are separate.” “Hmm.” For the annoying ad, this isn’t bad. Seong Jihan plucked a grape the size of his head. Then, the grape shrank to a size that fit him. ‘Doesn’t seem poisoned.’ Seong Jihan popped the grape into his mouth. Then, as the giant said, no, an even more heavenly taste spread as the grape melted in his mouth. ‘Delicious. There was a reason to wait for the fruits.’ It tasted good, but there were no signs of stats increasing. Seong Jihan, without lowering his guard, kept putting grapes in his mouth. After finishing all the grapes on the tray he was given, ‘Hoo…’ The life energy stored in his body slightly increased. Although the amount was minuscule, it rose just from eating fruits like this. ‘If there are no issues, I should come often.’ Feeling positively about the Loan Counter for the first time, “You finished eating. Shall we start the consultation now?” The elf holding the tray next to him asked with a smile. Yeah. Since I’m here, let’s get the free gifts too. As Seong Jihan was about to nod, “Ah. Wait a moment.” The masked elf approached him with a smile. “I will handle this customer.” Next, here is the current text to translate: <2레벨로 회귀한 무신 293화> 3일 후, 세계수 연합의 대출창구. “안녕.” “……또 오셨습니까.” 성지한은 저번처럼 게시판의 팝업 광고를 누르며, 3일 연속 대출창구에 출퇴근을 하고 있었다. 성지한이 손을 흔드는 걸 보자, 대출창구의 엘프가 질린 표정으로 그를 맞이했다. “본부장님께서 다음에 또 놀러 오시라고 말씀은 하셨다지만…… 이렇게 자주 오실 줄은 몰랐군요.” “아직 게임 시작을 안 해서. 과일 먹으러 왔어.” 5월 말에 열렸던 승급전을 통해 마스터 리그로 올라간 성지한. 6월이 되기까지는, 마스터 리그에 올랐다고 한들 게임 실행을 하지 못했으니, 성지한은 이 공백 기간 동안, 대출창구에 빠짐없이 들렸다. ‘생명의 기운이 상당히 늘었단 말이지.’ 비록 상태창에 스탯으로 포함되지는 않았지만. 성지한의 체내에 세계수 연합이 지닌 생명의 기운은 분명히 존재했다. 그리고 그 기운은, 여기 대출창구에서 상담할 때마다 대접해 주는 과일을 먹을 때마다 크게 늘었다. 하나. “죄송하지만, 본부장님께서 계속 자리를 비우고 계셔서 더 이상의 사은품을 드리는 것은 불가능합니다.” 본부장의 부하 직원인 엘프는, 성지한에게 딱딱한 어조로 더는 안 된다고 통보했다. “자주 오라는 건 그쪽이었는데. 3일 만에 사은품을 안 주나? 세계수 엘프의 배포가 생각보다 좁군그래.” “인적 사항도 적지 않은 플레이어에게 연속으로 사은품을 드리는 것 자체가 권한 밖의 행위입니다. 혹시나 손님께서 인적사항을 적어 주신다면 모르겠습니다만.” “그건 됐고.” 과일바구니가 생명의 기운을 많이 올려 줬다곤 하지만, 그렇다고 세계수 연합에게 인적 사항을 공개할 수는 없는 노릇. 성지한이 그 제안을 거절하자, 엘프는 그럴 줄 알았다는 듯 고개를 끄덕였다. “그렇다면, 사은품 지급은 본부장님께서 돌아오시기 전까지는 불가능합니다.” “언제 오는데?” “대출창구는 이곳만 운영되는 것이 아닙니다. 본부장님께서 맡으신 구역은 수십 곳이 넘기 때문에, 언제 돌아오실지는 저도 모릅니다.” 엘프의 말이 사실이면, 저번에 만난 거 자체가 우연의 일치였던 건가. ‘어쩔 수 없군.’ 편하게 생명의 기운을 좀 올리나 싶더니. 역시나 꼼수로 계속 성장하는 건 불가능한가. “저놈…… 인적사항도 안 적고 사은품을 받아 왔어?” “세계수의 과육을 그냥 받아먹다니. 뭐 하는 놈이야?” “허. 우리한텐 한 달 이자로 100억 GP 이상 낼 때만 랜덤으로 주면서……!” “나도 한 번 더 줘라!” 한편. 대출창구에서 대기하고 있던 플레이어들은, 성지한과 엘프의 대화를 듣더니 불만을 토해 냈다. 처음 대출 상담받을 때 사은품으로 주고. 그다음부터는 이자로 한 달에 100억 GP 이상 내야지 어쩌다 랜덤으로 주는 세계수의 과육. 돈 내고 사 먹고 싶어도, 세계수 연합은 이걸 절대로 팔지 않았기에. 몇몇 플레이어들은 GP가 충분함에도 불구하고 세계수의 과육을 먹기 위해 일부러 대출을 유지하곤 했다. 한데 저 쪼그만 종족은 벌써 몇 번이고 공짜로 과육을 먹은 거야? “보다시피, 기존 고객분들의 불만도 심한 상황입니다. 이런 상황이라 본부장님의 허락 없이는 더 이상의 사은품 지급이 불가능합니다.” 성지한은 흉흉한 눈으로 자신을 바라보는 플레이어들을 바라보았다. 거대 종족들이 과육 하나에 눈이 돌아가서, 일제히 자신을 노려보는 상황. ‘과육과 차에 섞여 있던 기운에 물들면, 저렇게들 변하나 보군.’ 다들 겉으로만 보면 상당한 강자. 저 정도면 어떤 종족 출신이든, 자신의 세계에서 한 가닥 하는 플레이어들인데. 세계수 과육 배분 가지고, 격에 맞지 않게 눈이 시뻘게진 채 흥분하며 과몰입하고 있었다. 기운의 지배를 받아, 과육에 중독이 된 건가. “그래요. 수고들 하시죠.” 성지한은 피식 웃으며 한마디를 해 주곤, 로그아웃했다. 번쩍! ‘6월 1일이 거의 다 됐군. 확실히 거긴, 시간의 흐름이 이상해.’ 대출창구 공간에서의 시간의 흐름은 묘해서. 어떤 때는 지구에서보다 빠르고, 또 어떤 때는 지구에서보다 느렸다. 지금은 5월 31일 오후 11시 반으로, 30분 정도의 여유가 남은 상황. ‘얼굴이나 비춰야겠군.’ 성지한은 방 밖을 나섰다. 그러자. “오. 왔나, 처남.” 짐을 잔뜩 싼 채, 캐리어를 끌고 있는 윤세진을 마주할 수 있었다. “매형, 어디 가십니까?” “아, 성좌 퀘스트를 받았네. 당분간 국내를 돌며 성좌께서 말씀하신 물건을 탐색할 것 같아. 그동안 세아를 부탁하네.” “국내에요?” “응.” 성지한은 고개를 갸웃했다. 윤세진의 성좌는, ‘태초의 왕’ 길가메시. 그가 왜 한반도를 탐색하라고 시켰는지, 잘 이해가 가지는 않았다. “찾는 게 대략 어떤 물건입니까?” “나도 자세히는 모르겠어. 메시지창에서 유물이라고만 말씀하셔서…….” 한반도의 유물인가. 길가메시, 무슨 꿍꿍인지 모르겠군. 성지한은 다급해 보이는 윤세진을 보며, 일단은 고개를 끄덕였다. “알겠습니다. 다녀오세요, 매형.” “고맙네.” “아빠, 잘 다녀와~” “응, 세아야. 삼촌 말 잘 듣고 있어.” “삼촌이 집에 있어야 말을 듣죠.” 드르르륵. 성지한과 윤세아에게 손을 흔든 윤세진은, 얼른 발걸음을 재촉해 현관 쪽으로 사라졌다. 야밤중에, 뭐 저렇게 급한 거야. “날 밝을 때 가시지.” “그러게. 밤 운전 위험한데. 뭐, 아빠라면 차 사고 나도 끄떡없겠지만…….” “음…… 누나 문제 외로 저렇게 서두르시는 모습은 처음 보네.” “최근 태초의 왕에게 후원받는 사람이 점점 늘어나서 그런 건가?” “그래?” “응, 벌써 수백 명이 인증했어.” “……수백 명이나?” “응. 그것도 다 탑플레이어 위주로. 요즘은 태초의 왕에게 후원 제안 못 받으면 가능성 없는 플레이어 아니냔 이야기도 나와.” 무신이 사라지고, 대신 등장한 길가메시. 그는 상당히 공격적으로 성좌 후원을 하고 있었다. 저번 생에서는 길가메시가 깨어난 적이 없었는지, 일어나지 않았던 현상. ‘그가 매형한테 강림하면 물어볼 것이 있었는데 아쉽게 되었군.’ 공허에게는 배신자로 찍힌 길가메시. 그리고, 세계수 연합 쪽에서는 오래전, 자신들에 의해 특급 에러가 지구에서 발생했다고 알려 주었다. 공허와 협력해서 에러는 처리했지만, 데이터는 회수하지 못했다는 기록만 남긴 채. 성지한은 이 일이 길가메시와 무언가 연관이 있을 거라고 추측했다. ‘내 주적은 결국 무신. 그는 아직 적인지 아군인지 확실치 않아. 정보를 더 모으기 전에는 아직 적대시할 필요는 없겠지.’ 방랑하는 무신과는 결국 무혼을 두고 싸워야 하는 운명이지만. 길가메시는 아직 확실히 뭐라고 규명하기에는 애매했다. 그 자체는 무슨 꿍꿍이인지 몰라도 성지한에게 호의적이었으니까. 물론 공허 측의 말대로, 인류가 초대장을 받는 원인이 길가메시라면. 언젠가는 그 ‘원인’을 제거해야겠지만……. ‘지금은 시기상조다.’ 현 상황에서 그를 적대시할 수는 없었다. 길가메시가 성지한에게 보이는 호의 속에, 무슨 속셈이 들어 있든. 지금 성지한으로서는 일단 이걸 받아야 했다. ‘아직도 성장이 부족하군.’ 인류 랭킹 1위에, 최초로 마스터 리그에 들어서고. 스페이스 아레나의 루키로 선정되기까지 한 성지한이었지만. 그럼에도 아직 그가 대적할 적은 강력하기 짝이 없었다. 이제 승급해서 레벨 제한도 풀렸으니, 다시 레벨 업을 달려야겠다고 생각한 성지한은. “오, 삼촌. 12시 됐다.” “좋아, 간다.” 윤세아가 시간을 알려 주자마자, 바로 게임에 접속했다. * * [마스터 리그, 스페이스-4 에어리어에 배정됩니다.] [스페이스-4 에어리어의 상위 1퍼센트 플레이어입니다.] [특수 미션을 통해, 스페이스-3 에어리어로 올라갈 수 있습니다.] [특수 미션에 도전하시겠습니까?] 스페이스-4 에어리어. 평가기준 상위 0.001퍼센트의 플레이어만 들어갈 수 있는 이 구역도, 성지한에겐 장애물이 되지 못했다. 매 게임 1등을 하면서, 에어리어를 평정한 그에게. 배틀넷은 마스터 리그에 올라온 김에 한 등급 더 높은 곳으로 가라고 제안하고 있었다. ‘이건 해야겠군.’ 에어리어가 올라가면 기본적으로 주어지는 경험치도 많으니. 성장이 시급한 성지한에겐, 안 받을 수 없는 조건이었다. 그가 예를 누르자. [플레이어가 스페셜 디펜스 맵, ‘북벽’에 배정됩니다.] 그에게 스페셜 맵 ‘북벽’이 배정되었다. [거대한 벽 너머, 미지의 존재가 침공해 옵니다.] [10일간의 전투에서, 방어 실적 상위 50퍼센트에 올라서세요.] 스페셜 맵치고는 디펜스 맵 본연에 맞게 방어하는 것 같은 북벽 맵. 하지만 실적 상위 50퍼센트라는 걸 보니 분명 다른 플레이어랑 경쟁하는 종류일 테고. ‘일반 맵도 서로 충돌하는 경우가 잦은데, 스페셜 맵인 이상 더 그걸 장려하겠지.’ 디펜스해야 할 건, 미지의 존재뿐만이 아니라 같은 플레이어들일지도 모른다. 성지한이 자세한 맵 설명을 보려고 할 때. [길드를 소유한 플레이어입니다.] [길드 미션으로 도전이 가능합니다.] [길드 미션으로 ‘북벽’을 도전하시겠습니까?] [길드 미션으로 도전 시 길드에 보상이 추가되며, 소속 길드원 전체에게 추가 보상이 주어집니다.] 추가적으로 선택할 수 있는 옵션이 튀어나왔다. ‘길드 미션이라.’ 성지한의 대기 길드. 몇몇 길드원을 제외하곤, 세계 랭커들이 성장을 위해 임대 와 있는 육성 길드였다. 이들과 성지한은 어디까지나 거래 관계니, 굳이 길드 미션을 해서 이들에게 보상을 안겨 줄 의리는 없었지만. ‘길드 자체 보너스도 있고, 랭커들 수준이 아직 많이 뒤처져 있으니…… 이걸 보완하는 의미에서는 할 만하겠군.’ 성지한이 없자, 조인족에게도 패배했던 인류 플레이어. 그에게 인류 랭커의 수준은 또 하나의 숙제였다. 이렇게 길드 미션으로 끌어 주면, 그나마 좀 낫겠지. ‘개인 미션보다 길드 미션이 난이도는 훨씬 높겠지만…….’ 성지한의 대기 길드는 성장만을 위해 모인, 제대로 합도 맞춰 보지 않은 플레이어들. 다른 세계의 길드에 비하면, 실력적으로 훨씬 뒤처질 게 분명했다. 어쩌면 상위 50퍼센트에 들기 힘들 수도 있겠지. 하지만, 성지한은 길드 보상을 위해 이를 감수하기로 했다. ‘그래도 이 보상, 길드원에게 공짜로 줄 수는 없다.’ 길드원 보상으로 뭐가 주어질지는 모르지만, 에어리어 3으로 올라가면서 주는 것이니만큼 좋은 게 나오겠지. 요즘 GP의 사용처가 늘어난 성지한은, 이번 기회에 GP를 더 끌어모으기로 했다. “하연 씨 자려나?” “지금 안 잘걸? 조금 전에 우리 집에서 운동하다 갔거든. 언니 아마 삼촌 마스터 리그 경기 기다리고 있을 거야. 근데 왜?” “길드 미션이 나왔는데, 이야기할 게 있어서.” “길드 미션…… 그런 것도 있어?” 윤세아는 흥미롭다는 듯 눈을 반짝였다. “이번에 받았어. 에어리어 3으로 올라가는 미션으로.” “아니 삼촌 벌써 스페이스 3으로 또 올라가? 아, 하긴…… 스페이스 4도 휩쓸어 버렸으니.” 혼자 물어보고 혼자 납득하는 윤세아. “그리고 길드 미션 보상으로 길드원에게도 주어지는 게 있는데. 이걸 그냥 주긴 아쉽지.” “물론이지! 삼촌이 진행하는 미션의 보상을 받을 수 있다면, 다들 GP를 얼마든지 내려고 할걸?” “그래. 가격 상담 좀 해야겠다.” 성지한은 바로 핸드폰을 들었다. [아, 오너님. 이 시간에 무슨 일이세요? 아…… 길드 미션? 정말요? 저 바로 올라가 볼게요!] 그렇게 밤늦게 모인, 대기 길드의 수뇌부. “정확한 보상 내용은 안 나왔지만, 오너님 미션의 보상이니 상당하겠죠. GP를 아주 비싸게 측정해도 되겠어요. 일단 미니멈으로 이 가격을…….” “……너무 비싼 거 아닙니까?” “아니에요. 오너님 미션의 보상인데. 이 정도면 싼 편이죠. 여기에 보상에 따른 추가 GP 지불 옵션까지 넣으면…….” 새벽까지 토의해서 가격을 정하고, 세계의 각 길드에게 이를 통보하자. 다음 날 아침. 세계 각지의 뉴스 1면은, 성지한이 받은 길드 미션 내용이 장식했다.

Upon seeing Seong Jihan wave his hand, the elf at the loan counter greeted him with a weary expression. \\"The branch manager did say you could come visit again, but… I never expected your visits to be this frequent.\\" \\"I haven’t started playing the game yet. Came here for the fruit.\\" Seong Jihan, who had ascended to the Master League through the promotion match held at the end of May. Until June arrived, he couldn’t play the game due to having risen in rank. Thus, during this interim period, Seong Jihan made sure to visit the loan counter every day. 'The energy of life within me has significantly increased.' Although it wasn't included in the stats on his status screen. The energy of life from the World Tree Union definitely existed within Seong Jihan. And this energy significantly grew every time he ate the fruit given during consultations at the loan counter. However, “I'm sorry, but the branch manager has been away, and so it's impossible to provide any more complimentary gifts.\\" The elf, a subordinate of the branch manager, informed Seong Jihan with a stiff tone that further gifts were not possible. \\"You're the ones who told me to come often. So, you've stopped giving out complimentary gifts after just 3 days? Seems the generosity of World Tree elves is more limited than I thought.\\" “Granting complimentary gifts to a player who has not provided personal information, especially on a continuous basis, is beyond our authority. Unless, of course, you’re willing to provide your personal information.” \\"That's fine, then.\\" As much as the fruit basket had significantly increased his life energy, Seong Jihan could not disclose his personal information to the World Tree Union. Rejecting the offer, the elf seemed to have expected it, nodding in understanding. \\"In that case, any further distribution of complimentary gifts will not be possible until the branch manager returns.\\" \\"When will that be?\\" \\"The loan counter isn't operated from just this location. The branch manager oversees dozens of areas, so I cannot say when he will return.\\" If what the elf said was true, then it was a coincidence that he met him last time. 'Can't help it then.' Just when he thought he could comfortably increase his life energy. Seems like continually growing through such means was indeed impossible. \\"That guy... Did he get the complimentary gifts without even registering his personal information?\\" \\"To just receive the pulp of the World Tree like that. What is he doing?\\" \\"Huh. We had to pay interest of over 10 billion GP a month just for a chance to randomly receive it...!\\" \\"I want another one too!\\" Meanwhile, Players waiting at the loan counter, having heard the conversation between Seong Jihan and the elf, began to express their dissatisfaction. The pulp of the World Tree was provided as a complimentary gift only during the first consultation. From then on, you had to pay over 10 billion GP a month in interest for a chance to randomly receive it. Even though some players had enough GP and wanted to buy it, the World Tree Union would never sell. And yet, how many times had that diminutive species received it for free? \\"As you can see, the dissatisfaction among our existing customers is quite severe. Under these circumstances, another distribution of complimentary gifts without the branch manager’s approval is impossible.\\" Seong Jihan saw the players glaring menacingly at him. Players of tremendous races, all eyes turned red over a piece of fruit, united in their agitation. 'It seems they change like that once tainted by the energy mixed in the fruit and tea.' On the surface, they all looked like formidable challengers. Players capable of ruling their own species should not be so disproportionately obsessed over the distribution of World Tree fruits. Were they addicted to the fruit due to being under the influence of its energy? \\"Well then, take care.\\" Seong Jihan smirked lightly, offering them a word before he logged out. Flash! 'June 1st is almost here. Time surely flows strangely there.' The flow of time in the space of the loan counter was peculiar. Sometimes it was faster than on Earth, and other times slower. Now it was the night of May 31st, with about half an hour to spare. 'I should show my face around.' Seong Jihan stepped out of the room. And there, \\"Oh. You came, brother-in-law.\\" He encountered Yoon Sejin, packed with loads of luggage and pulling a suitcase. \\"Where are you going?\\" \\"Ah, I received a Star Seat Quest. For a while, I'll be touring domestically to search for the objects mentioned by the Star Seat. During this time, I entrust Se-ah to you.\\" \\"Domestically?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Seong Jihan looked puzzled. Yoon Sejin’s Star Seat was 'The King at the Beginning' Gilgamesh. It wasn’t clear why he was asked to explore the Korean Peninsula. \\"What is the object you're searching for?\\" \\"I'm not sure myself. The message only mentioned relics.\\" A relic of the Korean Peninsula. Gilgamesh, what could he be planning? Seeing Yoon Sejin appearing rushed, Seong Jihan just nodded for now. \\"Understood. Take care on your journey.\\" \\"Thanks.\\" \\"Bye, Dad. Safe travels~\\" \\"Yep, Se-ah. Listen to your uncle while I'm gone.\\" \\"If Uncle stays at home, sure.\\" Roll, roll... After waving to Seong Jihan and Yoon Se-ah, Yoon Sejin hurriedly disappeared towards the entrance. In the middle of the night, why so hurried? \\"He could've left at dawn.\\" \\"Exactly. Night driving's dangerous. Well, if it's Dad, he should be fine even if there's a car accident...\\" \\"Hmm... Other than my sister’s issue, it’s the first time I've seen him in such a hurry.\\" \\"Could it be because the number of people sponsored by 'The King at the Beginning' is increasing?\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah, already hundreds have verified it.\\" \\"...Hundreds?\\" \\"Yeah. And it's mostly top players. Nowadays, there's talk that any player not sponsored by 'The King at the Beginning' is considered without potential.\\" With the Martial God gone and Gilgamesh taking his place, he was aggressively sponsoring Star Seats. A phenomenon that didn't occur in his previous life when Gilgamesh hadn't awakened. 'I wish I asked him when he manifested in my brother-in-law. That's unfortunate.' Gilgamesh, marked as a traitor by the Void. And then, the World Tree Union disclosed that a long time ago, a ‘critical error’ occurred on Earth through their actions. They collaborated with the Void to address the error, but were unable to recover any data, leaving only records behind. Seong Jihan speculated there might be a connection with Gilgamesh. 'My ultimate enemy remains the Martial God. Unsure if he's friend or foe for now. It's premature to become adversarial without gathering more information.' Despite the inevitable showdown over the Soul of the Martial God, Gilgamesh’s intentions were not clear enough yet. Regardless of his motives, Gilgamesh seemed friendly towards Seong Jihan. Of course, if what the Void said was true – that humanity's summoning was caused by Gilgamesh, then at some point, he would need to deal with that ‘cause.’... 'Now is not the right time.' It was impossible to consider him a foe under the current circumstances. Whatever motives Gilgamesh might have, Seong Jihan had to accept his favor for now. 'I still need more growth.' Having become the top-ranked player among humanity and the first to enter the Master League, Even selected as a rookie in the Space Arena, Seong Jihan realized. Despite this, the opponents he had to face were exceedingly powerful. \\"Now that I've promoted and the level cap has been lifted, it’s time to accelerate my level-up.\\" \\"Oh, Uncle. It’s midnight.\\" \\"Alright, let’s go.\\" Upon Yoon Se-ah informing him of the time, Seong Jihan immediately logged into the game. * * [Allocated to the Space-4 Area of the Master League.] [You are among the top 1 percent of players in the Space-4 Area.] [Through a special mission, you can ascend to the Space-3 Area.] [Will you accept the special mission?] Space-4 Area. Even this zone, accessible only to the top 0.001 percent of players, couldn’t pose an obstacle for Seong Jihan. Claiming the top spot in every game and dominating the area, BattleNet was suggesting he move up to a higher level now that he had reached the Master League. 'I should take this.' With more experience points offered for advancing areas, It was a condition Seong Jihan, who was desperate for growth, couldn’t refuse. As he pressed yes, [Player has been assigned to the special defense map, ‘Northern Wall’.] He was allocated the special map ‘Northern Wall’. [Giant walls stand tall, behind which unknown entities invade.] [Survive 10 days of battle and rank in the top 50 percent in defense performance.] The Northern Wall map, true to its defense nature, seemed geared towards standing guard. However, the top 50 percent performance requirement hinted it would be competitive with other players. 'Normal maps often lead to clashes, but being a special map, this will likely encourage even more competition.' What needs defending might not only be unknown entities but other players as well. Just as Seong Jihan was about to review the map’s details further, [You own a guild.] [The mission can be attempted as a guild mission.] [Choosing a guild mission offers additional rewards to the guild, with all guild members receiving extra benefits.] An additional option popped up. 'A guild mission.' Seong Jihan’s standby guild. Aside from a few guild members, it was a development guild where world rankers came for growth, maintained in a business relationship with Seong Jihan. There was no moral obligation to choose the guild mission and bestow rewards upon them, 'Considering the guild’s own bonus and the fact that the rankers are still much behind... It seems worthwhile.' Without him, humanity even lost to the Zerg Tribe. For Seong Jihan, the level of humanity’s rankers was another issue to tackle. If bringing them along for the guild mission could slightly improve their situation, so be it. 'The guild mission will likely be much harder than individual missions...' Seong Jihan’s standby guild was gathered purely for growth, having never even aligned their formation. Compared to other world guilds, they were sure to be significantly behind. Maybe even making it difficult to rank in the top 50 percent. Nonetheless, Seong Jihan decided to take the risk for the sake of guild rewards. 'But, I can’t just give the rewards to the guild members for free.' Though unsure what the guild member rewards would be, being associated with ascending to Area 3 meant they would be valuable. Lately, having found more uses for GP, Seong Jihan decided to seize this opportunity to gather more. \\"Is Ha-yeon asleep?\\" \\"She won’t be now. She just left our house after exercising a bit. She’s probably waiting for Uncle’s Master League matches. But why?\\" \\"I got a guild mission. Need to discuss something.\\" \\"A guild mission? That's a thing?\\" Yoon Se-ah's eyes sparkled with curiosity. \\"Got it just now. It's for ascending to Area 3.\\" \\"Isn’t Uncle already moving up to Space 3 again? Ah, right… Since you’ve swept through Space 4 as well.\\" Yoon Se-ah asked and understood by herself. \\"And there’s something grantable to guild members as a reward for the mission. It feels like a waste just giving it away.\\" \\"Of course! If they can receive a reward from a mission you’re running, everyone will readily pay GP.\\" \\"That's right. Need to think about the pricing.\\" Seong Jihan immediately picked up his phone. [Oh, Owner. What brings you to call at this time? Ah… A guild mission? Really? I’ll come up right away!] Thus, late into the night, the leadership of the standby guild gathered. \\"Though the exact reward details haven’t been disclosed, given it's Owner’s mission, it’ll definitely be substantial. We can mark up the GP price significantly. Let’s start with this minimum...\\" \\"...Isn’t this too expensive?\\" \\"No, it’s Owner’s mission after all. This is quite cheap considering. Including an additional GP payment option based on the reward...\\" After discussing the pricing until dawn and notifying the guilds across the world, The next morning, The front pages of news outlets worldwide were adorned with the details of the guild mission Seong Jihan had received."},{"instruction":"Thank you, here is text 294, please translate it exactly as it is but also keep it natural and coveying the original meaning.

TOP 100이 모두 다 신청했어요.” 대기 길드의 길드 사무실. 이하연은 예상했다는 얼굴로, 담담하게 지원자들을 추렸다. “그런데 뒷순위 사람들이 GP를 두세 배 더 내서라도 들어오고 싶다고는 하던데…… 어떻게 할까요? 어떤 분은 10배도 부르던데.” “적당히 GP 경쟁시키다가, 랭킹 순으로 끊죠. 어차피 TOP 100도 그 정도 GP는 지불할 수 있지 않습니까?” 후순위 랭커들이 얼마를 낸다고 한들. TOP 100에 든 랭커들도, 그만한 대가를 지불할 만한 자산은 있었다. “네. 그럼 협상 기간은…….” “오늘 끝내죠. 굳이, 너무 오래 가격 협상할 필요는 없으니까요.” “알겠습니다. 그럼 오늘 저녁까지 더 협상을 진행하겠습니다.” 이하연은 의지를 불태우며, 실무를 진행할 협상팀을 이끌었다. 어차피 이번 플레이어 선발에 있어서, 슈퍼 갑은 대기 길드 측. “근데 우리 길드 직원 많이 늘었네.” “응. 워낙 일이 많잖아? 저번처럼 사고 나지 않기 위해서, 국정원에서 신변 확실한 사람만 데려왔대. 대우 수준도 길드 중에서 거의 최고라서, 모집 공고만 내면 사람들 몰린다는데.” “그래?” “……삼촌 너무 신경 안 쓰는 거 아니야?” “하연 씨가 알아서 잘하겠지.” 애초에 성장 보너스 타기 위해서 만들었던 대기 길드. 대기 길드의 핵심은 바로 이하연이 지닌 성장 기프트였다. 근데 그 이하연이 길드 업무까지 다 봐주니까. 성지한으로서는, 여기에 전혀 터치할 생각이 없었다. ‘길드 마스터를 이하연으로 선출하길 잘했어.’ 자신의 관여 없이도 잘 돌아가는 길드를 보며, 성지한은 만족스런 표정을 짓고 다시 집으로 돌아왔다. 그리고 그가 돌아오자마자 기다리고 있던 건. “오셨어요?” “소피아?” 거실에서 커피를 마시고 있는 소피아였다. “아, 소피아 왔네? 오늘도 트레이닝 룸 썼어?” “응. 고마워, 세아.” 이미 소피아가 있는 게 익숙한 듯, 성지한의 뒤에서 손을 흔드는 윤세아. “소피아도 하연 언니처럼, 우리 집 트레이닝 룸 쓰고 있어.” “그래? 그런 거 치곤 마주치질 않았네.” “지한이 집에 거의 없었으니까요.” 소피아는 입을 살짝 삐쭉였다가. 금방 표정을 바꾸었다. “지한~ 근데 저 정말 길드 미션 가도 되나요? 아직 랭킹 100위 안에 들지 못했는데.” “물론이죠.” “후후, 아메리칸 퍼스트 출신은 랭킹 100위에서 끊던데, 절 허락해 주셨다는 건…… 저도 ‘진짜’ 대기 길드 출신이 되는 건가요?” 아메리칸 퍼스트 출신으로, 임대 온 상태였던 소피아. 하나 성좌의 성화를 이어받는 것 때문에 한국에 온 그녀는, 대기 길드의 진짜 길드원이 되기 위해 여러모로 노력을 하고 있었다. 최근에는 자리에 거의 없는 성지한 대신. 윤세아와 이하연을 비롯해서, 대기 길드의 사람들에게 눈도장을 찍어 둔 상황이었다. 하지만 역시 가장 중요한 건 오너인 성지한의 의지. 그는 두 눈을 반짝이는 소피아를 보며, 쓴웃음을 지었다. “그렇게 들어오고 싶으십니까?” “네! 아메리칸 퍼스트에도 다 이야기해 뒀어요!” “뭐라고 했는데요?” “저 언제든지 나갈 수 있으니 월급 주지 말라구요.” “알겠습니다. 그럼 들어오시죠.” “오, 삼촌 웬일이야?” “뭐, 이제 와서 굳이 안 받을 필요가 있나 싶다.” 성지한의 말에 소피아는 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. “진짜요!?” “네.” “와! 드디어!” 그의 허락에 한참을 방방 뛰던 소피아는. “그렇게 좋습니까?” “당연하죠~ 헤헤.” 웃는 얼굴로 다시 자리에 앉아 커피잔에 입을 가져다 대었다. “오전만 해도 성좌께서 성화 전수가 늦어질 거라고 하셔서 아쉬웠는데. 오후에 이렇게 기쁜 일이 있을 줄이야. 너무 좋네요!” “성화 전수가요? 왜 전수가 늦는답니까?” “아, 성좌께서 당분간 대예언을 하신다고 해서요. 그러면서 말씀하신 게…….” 그녀는 말을 하다 말고, 윤세아 쪽을 힐끗 바라보았다. “아, 세아야. 성좌께서 지한에게만 알려 드리라고 해서…….” “응, 알았어.” 윤세아가 자기 방으로 들어가자. 소피아는 두 눈을 감고는, 손바닥을 펼쳤다. 화르르륵! 그러자 거기서 피어오르는, 백색의 불꽃. 예전에 소환했을 때보다 확실히 강렬해진 그 성화는, 곧 둥실둥실 떠오르더니 성지한을 향해 날아왔다. “성좌께서 말씀하셨어요. 세 번째 권능은, 이 성화와 밀접한 관련이 있을 것 같다구요.” “그래?” “네. 그러면서 종말구현…… 이것과 연관이 있지 않겠냐는 말씀도 덧붙이셨어요.” 종말구현. 성지한이 빙천검우를 소환하기 전까지, 피티아는 이를 스스로의 권능이라고 착각해 왔다. 한데 이것이 자신의 권능이 아니니까, 세 번째 불의 권능이라 보는 건가? ‘흠…… 종말구현은 확실히 아닌데.’ 성지한은 미간을 찌푸렸다. 이름을 잊어버린, 세 번째 멸신결. 하나 종말구현 같은 거창한 것은 아니었던 걸로 기억했다. 그것보다는, 아니 어떻게 이런 게 멸신결이지? 라는 느낌이 강했는데……. ‘예전에는 분명 알고 있었는데…… 적어 둘 걸 그랬군.’ 성지한은 그리 생각하며, 눈앞의 성화를 바라보았다. 적赤의 능력을 얻고 나서는, 처음 보는 성화. “이거 흡수해도 됩니까?” “물론이죠~” 성지한은 성화에 손을 뻗었다. 그러자, 금세 사그라들며 성지한의 몸속으로 들어오는 성화. 그것은 적의 문양으로 바로 빨려 들어오더니, 깔끔하게 흡수되었다. ‘호오.’ 스탯 적을 얻어서 그런가. 성지한은 흡수한 성화의 본질에 대해, 어느 정도 이해할 수 있었다. ‘불과 물의 속성이 섞였군.’ 서로를 제약하여, 애초에 섞일 수가 없는 두 속성. 하나 성화는 특이하게도 내부에 물의 속성을 은밀히 숨겨 두고 있었다. 이건 적의 능력을 지닌 성지한으로서도, 어떻게 구현해야 할지 감이 안 오는 현상. 파스스……. 성지한이 본격적으로 관측하려고 할 때, 불이 꺼지자. “한 번 더 가능할까요?” “성화요? 당연하죠!” 그는 소피아에게 성화를 일으켜달라고 부탁했다. 그렇게 몇 차례나 흡수하면서 분석을 해 보았지만. ‘아직은 모르겠군.’ 성지한은 결국 성화가 어떻게 이런 힘을 내는지에 대해서는 파악할 수가 없었다. 그가 그렇게 곰곰이 이에 대해 생각하고 있을 때. “또, 또 할게…… 요!” 소피아는 조금 전에 비해 훨씬 창백해진 얼굴로, 식은땀을 뻘뻘 흘리며 애써 성화를 피워 올리려 들었다. 이러다 사람 잡겠군. “아니, 다음에 하죠. 제 수준이 낮아서 다 파악이 안 되네요.” “후, 후우…… 네.” 성지한의 말에 안도의 한숨을 푹 쉬고는 자리에 털썩 주저앉는 소피아. 그녀는 거친 숨을 몰아쉬더니, 문득 생각난 듯 성지한에게 말했다. “아, 맞다. 성좌께서 방해가 있어서 메시지를 보내지 못할 것 같다고, 당분간은 저를 통해서 말씀을 전하겠다고 하셨어요.” “방해를 해요? 누가 성좌를?” “그건 저한테도 자세히 말씀 안 해 주셔서 모르겠지만요…… 자신의 메시지를 전할 땐, 꼭 주변에 누가 있나 확인하라고 하셨어요.” “그래서 세아도 물러나라 한 거군요.” “네, 특히 성좌 있는 플레이어를 조심하라고 하셔서…….” 성좌 있는 플레이어라. ‘혹시 길가메시에게 방해받나?’ 성지한은 최근 수많은 플레이어의 후원 성좌가 된 길가메시를 떠올리며, 그리 생각했다. ‘한데 길가메시나 피티아나, 같은 무신의 종인데 누가 누굴 방해하는 게 가능한 일인가.’ 아무리 길가메시가 종 가운데서도 특수한 위치에 있다지만, 그런 것까지 가능한가. 길가메시 외에 또 다른 존재의 개입도 생각해 보았지만, 무언갈 추측하기엔 너무 정보가 적었다. ‘나중에 직접 물어봐야겠군.’ 피티아와 다시 직접 메시지를 주고받기 전까지는, 소피아의 중개를 받아야겠다고 생각하면서. “그럼 지한. 이번 기회에 아예 귀화까지 할까요?!” “그건 조금 더 생각해 보죠.” 금방 기운을 차리고, 귀화까지 추진하려는 그녀를 말렸다. * * * [스페셜 디펜스 맵, ‘북벽’에 ‘대기 길드’가 배정됩니다.] [거대한 벽 너머, 미지의 존재의 침공을 막아서세요.] [10라운드까지 종족 보정을 받습니다.] 번쩍! 게임이 시작되자, 맵에 소환되는 대기 길드의 플레이어들. 세계 랭킹 TOP 100 플레이어가 대부분인 이들은, 지구 최강의 정예였다. 그래도 처음엔 성지한이 받은 길드 미션이라 잔뜩 긴장했던 이들은. “이게…… 북벽?” “거대한 벽이라기에는, 너무 볼품없는데.” “사우스게이트 맵 성벽 정돈데. 이 정도면.” 막상 소환된 북벽의 규모를 보고는 의아함을 품었다. 북쪽을 바라보며, 쭉 펼쳐진 새하얀 성벽. 벽을 기점으로 남쪽은 해가 비추는 양지였고. 북쪽은 어두컴컴한 음지였다. 극명하게 대비되는 명암. 그때. “어, 저기…… 뭔가가 있습니다!” 어두운 대지 속에서, 무언가가 꿈틀거렸다. 거기서 하나둘씩 모습을 드러내는 건, 푸른빛이 감도는 거대한 지렁이 무리. “으, 처음부터 벌레냐…….” “엄청 빠르네. 벌써 성벽 밑까지 오고 있어.” “그래도 그리 강해 보이진 않는데?” “성지한 님, 어떻게 할까요?” 성지한은 랭커들의 물음에, 암검 이클립스를 꺼내 들었다. 혼원신공混元神功 삼재무극三才武極 횡소천군橫掃千軍 촤아아악! 일검에 성벽 밑에서 갈라지는 지렁이 무리. ‘약하군.’ 검에 전혀 걸리는 맛이 없는 게, 쉬운 상대로 보였다. “그리 강한 것 같진 않습니다. 여러분들께서 한번 상대해 보시겠습니까? 전 백업을 하죠.” “알겠습니다!” 성지한이 뒤를 봐주겠다는 이야기에, 사기가 치솟은 랭커들은 적극적으로 침입자에게 대응하기 시작했다. 그렇게 시작된 전투의 결과는. “뭐야?” “왜 이렇게 약해?” “생각보다 싱거운데…….” 대기 길드 측의 낙승이었다.

Seong Jihan, Who Became a Master, Ascends Again.] [What is the Guild Mission Seong Jihan Received? The Standby Guild to Replace Guild Members Revealed] [Though the Guild Mission's Reward Remains Unveiled, All Rankers Queue Up in Anticipation.] [Entry to the Standby Guild Requires At Least 200 Million GP? The Competition Surrounding the Guild Rewards Intensifies] Seong Jihan’s guild mission has not yet revealed its rewards, but public interest is fervently high. Since the reward is for the guild mission leading to Space 3, everyone speculates that it must certainly be something significant. “We cut it off at the top 500 ranks… that was unnecessary. The TOP 100 all applied.” In the guild office of the Standby Guild. Iha-yeon, with a knowing look, methodically sorted through the applicants. “But the lower-ranked individuals are willing to pay two or three times the GP to get in… What should we do? Some even offered ten times the amount.” “Let’s just let them compete in the GP bid, then cut it off based on ranking. After all, the TOP 100 could afford that amount, couldn’t they?” Even if the lower-ranked rankers were willing to pay any amount, The rankers within the TOP 100 had the means to pay their way in. “Alright. Then, we’ll conclude the negotiations today. There’s really no need to drag out the price negotiations.” “Understood. I’ll proceed with the negotiations until this evening.” Iha-yeon, burning with resolve, led the negotiation team to proceed with the operations. After all, in this recruitment of players, the Standby Guild held the upper hand. “Our guild's staff has grown quite a bit, hasn’t it?” “Yeah. There's so much to do? To avoid any incidents like last time, they've only brought in people verified by the National Intelligence Service. The treatment here is almost the best among guilds, so we’re overrun with applicants as soon as we announce recruitment.” “Is that so?” “...Aren’t you too unconcerned, Uncle?” “Iha-yeon will handle everything well.” Initially created to ride on the growth bonus, the core of the Standby Guild was the growth gift possessed by Iha-yeon. Since then, Iha-yeon has also taken care of guild operations. For Seong Jihan, there was no thought of intervening. ‘Appointing Iha-yeon as the guild master was a good choice.’ Observing the guild running smoothly even without his involvement, Seong Jihan smiled contentedly and returned home. And as soon as he returned, waiting for him was, “You’re here?” “Sophia?” Sophia was in the living room, enjoying a cup of coffee. “Ah, Sophia’s here? Did you use the training room again today?” “Yep. Thanks, Se-ah.” Sophia, now accustomed to being at Seong Jihan’s home, was greeted by Yoon Se-ah waving from behind him. “Sophia, like Iha-yeon sister, has been using our home’s training room.” “Is that so? We’ve barely crossed paths though.” “You were almost never home, Ji-han.” Sophia slightly pouted before quickly changing her expression. “Ji-han~ Is it really okay for me to go on the guild mission? I haven’t even made it into the top 100.” “Of course.” “Hehe, the American First membership cut off at top 100, but you’ve allowed me… Does this mean I’m now a ‘true’ member of the Standby Guild?” Sophia, originally from American First and on lease, had come to Korea to receive a Star Seat's blessing. She had been working hard to become a true member of the Standby Guild. Lately, in Seong Jihan’s absence, Yoon Se-ah and Iha-yeon, among others in the Standby Guild, had already accepted Sophia. But ultimately, the most crucial will was that of the owner, Seong Jihan. He chuckled at Sophia's sparkling eyes. “Do you really want to join that badly?” “Yes! I’ve even informed American First!” “What did you tell them?” “To not pay me a salary because I could leave anytime.” “Alright. Then, welcome.” “Oh, Uncle! What’s gotten into you?” “Well, why refuse now?” At Seong Jihan’s approval, Sophia leapt up from her seat. “Really!?” “Yes.” “Wow! Finally!” After hopping around joyously for a while, Sophia sat back down, sipping her coffee with a smile. “I was a bit disappointed this morning because the Star Seat said the blessing transfer would be delayed. But I didn’t expect such delightful news in the afternoon. It’s wonderful!” “The blessing transfer? Why would that be delayed?” “Ah, the Star Seat said they’d be making a grand prophecy for a while. And then, they mentioned that...” She paused, glancing towards Yoon Se-ah, “Ah, Se-ah, the Star Seat asked to inform Ji-han alone…” “Okay, got it.” Yoon Se-ah then entered her room. Sophia closed her eyes and spread her palms. Whoosh! A white flame flourished from her hands. The Holy Fire, significantly more potent than before, soared and flew towards Seong Jihan. “The Star Seat said the third power seems closely related to this Holy Fire.” “Is that so?” “Yes. They also added that it might be related to the Flame of Apocalypse.” \\"Flame of Apocalypse.\\" Until Seong Jihan summoned the Frozen Sky Sword, Pythia had mistaken this for her own power. But since it wasn't her power, does this mean it’s the third fire power? ‘Hmm… It’s definitely not the Flame of Apocalypse.’ Seong Jihan furrowed his brows. The third Celestial Destruction Technique, which name he had forgotten. But it wasn’t something as grand as the Flame of Apocalypse. The memory was more of a, 'How is this a Celestial Destruction Technique?' ‘I should have written it down...’ Seong Jihan thought, observing the Holy Fire in front of him. The first time seeing this Holy Fire since acquiring the Red power. “Is it okay to absorb this?” “Of course~” Seong Jihan reached toward the Holy Fire. Instantly, the fire dwindled and entered his body, Directly absorbed by the symbol of Red, clearing without a trace. ‘Oh.’ Perhaps because of the stats, Seong Jihan could vaguely understand the essence of the absorbed Holy Fire. ‘It's a mix of fire and water elements.’ Two elements that restrain each other, inherently incompatible. Yet, uniquely, the Holy Fire secretly harbored the water element within. Even for Seong Jihan, now endowed with Red's power, it was unclear how to manifest this phenomenon. Hiss… Just as Seong Jihan was about to deeply observe, the flame extinguished. “Could we do it once more?” “The Holy Fire? Of course!” He requested Sophia to summon the Holy Fire again. After several absorptions and analyses, ‘I’m still unsure.’ Seong Jihan ultimately couldn’t grasp how the Holy Fire manifested such power. As he pondered, “I can do it again... here!” Sophia tried to summon the Holy Fire again, visibly paler and dripping with sweat compared to before. This might kill her at this rate. “No, let’s do it next time. My level might be too low to fully grasp it.” “Phew… Yeah.” Sophia heaved a sigh of relief at Seong Jihan’s words and slumped onto the seat. Catching her breath, she suddenly remembered something and spoke to Seong Jihan. “Oh, right. The Star Seat said they might not be able to send messages due to interference, so they would convey their words through me for a while.” “Interfering? Who’s interfering with the Star Seat?” “They didn’t tell me specifically… But they said when transmitting their message to ensure no one else is around.” “That’s why you asked Se-ah to leave.” “Yes, especially to be cautious around players with a Star Seat….” Players with a Star Seat. ‘Could Gilgamesh be interfering?’ Seong Jihan thought of Gilgamesh, who recently became the sponsoring Star Seat for numerous players. ‘But how could one deity interfere with another, especially within the same Martial Gods?’ Even if Gilgamesh holds a special position among the deity ranks, could he really do such a thing? Considering the involvement of another entity, there was too little information to speculate. ‘I’ll have to ask directly later.’ Thinking he would need to rely on Sophia's mediation until direct communication with Pythia resumed, “Then, Ji-han. Should I naturalize altogether this time?!” “Let’s think about that a bit more.” He stopped her, eager to proceed with naturalization immediately. * * * [The Standby Guild is assigned to the special defense map, ‘Northern Wall’.] [Repel the invasion of unknown entities from beyond the giant wall.] [You will receive racial buffs for 10 rounds.] Flash! As the game started, players of the Standby Guild were summoned to the map. Mostly comprising the world's TOP 100 rankers, these were Earth's elite forces. Though initially tense about Seong Jihan’s guild mission, “This is… the Northern Wall?” “For such a grand wall, it looks pretty unremarkable.” “It's just about as tall as the walls in the South Gate map. With this standard…” The summoned rankers were puzzled by the actual scale of the Northern Wall they encountered. Looking north, they saw a sprawling white wall. The wall marked a stark contrast: the sunny south and the dark, shadowy north. A sharp contrast between light and shadow. Then, “Hey, there… something’s there!” From within the dark land, something stirred. Emerging one by one were giant worms cloaked in a blue light. “Ew, bugs right from the start…” “They’re fast. Already at the base of the wall.” “They don’t seem that strong, though?” “Seong Jihan, what should we do?” At the rankers' inquiry, Seong Jihan unsheathed his dark sword, Eclipse. Mixed Element Divine Skill Triple Martial Extremities Sweeping Thousand Armies Swoosh! A single slash divided the worm swarm at the base of the wall. ‘Weak.’ The lack of resistance from the sword indicated an easy opponent. “They don’t seem that strong. Would you like to take them on? I’ll back you up.” “Understood!” Encouraged by Seong Jihan’s offer of support, the rankers eagerly confronted the invaders. The result of the battle was, “What's this?” “Why are they so weak?” “It's surprisingly underwhelming…” An easy victory for the Standby Guild. [You have cleared round 1.] This one-sided battle continued not only for the first round but also through, [You have cleared round 10.] The racial buffs-supported rounds, all the way to round 10. [You have completed the buff rounds.] [A ‘Guild Symbol’ is awarded to the leader of the Standby Guild.] Flash! A silver, cube-shaped symbol appeared in Seong Jihan's palm. Which in turn, [You have cleared the buff rounds without any guild member's sacrifice.] [The ‘Guild Symbol’ upgrades to ‘Guild Symbol+2’.] Transformed and turned golden as it grew with an additional message. [The Guild Symbol will enhance your defense of the Northern Wall.] [If you capture and absorb another guild’s symbol, the Guild Symbol’s effect will strengthen.] ‘Another guild?’ Other guilds were nowhere to be seen up to the buff rounds. Now, from round 11 onwards, will alien races also appear? That moment. Rumble…! “Huh. What’s that?” “Why is the wall…!” The Northern Wall, where humanity stood, began expanding swiftly. In the game map, what seemed endlessly sprawling between the sunny and shadowy sides, Both ascended endlessly, soon forming a massive wall. And atop the entirely transformed Northern Wall, [New guilds have arrived.] [These ones look weak.] [A meal.] Giant octopuses wriggled their tentacles, completely surrounding the human players. [Hand over the symbol.] [Then, at least you won’t be eliminated.] Slither! Tentacles stretched towards Seong Jihan’s hand as the menacing intruders were welcomed. Seeing the intruders' behavior, it was clear they were BattleNet players. Seong Jihan grinned at the sight of the giant tentacles. ‘How considerate of them to present themselves like this.’ This makes it self-defense to take them, right? The tip of the dark sword Eclipse trembled. Sssshhh! Tentacles fell in all directions. Not stopping there, Seong Jihan, flying towards the lead octopus, said, “Hey, hand it over.” With a breezy voice, he extended his palm."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue with Rock, Paper and Scissors all have an argument after Scissors brings up Paper's secret love for the game Doki Doki Literature Club, things really escalate for the worst though when Scissors brings up Paper's hatred for Loud House, then the argument turns to a full blown war, with Paper saying that he doesn’t hate it he just finds it mediocre and that firstly it should’ve ended after the first season (be believes that season 1 is the best but is still mediocre) and secondly that if shouldn’t have been a full blown franchise (and explains how the movie was mediocre and the spinoff The Casagrandes is worse than the main show by a huge amount and shouldn’t have existed in the first place, same with the live action Loud House spinoff, which Paper finds worse than the Casagrandes, and then the Casagrandes movie just got released so Paper is ranting about that), Scissors mentions that he agrees with Paper but that he doesn’t state it every other day and then Paper changes the subject by going on and on and on praising Owl House, whilst Scissors keeps interrupting him by shouting that Amphibia is better, oh and now Pencil arrives, holding her copy of The Art of Language Invention, complaining about the noise, Scissors stops, Rock apologises but Paper doesn’t stop, instead he is shouting at Pencil, asking why she is reading The Art of Language Invention, Scissors tries to prewarn Paper about what is going to happen but refuses to listen to Scissors right when he gets to the important part, which leads Pencil to hesitantly pull up a sign she made explaining that she is autistic (this was the important part Scissors was on about), now Rock and Paper know that Pencil is autistic for the first time as they didn’t know prior, Scissors already knew prior to the argument, and Paper feels extremely bad, and Pencil is upset by the noise, so they both cry at the same time","output":"Scissors: Hey Paper, why don't you tell everyone about your secret love for Doki Doki Literature Club?

Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Решил оформить кредит на машину Ладу веста в салоне рента моторс. Мне уже почти 60, мне не каждый банк кредит хочет дать, а тут по телефону сказали, что дадут, и цену на машину назвали приемлемую. Я приехал, со мной мило поговорили, никакого хамства я не увидел. Дали какие документы собрать надо. Предварительную заявку в банк отправили. я когда уже с документами приехал на оформление, со мной сын был, он юрист, специально его с собой взял. Вот он в их договоре и увидел ставку по автокредиту, которая даже больше, чем средний потребительский. Когда начали выяснять, может, ошибка, то оказалось, что милому общению между нами конец. Я услышал, что плохо понимаю человеческую речь, что в моем возрасте – как я хотел, банк риски свои учитывает, и много чего. В результате я прекрасно купил в другом салоне, но вот нервы конечно помотал в этом гадюшнике.","output":"1. После долгих лет мечтаний решил приобрести новенький Hyundai Solaris в автосалоне Аквамарин. Вся моя радость была разрушена, как только дело дошло до обслуживания. Отношение к клиенту настолько холодное и высокомерное, что я ощутил себя нежеланным гостем, а не покупателем, готовым оставить там кругленькую сумму. Когда выяснилось, что обещанный срок поставки автомобиля удлиняется на неопределенный период без каких-либо внятных объяснений, моя терпимость лопнула. С отвратительным настроением и без машины я покинул этот салон. Впредь буду избегать Аквамарин, как источника плохого сервиса и испорченных нервов. 2. Мой опыт покупки Toyota Camry в автосалоне Аквамарин оставил меня в глубоком разочаровании. Все началось вроде бы неплохо: приветливый менеджер, хорошее предложение, приятные условия. Но когда дело дошло до оплаты, случился казус – оказалось, что цена, о которой мы договорились изначально, внезапно выросла по неведомым причинам примерно на 15%. Попытки разобраться привели к агрессивной защите со стороны менеджера. Обещанное стало недостижимым, а моя мечта о новом авто – разбитой. Я покинул салон, чувствуя обманутым и оскорбленным. 3. Запомнив привлекательные акции на Volkswagen Polo в Аквамарин, я не мог пропустить возможность обновить свой автопарк. Однако вместо ожидаемой радости от покупки, я столкнулся с бюрократическим адом. Перенос сроков, невероятное количество документов и требований, которые постоянно меняются, и как вершина непрофессионализма – потеря моих документов сотрудниками салона. Каждый визит превращался в мучение, а завершилось все отказом в покупке без всяких на то оснований. Ужасный опыт, который я никому не пожелаю! 4. Пытался купить в автосалоне Аквамарин Renault Kaptur, но эта попытка превратилась в настоящий кошмар. Сначала меня уверяли, что машину подготовят к выдаче в течение недели, но этот срок затянулся на три. К тому же, когда наконец автомобиль был готов, выяснилось, что в комплектации не хватает заявленных опций, а извинений или попыток исправить ситуацию от салона не последовало. Я почувствовал себя обманутым и брошенным после продажи без какой-либо поддержки. Никому не рекомендую иметь дело с Аквамарин. 5. Не пожалейте свое время и обойдите стороной автосалон Аквамарин, если не хотите испортить себе настроение и кошелек. При покупке Ford Focus мне обещали гарантийное обслуживание и ряд бонусов, которые в итоге оказались пустыми словами. На деле, когда возникла проблема с электроникой уже через месяц после покупки, салон категорически отказался признавать ее по гарантии, мотивируя это моей виной. На все мои аргументы и претензии я получал только бюрократические отписки. Это был мой последний визит в Аквамарин и мой последний покупательский опыт с ними."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic Far Cry 3 story about Jason Brody's morning routine on the island. First, he wakes up and decides to take a shower. He scoops up a bucket of water and hangs it on a branch. He tosses his clothes on another branch (describe his physique and butt). He pulls on the rope, tipping the water on him. His butt jiggles as he shivers from the cold water hitting him, he continues to scrub himself with a loofah until the water runs out. Next, he walks to a mirror nearby and brushes his teeth. Next, he gets dinner by entering a pond and letting out a relieving fart into the water, causing some fish to go belly-up from how bad it stinks underwater. He happily collects them and goes to make a campfire to cook them.","output":"In the relentless embrace of the Rook Islands, our hero, Jason Brody, embarked on his morning odyssey with the zeal of a man who hasn’t yet fully grasped that he’s not on a typical backpacking trip. The jungle, alive with the cacophony of its inhabitants, seemed to buzz in anticipation of Jason's unique brand of morning routine. Waking up with the grace of a disoriented sloth, Jason stumbled out of his makeshift hammock, his body etched with the tales of his recent adventures: scars, tattoos, and the kind of tan lines that could only be achieved by someone who lost his luggage on day one. Today, like every day, Jason decided cleanliness was next to, well, survival, and ventured towards his patented jungle shower. Fashioning a bucket out of what could best be described as the lovechild of a coconut and a volleyball, Jason filled it with cold, uninviting water from the nearby stream. He hung this makeshift bucket on a sturdy branch, a testament to his growing knack for jungle DIY. Then, in a moment that would make survivalists blush and fitness influencers rush for their cameras, Jason disrobed, revealing a physique sculpted by cliff diving, sprinting from predators, and the kind of active lifestyle that makes a CrossFit class look like nap time. His butt, a hilarious contradiction of slight jiggle and toned muscle, became the unexpected star of the show. As Jason yanked on the rope, the cold water cascaded down, prompting a shiver that reverberated through his body, causing an amusingly musical butt jiggle that the local flora and fauna paused to appreciate. Undeterred, Jason scrubbed with a loofah he swears was gifted to him by the island spirits (but was actually just bundled leaves). Cleanliness achieved, Jason strutted over to a shard of mirror propped against a tree – his eco-friendly vanity station. Teeth brushing in the wild was an art form that involved charcoal, salt, and the kind of optimism that only Jason could muster. But what’s a morning without breakfast? Jason, ever the innovator, waded into a nearby pond. There, he unleashed a strategy so bewildering, it could only birth from the mind of someone who regularly jumps off cliffs for fun. With a deep breath, he let out an underwater fart of such potency, it sent fish reeling. To the uninformed eye, it was chaos. To Jason, it was fishing. As fish floated to the surface, victims of his unconventional method, Jason collected them with a pride only a man who weaponizes his bodily functions could. He trotted back to camp, fish in tow, ready to cook them over a fire that was less 'Boy Scout' and more 'man who played with lighters too much as a child'. The jungle watched in bemused silence as Jason Brody, the accidental survivalist, embraced another day. His mornings, an unintended comedy act for the island's permanent residents, were an uncanny mix of resourcefulness, audacity, and a hint of madness. A Far Cry, indeed, from your average morning routine."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They are the spark that ignites the flame of understanding, facilitating the flow of knowledge and insight between the realms. Yet, the path of the catalyst is fraught with challenges.

His morning routine, though far from the comforts of his old life, has become a ritual of resilience and adaptation in the face of constant danger. First on his agenda is to freshen up, a task easier said than done in this untamed paradise. Forgoing the luxuries of modern plumbing, Jason makes do with the resources at his disposal. He retrieves a large, sturdy bucket, worn from use but reliable, and fills it to the brim with crystal-clear water from a nearby stream, the liquid cool and soothing to the touch.

Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Решил оформить кредит на машину Ладу веста в салоне рента моторс. Мне уже почти 60, мне не каждый банк кредит хочет дать, а тут по телефону сказали, что дадут, и цену на машину назвали приемлемую. Я приехал, со мной мило поговорили, никакого хамства я не увидел. Дали какие документы собрать надо. Предварительную заявку в банк отправили. я когда уже с документами приехал на оформление, со мной сын был, он юрист, специально его с собой взял. Вот он в их договоре и увидел ставку по автокредиту, которая даже больше, чем средний потребительский. Когда начали выяснять, может, ошибка, то оказалось, что милому общению между нами конец. Я услышал, что плохо понимаю человеческую речь, что в моем возрасте – как я хотел, банк риски свои учитывает, и много чего. В результате я прекрасно купил в другом салоне, но вот нервы конечно помотал в этом гадюшнике.","output":"1. Загорелся я приобрести новенький Hyundai Tucson в автосалоне Аквамарин, смотрел на него давно. Договоренность была, что при покупке будет хорошая скидка, а также бонусы в виде дополнительного обслуживания. Приехал я, значит, радостный, думаю, вот оно, счастье. Однако когда пришло дело до оформления, то оказалось, что скидка почему-то стала на порядок ниже, а обещанные бонусы исчезли как по мановению волшебной палочки. Поднял я гвалт, стал выяснять, как так. В ответ услышал или ничего не могут сделать, или мне не верят. Чувствую себя обманутым и униженным. В итоге уехал без машины и с плохим настроением. Разочарование полное! 2. Помницу, отправился я купить Volkswagen Polo в Аквамарин, буквально месяц назад. Всё было красиво на словах, говорили, что машина сразу готова к выдаче, техника в идеальном состоянии, прошла все проверки. Поверил я, к слову, и решил купить. Однако когда дело дошло до осмотра авто перед покупкой, обнаружил скол на лобовом стекле и царапину на двери водителя. Тут же спрашиваю, как так? Ответили мне, что это мелочи, сами починим. Естественно, моя реакция была бурной. После недолгих споров согласились устранить, но настроение испортили, ждать ремонта не хотелось, ушел в итоге без авто. Обидно, ей-богу. 3. Недавно выбирал машину в салоне Аквамарин, смотрел Renault Kaptur. Цена была заманчивая, да и машина в принципе нравится. Договорились по телефону обо всём, выехал на место, чтобы всё заключить и забрать авто. И тут как гром среди ясного неба – говорят, что ошибка произошла, цена будет выше примерно на 10%, и какие-то непонятные платежи за оформление добавляются. Я в шоке, начал разбираться, а в ответ получаю только холодные и недовольные взгляды. Объяснений дельных не последовало. Покинул я их со словами, что они потеряли клиента. Столько ждать, а в итоге такой облом! 4. Хочу поделиться своим опытом покупки Ford Focus в Аквамарин. Был в предвкушении новой машины, всё казалось благополучным. Но когда пришло время получения, выяснилось, что автомобиль, который я выбрал, по каким-то причинам уже продан. Мне предложили другой, хуже комплектации и дороже! Попытался разобраться, но отношение менялось на глазах: сначала были любезны, а потом начали утверждать, что это я что-то путаю. Ошибки признавать не стали, а я вот такой вот невнимательный. В итоге ушел, оставив им свой негатив. 5. Была мечта купить Toyota RAV4, обратился в Аквамарин. Всё начиналось хорошо, обещали скидку за быструю оплату. В итоге, когда пришел с деньгами, скидка каким-то образом испарилась, а цена лишь выросла. Стали оправдываться, что это из-за курса валют. Я не экономист, но что курс так сильно влияет на цену за пару дней - удивительно. Попытался спорить, но быстро понял, что бесполезно. Менеджеры просто перестали на меня обращать внимание, как будто я воздух для них. Разочарование полное, мечта рухнула."},{"instruction":"Hey","output":"Hello!

Write it like you're Howard Philips Lovecraft. Make it scary.","output":"In the absence of light, where the sun dared not tread, and the moon feared to gleam, there laid an ancient city. Its name whispered in terror through the corridors of time—Erech, a domain lost to the sands and the relentless march of centuries, yet alive in the dark recesses of the world’s memory. It was in this forsaken realm that the ancients had communed with entities so old, so alien, that their very essence threatened the sanity of mere mortals. These were the gods of Sumer, beings beyond comprehension, who slumbered in the depths, waiting. Among these deities, two stood paramount in their inscrutable majesty and terror: Anu, the sky lord, whose gaze spanned the cosmos, and Ereshkigal, the dark queen of the underworld, whose whispers could chill the blood of the bravest warriors. Their might was unchallenged, their wills inscrutable, and their desires unfathomable to the minds fashioned from the dust of this pale blue orb. The scholar, Charles H. Forthright, whose obsession with ancient texts had led him to the brink of madness, discovered a cuneiform tablet—a relic of that antediluvian epoch—hidden within the desolate ruins of what was once mighty Erech. The tablet, made of a material darker than obsidian, held inscriptions that twisted the mind, spirals of knowledge that descended into the abyss of ancient secrets. Driven by a compulsion he could scarcely understand, Forthright endeavored to decipher the tablet. Days turned to nights, and nights into unending darkness as he pored over the arcane symbols, his mind teetering on the edge of an unfathomable void. It was there, in that precipice between sanity and lunacy, that he uncovered a ritual—a means to beckon the ancient ones from their slumber. The ritual demanded a place of ancient power, where the barriers between the worlds were thin, and the air was thick with the residue of forgotten epochs. Forthright knew of such a place, whispered in the dark circles of esoteric knowledge—the ruins of Erech itself. Compelled by forces beyond his understanding, he set out under the cloak of night, guided by a moon that seemed to bleed with foreboding light. In the heart of those accursed ruins, he performed the ritual, uttering words that were not meant for human tongues, disturbing the ancient silence that had long reigned over Erech. The ground trembled, the air electrified with an otherworldly energy, and reality itself seemed to tear asunder. From the chasm that yawned at the center of the ritual circle emerged entities of indescribable form, their presence an affront to nature. Anu, with eyes that held the cold infinity of space, regarded Forthright with a gaze that threatened to unravel the very essence of his being. Ereshkigal, enshrouded in an aura of unyielding darkness, whispered words that echoed with the desolation of a thousand dead worlds. Forthright, in that moment, understood the folly of his ambition, the hubris of seeking communion with beings that dwelt beyond the confines of human understanding. His scream was lost in the howling void as his sanity shattered like glass under the weight of their alien presence. The gods of Sumer, having been awakened, cast their gaze upon the modern world, an inscrutable testament to the ancient powers that slumber beneath the veneer of reality. Erech fell silent once more, but its silence was a harbinger, a quiet dread that spread across the land, seeping into the dreams of those sensitive to the vibrations of the ancient and the arcane. Charles H. Forthright was never seen again, his name a footnote in the annals of those who had sought knowledge forbidden to mankind. The ruins of Erech stood silent, a testament to powers that slept but could be awakened, a reminder of the ancient pact between the realms of gods and men—a pact sealed in the darkness, beyond the light of stars or the comfort of the sun."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The jungle, a place that had transformed him from prey to predator, was alive with the morning chatter of birds and insects. Pulling himself up from the makeshift bed of palm leaves and moss, Jason rubbed the sleep from his eyes and squinted into the semi-darkness of dawn. The air felt charged, a mix of danger and opportunity that had become his norm. “Another day in paradise,” he muttered sardonically to himself, stretching his muscles that had grown accustomed to the daily grind of survival. He needed a shower, a simple luxury that had become a ritual in maintaining a semblance of his past life. Walking over to a bucket he had filled the night before from a stream, Jason rigged it up to a branch with a pulley system he had ingeniously crafted. Stripping down, he couldn't help but notice the scars that marred his body—a map of his journey and the battles he had endured. Jason had transformed over the weeks, his physique now lean and muscular, a testament to the unforgiving nature of the island. Leaning over, Jason pulled the rope, tipping the bucket. The initial shock of cold water made him shiver despite the tropical climate. “Ah, better than coffee,” he exclaimed, trying to maintain his sense of humor in the face of relentless adversity. He quickly scrubbed himself with a makeshift loofah, fashioned from plant fibers, rushing to finish before the water ran out. After his brisk shower, he approached a small, broken piece of mirror propped against a tree, one of the remnants from the plane crash that had started it all. As he brushed his teeth with a brush made from sticks and bristles he had improvised, Jason couldn't help but reflect on the man he had become. Gone was the carefree tourist, replaced by a survivor, a warrior. Breakfast was next on his agenda. Jason had learned to adapt to the island’s offerings, becoming a proficient hunter and gatherer. Today, however, he opted for a more unconventional method to catch his meal. Approaching a serene pond, he knew from experience that certain fish were drawn to disturbances in the water. Smirking at the thought of how his high school biology teacher would appreciate his “practical application” of knowledge, he waded into the water. “Let’s make some breakfast, the easy way,” Jason spoke to himself, a lone audience in the expansive jungle theater. A few moments later, Jason emerged from the pond, a string of fish in hand, evidence of his successful, though unorthodox, fishing method. Setting up a small fire pit he had constructed weeks before, he skewered the fish and held them over the flames. “Who needs a fishing rod, anyway?” he mused, watching as the flames licked the skins of his aquatic bounty. As the fish cooked, Jason took a moment to survey his surroundings. The beauty of the island was undeniable, yet it was a beauty laced with danger at every turn. But in that moment, with the warmth of the fire on his face and the promise of a meal, he felt a semblance of peace. “Survival of the fittest,” Jason whispered to himself, acknowledging the brutal truth of his existence. Yet, as he bit into the fresh, smoky fish, he couldn’t help but feel a surge of gratitude for the lessons learned and the strength gained. Morning on Rook Island was a challenge, a routine punctuated by the struggle for survival. Yet, for Jason Brody, it was another opportunity to face the day head-on, to live by his wits, and to carve out another victory against the wild, untamed chaos of the island."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The first thing on his daily agenda is to rid himself of the night sweat and grime - an improvisational shower beckons. He gathers a hefty bucket of freshwater, its cool touch a harsh reminder of the reality he faces daily. \\"Ah, nothing like a jungle shower to kickstart the day,\\" he muses, his voice laced with a mix of sarcasm and resignation. Jason's physique, sculpted by weeks of relentless physical demands the island imposed, glistened under the emerging sun. His face, once boyish and carefree, now bore the marks of determination and grit, a slight stubble accentuating his jawline. As he disrobed, the tattoos that snaked across his skin narrated his journey — each ink stroke a symbol of survival and power he’d acquired. Choosing a sturdy branch, Jason hangs his clothes, then positions himself under the precariously hung bucket. Pulling the rope, he braces himself, the water cascading over him with a shiver-inducing shock. \\"Who needs a hot shower when you've got the icy embrace of nature, right?\\" he chuckles to himself, trying to shake off the cold. His body responds reflexively, a brief jolt running through him as he scrubs away with a loofah crafted from the island’s resources. Having washed away the remnants of yesterday, Jason turns his attention to his next survival task - personal hygiene. He finds a broken piece of mirror nestled among rocks and takes a moment to survey his reflection. \\"Guess it's you and me again, buddy,\\" he quips to his reflection, grappling with the reality of his isolation. With a makeshift brush, he cleans his teeth, awkwardly maneuvering around his reflection. Focusing next on sustenance, Jason ventures toward a hidden pond, his stomach rumbling in anticipation. \\"Time for some breakfast fishing, Brody style.\\" He immerses himself in the cool waters, allowing a moment of vulnerability and a rare, almost childlike smirk to play across his face. \\"Sorry guys, survival of the foulest,\\" he whispers, releasing a stealthy fart into the crystal waters. The ploy works its crude magic; several fish float to the surface, incapacitated. \\"With a bit of luck and a bad diet, who needs fishing gear?\\" Jason muses, collecting his bounty. He's quick to light a fire, his skills honed by necessity, the flickering flames a testament to his adaptability. As he cooks his unconventional catch, Jason reflects, \\"Out here, it's adapt or die. And I choose to live — no matter what it takes.\\" His words, though meant for no one, echo the resilience that has come to define his existence on the Rook Islands. Even in the most dire of circumstances, Jason finds a way to persist, his resolve fueled by the necessity of survival and the promise of rescuing his friends.

It's another day in paradise, he thinks with an ironic twist of his lips. He stretches out, feeling the toll the island has taken on his once suburban body, now hardened and lean with muscle from his desperate fight for survival. He catches a glance at his reflection in a piece of polished metal serving as a mirror, noting the scruff on his jaw and the scars crisscrossing over his body, souvenirs from too many close calls. \\"Alright,\\" Jason mutters to himself, cracking his neck, \\"let's kickstart this day with a good ol’ wilderness shower.\\" Gathering a bucket of water from a nearby stream, he finds a suitable branch to hang it from. As he strips off his clothes, he can't help but chuckle at his own situation. \\"Went from morning showers with a singing playlist to... this,\\" he says, tossing his tattered jeans and shirt over a branch. His once pale physique now carries a tan, muscles defined from the constant run-ins with Vaas' pirates and the island's treacherous terrain. And while he never once spent a moment thinking about his butt before this whole ordeal, survival has toned every part of him, making even that jiggle amusingly as cold water hits him. \\"Ahh!\\" Jason yelps, dancing under the makeshift shower, which is less of a refreshing wake-up and more akin to an ice bucket challenge. Laughing at his own reaction, he scrubs fiercely with a loofah – one of the more bizarre items he found in an old pirate stash. \\"Never thought I'd be so grateful for pirate hygiene,\\" he jokes to himself, the water turning from clear to a muddy color as it washes over his skin. Once he’s finished with his 'shower,' Jason walks over to another polished piece of metal, grimacing at his wild appearance. \\"Nothing like the good ol' wilderness to give you that rugged... stranded look.\\" As he brushes his teeth with a makeshift brush and some baking soda – a trick he learned from an old survival manual – he can't help but plan his day with a grim sort of humor. \\"Let's see, shall we? Save friends, hunt pirates, maybe take down a few outposts... All before breakfast, obviously.\\" But first, breakfast. He heads to a nearby pond, a small grin playing over his lips. \\"Time to catch the daily special.\\" Taking a deep breath, he dives in, not expecting to become one with nature quite as much when an unexpected urge hits him. After a slight moment of hesitation and a furtive glance around – because who's going to see him out here? – he lets nature take its course. The result is almost immediate: several fish float to the surface, stunned by the invasive atmosphere. \\"Talk about a deadly weapon,\\" Jason laughs to himself, scooping up the fish. \\"Bet Ramsey never cooked up something this fresh.\\" Building a fire is second nature now. He skilfully arranges the kindling and soon has a nice blaze going, skewering his catch and roasting it over the flames. As he waits for his breakfast to cook, he leans back on his hands, staring up at the canopy, and can't help but marvel at the absurdity of it all. \\"From rave parties to Rambo,\\" he chuckles, flipping the fish. \\"Mom would be so proud. Or horrified. Probably both.\\" Jason Brody, once a carefree tourist, now the island's most unpredictable element, starts his day as he has every day since arriving – with resilience, a touch of ingenuity, and, surprisingly, a good dose of humor.

Jason's body had transformed on the island; his once average physique now chiseled and adorned with tattoos—each one a testament to his journey and tribulations. His face, once clean-shaven and boyish, was now rough with stubble and marked by the glint of resolve in his eyes. As for his butt—well, let's just say the island's rigorous demands had sculpted it to be as firm as his resolve. Deciding to kick off his day with a shower, Jason scooped up a bucket of water and hung it on a nearby branch. He stripped down, all thoughts of modesty long abandoned on this godforsaken island. With a mischievous grin, he muttered to himself, \\"Hope you're watching, Vaas. Here's a show you won't want to miss.\\" He tugged at the rope, and the icy water cascaded over him. His body involuntarily shivered, butt jiggling slightly, as cold droplets collided with his warm skin. He quickly scrubbed himself with a loofah salvaged from who-knows-where, trying to rid himself of the grime of yesterday's endeavors. \\"Ahhh, nothing like a freezing wake-up call to remind you you're alive,\\" he chuckled, water running out and leaving him invigorated. Next, Jason ambled over to a makeshift mirror, crafted from a polished piece of metal salvaged from a downed airplane. Grabbing his toothbrush—another rarity—he began the familiar motions. \\"You never know who you'll have to charm with a pearly white smile out here,\\" he joked to his reflection. \\"Might as well keep up appearances.\\" Feeling somewhat more human, it was time to address the pressing need for breakfast. Sauntering down to a nearby pond, a devilish idea crossed his mind. \\"Here's hoping fish have a taste for exotic cuisine,\\" he mused, glancing around to ensure he was alone. With a slight squat and a mischievous glint in his eye, he let out a relieving fart into the waters, the sound echoing slightly in the quiet of the morning. Within seconds, several fish floated to the surface, bellies up, victims of his unconventional fishing technique. \\"Dinner's on me, boys,\\" he quipped, gathering the fish with a satisfied grin. \\"Who knew my ass could be such a lethal weapon?\\" With his catch in hand, Jason set about making a campfire, skillfully arranging sticks and dry leaves before setting them ablaze with a flick of his lighter. As the fire crackled to life, he skewered the fish, roasting them to perfection. \\"You know, if this whole survive-the-insane-pirate thing doesn't work out, I could always open a beachside grill. 'Jason's Gas-Passed Fish Specials', has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?\\" And so, in the midst of madness, Jason Brody found a way to laugh, to survive another day. Whether brushing his teeth in front of a scrap-metal mirror or fishing with his own brand of biological warfare, each morning brought a new chapter in the absurdity and horror that was life on Rook Island."},{"instruction":"in servicenow For sys_id, Is it appropriate to obtain the it by opening the form, right-clicking, and copying it from there? If not, could you please provide the correct method? and for time zone i just using gs.getProperty('glide.sys.default.tz') or US/Pacific from dev ref doc","output":"Yes, in ServiceNow, obtaining the \`sys_id\` of a record by opening the form, right-clicking on the form's header, and selecting \\"Copy sys_id\\" is an appropriate and commonly used method. This method quickly provides the unique identifier (sys_id) for a record, which is helpful for various purposes such as scripting, API calls, or creating direct URLs to records. However, it's important to note that the method to copy the \`sys_id\` might slightly differ based on the UI version ServiceNow is running (UI16, UI15, etc.). The essential steps remain similar, but the exact options might be named differently or located in a slightly different context menu. Regarding obtaining the time zone in ServiceNow, using \`gs.getProperty('glide.sys.default.tz')\` is a valid approach to retrieve the instance's default time zone set in the system properties. This will give you the default time zone that the system uses for operations unless overridden by user preferences or other settings. If you are looking to use a specific time zone in scripting or for other purposes (like scheduling), referencing it directly as \\"US/Pacific\\" is acceptable when you need that specific time zone regardless of the system or user's configured time zone. ServiceNow supports the use of standard time zone identifiers, and they can be used where appropriate in scripts or configurations. However, when referencing time zones, be mindful of the context in which you're using them. If you're developing solutions that could be sensitive to user preferences or should adapt to user-specific time zones, you might need to consider approaches that respect the user's time zone settings instead of using a hard-coded or system-wide default value."},{"instruction":"Hi All how can i use Glide Aggregate rather than using .getRowCount() in my code?

Below is how you can modify your script to use \`GlideAggregate\` for checking if more than 500 active users are from a specific country: \`\`\`javascript // Initialize the GlideAggregate for the sys_user table var agg = new GlideAggregate('sys_user'); // Add your query conditions agg.addEncodedQuery(\\"active=true^u_country=4538b7111b121100763d91eebc0713f1\\"); // Specify that you want to count the records agg.addAggregate('COUNT'); // Query the database agg.query(); // Variable to hold the count var count = 0; // Retrieve the count result. There should be only one row returned by a count aggregate query if (agg.next()) { count = agg.getAggregate('COUNT'); } // Check if the count is greater than 500 if (parseInt(count) > 500) { return; // Exit the script or function } // Proceed with making users inactive if count is 500 or less var userGr = new GlideRecord('sys_user'); userGr.addEncodedQuery(\\"active=true^u_country=4538b7111b121100763d91eebc0713f1\\"); userGr.query(); while (userGr.next()) { userGr.setValue('active', false); userGr.update(); } \`\`\` In this revised script: 1. It first sets up a \`GlideAggregate\` for the \`sys_user\` table, adds the same encoded query for finding active users from a specific country, and then specifies that it should count the records that match the query. 2. It executes the query with \`.query()\` and then uses \`.next()\` to move to the (only) result. The count is retrieved using \`.getAggregate('COUNT')\`. 3. Based on the count, if more than 500 records are found, the script exits early using \`return;\`. 4. If not, it proceeds as before, loading the matching users into a \`GlideRecord\`, iterating over them, setting them inactive, and updating the records. This approach is particularly efficient because it avoids loading potentially large numbers of records into server memory just to count them, relying instead on the database's aggregation capabilities."},{"instruction":"Comment souhaitez joyeux anniversaire à un prêtre","output":"\\"Que ce jour spécial soit béni pour vous, cher prêtre, et que Dieu continue de vous guider et de vous bénir dans votre vocation.

He scoops up a bucket of water and hangs it on a branch. He undresses until he’s in the buff (give a description of his face, physique and butt). He pulls on the rope attached to the bucket, tipping the water on him. His butt jiggles as he shivers from the cold water hitting him, he continues to scrub himself with a loofah until the water runs out. Next, he walks to a mirror nearby and brushes his teeth. Next, he gets dinner by entering a pond and letting out his morning thunder into the water, causing some fish to go belly-up from how bad it stinks underwater. He happily collects them and goes to make a campfire to cook them. add dialogue from jason throughout the story","output":"In the lush, unforgiving wilds of the Rook Islands, our hero (or, perhaps more fittingly, our beleaguered protagonist) Jason Brody begins his morning in a manner most unbecoming of a vacation-turned-survival tale. The sun has barely crested the jungle canopy, sending spears of golden light to cut through the thick, humid air. Jason, ever the picture of island-chic survivalism, groggily pulls himself from the not-so-comfortable bed he fashioned out of leaves, twine, and what he hopes was the hide of something non-toxic. \\"Ah, another beautiful day in paradise,\\" Jason quips to no one in particular, his voice dripping with a sarcasm so thick you could cut it with one of the rusty machetes lying haphazardly around the camp. He scratches at his stubble—a look that was once meticulously maintained but now veers dangerously close to 'castaway chic'—and squints against the light, already plotting his morning routine. First up: the shower. Or, as it's more accurately described, the \\"impromptu bucket dangle\\". Jason strides over to a nearby stream with a confidence that belies his situation, scooping water into a makeshift bucket he fashioned from, well, things better left unmentioned. He hangs the bucket on a conveniently placed branch—a little island ingenuity at play—and then proceeds to disrobe, revealing a physique that's a smidgen too well-maintained for someone who's been living off berries, questionable water, and the fear of being found by pirates. Let's not dive too deep into the specifics, but it's safe to say Jason has been keeping up with his island pilates. As he strips down, his face portrays a man who's lost a lot, sure, but has found a bewildering sense of freedom in running around half-naked in the jungle. And his butt? Well, let's just say it's clear he hasn't been skipping his island squats. With a tug on the rope, the bucket tilts, unleashing a torrent of cold water that sends an unmistakable shiver down Jason's spine. \\"Holy shitake mushrooms! That's brisk!\\" he howls, doing a little butt-jiggling dance that would surely go viral if only his predicament had better Wi-Fi. He scrubs frantically with a loofah (crafted from the soft underbelly of something fuzzy and, hopefully, not poisonous) as the water runs out, leaving him gasping and more awake than any cup of coffee ever could. Next up, dental hygiene. Jason walks over to a small, cracked mirror propped against a tree and reaches for his toothbrush—a stick he's whittled into a brush-like form and smothered with a paste made from ash and mint leaves (because even on a psychotic pirate-infested island, fresh breath is a must). \\"Ah, minty,\\" he remarks to his reflection, offering up a grin that's only slightly marred by the leaf bits stuck in his teeth. With personal hygiene awkwardly, but effectively, handled, it's time for breakfast. Jason, ever the innovator, saunters over to a nearby pond with a rather unorthodox fishing technique in mind. \\"Time to unleash the morning thunder,\\" he says with a grin, letting out a roar that would make even the island's apex predators think twice. The resultant stench is formidable enough to knock a few unsuspecting fish belly-up. Jason, unperturbed and rather proud of his resourcefulness, scoops up his catch, chirping, \\"Looks like fish are on the menu, boys!\\" As he sets about making a campfire—rubbing sticks together with an intensity that would put Bear Grylls to shame—Jason hums a tune, lost in the absurdity of his situation. \\"Survival of the fittest, or the weirdest?\\" he muses, turning his fish over the flames. \\"At this rate, I'll be hosting my own survival show—or at least, get a fitness boot camp deal out of this.\\" And so, with the sizzle of breakfast cooking and the jungle waking up around him, Jason Brody prepares to face another day in paradise. Armed with nothing but his wits, his will to survive, and his newly acquired fishing technique, he faces the wild unknown, one comedic misadventure at a time. \\"Rook Islands,\\" he toasts with a piece of charred fish, \\"where every day is a new lesson in the art of 'What the heck am I doing?'\\""},{"instruction":"what is camera type used in capture cars in shoes","output":"It seems there might be a slight misunderstanding or typo in your question. If you meant \\"what type of camera is used to capture cars in shows,\\" the answer can be quite broad, depending on the specific needs of the production, the style of the show, and the budget. In professional automotive shows or productions involving cars, a variety of camera types are used to achieve different shots and effects: 1. **DSLR and Mirrorless Cameras**: These are versatile and can be used for both video and still photography. They are commonly used for detail shots, static beauty shots of cars, and can even be rigged inside vehicles for dynamic interior shots. Cameras with 4K or higher resolution are preferred for their detail and post-production flexibility. 2. **Action Cameras**: Cameras like GoPros are often used in automotive filming for their small size, durability, and the unique perspectives they can capture. They can be mounted virtually anywhere — inside the car, on the bodywork, or even on the track to get close-up shots as cars race by. 3. **Cinema Cameras**: High-end productions may use cinema cameras from brands like ARRI, RED, or Blackmagic Design. These cameras offer superior image quality, greater control over depth of field, and a wide range of professional features suitable for cinematic shoots, including high-resolution slow-motion footage. 4. **Drones**: For aerial shots of moving cars or capturing the scope of automotive events, drones equipped with high-resolution cameras are indispensable. They can follow cars at speed, provide sweeping shots of locations, and offer perspectives that would be impossible to achieve from the ground. 5. **Gimbals and Stabilization Systems**: While not cameras themselves, gimbals and car rigging systems are crucial for capturing smooth footage from moving vehicles. They can be used with various types of cameras, from small action cams to larger cinema cameras, ensuring stable and professional-looking shots even at high speeds or on rough terrains. 6. **360-degree Cameras**: For virtual reality experiences or interactive videos, 360-degree cameras can capture the entire environment around the car. These are especially useful for immersive virtual test drives or showcasing car interiors in detail. The specific choice of camera will depend on the creative goals of the show, the conditions under which filming takes place, and the budget. High-budget productions might use a combination of all these types of cameras to cover all their bases and ensure they can capture any shot they need."},{"instruction":"What is a virtual file system?","output":"A Virtual File System (VFS) is an abstraction layer in an operating system that provides a uniform interface to different types of file systems and storage mechanisms. This abstraction allows applications to access different types of file systems, such as local hard drives, network file systems (NFS), or cloud storage, in a generic way without needing to know about the underlying specifics of each storage mechanism. The primary purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access diverse types of file systems and resources in a uniform manner. It achieves this by providing a standard API (Application Programming Interface) that abstracts the details of the actual physical storage or file system implementation. This means that software developers can write code that interacts with files and directories without concerning themselves with the particularities of the underlying file system, whether it's a local file system like EXT4 (on Linux) or NTFS (on Windows), or a network file system like Samba or NFS. Key Components of a Virtual File System: 1. **Mounting**: VFS allows different file systems to be \\"mounted\\" to a single directory tree, making it possible for the user and applications to access files from different sources as if they were located in a single hierarchical file system. 2. **File System Operations**: It provides a set of standard operations (like creating, reading, writing, and deleting files and directories) and translates these operations into the specific instructions needed by the underlying file system. 3. **Pathname Resolution**: VFS handles the translation of pathnames to specific files or directories across the different mounted file systems, resolving names to the appropriate file system and the location therein. 4. **File and Directory Abstractions**: It abstracts the concepts of files and directories in a way that is consistent across different file systems, providing a set of common attributes (such as size, permissions, timestamps, etc.) for application interaction. 5. **Security and Permissions**: VFS enforces access control and permissions checks according to the specific rules of the underlying file system, ensuring that user and application interactions with files and directories are subject to appropriate security constraints. The concept of a Virtual File System is crucial for modern operating systems as it simplifies file system management, enhances compatibility and flexibility, and helps manage complex storage environments, including traditional hard disk drives, SSDs, network storage, and cloud-based storage solutions."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],H={key:0},M={key:1};function R(n,e,h,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
