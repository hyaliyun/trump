Find the distance between the line segments (A_1C_1) and (BD_1). 1. First, let's visualize the cube and identify the relevant lines. The cube is represented with vertices: - Bottom face: (A, B, C, D) - Top face: (A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1) The lines in question are (A_1C_1) and (BD_1). 2. Consider the plane of the square (BB_1D_1D). Since the side length of the cube is 1, each edge has length 1. 3. To find the distance between the line segment (A_1C_1) and (BD_1), we need to determine the perpendicular distance between these lines. 4. Identify the midpoint (O) of the line segment (B_1D_1). Since (B_1D_1) is a diagonal of a square face with vertices (B_1, C_1, D_1), and this square face has a side length of 1: [ text{Length of } B_1D_1 = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2} ] 5. The midpoint (O) of (B_1D_1) can be found. Let (B_1 = (1, 0, 1)) and (D_1 = (0, 1, 1)). The coordinates of the midpoint (O) are calculated as: [ O = left(frac{1+0}{2}, frac{0+1}{2}, frac{1+1}{2} right) = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 1right) ] 6. Now, construct the perpendicular line from (O) to (BD_1). The line (BD_1) has endpoints at: [ B = (1, 0, 0) quad text{and} quad D_1 = (0, 1, 1) ] 7. We need the perpendicular distance from (O) to (BD_1). 8. To find this distance, use the distance formula for a point to a line in 3D. Let (O) be the point (left(frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 1right)) and the line defined by points (B = (1, 0, 0)) and (D_1 = (0, 1, 1)). The vector (B to D_1) is: [ overrightarrow{BD_1} = (-1, 1, 1) ] 9. The coordinates of (O) can be seen as a point whose distance to the line is calculated by projecting onto the directional vector of (BD_1): 10. The distance between the point (O) and the line (BD_1) can be found using the formula for the distance of a point from a line in 3D. The distance (d) is given by: [ d = frac{| overrightarrow{OA} times overrightarrow{BD_1} |}{| overrightarrow{BD_1} |} ] where (overrightarrow{OA}) is the vector from point (O) to point (A) and (overrightarrow{BD_1}) is the directional vector of the line. 11. Calculating (overrightarrow{OA}): [ overrightarrow{OA} = O - B = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 1right) - (1, 0, 0) = left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 1right) ] 12. The cross product (overrightarrow{OA} times overrightarrow{BD_1}) is: [ overrightarrow{OA} times overrightarrow{BD_1} = begin{vmatrix} mathbf{i} & mathbf{j} & mathbf{k} -frac{1}{2} & frac{1}{2} & 1 -1 & 1 & 1 end{vmatrix} = mathbf{i}(0 - 1) - mathbf{j}(-frac{1}{2} + 1) + mathbf{k}(-frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}) = -mathbf{i} - mathbf{j}left(frac{1}{2}right) - mathbf{k}(-1) = -mathbf{i} - mathbf{j}left(frac{1}{2}right) - mathbf{k}(1) ] [ overrightarrow{OA} times overrightarrow{BD_1} = (-1, -frac{1}{2}, -1) ] 13. The magnitude of this vector (| overrightarrow{OA} times overrightarrow{BD_1} |) is: [ | overrightarrow{OA} times overrightarrow{BD_1} | = sqrt{(-1)^2 + left(-frac{1}{2}right)^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{1 + frac{1}{4} + 1} = sqrt{frac{9}{4}} = frac{3}{2} ] 14. Finally, the magnitude of (| overrightarrow{BD_1} |): [ | overrightarrow{BD_1} | = sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{3} ] 15. Plugging into the distance formula: [ d = frac{| overrightarrow{OA} times overrightarrow{BD_1} |}{| overrightarrow{BD_1} |} = frac{frac{3}{2}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{3}{2sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{6}}{6} ] # Conclusion: (boxed{frac{sqrt{6}}{6}}) The distance between the line segments (A_1C_1) and (BD_1) is (frac{sqrt{6}}{6})."},{"instruction":"Find all possible values of f(0) if f(x) satisfies the equation: [f(x + y) = frac{f(x)f(y)}{f(xy)}] for all real numbers x and y.","output":"1.

The equation is valid, but it does not give constraints on f(0). Assume a non-zero constant solution, (f(x) = c neq 0) for all x. Plugging this into the function equation: [c = frac{ccdot c}{c} = c^2 / c = c.] 3. Check if c = 0 works. If f(x) = 0 for all x, then: [f(x + y) = frac{0 times 0}{0}.] This case leads to an undefined situation unless specified as zero.

Similarly, let the line passing through ( Y ) and perpendicular to ( AY ) intersect ( L_1, L_2 ) at ( Y_1, Y_2 ) respectively. Assume ( X_1Y_2 ) intersects ( X_2Y_1 ) at ( P ). We need to prove that ( angle AZP = 90^circ ). 1. **Identify the center ( O ) of the circle ( (BCXY) ):** Since ( A ) is the midpoint of ( BC ) and ( Z ) is the midpoint of ( XY ), we can draw the center ( O ) of the circle. 2. **Cyclic quadrilaterals ( BAXX_1 ) and ( CAYY_2 ):** Since ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ) are perpendicular to ( BC ) and pass through ( B ) and ( C ) respectively, the lines ( AX ) and ( AY ) are perpendicular to the lines passing through ( X ) and ( Y ) respectively. Therefore, ( BAXX_1 ) and ( CAYY_2 ) are cyclic quadrilaterals. 3. **Intersection points ( U ) and ( V ):** Let ( U ) be the foot of the altitude from ( A ) to ( X_1Y_2 ), and ( V ) be the foot of the altitude from ( A ) to ( X_2Y_1 ). Since ( BAXX_1 ) and ( CAYY_2 ) are cyclic, ( U ) lies on both circles.

This directly measures dispersion. 2. **Median** is the middle value of a data set when it is ordered from least to greatest.

It is given that triangle (KLM) is equilateral. We need to prove that triangle (ABC) is equilateral. 1. **Understanding the properties of the equilateral triangle (KLM)**: - Since (KLM) is equilateral, (KL = LM = MK). This implies that all sides of triangle (KLM) are equal. 2. **Analyzing median properties**: - In triangle (AKC), (KL) acts as the median. We know that in any triangle, the median connecting the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side divides the opposite side into two equal segments. - Therefore, (K) being the midpoint of (BC), and (KL) being equilateral with sides (KLM), suggests that each segment (BK = KC). 3. **Identifying additional properties through symmetry**: - Since (KLM) is equilateral and symmetrical, the nature of symmetry in (ABC) should reflect similar symmetry. 4. **Considering (AK) as altitude in (∆AKC)**: - Since (KL) is a median in (∆AKC) and lies within equilateral triangle (KLM), it bisects (BC). This also means that (AK) behaves as an altitude in triangle (ABC). Similarly, the median (BL) and height (CM) are critical symmetries and equalities to consider. 5. **Evaluating the length (AC)**: - With symmetrical properties, (AB = AC). Moreover, since the internal symmetry and given equal lengths through medians and heights hold, we can generalize that (K) is also the centroid and midpoint, further suggesting (MK) bisects (BC). 6. **Final proof for equilateral nature**: - Given that (CM) lies perpendicular on (AB) and (AK) on median and being symmetric step through equal-sided qualities, - Hence, (BC = AC).

Now, let's find the number of ways to get each prime sum: - Sum of 2: There's only one way to get this sum (1+1). - Sum of 3: There are two ways to get this sum (1+2, 2+1). - Sum of 5: There are four ways to get this sum (1+4, 4+1, 2+3, 3+2). - Sum of 7: There are six ways to get this sum (1+6, 6+1, 2+5, 5+2, 3+4, 4+3). - Sum of 11: There are two ways to get this sum (5+6, 6+5). Adding these up, we get 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15 ways to get a prime sum.

So, the number of fish that swam eastward and were not caught is (3/5)E. Similarly, fishers caught 3/4 of the fish that swam westward, which means that 1/4 of the fish that swam westward were not caught and are still in the sea. Since 1,800 fish swam westward, the number of fish that swam westward and were not caught is (1/4) * 1,800 = 450. We also know that 500 fish swam north and were not caught. The total number of fish left in the sea is the sum of the fish that swam eastward and were not caught, the fish that swam westward and were not caught, and the fish that swam north. This total is given as 2,870 fish. So, we have the equation: (3/5)E + 450 + 500 = 2,870 Now, let's solve for E: (3/5)E + 950 = 2,870 Subtract 950 from both sides: (3/5)E = 2,870 - 950 (3/5)E = 1,920 Now, multiply both sides by 5/3 to solve for E: E = (5/3) * 1,920 E = 5 * 640 E = 3,200 Therefore, boxed{3,200} fish swam eastward."},{"instruction":"Given overrightarrow{a}=(1,2), overrightarrow{b}=(x,4), if the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is acute, then the range of real number x is ____.","output":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,2) and overrightarrow{b}=(x,4), we are tasked with finding the range of x such that the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is acute.

Considering the possible ways to pick four vertices and form skew lines, we see that they could either be on adjacent faces or on opposite ends of the cube, and none of these configurations can form a 30° angle. Therefore, the angle that cannot be formed between two skew lines chosen in this way is 30°. boxed{A: 30°}"},{"instruction":"Angela is 4 cm taller than Helen.

Since x is even and y is the next odd integer, the smallest difference between y and x is 1 (if x = 2, then y = 3). However, since (y - x) > k, and k is a positive integer, the smallest k can be is 1. Therefore, the smallest (y - x) can be is 2 (if k = 1, then y - x must be greater than 1, so y - x could be 2). Now, since y and z are both odd and distinct, the smallest difference between y and z is also 2 (if y = 3, then z = 5).

Let's choose -1/3 for w to minimize the value of z - w. Now, we need to find the least possible value of z - w given that (z - w) > m and k > m. Since the smallest k can be is 1, the smallest m can be is less than 1 (since k > m). However, m must be a positive integer, so the smallest m can be is 1. Therefore, the smallest (z - w) can be is greater than 1. Let's calculate z - w with the smallest possible values for z and w: z = 5 (the smallest odd integer greater than y = 3) w = -1/3 (the closest negative non-integer multiple of 1/3 to zero) z - w = 5 - (-1/3) = 5 + 1/3 = 15/3 + 1/3 = 16/3 Since (z - w) must be greater than m and m is at least 1, the smallest (z - w) can be is greater than 16/3.

Show that the triangles PQR and P'Q'R' can be transformed into each other through a suitable rotation.","output":"To show that the triangles (PQR) and (P'Q'R') can be transformed into each other by a rotation around a suitable center, we need to demonstrate the existence of a point (O) such that: [ O P' = O P, quad O Q' = O Q, quad text{and} quad O R' = O R ] and to show that the rotations that map (OP') onto (OP), (OQ') onto (OQ), and (OR') onto (OR) are equal, considering their direction. Let's denote the directed rotation angles of (OP') to (OP), (OQ') to (OQ), and (OR') to (OR) by ( omega ). Under such a rotation ( omega ) about (O), the triangle (P'Q'R') would be mapped to the triangle (PQR), with each vertex of the first triangle mapping to the corresponding vertex of the second triangle. 1. **Existence of the Point (O)**: - If such a point (O) exists, it must lie at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of segments (PP'), (QQ'), and (RR'), ensuring that each of these pairs of segments is equidistant from (O). - Since (PP') and (QQ') are line segments with different directions, their perpendicular bisectors are not parallel and they intersect at a unique point (O). Thus, there is at most one such point (O). 2. **Verification with the Incircle Center**: - We will show that the point (O) is in fact the center of the incircle of triangle (ABC), known as the incenter. - The triangles (OPP'), (OQQ'), (ORR') are isosceles and congruent triangles because (O) is equidistant from each pair of corresponding points. - Specifically, the distances of the point (O) from points (P) and (P'), (Q) and (Q'), and (R) and (R') all equal the radius of the incircle of (ABC). 3. **Verification of Rotation**: - We choose the orientation such that (A), (B), and (C) are traversed counterclockwise (positive direction). - Rotating the ray (OA) around (O) in a positive direction precisely results in transforming points in the order ( R, Q', B, P, R', C, Q, P', A ), cyclically. - Since (O) is the incenter, all angles of rotation ( omega ) for (PP'), (QQ'), and (RR') are less than (180^{circ}). This ensures that as the half-line rotates from (Q') to (Q), it corresponds to a single counterclockwise traversal when parallel to (BC).

To prove that the product of these areas (S_{1} cdot S_{3} = S_{2} cdot S_{4}), we consider the triangles (triangle ABP) and (triangle BCP), which share the common height dropping from vertex (B) onto diagonal (APC). 4.

Since (S_{1} cdot S_{3} = S_{2} cdot S_{4}), let (k) be an integer such that: [ S_{1} cdot S_{3} = S_{2} cdot S_{4} = k ] 9. Therefore, the product can be written as: [ S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} S_{4} = k cdot k = k^2 ] 10. Thus, (S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} S_{4}) is the exact square of the integer (k).

Thus, k=4 is not a valid solution because it contradicts the given information that the lines are perpendicular. Instead, let's re-examine the equation after simplification: [ frac{3-k}{k-3} = 1 ] This simplification is incorrect as the slopes should multiply to -1. So let's go back to the step where we multiply the slopes: [ (k-3)(-frac{k-3}{3-k}) = -1 ] Since the terms k-3 and 3-k will cancel each other regardless of the value of k (except when k=3 which would make the expression undefined), and then the negative sign will make the product -1.

The third leak drains the tank in 12 hours, so its rate is 1 tank per 12 hours, or ( frac{1}{12} ) tank per hour. When all three leaks are active simultaneously, their combined draining rate is the sum of their individual rates: ( frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{12} ) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

This means that with all three leaks active, the tank is being filled at a rate of ( frac{1}{8} ) tank per hour. To find out how long it would take to fill the tank at this rate, we take the reciprocal of the rate: ( frac{1}{frac{1}{8}} = 8 ) hours.

Let ( P ) be the intersection of diagonals ( AD ) and ( CF ), ( R ) be the intersection of diagonals ( BE ) and ( CF ), and ( Q ) be the intersection of diagonals ( AD ) and ( BE ). We are also given that ( AP = PF ), ( BR = CR ), and ( DQ = EQ ). We aim to prove that the points ( A, B, C, D, E, ) and ( F ) lie on the same circle. 1. **Finding symmetries in triangles**: - We start by considering the triangle ( APF ). Since ( AP = PF ), triangle ( APF ) is isosceles. - Let ( O ) be the center of the circumcircle of triangle ( PQR ). 2. **Considering perpendicular bisectors**: - The line segment ( PO ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( AF ) due to the symmetry in the isosceles triangle ( APF ). Thus, ( OA = OF ). 3. **Identical arguments for other vertices**: - Similarly, for triangles ( BRC ) and ( DQE ), we can argue the same symmetry: - In triangle ( BRC ), since ( BR = CR ), line segment ( RO ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ), and thus ( OB = OC ). - In triangle ( DQE ), since ( DQ = EQ ), line segment ( QO ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( DE ), and hence ( OD = OE ). 4. **Equal distances**: - Consequently, we have ( OA = OF = OB = OC = OD = OE ). This implies that ( O ) is equidistant from all six vertices of the hexagon. 5. **Conclusion - Circumcircle**: - Since all six vertices ( A, B, C, D, E, ) and ( F ) are equidistant from a common point ( O ), they must lie on the circumference of the same circle with center ( O ). Therefore, the points ( A, B, C, D, E, ) and ( F ) are concyclic, and we have shown that they lie on a single circle.

Therefore, the function g(x) is increasing on the interval (1, 4). As x approaches 1 from the right, g(x) approaches 1 - 4 + 2 = -1. As x approaches 4 from the left, g(x) approaches 4 - 1 + 2 = 5.

Here's a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Identifying Vertices and Edges**: - Each (10 times 20) cell is divided into 4 triangular sub-cells by joining the vertices through the center of the cell. This effectively increases the nodes in the net. - Each vertex and center of a cell is considered a node, leading to nodes also along the diagonal ropes. 2. **Calculating Vertices and Edges with Centers**: - In the original setup without center connections, each (10 times 20) grid has ( (10+1) times (20+1) = 11 times 21 ) vertices. - Each vertex of the grid is connected to its four neighbors forming diagonal and orthogonal connections thus containing more edges. 3. **Connection **: - By adding diagonal connections, we allow each of the ( 200 ( = 10 times 20 ) ) cells to each have 4 sub-triangles with each cell division ensuring all vertices and centers to be connected. 4. **Using Graph Theory (Euler's Formula for Plane Graphs)**: - Adding ( 10 times 20 = 200 ) additional vertices (one center for each cell) gives us ( 11 times 21 + 10 times 20 = 231 + 200 = 431 ) vertices. 5. **Counting Total Connectivity**: - Assuming without any constraint, the net is separated forming a bipartite arrangement visually confirming each such primary net (center splits). 6. **Maximum Edges to Cut Without Separation**: - The Bipartite nature here provides that each cut to resemble requiring the minimum cutset of kron which essentially ( min-cut ) calculations so, [ 2 times ( text{initial } 21 + 10 times cells/splitted - cells connecting once counted every vertex) ] 7. **Final Calculation**: - Subtracting any extra fully-connected arrangements leaves such dynamic equations ensures a satisfying: Thus the approachable calculation dictates: [ boxed{800} ] Thus confirming that 800 ropes can be cut without the net falling apart into separate pieces."},{"instruction":"sin 300^{circ}+cos 390^{circ}+tan (135^{circ})= () A: sqrt {3}1 B: 1 C: sqrt {3} D: sqrt {3}+1","output":"Solution: sin 300^{circ}+cos 390^{circ}+tan (-135^{circ})=sin (-60^{circ})+cos 30^{circ}+tan (180^{circ}-135^{circ}) =-sin 60^{circ}+cos 30^{circ}+tan 45^{circ}=- dfrac { sqrt {3}}{2}+ dfrac { sqrt {3}}{2}+1=1， Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{B}.

Summing these areas: [ S_{triangle KBL} + S_{triangle MDN} = frac{1}{4} S_{triangle ABC} + frac{1}{4} S_{triangle ADC} = frac{1}{4} (S_{triangle ABC} + S_{triangle ADC}) = frac{1}{4} S ] 3.

Similarly for ( CL ) in (triangle BCD): [ S_{triangle KAN} + S_{triangle MCL} = frac{1}{4} S_{triangle ABD} + frac{1}{4} S_{triangle BCD} = frac{1}{4} S ] 4.

We create sets A and B, such that initially A contains u and B contains everything else. - Whenever we disconnect an edge between a in A and b in B, we move b from B to A. - We claim that at any time, for all a in A, a cup S setminus {u} is k-friendly. - This is true at the beginning when the only thing in A is u. - Since all k-friendly sets remain k-friendly forever, the only thing we need to check is that when we move a new vertex to A, it works. - When we disconnect the edge between a and b, then a cup S setminus {u} remains k-friendly, but b becomes identical to a, so b cup S setminus {u} is also k-friendly. - As long as B is nonempty, we must eventually disconnect an edge between a in A and b in B, so the size of B keeps decreasing until all vertices have been moved to A. - This is impossible because moving a vertex in S setminus {u} to A means we disconnected an edge between a in A and a vertex in S setminus {u}, which is an edge inside a k-friendly set, contradiction. 5. **Conclusion:** - If we have a k-friendly set S (with k geq 2), we must eventually disconnect an edge inside some k-friendly set, which by Claim 1 means we will get a (k-1)-friendly set. - We start off by having an n-friendly set, the set of all vertices (the given condition means the graph is connected), so then we will eventually have a 1-friendly set, where one vertex is connected to everything. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=2cos ^{2}(x frac {π}{6}) sqrt {3}sin 2x+1, (I) Find the interval(s) where f(x) is monotonically increasing; (II) If f(x) geqslant log _{2}t holds true for all x in ( frac {π}{6}, frac {π}{2}), find the range of t.","output":"(I) First, we simplify the function f(x).

We know that cos(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval [-pi, 0].

However, since f(x) is a periodic function with a period of pi, we can add any integer multiple of pi to these boundaries to get all possible intervals where f(x) is monotonically increasing. Thus, the intervals where f(x) is monotonically increasing are [frac{kpi}{2} - frac{3pi}{4}, frac{kpi}{2} - frac{pi}{6}], where k is an integer.

Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) in this interval is attained at the right endpoint, x = frac {π}{2}. We have f(frac {π}{2}) = cos (pi + frac {π}{3})+2 = -1 + 2 = 1. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) in the interval ( frac {π}{6}, frac {π}{2}) is 1. On the other hand, the maximum value of f(x) in this interval is attained at the left endpoint, x = frac {π}{6}. We have f(frac {π}{6}) = cos (frac {π}{2} + frac {π}{3})+2 = 0 + 2 = 2. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) in the interval ( frac {π}{6}, frac {π}{2}) is 2.

On the other hand, since f(x) geqslant log _{2}t holds true for all x in ( frac {π}{6}, frac {π}{2}), and the minimum value of f(x) in this interval is 1, we must have log _{2}t geqslant 0, or t geqslant 1.

This means that up to the 16th inning, the batsman had scored a total of 16A runs. After scoring 87 runs in the 17th inning, his new average becomes A + 3. The total runs scored after 17 innings is the sum of the runs scored in the first 16 innings and the runs scored in the 17th inning, which is 16A + 87. The new average after 17 innings is the total runs scored divided by the number of innings, which is (16A + 87) / 17. Since we know the new average is A + 3, we can set up the equation: (16A + 87) / 17 = A + 3 Now, we solve for A: 16A + 87 = 17A + 51 (Multiplying both sides by 17 to get rid of the fraction) 87 - 51 = 17A - 16A (Subtracting 16A and 51 from both sides) 36 = A So, the average before the 17th inning was 36 runs.

Mathematically, we can write these conditions as: [ q = frac{D}{5} ] [ q = 7d ] 3. By equating the two expressions for ( q ), we get: [ frac{D}{5} = 7d ] 4. Rearranging this equation to solve for ( d ), we get: [ d = frac{D}{35} ] 5. From this, substituting back into the expression for ( q ), we get: [ q = 7 cdot frac{D}{35} = frac{7D}{35}=q ] 6.

First, let's find the speed of the train when it passes the signal pole. Since the train starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, we can use the following kinematic equation to find its speed (v) after 25 seconds (t): v = u + at where: u = initial velocity (0 m/s, since the train starts from rest) a = acceleration (2 m/s^2) t = time (25 seconds) v = 0 + (2 m/s^2 * 25 s) v = 50 m/s Now that we know the speed of the train when it passes the signal pole, we can calculate the distance it covers while passing the platform. The train takes 50 seconds to pass the platform, and during this time, it is still accelerating. We can use the following kinematic equation to find the distance (s) covered in 50 seconds: s = ut + (1/2)at^2 where: u = initial velocity (0 m/s) a = acceleration (2 m/s^2) t = time (50 seconds) s = (0 m/s * 50 s) + (1/2 * 2 m/s^2 * (50 s)^2) s = 0 + (1 * 50 * 50) s = 2500 m This distance (s) is the combined length of the train and the platform. Since we know the length of the train is 500 meters, we can find the length of the platform (L) by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: L = s - length of train L = 2500 m - 500 m L = 2000 m Therefore, the length of the platform is boxed{2000} meters."},{"instruction":"Given tan alpha=2 and tan (alphabeta)=frac{3}{5}, find tan beta.","output":"To solve, we use the identity tan beta=tan [alpha-(alpha-beta)]= frac{tan alpha-tan (alpha-beta)}{1+tan alpha tan (alpha -beta )}=-13.

We need to show that corresponding sides of these triangles (i.e., A_1B_1 and A_2B_2, B_1C_1 and B_2C_2, C_1A_1 and C_2A_2) meet at points that are collinear with the common centroid, and another way around. **Proof Step-by-Step:** 1. **Setup:** - Let G be the common centroid of triangles A_1B_1C_1 and A_2B_2C_2. - By definition, the centroid G is the intersection of the medians of each triangle. 2. **Parallel Line Assumption:** - Assume lines ( A_1A_2 parallel B_1B_2 parallel C_1C_2 ). 3. **Transformations and Centroid Property:** - We know that a transformation involving a homothety (similarity transformation) and/or translation preserves parallelism. - Since the centroids coincide and parallel medians imply that triangles A_1B_1C_1 and A_2B_2C_2 can be regarded as a single triangle undergoing an affine transformation. 4. **Application of Desargues' Theorem:** - Desargues’ theorem states if two triangles are in perspective axially, then they are in perspective centrally (and vice versa). - Considering that ( A_1A_2 parallel B_1B_2 parallel C_1C_2 ), by Desargues' theorem, intersections of corresponding sides (A_1B_1 with A_2B_2, B_1C_1 with B_2C_2, and C_1A_1 with C_2A_2) are collinear. 5. **Conclusion of the Forward Proof:** - The points of intersections of the corresponding sides of the triangles (namely, A_1B_1 with A_2B_2, B_1C_1 with B_2C_2, and C_1A_1 with C_2A_2) are collinear and lie on the axis of perspective. 6. **Reverse Theorem:** - Next, assume corresponding sides intersect at points on a line that also contains the centroid G. - If the intersections form a line, according to Desargues’ converse theorem, the two triangles are in perspective centrally. - This implies that the lines connecting corresponding vertices are concurrent or parallel, maintaining a common full intersection at point G or remain parallel beyond any specific transformations. Thus, both the direct and converse statements are established thanks to Desargues' theorem and properties of affine transformations. Conclusively, triangles A_1B_1C_1 and A_2B_2C_2 with the specified conditions result in: boxed{text{The points of corresponding side intersections are collinear with the common centroid.}}"},{"instruction":"Let E be an ellipse with foci A and B .

We shall analyze these assertions one by one: # Assertion 1: Both (A) and (B) contain a finite number of elements. 1. Suppose either (A) or (B) is infinite. 2. If either set is infinite, then set (C) would necessarily also be infinite because the sums (a + b) for (a in A, b in B) would be infinite combinations. 3. However, (C) is given as ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 2^{2828}}), which is a finite set. - Therefore, (A) and (B) must both be finite to ensure (C) remains finite. # Assertion 2: All elements of sets (A) and (B) are integers. 1. Consider (a_{text{max}} = (sqrt{2} + 1)^{2020} + (sqrt{2} - 1)^{2020}). 2. The value of ((sqrt{2} - 1)^{2020}) is extremely small because (0 < sqrt{2} - 1 < 1), and raising it to a large power makes it approach zero. 3. Use binomial expansion to explore the expression: [ (sqrt{2} + 1)^{2020} = sum_{k=0}^{2020} binom{2020}{k} (sqrt{2})^k 1^{2020-k} ] - Since ((sqrt{2} - 1)^{2020}) is close to zero, the sum ( (sqrt{2} + 1)^{2020} + (sqrt{2} - 1)^{2020} ) becomes very close to ( (sqrt{2} + 1)^{2020} ). 4. By examining the symmetry and properties of binomial coefficients, one can prove that the combination (a_{text{max}}) is actually an integer. 5. If (B) contained non-integers, the sums (a + b) with (a in A, b in B) would yield non-integers in (C).

Given the large nature of the numbers involved, [ a_{text{max}} approx 2^{2828} ] This approximation confirms: 4. Since (b + a_{text{max}} = 2^{2828}), the minimal (b) should be less than or equal to (2^{2828} - 2^{2525}). # Conclusion: By analyzing all the assertions: 1.

We'll proceed through several steps and cases to reach our conclusion. 1. **Basic Setup**: Consider an ( n )-gon with vertices labelled as ( V_1, V_2, ldots, V_n ). Let ( T ) be the set of triangles whose vertices are all distinct vertices of this ( n )-gon. Any pair of triangles in ( T ) must have either 0 or exactly 2 vertices in common. 2. **Case 1**: No pair of triangles share any common vertices. - In this situation, since there are no shared vertices, each triangle uses 3 of the ( n ) vertices. - Since each triangle needs 3 unique vertices and we have ( n ) vertices total, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is ( leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor ). - Since ( 3 ) is a positive integer, this means ( |T| leq frac{n}{3} ). Since (frac{n}{3}) is less than or equal to ( n ) for all natural numbers ( n > 2 ), our inequality holds. 3. **Case 2**: Pairs of triangles share exactly 2 common vertices. - Assume the set ( T ) contains at least two triangles that share vertices. Without loss of generality, let's denote these triangles as ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ABD ). - Any additional triangle in ( T ) must also follow the condition of sharing exactly 2 vertices. This means a new triangle will again share 2 vertices with ( triangle ABC ) or ( triangle ABD ). 4. **Exploring Connections**: - If we introduce a third triangle ( triangle ACD ), it shares vertices ( A ) and ( C ) with ( triangle ABC ), and ( A ) and ( D ) with ( triangle ABD ). - Suppose a fourth triangle has to connect vertices with existing triangles. Consider ( triangle BCD ), which shares vertices ( B ) and ( C ) with ( triangle ABC ), and ( B ) and ( D ) with ( triangle ABD ). 5. **General Extension**: - We consider that each time a new triangle is added, it must continue connecting through sharing two vertices with those already established. - This condition forces each new triangle to share vertices with the previous, creating links among the new vertices being added. 6. **Inductive Conclusions**: - If we start with ( n ) vertices and 0 or 2 shared vertices per triangle, we need to include these new triangles in such a way that it won't exceed ( n ). - Suppose by induction that any subset of ( k le n ) vertices can form at most ( k ) triangles. Adding another vertex extends this without breaking our rule. # Conclusion: By carefully extending and considering each case recursively, we easily see that no matter how additional triangles are added, they must respect the 0 or 2 vertices shared condition.

Denote the perpendicular distances from ( P ) to the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) as ( a_P ), ( b_P ), and ( c_P ) respectively.

In this case, the total length of the sides lying inside the circle is: [ 2sqrt{1 - a_P^2} + 2sqrt{1 - b_P^2} ] - Since ( a_P + b_P + c_P = frac{3}{2} ) and ( c_P > 1 ), it follows that ( a_P + b_P < frac{1}{2} ).

Hence, (C_1D_1 perp AB). 3. **Angle Analysis**: Observe that (angle AC_1D_1 = angle ABC). This is true because triangle (AC_1D_1) is congruent to triangle (ABC) (by construction, since (AC_1 = AB) and (C_1D_1 parallel BC), thus all corresponding angles are equal). 4. **Inequality Comparison**: Notice that (angle AC_1D_1 leq angle ACH_3). This is because (C_1D_1) is an external perpendicular dropped to (AB) from extended (AC), naturally resulting in (angle ACH_3) being potentially larger due to the placement of point (H_3) on the hypotenuse (AB). 5. **Symmetric Argument for Second Part**: Similarly, consider the angle (angle BCH_3). The angle (angle BCH_3 geq angle BAC) because point (H_3) divides the hypotenuse (AB) in such a manner that (C) remains the right angle and thus constrained mechanically by the structure of triangle geometry. 6. **Proof Conclusion**: - Since extending (C_1) with (angle AC_1D_1 = angle ABC) and noting that (angle AC_1D_1 leq angle ACH_3) reaffirm (angle ACH_3 geq angle ABC). - Similarly, (angle BCH_3 geq angle BAC) by symmetric argument and basic geometric constraint of triangle (ABC).

The diagonals of this parallelogram intersect at the rhombus's center (O) and bisect each other. 4. **Connection Strategy**: - To minimize the total road length while covering all connections between the oases, we focus on connecting (A') to (C'). This connection reduces redundancy caused by multiple crossings in the symmetric points. 5. **Cost Allocation Calculation**: - Residents at each oasis will travel to all other three oases exactly once. - Let's define the road segments as: [ AE = a, quad BE = b, quad EF = c ] Here, (A) travels over segments (AE), and similarly (B) travels over (BE) and so forth. 6. **Applying Geometric Relationships**: - Through symmetry and the fact that ((OA) is perpendicular to (A')), the triangles formed are similar. - Calculate the ratios: [ AE = 2 cdot EO = EF Rightarrow a = 2 cdot EO = c ] Likewise, [ BE = 2 cdot AE = 2a ] 7. **Summing Up Travel Distances**: - Sum each residents' travel distances: - Resident at (A): [ (4a + 2b + 2c) = 10a ] - Resident at (B): [ (2a + 4b + 2c) = 12a ] 8. **Proportional Cost Allocation**: - Given the above travel distances, the ratio of contributions between residents of (A) and (B) is: [ 10a : 12a = 5 : 6 Rightarrow text{(Note the contributions are proportional)} ] Since (A) and (C) share equal distances (by symmetry), and similarly for (B) and (D): [ text{Each of } A text{ and } C: frac{5}{22} = 22.7% ] [ text{Each of } B text{ and } D: frac{6}{22} = 27.3% ] # Conclusion: Thus, the fair cost allocation ratios for the construction of the road system among the oases are: boxed{22.7% text{ for each of } A text{ and } C, quad text{and} quad 27.3% text{ for each of } B text{ and } D}."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = |xm| (m>0), and g(x) = 2f(x) f(x+m), the minimum value of g(x) is 1.

Let's assume there are 100 members in the study group for simplicity (the actual number doesn't matter since we're dealing with percentages). 1. Probability of selecting a woman lawyer: - 50% of the members are women, so there are 50 women. - 30% of these women are lawyers, so there are 0.30 * 50 = 15 women lawyers. - The probability of selecting a woman lawyer is therefore 15/100 = 0.15 or 15%. 2. Probability of selecting a woman doctor: - 40% of the 50 women are doctors, so there are 0.40 * 50 = 20 women doctors. - The probability of selecting a woman doctor is therefore 20/100 = 0.20 or 20%. 3.

Each vertex is connected by 16 sides and diagonals. Because the polygon is convex, any three vertices chosen will always form a triangle. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** By the pigeonhole principle, in any coloring of the sides and diagonals of each vertex (which has 16 edges), there is at least one color that colors at least (leftlceil frac{16}{3} rightrceil = 6) edges with that color. Suppose without loss of generality that this color is red, and the vertex we're considering is (V). 3. **Identifying Color Patterns:** Let these six vertices connected to (V) by red edges be (A, B, C, D, E, F). We are now considering the subgraph induced by these 6 vertices. 4. **Examining Triangles in Subgraph:** If any of these vertices are connected to each other by a red edge, say (AB) is red, then (A, B,) and (V) form a red triangle, satisfying the problem's condition. This proves the statement directly if we find such a red edge among these vertices. 5. **Handling the Non-Red Case:** If none of the edges among (A, B, C, D, E, F) are red, all these edges must be colored by the other two remaining colors, say yellow and green. 6. **Applying Ramsey's Theorem:** Considering the (K_6) complete subgraph formed by these six vertices, Ramsey's theorem guarantees that any 2-coloring of the edges will contain at least one monochromatic triangle. Let's analyze the yellow triangles: - Among the 5 edges from (A) to the other vertices (B, C, D, E, F), by the pigeonhole principle, at least three must be the same color. Assume these are yellow edges (AB, AC,) and (AD). 7. **Identifying Monochromatic Triangles:** Now check the yellow edges connecting the vertices (B, C, D): - If any of (BC, BD,) or (CD) is yellow, then combined with (A), this forms the desired monochromatic (yellow) triangle, e.g., (ABC). - If none of (BC, BD, CD) is yellow, those edges must all be green, thus (BCD) forms a monochromatic green triangle. **Conclusion:** In all scenarios described above, there always exists a triangle with all sides of the same color, satisfying the condition of the problem. Thus, in any 3-coloring of the sides and diagonals of a convex 17-gon, there always exists a monochromatic triangle.

Also, let the center of the circumcircle (circumcenter) be (O). 2. **Express Side Length in Terms of Angles:** Consider the central angles subtended by the sides of the quadrilateral. Specifically, let (angle AOB), (angle BOC), (angle COD), and (angle DOA) be the angles subtended by the sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA), respectively, at the circumcenter (O). The length of each side of the quadrilateral can be related to these central angles using the sine function: [ AB = 2 cdot R cdot sinleft(frac{angle AOB}{2}right) = 2 sinleft(frac{angle AOB}{2}right) ] 3. **Sum of Central Angles:** Since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the sum of the central angles around the circumcenter (O) equals (360^circ) (or (2pi) radians): [ angle AOB + angle BOC + angle COD + angle DOA = 360^circ ] 4. **Range of the Halved Angles:** Let's denote the angles at the circumcenter by (theta_1 = frac{angle AOB}{2}), (theta_2 = frac{angle BOC}{2}), (theta_3 = frac{angle COD}{2}), and (theta_4 = frac{angle DOA}{2}). Since the sum of the central angles is (360^circ), the sum of the halved angles is: [ theta_1 + theta_2 + theta_3 + theta_4 = 180^circ ] 5. **Determine the Maximum Value Among the Halved Angles:** Among the four halved angles, at least one of them must be less than or equal to (frac{180^circ}{4} = 45^circ). Suppose this smallest angle is (theta_i). Therefore: [ theta_i leq 45^circ ] 6. **Evaluate the Shortest Side:** Because the sine function is increasing in the interval ([0^circ, 45^circ]), the value of (sinleft(theta_iright)) attains its maximum when (theta_i = 45^circ). Thus, the maximum possible length of the shortest side is, at most: [ 2 sin(45^circ) = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = sqrt{2} ] # Conclusion: Therefore, the shortest side of a cyclic quadrilateral with circumradius 1 is at most (sqrt{2}).

Can we arrange two copies of the elements of the group in a sequence (total length ( 2n )) so that each element is ( g ) or ( h ) times the previous element and the first element is ( g ) or ( h ) times the last?","output":": Consider the group ( G ) with ( n ) elements generated by the elements ( g ) and ( h ). We need to arrange two copies of these elements into a sequence of length ( 2n ) such that each element is either ( g ) or ( h ) times the previous element and the sequence is cyclic, meaning the first element is ( g ) or ( h ) times the last element. 1. **Model as a Directed Graph:** Regard the elements of ( G ) as vertices of a directed graph ( Gamma ). Draw a directed edge from vertex ( A ) to vertex ( B ) if ( B = gA ) or ( B = hA ). 2. **Vertex Degree Properties:** For each vertex ( A ) in ( Gamma ): - Incoming edges: ( A ) has incoming edges from ( g^{-1}A ) and ( h^{-1}A ). - Outgoing edges: ( A ) has outgoing edges to ( gA ) and ( hA ). Therefore, each vertex has exactly 2 incoming edges and 2 outgoing edges. 3. **Graph Connectedness:** Since ( g ) and ( h ) generate the group ( G ), the graph ( Gamma ) constructed is connected. 4. **Existence of an Eulerian Cycle:** By the **Eulerian Circuit Theorem**: A connected directed graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if the in-degree of each vertex equals its out-degree. Given our graph ( Gamma ), every vertex has an in-degree and out-degree of 2. Thus, ( Gamma ) has an Eulerian cycle. 5. **Constructing an Eulerian Cycle:** - Start at an arbitrary vertex ( P_1 ) and follow a directed edge to ( P_2 ). - Continue this process by traveling to successive vertices, where each step involves moving along an edge corresponding to multiplication by ( g ) or ( h ). - Eventually, since the graph is finite and connected, the path will return to the starting vertex, completing the cycle. 6. **Partition of Edges into Disjoint Cycles:** If there are any remaining edges after forming one cycle, they must form additional cycles due to the equal in-degree and out-degree of each vertex. Since the entire graph is connected, these cycles can be merged into a single Eulerian cycle at a shared vertex. 7. **Sequence Construction:** This Eulerian cycle will list all vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) such that ( A_{i+1} = gA_i ) or ( A_{i+1} = hA_i ) (with indices considered modulo ( n )). Each element of the cycle represents ( g ) or ( h ) times the previous element, and the sequence loops back to the start, fulfilling the initial condition. # Conclusion Thus, we can arrange two copies of the elements of the group ( G ) in a sequence of length ( 2n ) such that each element is ( g ) or ( h ) times the previous element, and the first element is ( g ) or ( h ) times the last element: [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given U is the universal set, and A, B, C are nonempty subsets of U.

Problem: Given the sequence of distinct natural numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, where no number in the sequence has 100 consecutive ones in its decimal representation. We need to prove that among the values of frac{a_n}{n}, there exist arbitrarily large numbers. # 1. **Declare the digit system:** We consider the numbers in a d-ary number system where ( d = 10^{100} ). This means that each \\"digit\\" in this system corresponds to a chunk of ( 100 ) decimal places. 2. **Characteristic of the sequence:** Given the problem's condition, the sequence comprises natural numbers expressed in decimal form without ( 100 ) consecutive ones. In ( d )-ary form, our number sequence does not contain the digit ( c = underbrace{11 ldots 1}_{100} ). 3. **Number of valid digits:** In the ( d )-ary number system, we need to count the digits that do not include the configuration ( c ). This implies ( d-1 ) valid digits per place because ( 11 ldots 1 ) is excluded from the ( 10^{100} ) possibilities. 4. **Mapping to the sequence:** According to our digit system, any number ( a_n ) will be expressed in a form that satisfies these constraints. Specifically, if we consider numbers up to ( k ) digits long in the ( d )-ary system, the number of such numbers is: [ (d-1)^k ] 5. **Lower bound on sequence:** We derive that, for sufficiently large indexes n, specifically less than or equal to ( (d-1)^k ), the value of a_n is bounded below by: [ a_n geq d^k ] 6. **Calculating the ratio:** Evaluate the ratio frac{a_n}{n}: [ frac{a_n}{n} geq frac{d^k}{(d-1)^k} ] Simplify this expression: [ frac{a_n}{n} geq left( frac{d}{d-1} right)^k ] 7. **Asymptotic behavior:** The fraction ( frac{d}{d-1} ) is slightly greater than ( 1 ). As ( k ) increases, ( left( frac{d}{d-1} right)^{k} ) increases without bound because of the exponential term. 8. **Conclusion:** Hence, for larger and larger ( k ), the expression ( frac{a_n}{n} ) can grow arbitrarily large. This proves that the ratio frac{a_n}{n} can become as large as we want, fulfilling the problem's requirement.

This can only happen if the positive numbers are exactly balanced out by the negative numbers (or if all the numbers are zero, but that's not the case we're interested in). To maximize the number of positive numbers, we would want to minimize the number of negative numbers. The smallest number of negative numbers we can have is one, because if we had zero negative numbers, the sum would not be zero (it would be positive). So, if we have one negative number, it must be the case that the sum of all the positive numbers is equal to the absolute value of that negative number. This means that we can have up to 29 positive numbers (since we have 30 numbers in total and one must be negative to balance out the positives).

The second derivative of f(x) is begin{align*} f''(x) & = frac{d^2}{dx^2}(ax^2 + x^2) & = frac{d}{dx}(2ax + 2x) & = 2a + 2. end{align*} Substitute a = -1 into the second derivative: begin{align*} f''(x) & = 2(-1) + 2 & = 0. end{align*} However, since the second derivative at x = -2 is equal to zero, it is inconclusive for determining whether x = -2 is a point of extreme value. In this specific case, the second derivative test fails to provide definitive information about the nature of the extremum.

Given that x = 2 + i is a root of f, we substitute this value into the function. 2. **Symmetry of coefficients and implications for roots:** The function f exhibits a symmetry in its coefficients, which implies that if x = r is a root, then x = frac{1}{r} is also a root. This is due to the relationship fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = frac{f(x)}{x^4} for all x neq 0. 3. **Finding the conjugate root:** Given x = 2 + i is a root, we find its conjugate root by calculating x = frac{1}{2 + i}. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get: frac{1}{2 + i} = frac{1}{2 + i} cdot frac{2 - i}{2 - i} = frac{2 - i}{5} = frac{2}{5} - frac{1}{5}i. 4. **Identifying all roots:** With the roots 2 pm i and frac{2}{5} pm frac{1}{5}i identified, we now have all four roots of f, considering the polynomial has real coefficients and thus the conjugates of its roots are also roots. 5. **Forming quadratic equations from the roots:** - For roots 2 pm i, the monic quadratic is (x - 2 - i)(x - 2 + i) = x^2 - 4x + 5. - For roots frac{2}{5} pm frac{1}{5}i, the monic quadratic is left(x - frac{2}{5} - frac{1}{5}iright)left(x - frac{2}{5} + frac{1}{5}iright) = x^2 - frac{4}{5}x + frac{1}{5}. 6. **Multiplying the quadratic equations:** Multiplying these quadratic equations to form f(x), we get: f(x) = aleft(x^2 - 4x + 5right)left(x^2 - frac{4}{5}x + frac{1}{5}right) = aleft(x^4 - frac{24}{5}x^3 + frac{42}{5}x^2 - frac{24}{5}x + 1right). 7. **Determining the coefficients a, b, c:** From the expanded form of f(x), we see that the coefficients a, b, c are in the ratio 1 : -frac{24}{5} : frac{42}{5}.

Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 12 km/hr × 2/15 hours = 24/15 km = 8/5 km Since 1 km = 1000 meters, the distance in meters is: Distance = (8/5) × 1000 meters = 1600 meters This distance is the perimeter of the park, which is the sum of all four sides of the rectangle. Let the length be L meters and the breadth be B meters. According to the given ratio, L:B = 1:3, so we can say L = x and B = 3x, where x is a common multiplier. Perimeter = 2(L + B) 1600 meters = 2(x + 3x) 1600 meters = 2(4x) 1600 meters = 8x Now, we solve for x: x = 1600 meters / 8 x = 200 meters Now we have the length and the breadth: L = x = 200 meters B = 3x = 3 × 200 meters = 600 meters The area of the park (A) is given by the formula A = L × B: A = 200 meters × 600 meters = 120000 square meters Therefore, the area of the park is boxed{120000} square meters."},{"instruction":"The axis of symmetry of the graph of the quadratic function y=x^{2}4x+3 is the line ______.","output":"To find the axis of symmetry of the graph of the quadratic function y = x^2 - 4x + 3, we can complete the square to rewrite the equation in vertex form.

Since the value of y is the same for x=-1 and x=3, and it changes from y=0 at x=0 to y=n at x=1 and then to y=m at x=2, before returning to y=4 at x=3, we can infer that the vertex of the parabola is at x=1. This is because the parabola is symmetric about its vertex, and the given values suggest that the vertex lies between x=0 and x=2. 2. The points where the parabola intersects the x-axis, known as the roots of the quadratic equation, are given as (0,0) and (2,0). This means the parabola touches the x-axis at these points, indicating that the values of y are 0 at x=0 and x=2. 3. Given that the parabola has a vertex at x=1 and it intersects the x-axis at x=0 and x=2, and considering the nature of quadratic functions, we can conclude that the parabola opens upwards.

For a parabola that opens upwards, the values of y will be less than 0 (negative) between the roots of the quadratic equation.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to x + y + z = n is given by the combination formula: [ u_{n} = binom{n+2}{2} = frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}. ] 4. **Returning to the Original Problem \\"Two Jokers Problem\\"**: For n in {1, 2, cdots, 2004}, let a_{n} represent the number of card sets with a total score of n. - **Case 1: No Jokers in the Set**: These sets are equivalent to those in the \\"three jokers problem\\" with a score sum of 2k. If we halve the score of each card, we get the number of such sets as u_{k}. - **Case 2: Contains Both Jokers**: Removing the two jokers from these sets transforms them into the \\"three jokers problem\\" sets with a score sum of 2k-2. Hence, the number of such sets is u_{k-1}. Combining these, we get: [ a_{2k} = u_{k} + u_{k-1} = frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} + frac{k(k+1)}{2} = (k+1)^2, quad k = 1, 2, cdots, 1002. ] 5. **Finding the Number of \\"Good Card Sets\\"**: For k = 1002, since 2k = 2004, [ a_{2004} = 1003^2 = 1006009. ] Thus, the number of \\"good card sets\\" with a total score of 2004 is: [ boxed{1006009} ]"},{"instruction":"What is the sum of the first 23 natural numbers (starting from 1)?","output":"The sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2 For the first 23 natural numbers, we can plug in n = 23 into the formula: Sum = 23 * (23 + 1) / 2 Sum = 23 * 24 / 2 Sum = 552 / 2 Sum = 276 Therefore, the sum of the first 23 natural numbers is boxed{276} ."},{"instruction":"A store ordered 300 more than twice as many pens as it did pencils at 5 each.

Begin by noting that point E = left(frac{19}{2}, frac{15}{2}right) is the center of the parallelogram OABC. Hence, point E must be the midpoint of the diagonals OB and AC. 2. The coordinates of point O are (0,0), and we will denote the coordinates of points A, B, and C as (x_a, y_a), (x_b, y_b), and (x_c, y_c), respectively. 3. Since E is the midpoint of OB, the coordinates of point B can be directly found using the midpoint formula: [ E = left(frac{0 + x_b}{2}, frac{0 + y_b}{2}right) = left(frac{19}{2}, frac{15}{2}right) ] From which, we deduce: [ x_b = 19, quad y_b = 15 ] Thus, the coordinates of point B are (19, 15). 4. Next, since E is also the midpoint of AC, we use the midpoint formula again: [ E = left(frac{x_a + x_c}{2}, frac{y_a + y_c}{2}right) = left(frac{19}{2}, frac{15}{2}right) ] From which, we obtain two equations: [ frac{x_a + x_c}{2} = frac{19}{2} implies x_a + x_c = 19 ] [ frac{y_a + y_c}{2} = frac{15}{2} implies y_a + y_c = 15 ] 5. We need to find all pairs of natural numbers (x_a, x_c) such that x_a + x_c = 19.

The valid pairs are: [ (1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), ldots, (14, 1) ] This yields 14 possible pairs for (y_a, y_c). 7. Since the choices for (x_a, x_c) and (y_a, y_c) are independent, the total number of valid (A, C) pairs is the product of the numbers of choices: [ 18 times 14 = 252 ] 8.

Let's solve the system: - h + p + x + a + b + c + x = 24 - h + a + b + x = 15 - p + a + c + x = 10 - 2x + b + c = 14 We need another equation or method to isolate x.

This transformation is crucial for simplifying the given conditions and understanding the behavior of the function f(x) under the given constraints. 1. **Defining a New Function:** Let's define g(x) = x^2f(x), where x > 0. This step is essential for simplifying the given inequality and making the problem more manageable. 2. **Finding the Derivative of g(x):** To understand how g(x) behaves, we calculate its derivative: [ g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^2f(x)) = x^2f'(x) + 2xf(x). ] This step involves applying the product rule for differentiation. 3. **Simplifying g'(x):** We can further simplify g'(x) by incorporating the given condition f'(x) + frac{2}{x}f(x) > 0: [ g'(x) = x^2left(f'(x) + frac{2}{x}f(x)right) > 0. ] This step shows that g(x) is an increasing function on the interval (0, +infty) because its derivative is positive. 4. **Analyzing the Given Inequality:** The given inequality is frac{(x+1)f(x+1)}{4} < frac{f(2)}{x+1}.

If B alone can do the work in 12 days, then B's work done per day is 1/12 of the work. Now, let's calculate the work done per day by A, B, and C together before C's speed doubles. A's work done per day = 3 * (1/12) = 1/4 of the work B's work done per day = 1/12 of the work C's work done per day = 1.5 * (1/12) = 1/8 of the work Total work done per day by A, B, and C together before C's speed doubles = (1/4) + (1/12) + (1/8) = (3/12) + (1/12) + (1.5/12) = 5.5/12 of the work For the first 4 days, they will complete 4 * (5.5/12) = 22/12 = 11/6 of the work.

Now, we are given that m is also divisible by a positive integer a and leaves a remainder b. This means: m = aq + b where q is some positive integer. Since m is the same in both equations, we can equate them: 720k + 83 = aq + b We want to find the largest possible value of a * b. To maximize a * b, we need to maximize both a and b. However, since b is a remainder when m is divided by a, it must be less than a. Therefore, the largest possible value for b is a - 1. Now, let's substitute b = a - 1 into the equation: 720k + 83 = aq + (a - 1) 720k + 83 = aq + a - 1 720k + 83 = a(q + 1) - 1 Now, we want to find the largest possible value of a such that a(q + 1) - 1 is equal to 720k + 83. Since a is a divisor of m, a must also be a divisor of 720. The largest divisor of 720 is 720 itself. However, if we choose a = 720, then b would be 719, which is not possible because the remainder when m is divided by 720 is 83, not 719. Therefore, we need to find the largest divisor of 720 that is less than or equal to 83. The divisors of 720 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 48, 60, 72, 80, 90, 120, 144, 180, 240, 360, and 720. The largest divisor of 720 that is less than or equal to 83 is 72. So, we choose a = 72. Then b = a - 1 = 71. Now, let's check if this satisfies the equation: 720k + 83 = 72q + 71 We need to find a value of k such that the left side minus 83 is divisible by 72. Since 720 is a multiple of 72, any value of k will satisfy this condition.

Recall that ((a, n) = 1) implies (a) and (n) are coprime. This means that for (b) chosen as any integer, ({b, a + b, 2a + b, ldots, (n-1)a + b}) forms a complete residue system modulo (n). 2.

First, we note that each vertex S of the polygon can be colored in m ways. However, for the vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n directly attached to S, none of these can be the same color as S. Therefore: - We use m-1 colors for vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n. 2. We let a_n represent the number of valid colorings of the vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n such that adjacent vertices are colored differently. Additionally, we ensure that A_n is different from A_1. 3. For n = 3, the number of valid colorings is: [ a_3 = (m-1)(m-2)(m-3) ] 4. For n > 3, we derive the recurrence relation for a_n. Consider the steps: - Vertex A_1 can be colored in m-1 ways. - Vertex A_2 can then be colored in m-2 ways, as it should differ from A_1. - Similarly, each subsequent vertex A_i for i = 2, ldots, n-1 can be colored in m-2 ways, as each must differ from its predecessor. - Finally, A_n needs to be different from A_{n-1}. If A_n only needs to differ from A_{n-1} and not A_1, it can be colored in (m-2) ways. Thus, the total number of ways to color the vertices such that A_n and A_1 may or may not match is: [ (m-1)(m-2)^{n-1} ] 5. The total number of colorings in (m-1)(m-2)^{n-1} can be divided into two types: - Type 1: Colorings where A_n differs from A_1. The number of such colorings is a_n. - Type 2: Colorings where A_n matches A_1. For these invalid configurations, if we merge A_n and A_1 into a single vertex, we obtain valid colorings of an n-1 vertex figure. This situation occurs, hence there are a_{n-1} colorings. Therefore, we get the relation: [ a_n + a_{n-1} = (m-1)(m-2)^{n-1} ] 6. Rearranging this, we obtain: [ a_n = (m-1)(m-2)^{n-1} - a_{n-1} ] 7. Using the relations above, express a_n recursively: [ a_n - (m-2)^n = -(a_{n-1} - (m-2)^{n-1}) = (-1)^2(a_{n-2} - (m-2)^{n-2}) = cdots = (-1)^{n-3}(a_3 - (m-2)^3) ] 8. Substituting a_3 in the equation: [ a_n - (m-2)^n = (-1)^{n-3}((m-1)(m-2)(m-3) - (m-2)^3) ] Simplifying the terms inside the parenthesis: [ (m-2)^3 = (m-2)(m-2)(m-2) ] [ a_n - (m-2)^n = (-1)^{n-3}((m-1)(m-2)(m-3) - (m-2)^3) ] Simplify the right-hand side: [ (m-1)(m-2)(m-3) - (m-2)^3 implies (m-1)(m-2)(m-3) - (m-2)(m-2)(m-2) ] 9. Therefore, [ a_n - (m-2)^n = (-1)^{n-3}[-(m-2)] = (-1)^{n-2}(m-2) = (-1)^n(m-2) ] 10. Solving for a_n, we get: [ a_n = (m-2)((m-2)^{n-1} + (-1)^n) ] 11.

What is the smallest possible chromatic index of a tournament?","output":"1. **Definition of Chromatic Number (k):** - Let ( k ) be the unique integer such that ( 2^{k-1} < n leq 2^k ). - This means (k) is the smallest integer such that (n) does not exceed (2^k), establishing ( k ) as a boundary in terms of the size of ( n ). 2. **Vertex Numbering and Edge Directions:** - Assume the vertices of the graph are numbered from ( 0 ) to ( n-1 ). - Edges are oriented such that they always point towards the vertex with the smaller number. 3. **Coloring Scheme:** - Use colors ( 1 leq i leq k ) for the edges. - For an edge between vertices numbered ( a ) and ( b ), color it with color ( i ) if the most significant differing bit (when ( a ) and ( b ) are written in binary) is at position ( k-i ). - This ensures that edges differing at the highest significant bit receive different colors, achieving a proper edge coloring. 4. **Verification of Proper Coloring:** - To prove this coloring is proper, consider any trio of vertices ( a, b, c ). - Assume edge ( a to b ) (directed towards ( b )) and ( b to c ) (directed towards ( c )). - By our coloring rule, the edges ( a to b ) and ( b to c ) will have distinct colors as they differ by at least one significant bit position in their vertex number binary representation. - Therefore, no two consecutive edges in any directed path will share the same color. 5. **Color Count Analysis:** - Now demonstrate that no complete directed graph of ( n ) vertices can be colored with fewer than ( k ) colors. - Suppose, for contradiction, we use ( k-1 ) colors. - Define ( A_i ) as the set of vertices that are endpoints of edges colored ( i ), and ( B_i ) as the set of vertices not in ( A_i ). - For any pair of vertices ( x ) and ( y ), there must be at least one color ( i ) such that ( x in A_i ) and ( y in B_i ) or vice versa. - This implies every vertex is uniquely described by the set of colors where it appears in ( A_i ), giving at most ( 2^{k-1} ) vertices (since each vertex can be uniquely identified by being in (A_i) or (B_i) for each color (i)). 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** - We established that (n > 2^{k-1}), meaning there are more than (2^{k-1}) vertices. - This contradicts the assumption that (k-1) colors suffice since there exist more vertices than can be uniquely identified with (k-1) colors in binary representation. Thus, the smallest edge chromatic number for a directed complete graph (tournament) with ( n ) vertices is indeed ( k ).

This suggests a carry over since 2 + 6 = 8, and in base b, 8 can be written as 10_b (suggesting b > 8). - Tens place: Counting the carry over, we have 7_b + 5_b + 1 (carry) = 4_b (as the tens digit in 340_b is 4). Analyzing this, 7 + 5 + 1 = 13. In any base b, 13_b should be interpreted as 13, and thus in order for this sum to equal 4_b, 13 - 4 = 9 must be divisible by b, suggesting b = 9.

Next, some of the numbers are replaced by zeros. Prove that it is possible to choose some of the rows of the board (It could be a row only) so that in the chosen rows, is fulfilled that the sum of the numbers in each column is zero. [Spanish version](http://www.mathlinks.ro/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=88511) text{LaTeX}{} ed by carlosbr","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have a board with (2^n) rows and (n) columns. Each cell in the board initially contains either 1 or -1, and each row represents a unique sequence of length (n) formed from ({1, -1}). Some of these numbers are then replaced by zeros. We need to prove that it is possible to choose some rows such that the sum of the numbers in each column of the chosen rows is zero. 2. **Binary Representation:** Consider each row as a binary sequence of length (n), where each element is either 1 or -1. After some elements are replaced by zeros, we call these rows \\"h4xx0red rows.\\" 3. **Lemma:** For every binary row (b = (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n)), we can find a h4xx0red row (p = (p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n)) such that (b + p) (element-wise addition) results in another binary row. This (p) can be chosen injectively as a function of (b). **Proof of Lemma:** - Let (o = (o_1, o_2, ldots, o_n)) be an original row where (o_k = 1) if (b_k = 0) and (o_k = -1) if (b_k = 1). - If (o_k) was changed to 0, then (p_k + b_k in {0, 1}) holds true. - This choice of (p) is injective because no two different binary rows force us to choose the same h4xx0red row. 4. **Construction:** - Start with the binary row (0 = (0, 0, ldots, 0)). - Add h4xx0red rows as described in the lemma, ensuring that each addition results in another binary row. - Continue this process until a binary row is repeated (since there are only (2^n) possible binary rows, this must happen eventually). 5. **Cycle and Sum:** - When a binary row is repeated, the sum of the h4xx0red rows added between the first and second occurrence of this row must be zero. - This is because the addition of these rows resulted in the same binary row, implying that their sum is zero. 6. **Uniqueness of h4xx0red Rows:** - No h4xx0red row is added twice. If a h4xx0red row were added twice, say to binary rows (b) and (c), then by injectivity (b = c). - This would contradict the construction process, which stops when a binary row is repeated. Thus, we have shown that it is possible to choose some rows such that the sum of the numbers in each column is zero.

The median being 5 suggests the third and fourth values in this ordered set fall around 5. With the mode being 4 and unique, there must be at least two 4s; given they are not in the middle, they are likely among the smaller integers along with potentially one integer smaller than 4 or another 4. This setup helps ensure the median remains around 5. Now, calculating the possible sets: 1. If we have two 4s, since they are less than the median but the median is 5, the two numbers have to be smaller or equal to 5. Assuming the numbers smaller than the median are 4 and 4. This leads to two 5s or a 5 and another number greater than 5 but not exceeding the overall average dramatically. 2. Checking sums: - Possibility: {4, 4, 5, 5, x, y}. Solving 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + x + y = 33. Then x + y = 15. If we pick x = 6, then y = 9 which is close. - Set becomes: {4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9}; sort after adding 9: {4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9, 9}. 3.

Now consider the supplementary angle given by (angle AFO): - Since (angle AMB) is determined by the intersection of chords (AC) and (BD), the sum of the angles around point (M) will be: angle AMB + angle AFO = 180^circ - Thus, the angle (theta) at (AFO) is given as: theta = 180^circ - angle AMB 6. **Role of Motion of Points (B) and (D):** - As points (B) and (D) move along arcs (AC) and (CA), the location of (F) would evolve accordingly. - When points (B) and (D) approach (C), (F) tends to move towards the center (O). 7. **Critical Analysis at Limits:** - As (D) approaches (A) and (B) moves towards some point (B') on arc (CA), such that (CB' = CA). Consequently: - (F) moves towards the midpoint of chord (AB'), say (G). - Therefore, the locus of (F) as (B) and (D) move, forms a circular path around (GO), maintaining the constant angle (theta). 8. **Conclusion:** The locus of the circumcenter (F) of triangle (triangle ABM) is the arc of the circle centered at (G) (midpoint of chord (AB') passing through (O) (center of the given circle), and making a fixed angle (theta) with the line segment (GO).

Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speeds add up. Let's denote the speed of the first train as ( V_1 ) (in km/h) and the speed of the second train as ( V_2 ) (in km/h). We know that ( V_2 = 50 ) km/h. When the two trains pass each other, they cover a distance equal to the sum of their lengths. Since each train is 190 m long, the total distance covered is ( 190 m + 190 m = 380 m ). We need to convert this distance to kilometers to match the units of speed (km/h). There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so the distance in kilometers is ( 380 m times frac{1 km}{1000 m} = 0.38 ) km. The time it takes for them to pass each other is given as 11.895652173913044 seconds.

Now, we can use the formula for relative speed: ( Relative , Speed = frac{Total , Distance}{Time} ) Substituting the given values, we get: ( V_1 + V_2 = frac{0.38 , km}{0.003304903381642512 , hours} ) ( V_1 + 50 , km/h = frac{0.38}{0.003304903381642512} ) ( V_1 + 50 , km/h = 114.94252873563218 , km/h ) Now, we solve for ( V_1 ): ( V_1 = 114.94252873563218 , km/h - 50 , km/h ) ( V_1 = 64.94252873563218 , km/h ) Therefore, the speed of the first train is approximately boxed{64.94} km/h."},{"instruction":"A cube is divided into 27 unit cubes.

The equation of the tangent line at (1, f(1)) is given by y - f(1) = f'(1)(x - 1), which simplifies to y + 1 = -(x - 1). Rearranging gives y = -x.

According to the information given: - 76% of the employees are women, so the number of women is 0.76E. - 60% of the employees are married, so the number of married employees is 0.60E. - 68.42% of the women are married, so the number of married women is 0.6842 * 0.76E. Now, let's calculate the number of married women: Married Women = 0.6842 * 0.76E = 0.520392E Since 60% of the employees are married, and we know the number of married women, we can find the number of married men by subtracting the number of married women from the total number of married employees: Married Men = Total Married - Married Women Married Men = 0.60E - 0.520392E Married Men = 0.079608E Now, since 76% of the employees are women, the remaining 24% must be men: Men = 0.24E To find the fraction of men who are single, we need to subtract the married men from the total number of men and then divide by the total number of men: Single Men = Men - Married Men Single Men = 0.24E - 0.079608E Single Men = 0.160392E Fraction of Single Men = Single Men / Men Fraction of Single Men = 0.160392E / 0.24E Fraction of Single Men = 0.160392 / 0.24 Fraction of Single Men ≈ 0.6683 Therefore, approximately boxed{66.83%} of the men are single."},{"instruction":"A long, light cylinder has an elliptical crosssection with semiaxes (a > b). It lies on the ground with its main axis horizontal and the major axes horizontal. A thin heavy wire of the same length as the cylinder is attached to the line along the top of the cylinder. For what values of (b/a) is the cylinder in stable equilibrium?","output":"1. Consider the geometry of the elliptical cross-section cylinder, which is described by the equation: [ frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ] Here, the major semi-axis is (a) along the (x)-axis and the minor semi-axis is (b) along the (y)-axis. The ellipse lies with its major axis horizontal. 2. We are interested in the stability of the cylinder. To analyze this, we need to study the contact point with the ground, which occurs along the line: [ y = 0, quad z = -b ] The thin wire is attached at the top of the cylinder at: [ y = 0, quad z = b ] so the wire exerts a downward force at the top. 3. For the cylinder to be in stable equilibrium, the normal at any point close to ((0, -b)) (the bottommost point of the cylinder) must intersect the (y)-axis above the topmost point ((0, b)). This ensures that the resultant force due to the wire’s weight acts in a direction that stabilizes the cylinder. 4. Examine the point on the ellipse near ((0, -b)), parameterizing it as ((a cos t, b sin t)) for a small parameter (t) around (pi). For now, consider small ( t ): [ cos t approx pi, quad sin t approx -(1 - epsilon), text{ where } 0 < epsilon ll 1 ] 5. Compute the gradient (slope) of the tangent to the ellipse at ((a cos t, b sin t)): [ text{Gradient of tangent} = frac{dy}{dx} = -frac{b^2 cos t}{a^2 sin t} approx -frac{b}{a cot t} ] 6. The slope of the normal at this point is the negative reciprocal of the tangent gradient: [ text{Slope of normal} = frac{a}{b tan t} ] 7. Formulate the equation of the normal at point ((a cos t, b sin t)): [ y - b sin t = frac{a}{b tan t} left( x - a cos t right) ] 8. Find the (y)-intercept by setting (x = 0): [ y_{text{intercept}} = b sin t - frac{a^2 sin t}{b} ] 9. Near the bottom point, where (sin t approx -(1 - epsilon)): [ y_{text{intercept}} approx -b(1 - epsilon) - frac{a^2 (1 - epsilon)}{b} approx -b - frac{a^2 - epsilon a^2}{b} ] For a small (epsilon), we approximate the intercept simplifying to: [ y_{text{intercept}} approx -b + bleft(frac{a^2}{b^2}right) = frac{a^2}{b} - b ] 10. For the equilibrium to be stable, this intercept should be greater than (b) (the height of the topmost point of the cylinder): [ frac{a^2}{b} - b > b ] Simplifying gives: [ frac{a^2}{b} > 2b implies a > b sqrt{2} ] # Conclusion: The cylinder is in stable equilibrium for values of ( frac{b}{a} ) such that: [ boxed{frac{b}{a} < frac{1}{sqrt{2}}} ]"},{"instruction":"The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were preparing for a train ride with three carriages.

A monomial is defined as an algebraic expression with only one term. Therefore, since x+2 has two terms, it is not a monomial but a binomial. Hence, option A does not meet the requirements. - **Option B**: The expression frac{x}{4} represents a term where x is a variable and 4 is a constant. Since the term includes a variable, it cannot be considered a constant term. A constant term would not include any variables. Therefore, option B does not meet the requirements. - **Option C**: The expression frac{y-1}{2} can be seen as a fraction where the numerator y-1 is a binomial (since it consists of two terms, y and -1) and the denominator is 2. This makes the expression a polynomial, not a monomial, because a monomial consists of a single term. Therefore, option C does not meet the requirements. - **Option D**: The expression frac{xy}{2} is a single term that includes a product of variables x and y divided by a constant 2.

Let h(x) = g'(x), then h'(x) = e^{x} - sin x - frac{2}{(x+1)^3}. 5. For x in (-1,0), h'(x) < 0, so h(x) is decreasing. Since h(0) = 3 - 2a, for a leq frac{3}{2}, h(x) geq 0, making g(x) increasing. Thus, g(x) < g(0) = 0, and f(x) is decreasing in (-1,0), meaning there is no extremum point in this interval. 6. For a > frac{3}{2}, g'(x) is decreasing in (-1,0), and g'(0) = 3 - 2a < 0. Also, g'(-1+sqrt{frac{1}{2a}}) > 0. Therefore, there exists x_0 in (-1,0) such that g'(x_0) = 0. This implies f(x) has a local minimum at some m in (-1,0). 7. Let t(x) = h'(x). Since t'(x) = e^{x} - cos x + frac{6}{(x+1)^4} > 0, h'(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty). Also, h'(0) < 0 and h'(1) > 0, so there exists x_1 in (0,1) such that h'(x_1) = 0.

This observation arises because a polygonal chain with ( n leq 8 ) can't meet the given condition. 3. **Proof Structure:** Let's prove that any non-self-intersecting closed polygonal chain with an odd number of segments not exceeding ( 13 ) always has a line containing exactly one segment of the chain. 4. **Assumption for Contradiction:** Assume there exists a polygonal chain such that no line contains exactly one segment. This implies that at least one of the lines must contain at least three segments of the chain. 5. **Line Containing Three Segments:** 5.1. These three segments have six endpoints. 5.2. Each endpoint is connected to a segment of the chain. 5.3. This implies there are at least six new segments connected to the endpoints, since no two segments lie on the same line. 6. **Counting and Contradiction:** - Each line containing one of these new segments should also contain at least one other segment. - Thus, we consider that there are ( 9 ) previously considered segments plus at least ( 6 ) more new segments: a total of at least ( 15 ) segments. - Therefore, this leads to a contradiction when the total number of segments is less than ( 15 ). 7. **Even ( n ):** For even ( n geq 10 ), it is a known that such polygonal chains exist (for instance, a ( frac{n}{2} )-star polygon).

We need to show that ( BLDN ) is a parallelogram. Since ( triangle LED cong triangle EBN ), it follows that ( BLDN ) is a parallelogram. 5. **Proof of Concurrency**: - If ( LE ), ( DH ), and ( BC ) are concurrent, then ( EC = EO ). - Let ( D, H, N ) be collinear. In ( triangle ENC ), ( angle ENC = angle LHE = 90^circ ). Therefore, ( angle ECN = angle ELH = angle ELB = angle EOC ), which implies ( EO = EC ). 6. **Proof of the Converse**: - If ( EO = EC ), then ( DH ), ( LE ), and ( BC ) are concurrent. - Let ( EO = EC ) and ( DN ) intersect ( EC ) at ( H' ). Then ( angle ECN = angle EON = angle ELB = angle ENH' ). In ( triangle ENC ), ( angle ENH' = angle ECN ) and ( angle ENC = 90^circ ), so ( angle EH'N = 90^circ ), which implies ( H' = H ).

To find the LCM, we need to express all times in terms of the smallest unit, which is 1/3 minute in this case: Time for a = 2 minutes = 6/3 minutes Time for b = 4/3 minutes Time for c = 1 minute = 3/3 minutes The LCM of 6/3, 4/3, and 3/3 is 12/3 minutes, which is 4 minutes.

Second Method: Consider the symmetry implied by the functional equations. The first equation implies that points (x+2, f(x+2)) and (2-x, f(2-x)) are symmetric with respect to the line x=2. Thus, the line x=2 is an axis of symmetry. Similarly, the second equation implies that points (x+7, f(x+7)) and (7-x, f(7-x)) are symmetric with respect to the line x=7. Thus, the line x=7 is another axis of symmetry. Given these two lines of symmetry: - x=2 - x=7 The composition of these symmetries can be viewed as a translation. Specifically, the distance between x=2 and x=7 is 5 units. Symmetry about x=2 followed by symmetry about x=7 corresponds to a combined transformation that results in a translation by 2 times 5 = 10 units.

Let ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) be the number of representatives from countries ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ), respectively. According to the problem: [ a = 2b, quad a = 3c, quad a = 4d ] 2. Recognizing that ( a ) must be a multiple of 2, 3, and 4, we deduce: [ a = 12k ] where ( k ) is some positive integer, thus: [ b = frac{a}{2} = 6k, quad c = frac{a}{3} = 4k, quad d = frac{a}{4} = 3k ] 3. The total number of representatives is: [ a + b + c + d = 12k + 6k + 4k + 3k = 25k ] 4. Let ( M ) be the number of tables and ( P ) the number of representatives per table. Hence: [ M cdot P = 25k ] 5. Let ( a_i ) represent the number of representatives from country ( A ) at the ( i )-th table.

Summing up all ( M ) tables, we get: [ 2a = 2(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_M) leq M(P - 1) ] Substituting ( a = 12k ): [ 24k leq M(P - 1) ] 7. We also have: [ 25k = MP ] Combining these inequalities, we can deduce: [ 24k leq frac{25k(P-1)}{P} ] Simplifying: [ 24 leq frac{25(P-1)}{P} ] 8. Solving for ( P ): [ 24P leq 25(P - 1) implies 24P leq 25P - 25 implies 24P - 25P leq -25 implies -P leq -25 implies P geq 25 ] 9. We must show it is possible to have ( P = 25 ). Consider one table with: - ( 12 ) representatives from country ( A ) - ( 6 ) representatives from country ( B ) - ( 4 ) representatives from country ( C ) - ( 3 ) representatives from country ( D ) In this setup, each representative’s condition is satisfied as follows: 10. For country ( A ): [ 12 < 6 + 4 + 3 quad text{or} quad 12 < 13 ] 11. For country ( B ): [ 6 < 12 + 4 + 3 quad text{or} quad 6 < 19 ] 12.

Different combinations are possible, but the assistant will determine the state of each triplet: - More heads than tails - More tails than heads - Without loss of generality, let's assume each triplet state as predominantly heads or tails. 5. **Step 5: The Assistant Covers All But Five Coins Strategically** - Let’s say out of the nine triplets, five have more heads than tails (arbitrary choice, it could be tails as well). The assistant will then leave one coin uncovered from each of these five triplets which predominantly show heads. - Example configuration where heads dominate: - ( {H, H, T} ) - covering any of (H,H) - ( {H, T, H} ) - covering any of (H,H) - and so on for five triplets. 6. **Step 6: The Determined Communication** - The trick lies in how the assistant decides which specific coin in each triplet to leave uncovered: - Define a rule. For instance, if the leftmost two coins in a triplet are heads, the assistant uncovers the left coin. This specific pattern will inform the magician about the positioning of heads within that triplet. - Possible rules for assistant: - Two leftmost heads: uncover the leftmost coin. - Two rightmost heads: uncover the middle coin. - Left and right heads: uncover the rightmost coin. - These rules allow the magician to infer the specific hidden heads coins in the other triplets based on the position of the uncovered coin. 7. **Step 7: The Magician’s Task** - When the magician enters, he sees the five uncovered coins and remembers the agreed pattern. - With the predetermined pattern, the magician deciphers the exact combination of heads positions in each triplet and thus guesses correctly which other five coins (still covered) will show heads. # Conclusion This combination and hidden message deciphering complete the focus trick successfully. The communication strategy of placement and the position patterns allow the magician to identify the correct state of the coins. The implementation assures that the magician can deduce without any further cues. The exact patterns need to be practiced and perfected.

For ( n geq 2 ), we need to show that ( (9 + 4 sqrt{5})^n ) produces solutions to the equation of the form ( p + q sqrt{5} ) such that ( p geq 0 ) and ( q geq 0 ). 3. By induction and properties of binomial expansion or direct multiplication, every power of ((9 + 4 sqrt{5})) can be expressed in the form ( p + q sqrt{5} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are non-negative integers (Task 176). 4.

Since ( (9 + 4 sqrt{5})^0 = 1 + 0 sqrt{5} ), it cannot be that ( p + q sqrt{5} < 1 + 0 sqrt{5} ). This is because by Task 181, it would imply ( q < 0 ), contradicting ( q geq 0 ). 6. Considering that the sequence terms ( (9 + 4 sqrt{5})^n ) grow without bound, ( p + q sqrt{5} ) must be between two of its terms. Hence, there exists some ( n geq 0 ) such that: [ (9 + 4 sqrt{5})^n < p + q sqrt{5} < (9 + 4 sqrt{5})^{n+1} ] 7.

Since the quotient (frac{p + q sqrt{5}}{(9 + 4 sqrt{5})^n}) must also be in the form ( p' + q' sqrt{5} ) (as the division of two solutions of the same form results in a solution of the same form), we find: [ 1 < p' + q' sqrt{5} < 9 + 4 sqrt{5} ] 9.

Starting with the left side of the inequality: [a^{2}+3b^{2} = a^{2}+b^{2}+2b^{2}.] Notice that (a^{2}+b^{2} geqslant 2ab) (by the AM-GM inequality). Therefore, we can write: [a^{2}+3b^{2} geqslant 2ab + 2b^{2} = 2b(a+b).] Thus, we have shown that (a^{2}+3b^{2}geqslant 2b(a+b)). The equality holds only when (a = b), fulfilling the condition of the proof. Part (2) Given (a > 0), (b > 0), and (frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b}=1), we are tasked with finding the minimum value of (2a+b). Using the given condition, we can express (2a+b) in terms of (frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b}): [2a+b = left(frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b}right)(2a+b).] Expanding the product, we obtain: [2a+b = 4 + frac{b}{a} + frac{4a}{b}.] Applying the AM-GM inequality to (frac{b}{a}) and (frac{4a}{b}), we get: [frac{b}{a} + frac{4a}{b} geqslant 2sqrt{frac{b}{a} cdot frac{4a}{b}} = 2sqrt{4} = 4.] Adding 4 to both sides of this inequality, we find: [2a+b geqslant 4 + 4 = 8.] Therefore, the minimum value of (2a+b) is (8), which occurs when (frac{b}{a} = frac{4a}{b}), or equivalently, when (b = 2a) and (a = 2), (b = 4).

We need to cover the surface of this cube using 2 times 1 dominos such that some dominos \\"cross\\" two faces, these crossing dominos' count is proven to be odd. 2. **Coloring the Grid:** Color the surfaces of the 9 times 9 times 9 cube like a chessboard, ensuring that each face has alternating black and white squares. Since each surface is 9 times 9, the top left square (considered for instance on each face) would be black. 3. **Counting Black and White Squares on Each Face:** - Each 9 times 9 face would have 41 black squares and 40 white squares because the total number of unit squares on each face is 81 = 9 times 9, which is an odd number, implying there’s one more black square than white squares. 4. **Analyzing the Dominos:** Each 2 times 1 domino covers two adjacent squares. When placed on a single face: - It covers one black square and one white square. - When placed “crossing” to adjacent faces, it must cover squares of the same color (both black or both white), because the unit squares overlap at the edge, transitioning towards the neighboring face. 5. **Evaluating the Total Squares:** Consider the entire surface area formed by the six 9 times 9 faces: - Total number of black squares: 6 times 41 = 246 - Total number of white squares: 6 times 40 = 240 6. **Calculating the Additional Count of Black Squares:** There are 6 more black squares than white squares (246 - 240 = 6). 7. **Distribution of Dominos:** - Each regular 2 times 1 domino contributes to equal numbers of black and white squares. - Each \\"crossing\\" domino contributes to either two black squares or two white squares. 8. **Conclusion:** Because there are 6 more black squares, the only way to account for this difference through 2 times 1 dominos is using 3 more “crossing” dominos that cover two black squares than those that cover white squares. Thus, the total number of such “crossing” dominos is odd.

This will help us determine the period of the function. The key to solving this problem is to apply the double angle formulas effectively. **Step 1: Simplify the function using double angle formulas** We have f(x)=cos frac{x}{2}left( sinfrac{x}{2}-sqrt{3}cosfrac{x}{2} right). Expanding this expression, we get: f(x)=cos frac{x}{2}sinfrac{x}{2}-sqrt{3}cos^{2}frac{x}{2}. Now, applying the double angle formulas, we have: cos frac{x}{2}sinfrac{x}{2}=frac{1}{2}sin x and cos^{2}frac{x}{2}=frac{1+cos x}{2}. Substituting these expressions into our function, we obtain: f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-sqrt{3}left( frac{1+cos x}{2} right). **Step 2: Simplify further and find the period** Now, let's simplify the expression further: f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}left( 1+cos x right). Distributing the -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we get: f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos x. Rearranging the terms, we have: f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

To find the coefficient of ( x^{3n} ) where ( n ) is the sum of all coefficients of the function ( f(x) = (1 + x - x^2)^{20} ), we first recognize that ( n ) is the sum of all coefficients when the function is expressed as a polynomial in ( x ). This leads us to evaluate ( f(1) ). 2. Evaluating ( f(1) ): [ f(1) = (1 + 1 - 1^2)^{20} = 1^{20} = 1 ] Hence, ( n = 1 ). We need to find the coefficient of ( x^{3 cdot 1} = x^3 ). 3.

Solving ( k + 2m = 3 ): - For ( m = 0 ), ( k = 3 ). - For ( m = 1 ), ( k = 1 ). 6.

Suppose a line EF cuts the quadrilateral into two similar quadrilaterals AEFD and EFBC. Since the quadrilaterals are similar, corresponding angles are equal. 3. **Angle Relationships**: Let the angles at the vertices of quadrilateral ABCD be denoted by alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and let the angles at the vertices of quadrilateral AEFD be denoted by alpha, varepsilon, varphi, delta respectively. Utilizing the properties of similar figures: - If A E F D sim E B C F, then A maps to E, E maps to B, F maps to C, and D maps to F. Thus: [ alpha = varepsilon ] [ 180^circ - varepsilon = beta ] [ alpha + beta = 180^circ ] Concluding that the original quadrilateral must be a trapezoid. 4. **Examine All Possible Cases**: Each possible arrangement of vertex mapping (8 in total) can lead to forming similar quadrilaterals in such a way that: - In the first case: alpha+beta=180^circ, hence quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid. - In the second case: When AEFD sim EFCB, again alpha=gamma and delta=beta, making quadrilateral ABCD a parallelogram (which is a special type of trapezoid). - Continuing this process for the remaining 6 cases, each configuration will show the resulting quadrilateral ABCD must be a trapezoid. 5. **Reverse Statement - Trapezoid**: To prove the reverse, assume ABCD is a trapezoid which can be divided into two similar trapezoids by a line. Let a, b_1, b_2, and c be the lengths of the parallel sides and the non-parallel sides respectively. For the trapezoids to be similar: [ frac{a}{u} = frac{u}{c} rightarrow u^2 = a cdot c ] where u is the length of the division line. 6. **Existence of Length u**: Such u exists within the bounds between a and c. If a neq c, then a unique u exists such that u^{2} = ac. If a = c, then any line parallel to the bases (bisector line) will work, dividing the trapezoid into two similar halves. 7. **Validating with Side Lengths**: By verifying the side lengths satisfy: [ frac{b_2}{b_1} = frac{u}{a} ] Given a=c=u, b_1=b_2 works naturally. If aneq c, we solve: [ frac{b_2}{b_1} = frac{c-a}{u-a} - 1 ] Substituting u^2 = ac into: [ frac{b_2}{b_1} = frac{c-a}{sqrt{ac}-a} - 1 = frac{c-a}{sqrt{ac}-a} - 1 = frac{sqrt{ac}+a}{a} - 1 = frac{sqrt{ac}}{a} = frac{u}{a} ] Hence, the condition of having similar trapezoids by the splitting line is satisfied. # Conclusion: From both necessary and sufficient conditions, we conclude that a convex quadrilateral can be divided by a line into two similar quadrilaterals if and only if the original quadrilateral is a trapezoid. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Determine the area of the triangle formed by the points of intersection of the parabola y = x^2 and the line x + y = 2, and the center of the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1.

Prove that your answer is correct.","output":"To determine the values of all five different-looking coins in your pocket, which are worth 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 florins respectively, you must follow a systematic process with the vending machine. Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Initial Observation:** - You need to identify the value of each of the five distinct coins. - The vending machine accepts any coin and returns one candy plus change if the coin's value exceeds 1 florin. 2. **Prove that three candies are not enough:** - By purchasing only three candies, you might end up spending any combination of 1-florin, 2-florin, or 5-florin coins. - Suppose your first three transactions did not involve 10-florin or 20-florin coins, you won’t receive these coins as change. - Thus, with three transactions, there’s a possibility you will not identify the 10-florin and 20-florin coins. 3. **Determine the least number of candies required - Testing with four candies:** - Purchase four candies using four different kinds of coins. - Two cases arise for identifying 1-florin coin: - **Case 1:** If any transaction doesn’t yield change, you must have paid with the 1-florin coin. Thus, you immediately identify the 1-florin coin. - **Case 2:** If all four transactions yield change, the 1-florin coin must be the one not used as payment. 4. **Identify the 2-florin coin:** - You have identified the 1-florin coin. With this, for each transaction, you can see if you received a 1-florin as change. - If change equals 1 florin, then the coin used in that transaction must be the 2-florin coin. 5. **Identify the 5-florin coin:** - Having 1-florin and 2-florin coins identified, you can recognize the change patterns: - For a 5-florin coin, the change would be either: - Four 1-florin coins - Two 2-florin coins - One 2-florin and two 1-florin coins 6. **Identify the 10-florin coin:** - Similarly, you now can verify the accumulation of florins received as change. The specific change for a 10-florin coin would total 9 florins (e.g., two 5-florin, a combination of lower denominations). 7. **Identify the 20-florin coin:** - Finally, all remaining unknown coins, after elimination and recognition from previous steps, lead you to correctly identify the 20-florin coin. 8. **Conclusion:** - Purchasing four candies ensures that by using and observing the change from four different coins, you can deduce the values of all five coins. Therefore, the least number of candies that you must buy to ensure that you can determine the values of all the coins is 4.

Firstly, the complexity of political issues has escalated over time, making it harder for individuals to stay informed. With the rapid pace of technological advancements and the increasing interconnectedness of global affairs, it's challenging for the average citizen to keep up with the nuances of every political issue. Moreover, the overload of information from various media sources, including social media, can sometimes lead to misinformation or confusion, further hindering political literacy. Additionally, the decline in civic engagement contributes to the lack of political knowledge among Americans. Despite the importance of local government in people's daily lives, voter turnout in local elections remains dismally low. This disconnect between citizens and their local governments could be attributed to various factors, including apathy, disillusionment with the political system, or barriers to participation such as voter suppression or lack of access to information. However, despite these challenges, democracy can still survive with low levels of political knowledge among citizens. Robust institutions, a free press, and mechanisms for accountability are crucial in sustaining democracy. Educating citizens about their rights and responsibilities as voters, promoting civic engagement, and fostering critical thinking skills can help mitigate the effects of political ignorance and strengthen democratic participation.\\"","output":"Despite more education, Americans aren't getting better at understanding politics. This might be because politics are complex and change fast, especially with new technologies and global issues. Too much news and social media can also confuse or mislead people. Fewer people getting involved in their local governments is another big issue. Many don't vote in local elections. This might be because they've lost interest, find it hard to vote, or just don't know enough. Still, democracy can survive even if people don't know much about politics, thanks to strong laws, free media, and checks on power. Better education and encouraging everyone to take part in politics can help keep democracy strong."},{"instruction":"reply in 100 words with simple words and robustness \\"A factor that contributes to low voter turnout is voter suppression. Certain laws and policies can make it more difficult for certain groups of people to access the polls, resulting in disenfranchisement. This can include voter ID laws, restricted polling locations, and limited voting hours, all of which can disproportionately affect marginalized communities as well as between juggling work, family, and the occasional Netflix binge, finding the time and motivation to cast a vote can be tough. But here is the thing: local governments are where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. They are the ones making decisions that directly impact our day-to-day lives, from fixing potholes to funding schools. So, while it is easy to shrug off local elections as no big deal, the truth is, they matter—a lot. If more folks realized that we would see voter turnout numbers that would make even the Founding Fathers proud.\\"","output":"Some laws make it too hard for people, especially those already facing challenges, to vote. Things like needing certain IDs or not having enough places to vote can stop people from having their say. Plus, life's busy with work and family, and sometimes we just want to watch TV instead of voting. But here's why we should care: local governments have a big say in our everyday lives, like fixing roads or funding schools. Local elections might seem small, but they're actually super important.

Please use it responsibly and test the program in a controlled environment before deploying. - \`ExitWindowsEx\` may require the program to be run with administrative privileges to perform a shutdown. - This program does not handle scenarios where the system is actively used right before the hour is up. You might want to add additional logic to prevent a shutdown if a user resumes activity. - Since this program utilizes \`unsafe\` code, be sure that you understand the implications and the risks associated with calling system APIs directly.

The \`GetTickCount\` function returns the number of milliseconds since the system started. - Added checks for \`GetLastInputInfo\` and \`ExitWindowsEx\` return values to handle possible errors. - Reduced the frequency the script actively checks for idle time to be dependent upon \`SetWaitableTimer\`, which will signal the \`timer_event\` every hour, making it more efficient.

Compile and run this Rust program with administrator privileges and ensure it functions properly in your environment. Always test thoroughly before real-world deployment."},{"instruction":"now does it have any security flaw","output":"The updated Rust program provided aims to shut down the computer after an hour of inactivity using Windows API calls, and it demonstrates appropriate error handling for the operations it performs. However, certain aspects could potentially introduce security or safety concerns if not managed correctly: 1. **Administrator Privileges**: The program requires administrative privileges to execute the \`ExitWindowsEx\` function for shutting down the system. Running programs with elevated privileges can be risky if the program's integrity is not ensured, as it could be exploited to perform unauthorized actions on the system. 2. **Code Injection**: The use of unsanitized pointers and direct Windows API calls opens avenues for potential code injection if the program interacts with external data or interfaces that could be compromised. 3. **Unhandled Errors**: The presence of \`panic!\` calls in the Rust code means that unexpected errors could cause the program to crash. In a production environment, this could be disruptive, and a more graceful error-handling approach may be preferable. 4. **Third-Party Dependencies**: The \`winapi\` crate is well-maintained and widely used in the Rust community, but any third-party dependency has the potential for security flaws or bugs. Always keep your dependencies updated to the latest version, which should include security patches. 5. **Operating System Compatibility**: Compatibility with different versions of Windows is another aspect to consider. If you're deploying this on multiple machines, be sure they support the API calls you're making. To address the potential vulnerabilities, here are some guidelines: - Keep the program's scope minimal and run it with the least privileges necessary. Unfortunately, in this case, administrative rights are necessary to execute the shutdown command. - Regularly update the \`winapi\` crate to the latest version to benefit from any security patches or improvements. - Clearly understand the implications of utilizing \`unsafe\` blocks, and make sure that any raw pointers or API calls are carefully reviewed and validated. - Review the program's logic and flow to ensure it correctly handles all error cases and doesn't inadvertently cause issues on the system in which it's running. - Implement comprehensive logging and alerting for system administrators so they can be informed of any unexpected behavior or errors. - If your program will interact with external user inputs or other external systems, ensure proper input validation and data sanitization are in place to prevent code injection attacks. Lastly, always consider conducting a thorough security audit of the code and its deployment context as part of your development lifecycle, especially if you plan to use this program in a sensitive or production environment."},{"instruction":"use windows crate instead","output":"As of my knowledge cut-off in early 2023, there isn't a Rust crate named \`windows\` specifically designed to interact with Windows API in the way you need for this task. However, there is a \`winapi\` crate in Rust that is widely used for making calls to Windows API functions. Just to clarify, as the knowledge base might not include the most recent updates in Rust libraries, you should check the latest state of Windows-related crates by searching on crates.io, which is the Rust community’s crate registry. If a new crate named \`windows\` was indeed released after my knowledge cut-off and is intended to replace or provide an alternative to the \`winapi\` crate, the usage pattern would typically be similar in many respects. The new crate should provide safe and potentially more ergonomic abstractions around the Windows API. Assuming your intention was to request using a more ergonomic crate for interacting with Windows API, we'll continue with the \`winapi\` crate, as it's the established method as of the last update. Please check crates.io or relevant Rust community resources for any new crates that might simplify Windows API interactions. If you are referring to a crate that does exist, and it's just beyond my current knowledge, you would use Rust's package manager Cargo to include it in your project's \`Cargo.toml\` file and reference its documentation for details on how to interact with system functionality such as querying idle time and initiating shutdown. The code implementation would depend greatly on what abstractions and API the crate provides."},{"instruction":"how to run it at startup programatically","output":"In Windows, if you want to run a Rust program—or any program, for that matter—at startup, you can either place it in the Startup folder or use the Windows Task Scheduler, both of which can be done programmatically: # Method 1: Using the Startup Folder To programmatically place a script or executable in the Startup folder: 1. Find or create the path to the Startup folder for the current user or for all users. 2. Create a shortcut to your Rust executable. 3. Place the shortcut in the Startup folder. This can be done via a Rust program using the \`std::fs\` and the \`std::path\` modules to work with file system paths, and the \`winapi\` crate to create a shortcut (lnk file). However, creating a shortcut programmatically in Rust is non-trivial and would require either using the COM library to create a Shell Link object (which is quite complex) or a third-party crate that simplifies this process. As an alternative, you might use a Rust program to write a simple batch script that creates the shortcut for you and then places that batch script in the Startup folder. # Method 2: Using Windows Task Scheduler Alternatively, the Windows Task Scheduler can be used for more control over the startup process: 1. Create a new task that runs at user logon. 2. Set the action to run your Rust executable. This approach would typically be done via the \`schtasks\` command-line utility, which can be called from Rust using \`std::process::Command\`. Here's how you could create a task for your Rust program: \`\`\`rust use std::process::Command; fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> { let executable_path = r\\"C:pathtoyour_rust_program.exe\\"; let task_name = \\"MyRustProgramStartupTask\\"; // Create task to run at user logon let output = Command::new(\\"schtasks.exe\\") .args(&[ \\"/Create\\", \\"/TN\\", task_name, \\"/TR\\", executable_path, \\"/SC\\", \\"ONLOGON\\", \\"/RL\\", \\"HIGHEST\\", ]) .output()?; if output.status.success() { println!(\\"Task created successfully.\\"); } else { eprintln!(\\"Failed to create task.\\"); eprintln!(\\"Output: {}\\", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr)); } Ok(()) } \`\`\` This program calls \`schtasks.exe\` with the appropriate arguments to create a new task that runs your Rust program at user logon. Please note: - Creating tasks with \`schtasks.exe\` might require administrative privileges. - You should provide the correct path to your executable. - Ensure you replace \`MyRustProgramStartupTask\` with a unique task name for your application. You can also consider using a tool like \`Task Scheduler Managed Wrapper\` or other third-party libraries which provide a more idiomatic Rust interface to Task Scheduler, if available. Again, safety is essential: running programs at startup and modifying system configurations should be done with caution, as these can affect system performance or stability, especially if requiring administrative privileges. Always make sure such changes are performed with the user's knowledge and consent."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Each \\"Greek\\" corresponds to a risk measure that helps traders understand the potential risks and rewards of their positions. Here are the most commonly discussed Greeks: 1. Delta (Δ): Measures the rate of change in the option's price per one-point movement in the underlying asset price. For example, a delta of 0.5 means the option's price will change by 0.5 units for every 1 unit change in the underlying asset's price. 2. Gamma (Γ): Measures the rate of change in delta for a one-point change in the underlying asset's price. Gamma indicates the stability of an option's delta and can be important for assessing the risk of options that are close to being at the money. 3. Theta (Θ): Measures the rate of time decay of the option's price. It tells you how much the option's price will decrease each day as it approaches expiration. The closer the option is to expiration, typically the higher the theta. 4. Vega (ν): Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to volatility in the underlying asset. A higher vega means the option's price is more sensitive to changes in implied volatility. 5. Rho (ρ): Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the risk-free interest rate. Rho is typically less important for day-to-day trading as interest rates don't usually change drastically in short periods. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Options Greeks in trading: Step 1: Understand the Greeks Educate yourself on what each Greek represents and how it affects the value of an option. You should be comfortable with the concepts and calculations associated with each Greek. Step 2: Define Your Strategy Determine what kind of options strategy you're employing (e.g., buying calls/puts, writing options, spreads). Different strategies will have different sensitivities to the Greeks. Step 3: Analyze Your Position Use the Greeks to understand the risks associated with your strategy: - Delta: Assesses the direction risk. If you're long a call option and expect the underlying to go up, a higher delta is beneficial. - Gamma: Affects the stability of your delta. High gamma means your position's delta can change quickly. - Theta: Consider whether you're in a time-decay strategy (net options seller) or a time-value buyer. As a seller, you want to benefit from high theta, while as a buyer, you look for low theta. - Vega: Analyze how much volatility you want in your position. Understand whether you want to profit from volatility changes (high vega) or if you prefer a more stable option price (low vega). - Rho: Generally a lesser concern, but still consider how interest rate changes might affect longer-term options trades. Step 4: Monitor the Market Watch for changes in the underlying asset's price, volatility, and time to expiration. These factors will influence the Greek values and, consequently, your position. Step 5: Adjust Your Position If Needed If the market conditions change and the Greeks show your position is at more risk than you're comfortable with, you can adjust your trade. This could mean buying or selling options to hedge delta or gamma, or altering your strategy to manage theta or vega exposure. Step 6: Close or Roll the Position As you approach expiration or achieve your profit/loss goals, decide whether to close the position or \\"roll\\" it (close and open another similar position) to manage your Greeks according to the current market view. Always remember, trading options and using Greeks requires substantial knowledge and experience, and comes with risk. The guidelines provided should serve as an educational foundation. Always perform thorough analysis before executing trades, and consider using professional platforms that offer Greeks calculations for your positions."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It was originally aimed at the education market, but was later made available to the general public as well. Announced in April 2002, the eMac design featured a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitor integrated with the computer's hardware into a single enclosed unit, similar in appearance to the original iMac G3 series. The eMac was designed to replace the aging iMac G3 models for educational buyers, offering a more powerful and budget-friendly alternative to the flat-panel iMac G4 that had been introduced earlier. The eMac was equipped with PowerPC G4 processors and had a 17-inch CRT display, which at the time was considered a generous size for classrooms and consumers on a budget. The eMac offered various ports for connectivity, like USB and FireWire, and came with a range of software suitable for educational purposes, as well as general use, such as Apple's iLife suite. Over its lifecycle, the eMac saw several updates to its hardware, including faster processors, better graphics cards, and increased storage capacity. However, as technology advanced and demand for CRT screens declined in favor of LCD screens, Apple eventually discontinued the eMac in July 2006. Apple's move towards all-LCD displays reflected the broader industry trend and consumer preference for the thinner, lighter, and more power-efficient technology."},{"instruction":"What Apple Computers Did Classrooms Use Before The eMac?","output":"Before the introduction of the eMac in 2002, Apple had a strong presence in educational institutions with several models of Macintosh computers. Some of the popular Apple computers used in classrooms before the eMac included: 1. **Apple II series**: The Apple II, introduced in 1977, was one of the first successful microcomputers and found a substantial place in schools. It was common throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Apple IIe and Apple IIgs models were particularly widespread. 2. **Macintosh Classic series**: These included the original Macintosh (1984), the Macintosh Classic (1990), and other compact Macs like the Macintosh SE and Macintosh SE/30. They were more affordable than some of the other Macintosh models and quite popular in educational settings due to their all-in-one design. 3. **LC series**: The \\"LC\\" stands for \\"low-cost color,\\" and these Macs, such as the Macintosh LC introduced in 1990, were budget-oriented desktop computers intended for the education market. They provided a color option to the typically monochrome displays available in the early compact Macs. 4. **Performa series**: Released in the early 1990s, the Macintosh Performa line was sold in retail channels and included versions that were nearly identical to models sold directly to education markets. They came in various form factors, including all-in-one designs and traditional desktops. 5. **iMac G3**: Introduced in 1998, the iMac G3 with its distinctive transparent, colored plastic case and all-in-one design, was a hit in schools. It replaced both the older Macintosh and the Apple II lines in educational settings. Apple has had a longstanding relationship with education, offering discounts and special pricing to schools, which helped establish a strong user base among students and educators. The transition from these earlier models to the eMac was seen as a path to modernize technology in classrooms with more powerful and, at the same time, affordable computers tailored to the needs of educational environments."},{"instruction":"ola","output":"Olá!

A sequência de Fibonacci é uma série de números em que cada número é a soma dos dois anteriores, começando com 0 e 1. Aqui está um exemplo de como você pode fazer isso usando um loop \`for\`: \`\`\`javascript function fibonacci(num) { const series = [0, 1]; for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) { series[i] = series[i - 1] + series[i - 2]; } return series; } const num = 10; // Por exemplo, calcule os 10 primeiros números na sequência de Fibonacci console.log(fibonacci(num)); // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] \`\`\` Este código definirá uma função chamada \`fibonacci\` que toma um número \`num\` como argumento e retorna os primeiros \`num\` números da sequência de Fibonacci. O resultado é um array dos valores da sequência. Neste exemplo, o código calcula os primeiros 10 números na sequência de Fibonacci e imprime o array resultante no console. Caso você queira uma função que retorne um único número de Fibonacci para uma posição específica (onde \`fibonacci(0) = 0\`, \`fibonacci(1) = 1\`, \`fibonacci(2) = 1\`, e assim por diante), você pode usar essa outra versão: \`\`\`javascript function fibonacci(num) { if (num < 2) { return num; } return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2); } const position = 10; // Por exemplo, pegue o número de Fibonacci na posição 10 console.log(fibonacci(position)); // 55 \`\`\` Este código implementa a função \`fibonacci\` usando recursão. No entanto, essa versão não é eficiente para valores grandes de \`num\` devido às chamadas de função redundantes.

In this ever-evolving landscape, one game stands out: Fortnite. Epic Games’ magnus opus involves unique and never-seen-before gameplay mechanics that hook you into the battle royale. In the past year alone, the cultural phenomenon gave away 19.64 million dollars in a competitive prize pool featuring a peak viewership of 700,000+ viewers. If you want to tap into that enormous sum of wealth and money, this guide will be the one to help you. From honing your reflexes to mastering building techniques and staying updated with the ever-changing meta, this guide will provide a comprehensive roadmap for transforming your Fortnite experience. So, boot up that inner gamer and get ready as we embark on a journey to unlock the secrets of being a true Fortnite professional. What is Fortnite? Fortnite is a battle royale game that was released July 21, 2017. Originally released as a player-versus-enemy game, after seeing the success of PUBG, the creators of Fortnite implemented a battle royale game that soared its popularity to new heights. From 1 million average players to 50 million players, Fortnite turned from a generational game to a once-in-a-lifetime game. Having a very unique and eye-catching art style, genre-defining game mechanics, and marketing that reached every nook and corner of the internet, it is not surprising that Fortnite has unprecedented success. Even now, Epics Games has evolved with the market and is still the gold standard for evolution in a game. Recently, they have introduced Creative Fortnite, where you can create anything you want, Lego Fortnite, a game where you play as lego characters and can build, and Fortnite Festival, a gamemode where you can play beats and listen to music with friends. Additionally, Fortnite has evolved its competitive scene, introducing global Fortnite championships and regional tournaments giving out millions. The people who qualify are the top of the crop however, by the time you finish reading this, you will meet those standards Understanding the Key Pillars to Professional Success To excel in the highly competitive landscape of professional Fortnite, one must grasp the key pillars that form the foundation for pro-level gameplay. The key pillars to tapping into professional gameplay are aim, mechanics, and game sense. To be tier one is to be able to effectively utilize all three in tandem. If one pillar were to be weaker than the other, your performances in tournaments and in-game will suffer. Additionally, If all three pillars are weak, your chances of excelling in top-tier pro lobbies will drop tremendously. So in this guide, we will go in-depth into these three pillars to make sure you have the highest chances of becoming a Fortnite pro. Aim Out of the three pillars, the mechanic of aiming is the most cut-through idea. However, it serves as the cornerstone for success in every situation. Developing your aim is a meticulous process as you must have a balance between a personal sensitivity that you are comfortable with and a mechanical sensitivity that allows for swift and controlled movements. If you don’t know, sensitivity is the speed at which your camera moves in relation to your mouse/joystick. To achieve this, you must personally try different percentages. However, it is recommended that you try out the sensitivities of different professional players as it creates a baseline for a sensitivity that works. Once you have found your sensitivity you must work on your ability to follow targets, shoot reactively to the environment around you, employ good crosshair placement, and you must be able to time your shots to maximum damage. Fortunately, many creative maps help players ease into aim training. Typically speaking, you want one mechanic's training map and one map that allows you to implement aim into real-game scenarios. Building Just like your aim, the mechanic of building serves as a cornerstone to achieving success in every situation. However, unlike aim, it is a very difficult to master game mechanic that has a multitude of layers of complexity. Truly mastering building is an art that would take at least 10 pages of detail, but to summarize the tier one building, you must understand key binds, editing, crosshair placement, piece control, and in-game implementation. When it comes to key binds, you must have key binds that are easy to repeatedly hit and are optimal to the way you play. Editing, you must be able to do it consistently, fast, and in a way that keeps you safe from enemy fire. Crosshair placement, you must be able to correctly place your crosshair in a way that allows you to utilize your building efficiently without a lot of screen movement. Piece control, you must be able to control the builds around you and be able to reactively control the builds in any scenario. Finally, in-game implementation, you must be able to utilize all of these aspects of building in the parameters of in-game. This is because when playing in a game, there are many latency differences and server issues that change the way your builds place and work. From mastering the basics of ramp rushes to executing complex high-ground retakes, the journey to becoming a Fortnite pro demands a commitment to refining building techniques that evolve with the competitive landscape and changing game metas. Game-Sense Game sense is a unique quality that sets Fortnite professionals apart from the rest. It encompasses a deep understanding of the game's dynamics, strategic insight, and the ability to make split-second decisions in the heat of the game. A pro player with an exceptional game sense not only comprehends the map layout, loot distribution, and potential engagement points but also anticipates the movements and decisions of opponents. Awareness of the ever-shrinking play zone and the strategic positioning of oneself and teammates are vital components. Furthermore, effective game sense extends to resource management, knowing when to engage or disengage, and adapting strategies based on the evolving circumstances of every match. It's a mix of experience, intuition, and a keen analytical mind that enables a Fortnite professional to navigate the chaos of the battlefield with finesse, making informed decisions that lead to victory. Additionally, game sense combines itself with the other pillars as it enables you to utilize efficient control of your aiming and building. The Highs and Lows of Professional Fortnite “For there to be light, there must be darkness. For there to be joy, there must be sorrow. For there to be beauty, there must be the grotesque.” - Penelope King In order to be an expert in Fortnite, you will have to sacrifice time and put in the willpower to masterfully grind the complexities of the game. The top competitors in Fortnite put in tens of thousands of hours to evolve with the game and get ahead of the meta. However, at some times, this may not be enough because things like server bugs and login issues can instantly turn your success upside down. Fortunately for you, once you tap into that glory, your hard work will pay off. Competitors that made it to the top have made millions of dollars in addition to having the spotlight shining on them. Clix, a champion of Fortnite, averages over 20,000 viewers in his streams every day. This causes him to make millions a year in addition to the many sponsors he receives and tournaments he wins. Because he is so consistent, Clix has made enough money to retire at the age of 20. The road to a Fortnite professional is plagued with challenges and obstacles that many would fail to overcome. However, once you have decided to dedicate yourself to the game, you will tap into the insurmountable glory and wealth that Fortnite provides for its winners. Will you be the next player to top the leaderboard and be the next Fortnite champion?","output":"Based on the rubric you've provided and the content of your essay, I will assess the essay against each indicated criterion.

Given the rubric and the content, which seems to target explaining the process of becoming a professional Fortnite player, here's how I would score the essay on a 1-100 scale: - Introduction: 8/10 – The introduction sets the stage for the process but could more directly outline the steps that will be analyzed. - Clarity of Process Explanation: 20/25 – The explanation of how to become a professional gamer covers key areas such as aim, building, and game sense, but could be structured more as a step-by-step guide. - Cohesion and Organization of Steps: 17/20 – The essay addresses different components but may benefit from clearer labeling and sequencing of steps (e.g., Step 1: Aiming, Step 2: Building, etc.). - Depth of Analysis: 18/20 – Insightful analysis of each component; aiming and building are well-discussed, yet game sense could be elaborated further in terms of its gradual development. - Use of Evidence and Examples: 8/10 – Some good examples are included, like the prize pool statistics and the story of a professional player; however, more specific process-related examples could be used. - Language and Vocabulary: 8/10 – Suitable domain-specific language is used, but a process analysis essay requires more instructive language. - Sentence Variety and Readability: 8/10 – Sentence variety is present, but complex sentences can detract from the clarity of instructions. - Transitions and Flow: 8/10 – Some transitions are used effectively, yet additional transitions that guide the reader through each step could improve flow. - Style and Tone: 8/10 – The tone is mostly consistent with the genre, but a process analysis typically has a more instructional tone. - Conventions of Standard Written English: 9/10 – Well-written with few errors, demonstrating strong command of English conventions. Total: 112/135 - Adjusted to fit a scale of 100, the score would be approximately 83. This score reflects a 'B' level for a process analysis essay, indicating that the essay is quite strong but has room for improvements specifically tailored to the genre of process analysis.

This could manifest in various ways, such as the fraudulent star exaggerating its brightness, size, or age to appear more important or influential within the cluster. The fraudulent star may manipulate its appearance through various means, such as emitting false signals or altering its spectral characteristics to mimic those of a more massive star. By deceiving other stars in the cluster, the fraudulent star could potentially exploit their trust and obtain access to resources or opportunities that it would not otherwise have access to. However, if other stars within the cluster were to discover the fraudulent nature of the star, this could lead to consequences such as loss of trust, social isolation, and potential retaliation from other stars within the cluster. This could result in the fraudulent star being ostracized or even expelled from the cluster, leading to negative repercussions for its survival and well-being."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Draw the heap just after Build-Max-Heap was executed. Then draw a new heap after another (the next) element has been sorted; the last heap you draw has a single element.","output":"Heapsort consists of two main phases: building a max heap from the input array, and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element to sort the array. To illustrate the operation of Heapsort on the array A = <5, 13, 2, 25, 7, 17, 20, 8, 4>, we will walk through each step. **Phase 1: Build a Max Heap** 1. Start by arranging the array into a complete binary tree. Here's how the array A would be represented as a complete binary tree: 5 / 13 2 / / 25 7 17 20 / 8 4 2. Convert the binary tree into a max heap by ensuring that each node is greater than its children. This is done by starting from the last non-leaf node and sifting down (heapifying) the elements as necessary. The last non-leaf node in this case is A[4], which is the element \`7\`. Here's the heap after Build-Max-Heap (assuming the heap is 1-indexed, and we recursively sift down starting from the last non-leaf node): 25 / 13 20 / / 8 7 17 2 / 5 4 **Note**: This satisfies the max heap property, where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes. **Phase 2: Sort the Array** 3. Swap the first element of the heap (current maximum) with the last element. 4. Reduce the heap size by one, effectively removing the last element (maximum) from the heap. 5. Sift down (re-heapify) the new root element to restore the heap property. The process of swapping the maximum element and sifting down is repeated as follows: a. Initial max heap (heap size = 9): 25 / 13 20 / / 8 7 17 2 / 5 4 b. Swap the first and last element (A[1] with A[9]): 4 / 13 20 / / 8 7 17 2 / 5 25 c. Decrease heap size to 8 (remove A[9]) and sift down (heapify) the new root element \`4\`: 20 / 13 17 / / 8 7 4 2 / 5 25 **Note**: The array now reflects the sorted position of \`25\` at the end: [20, 13, 17, 8, 7, 4, 2, 5, 25] d. Continue with the next iteration to sort the heap and reduce heap size. This process continues until the heap size is 1. e. Final heap after sorting (heap size = 1) with array elements extracted: 5 / 13 2 / 8 7 / 4 **Note**: The final sorted array will look like this, in ascending order: [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 20, 25] This illustration provides the major steps of Heapsort, however, there are intermediary heaps and array states at each step which are not shown here.

The array \`A = <5, 13, 2, 25, 7, 17, 20, 8, 4>\` represents a binary tree. In a binary heap, which is also a complete binary tree, we fill in the levels of the tree from left to right. The relationships between parent and child nodes for a zero-indexed array can be explained as follows for any index \`i\`: - The parent is at index \`(i - 1) / 2\`. - The left child is at index \`2 * i + 1\`. - The right child is at index \`2 * i + 2\`. Using this, let's lay out the array as a complete binary tree before transforming it into a max heap: \`\`\` 5 / 13 2 / / 25 7 17 20 / 8 4 \`\`\` Here's how the elements in the array are mapped as a binary tree: - The root is \`5\` at index 0. - The root \`5\` has two children: \`13\` (left child, at index 1) and \`2\` (right child, at index 2). - Node \`13\` again has two children: \`25\` (left child, at index 3) and \`7\` (right child, at index 4). - Node \`2\` has two children: \`17\` (left child, at index 5) and \`20\` (right child, at index 6). - Node \`25\` has two children: \`8\` (left child, at index 7) and \`4\` (right child, at index 8). Each node \`x\` in the tree will appear as follows: \`\`\` x / y z \`\`\` with \`y\` being the left child of \`x\` and \`z\` being the right child. Every node except the last one has two children, and the tree is filled from the top level to the bottom level, left to right, without gaps until the last level.

Here's how you can represent the heap visually after applying Build-Max-Heap to the original array. I'll describe the parent-child relationships first, then provide the ASCII-based diagram. After building the max heap, we expect the largest element (which is 25 in the given array) to be at the root of the heap. The heap will satisfy the max heap property: A parent node's key will be greater than or equal to the keys of its children. Following the Build-Max-Heap operation, the tree should look like this: - The root is \`25\`. - Node \`25\` has two children: \`13\` (left child) and \`20\` (right child). - Node \`13\` has two children: \`8\` (left child) and \`7\` (right child). - Node \`20\` has two children: \`17\` (left child) and \`2\` (right child). - Node \`8\` has two children: \`5\` (left child) and \`4\` (right child).

Эти разрывы могут быть использованы для достижения разных эффектов, в том числе: 1. Показ поведения персонажа: Разрыв в тексте может указывать на паузу, прерывание или сомнение, которое испытывает персонаж во время диалога. 2. Визуальные или звуковые интерпретации: В сценарии разрыв строки может указать на то, что следует визуальный или звуковой элемент, прерывающий или дополняющий текст. 3. Ритм и темп: Сценаристы используют разрывы предложений для контроля ритма и темпа диалога или нарратива, чтобы создать определенное настроение или подчеркнуть момент. 4. Указания для актеров и режиссеров: Разрывы могут давать указания исполнителям или режиссеру о том, как лучше всего передать линию или сцену, включая паузы, смену тона и эмоциональные перепады. Если вы спрашиваете о техническом аспекте включения разрыва предложения в рукопись сценария, это обычно делается с использованием стандартного форматирования сценария, где каждая новая строка диалога начинается с новой строки. Если разрыв предложения предназначен для создания особого эффекта в диалоге, писатели часто используют многоточие (…) или дефис (-), чтобы показать, что говорящий сделал паузу или его прервали. Примеры из сценария: 1. Остановка персонажа посреди предложения: \`\`\` ДЖОН Я думаю, ты должен... нет, забудь. \`\`\` 2. Прерывание одного персонажа другим: \`\`\` ДЖОН Я чувствую, что — МАРИЯ — Что ты больше не можешь ждать? \`\`\` Такие приемы помогают создавать живые и убедительные сценарии, которые точно передают интенции автора и помогают актерам и режиссерам в их работе."},{"instruction":"Вот так можно сделать разрыв предложения в сценариях полнометражного фильма?: Первая страница: Ed works INTENTLY at his LAB bench, FLANKED by HIGH shelves LADEN with neat rows of CHEMICALS and LAB tools.

Это может быть затруднительно для чтения и понимания, и редакторы сценариев часто стараются избежать такого разрыва, чтобы повысить читабельность документа. В случае, когда это неизбежно, например, когда необходимо подчеркнуть драматический момент или создать особый эффект удержания внимания, можно использовать такой перенос, чтобы повысить вовлеченность читателя и добавить вес описываемому моменту. Тем не менее, при использовании таких приёмов важно удостовериться, что перенос делается сознательно и целенаправленно, чтобы подчеркнуть определенный элемент истории или важное событие в сценарии, и что он не вызовет путаницу или недопонимание среди читателей сценария. В случае вашего примера, если бы это было сделано намеренно ради эффекта, перенос со страницы на страницу может сработать, но лучше всегда стремиться к ясности и легкости чтения, чтобы удерживать внимание читателя и избегать ненужных переводов страниц в критических моментах рассказа."},{"instruction":"Может быть в конце поставить девиз?: Ed works INTENTLY at his LAB bench, FLANKED by HIGH shelves LADEN with neat rows of CHEMICALS and LAB tools.

В этом контексте использование слова \\"девиз\\" может вызвать некоторую путаницу, поскольку \\"девиз\\" обычно относится к короткому выражению или слогану, который отражает основные принципы или установки персонажа, группы или организации. Если вы имеете в виду использование неполного предложения с целью драматического эффекта, то вам может понадобиться другой термин для этого, такой как \\"зависающая фраза\\" (hanging phrase) или \\"незавершённое предложение\\" (unfinished sentence). В сценариях это может быть приёмом, вызывающим напряжение или интригу у читателя, заставляя его перевернуть страницу для продолжения. Чтобы корректно передать это в сценарии, вы можете использовать соответствующее форматирование и визуальные средства, чтобы показать, что текст намеренно оставлен незавершенным. Так, например, незавершённое предложение может выглядеть так: \`\`\` Ed работает сосредоточенно за своим рабочим местом в лаборатории, которое окружено высокими полками, загруженными аккуратно расставленными рядами химических веществ и инструментов. Микроскоп, центрифуга и стопки документации захламляют его пространство. Живые клетки процветают под ближайшим колпаком, частицы вихрем кружатся, как галактика под линзой микроскопа, когда Ed наклоняется, его глаза сузились от концентрации, он полностью поглощён созданием... \`\`\` И затем идёт переворот страницы, где предложение продолжается: \`\`\` ...«Эликсира вечной жизни» — революционного вещества, обещающего остановить старение и болезни. \`\`\` Этот прием может быть сильным, если он используется уместно и способен усилить ощущение драматизма сцены, а также поддержать интерес и ожидание читателя."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","output":"coffee and flower"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Había escuchado rumores sobre una historia de amor prohibida entre dos estudiantes, oniisama e. Oniisama e eran dos chicos muy populares en la escuela, eran guapos y talentosos en deportes y en sus estudios. Pero lo que más llamaba la atención de todos era la cercanía que tenían, siempre juntos, siempre riendo y bromeando entre ellos. Había susurros y murmullos entre los demás estudiantes, algunos decían que eran solo buenos amigos, otros afirmaban que eran pareja. Yo siempre los observaba desde lejos, fascinada por la complicidad que compartían. Me preguntaba qué era lo que realmente pasaba entre ellos, si en verdad se amaban o si solo eran amigos muy cercanos. Pero nunca me animé a acercarme a preguntarles, temiendo ser rechazada o ridiculizada. Un día, mientras los observaba desde mi ventana, vi a oniisama e caminando juntos por el patio, riendo y hablando animadamente. Parecían tan felices juntos, que sentí una punzada de envidia en mi corazón. ¿Por qué ellos podían ser tan libres en su amor, mientras yo me mantenía alejada por miedo al qué dirán? Pero a medida que los observaba, me di cuenta de que su amor era más grande que cualquier prejuicio o miedo. Se miraban con tanto cariño y complicidad que era imposible ignorar lo que sentían el uno por el otro. Y en ese momento, supe que la verdad sobre oniisama e no importaba, lo único que importaba era el amor que compartían. Así que dejé de esconderme detrás de las sombras y decidí acercarme a ellos, dispuesta a descubrir la verdadera historia de su amor. Y aunque al principio me costó vencer mis miedos, finalmente fui recibida con los brazos abiertos por oniisama e, quienes me contaron su historia con una sonrisa en los labios y amor en sus ojos. Y en ese momento, entendí que el amor verdadero no conoce de barreras ni prejuicios, solo sabe ser sincero y puro, como el de oniisama e."},{"instruction":"queseamasatrevido","output":"Esa mañana, mientras observaba a oniisama e desde lejos, decidí que ya era suficiente de ser una espectadora pasiva de su historia. Me armé de valor y me dirigí directamente hacia donde estaban, decidida a descubrir la verdad sobre su relación. Cuando llegué a su lado, pude ver sorpresa en sus rostros, pero también una chispa de curiosidad. Sin titubear, les pregunté directamente si eran más que amigos, si lo que tenían iba más allá de una simple amistad. Los dos se miraron entre ellos, con una mezcla de sorpresa y felicidad en sus ojos. Finalmente, oniisama e se tomaron de la mano y me confesaron que, efectivamente, eran pareja. Habían estado ocultando su relación por miedo al qué dirán, pero ya no podían esconder su amor más tiempo. Me contaron cómo se habían conocido, cómo habían superado obstáculos juntos y cómo se habían enamorado en secreto. Me sentí emocionada de haber sido testigo de su valentía al revelar su amor en público, y me sentí afortunada por haber sido parte de ese momento especial. Los abracé con fuerza, sintiendo la calidez de su amor envolviéndome, y les prometí que los apoyaría en todo lo que necesitaran.
