Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the movie tells the story of Augustine Lofthouse (Clooney), a lonely scientist who communicates with a group of astronauts on a mission back to Earth. The film has strong visuals that transport the viewer to the desolate world Augustine inhabits. The cinematography captures the bleak and isolating atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic Earth, and the special effects are impressive, especially in the scenes set in space. Moreover, the performances of the cast are praiseworthy. Clooney's depiction of the fragile and tormented scientist gives the movie a raw human touch, and the ensemble of actors playing the astronauts in space portrays strong emotions that connect the audience to their characters. The storyline of the film is thought-provoking, but it is not without its flaws. While the first act sets up the anticipation of an epic space adventure, the action slows down in the second half, leading to a predictable climax. Nevertheless, The Midnight Sky manages to be a unique sci-fi film that challenges the viewer to reflect. The movie raises awareness of the effects of climate change and poses ethical and existential questions with no easy answers. It's a film that could resonate with people who enjoy sci-fi dramas that explore more extensive ideas. In summary, The Midnight Sky is a cinematic experience that blends emotion and spectacle. Although it has its pitfalls, it is still a film worthy of appreciation. Therefore, I would give this movie a rating of 8/10, and recommend it to anyone looking to engage in a thought-provoking sci-fi story."},{"instruction":"Which famous painting by Vincent van Gogh features a starry night sky?","output":"The painting is called \\"The Starry Night\\"."},{"instruction":"Samantha is reading a book for her book club.

Some of the innovations in development include genetically modified crops, vertical farming, and precision agriculture. These technologies could help feed the growing population, but they also raise concerns about safety and sustainability. What are your thoughts on the future of food production?","output":"Article: The world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, which will pose significant challenges for the food production and distribution systems. With the current global food crisis, it is clear that the current methods of agriculture and food production will not be sufficient to cater to the growing demand for food. Addressing the food security challenge calls for innovative and sustainable solutions that will meet the increasing demand while protecting the environment. To address the challenges of food production, scientists are developing new technologies and strategies to increase crop yields and reduce waste. One of the innovations in development is genetically modified crops. Genetic engineering could help improve crop resistance to pests and diseases, increase production efficiency, and improve nutritional value. However, such crops also raise concerns about the safety and long-term sustainability of such farming methods. Another promising technology being developed is vertical farming. This innovative method involves the growing of crops in vertically-stacked layers. This method of farming reduces land requirements, reduces water usage, and enables farmers to grow crops closer to the consumer – reducing transportation costs, saving energy, and lowering emissions. Precision agriculture is yet another technology that could revolutionize the food production industry. This refers to the use of modern technology such as GPS and sensors to monitor crop health and enhance crop management. With precision agriculture, farmers can identify crop stress levels, identify areas of vulnerability, and optimize irrigation and chemical applications to reduce waste and improve crop yields. While these innovative technologies hold promise for the future of food production and security, it is important to address their potential negative impacts on the environment, sustainability, and societal concerns. For example, genetically modified crops raise concerns of environmental degradation, potential health impacts, and intellectual property rights issues. In conclusion, as the world population continues to grow, and the demand for food increases, we must explore new and sustainable methods of food production. This calls for developing innovative technology and strategies that reduce waste, lower energy usage, increase productivity, and protect the environment. Ultimately, we require a balanced approach that addresses environmental, societal, cultural, and ethical concerns in our efforts to create a world where everyone has access to safe and sustainable food."},{"instruction":"Provide details about the book you're reading.

He added: “We’re asking Congress to provide 105 billion to schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill, in addition to the 30 billion we’ve already secured for colleges and universities.” The combined 135 billion, part of a 1 trillion aid package Republicans plan to release next week, represents a significant increase from the 70 billion the administration initially proposed for education stabilization in March.","output":"The Trump administration is advocating for schools to reopen despite the renewed spread of COVID-19.

During photosynthesis, chlorophyll-containing cells in the leaves of a plant absorb light energy and use it to power the synthesis of organic compounds such as glucose, which the plant can use for energy or store for later use. This process involves two main reactions: the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, and the light-independent reactions (also called the Calvin cycle), which occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts. In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. These energy-rich molecules are then used to power the light-independent reactions, in which carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into organic compounds through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The oxygen produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Question: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020?

Experts suggest that social connections are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health.","output":"A recent study has brought to light the alarming harms of loneliness, suggesting that it can be as damaging to one’s health as smoking 15 cigarettes per day. The study analyzed data collected from over 40,000 participants residing in various parts of the world. The results showed that loneliness can significantly contribute to health problems such as heart disease, depression, and cognitive decline. The study has shed light on an issue that has long been ignored - the impact of loneliness on overall health. Many people often don’t realize the impact of being lonely and may not even recognize when they are experiencing it. It's not only people living alone who face the risk of loneliness; many others may feel isolated despite being surrounded by people. The research proves that social connections are crucial for both physical and mental well-being. Experts have been urging people to prioritize building meaningful social relationships to prevent loneliness. While loneliness may seem like a personal problem, its effects can be felt by the wider community, with high healthcare costs and reduced productivity as employees suffering from loneliness are more likely to take sick leaves. The findings of the study serve as a wake-up call for the government, healthcare providers, and society at large to recognize loneliness as a serious public health issue. Healthcare providers can include screening for loneliness as part of their regular assessments, and governments can work towards creating policies to alleviate the isolation and provide opportunities for social interaction for all members of society. In conclusion, the study shows that loneliness can be as damaging to one’s health as smoking 15 cigarettes per day. To prevent the effects of loneliness, experts suggest that social connections are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health.

The protesters are adamant that action must be taken, and are calling for the zoo to either be shut down or vastly improved. The protesters allege that the animals are being kept in poor conditions, with limited access to food, water and adequate living spaces. They have further accused the zoo of allowing visitors to harass the animals, and not providing them with basic medical care. In response, zoo officials have denied these allegations, stating that the animals receive regular veterinary care, have a balanced diet, and are given access to adequate exercise and interaction with other animals. The officials have also pointed out that the zoo is regularly inspected by government agencies, and consistently receives positive ratings. It is difficult to know the true situation, as both sides present valid arguments. However, it is important to acknowledge the importance of animal welfare, and it is equally important that all animals are given proper care and treatment, regardless of their location. If the allegations are indeed true, steps should be taken to improve the situation for the animals. However, if the zoo is providing adequate care, then any protests should focus on encouraging other zoos to improve their own standards, rather than calling for the shutdown of a facility that has been serving the community for years. Ultimately, it is up to the public to educate themselves on the reality of the situation, and to make informed decisions about where they choose to visit and spend their time and money. In the case of the zoo, we must demand that animals are given proper care and kindness, and that their welfare is the top priority."},{"instruction":"f the premise I always take the train to work is true, what can we say about the hypothesis I take the bus to work.?

Include information on recent legislation, statistics on gun violence, and perspectives from both sides of the debate.","output":"Here is an article about the state of gun control laws in the United States: Gun control laws in the United States have been a contentious issue for decades. While some argue that stricter gun control measures are necessary to reduce gun violence, others argue that such laws would infringe upon their Second Amendment rights. Recent legislative efforts to address the issue have faced significant opposition from both sides of the debate. In February 2019, the House of Representatives passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which would require background checks for all firearm sales, including those conducted at gun shows and online. However, the bill has not yet been taken up by the Senate, and it is unclear whether it will receive enough support to pass. The lack of progress on this issue is concerning, given the staggering statistics on gun violence in the United States. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there were 39,773 gun-related deaths in the country in 2019 alone. Of these, 24,090 were suicides, and 15,593 were homicides. There were also 417 mass shootings, defined as incidents in which four or more people are shot. Those who support stricter gun control laws argue that reducing access to firearms would decrease these numbers by making it more difficult for individuals with harmful intentions to obtain guns. They also point to countries with stricter gun laws, such as Japan and Australia, which have much lower rates of gun violence. However, opponents of gun control argue that such laws are ineffective and infringe upon individuals' constitutional rights. Many argue that if someone is determined to commit a violent act, they will find a way to obtain a gun regardless of the law. They also point to cases where guns have been used by law-abiding citizens to defend themselves or others. The debate over gun control laws in the United States is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. As legislators consider proposed bills and individuals on both sides of the issue advocate for their views, it is important to remember the devastating toll that gun violence takes on communities across the country."},{"instruction":"Remember to save your work frequently to avoid losing progress.","output":"Save work frequently to avoid losing progress."},{"instruction":"According to a new study, people who exercise for at least 30 minutes a day are at lower risk of developing heart disease.

Reduced poverty: A basic income can help reduce poverty and inequality, particularly for marginalized groups who may not have access to traditional forms of income. 4. Streamlined welfare system: Implementing a basic income could eliminate the need for some of the bureaucracy associated with administering traditional welfare systems. Cons: 1. Cost: Implementing a universal basic income would be an extremely expensive undertaking, and could be difficult to finance. 2. Disincentivizes work: Critics argue that a basic income could discourage people from working, leading to a drop in productivity and economic growth. 3. Stigma: Some people may view those receiving a basic income as “lazy” or “unproductive,” perpetuating negative stereotypes. 4.

The melting of glaciers is driven by global warming, as the Earth's temperature continues to rise. This is a major problem as the melting ice is contributing to the rising water levels, which poses a risk to coastal cities and habitats. Antarctica is the largest ice sheet on Earth, and it contains about 90% of the world's ice. The amount of ice lost from Antarctica has been increasing in recent years, and scientists warn that this trend may be irreversible. The melting of glaciers in Antarctica is a result of both warming ocean currents and rising air temperatures. This melting contributes to the global rise in sea levels, which can affect coastlines around the world. The rise in sea levels caused by melting glaciers in Antarctica can have an impact on the global climate. As water levels rise, the warmer water can circulate around the world and affect ocean currents. This can cause changes in climate patterns, leading to more extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or droughts, and can also have a significant impact on marine ecosystems. To combat the rapid melting of glaciers, international efforts are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adopt sustainable energy sources. This will require a concerted effort from governments, industries and individuals around the world. It is imperative that we take action now, before it's too late. In conclusion, the rapid melting of glaciers in Antarctica is a major concern for scientists due to the rising sea levels and its impacts on global climate. We must take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further melting of glaciers. It is the responsibility of everyone to take action and protect our planet."},{"instruction":"What is the predicate in the sentence: The sky is blue.

With concerns about the environmental impact of meat consumption and the health benefits of a plant-based diet being brought to the forefront, more and more people are opting to cut out animal products from their diets. One of the biggest drivers behind the rise of veganism is the environmental impact of meat consumption. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. In fact, the production of meat generates more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector combined. As people become more aware of the impact that their diets have on the environment, they are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint by cutting out animal products. In addition to the environmental benefits, there are also numerous health benefits to a plant-based diet. A vegan diet has been linked to lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Plant-based diets are also typically higher in fiber, vitamins, and minerals than diets that include animal products. As the demand for vegan options increases, the food industry has been quick to respond. There are now a wide variety of meat substitutes on the market, ranging from veggie burgers and tofu to plant-based sausages and chicken nuggets. These meat alternatives are becoming increasingly popular, with many people choosing them as a healthier and more environmentally-friendly option. Overall, the rise of veganism is having a significant impact on the food industry. With more people opting for plant-based diets and seeking out meat substitutes, companies are coming up with new and innovative products to meet this demand. As we continue to learn more about the benefits of a vegan lifestyle, it’s likely that this trend will only continue to grow in popularity."},{"instruction":"Provide a detailed description of this information: John Smith, occupation, accountant.","output":"John Smith is an individual who works as an accountant."},{"instruction":"Correct the punctuation in the following phrase: happy birthday mom","output":"\\"Happy birthday, mom.\\""},{"instruction":"Explain the process of photosynthesis.

Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the technology, as well as the potential impact on the global environment.","output":"Article: Introducing the Solar Car: An Eco-Friendly Solution for Our Transportation Needs The world is quickly becoming more environmentally conscious, and the automotive industry is no exception. In recent years, we have seen the rise of hybrid and electric cars that are designed to reduce carbon emissions and lower the transportation industry's impact on the environment. However, a new technology is on the horizon that has the potential to take eco-friendliness to the next level – solar-powered cars. Solar-powered cars are exactly what they sound like – automobiles that run solely on solar power. They use photovoltaic cells, which absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity, to power the car's battery. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about transportation and could play a significant role in the fight against climate change. One of the most significant benefits of solar-powered cars is their eco-friendliness. Unlike traditional gas-powered cars, solar cars emit zero emissions, meaning they have no negative impact on the environment. This is because they do not need any fossil fuels to operate, which are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. As such, solar cars offer a sustainable solution to our transportation needs, one that doesn't rely on finite resources that harm the environment. Another benefit of solar cars is their cost-effectiveness. While the technology behind solar cars is relatively expensive, the fuel costs are virtually zero. Once the car is purchased, it can run solely on sunlight, meaning that fuel costs are eliminated entirely. Additionally, solar cars require less maintenance than traditional cars as there are no fluids to change or internal combustion engines to maintain. Therefore, they may end up being cheaper to own and maintain over the long run. Despite the many potential benefits of solar-powered cars, there are a few drawbacks. For one, the technology is still developing and has yet to reach the mass-market stage. Solar cars are also limited in terms of their range and speed due to the limited amount of energy that can be stored in the battery. This could be a significant issue for long road trips or for drivers who regularly use highways. Furthermore, solar cars are heavily dependent on weather conditions. Only when there is enough sunlight, they can function effectively. Cloudy weather, nighttime driving or dark tunnels are challenges that affect the driving experience of a solar car. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of solar cars are undeniable. Not only would they lead to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation system, but they could also greatly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, the greater adoption of solar power in vehicles could lead to a massive reduction in carbon emissions, potentially reducing the impact of climate change around the globe. In conclusion, the invention of solar-powered cars is a game-changer. They have the potential to revolutionize the automotive industry and drastically decrease our collective carbon footprint. While the technology is still developing, it is exciting to think about the potential impact that solar-powered cars could have on our planet. As such, it is essential that we continue to invest in and develop this eco-friendly transportation option for the good of our environment and future generations."},{"instruction":"they and the kids the same in this sentence?

Foie gras, a luxurious delicacy made from the liver of ducks or geese, is produced by force-feeding the birds until their livers become enlarged. This practice, known as \\"gavage,\\" has long been criticized by animal welfare groups who argue that it causes immense suffering and distress to the birds. In some cases, birds are confined to small cages and force-fed several times a day, leading to health problems such as liver disease and a shortened lifespan. The ban on foie gras sales, which was approved by the New York City Council, will go into effect in 2022. It follows similar bans in California, which prohibited the sale and production of foie gras in 2012, and in several European countries. Supporters of the ban argue that it is a necessary step towards improving animal welfare standards and reducing the suffering of animals in the food industry. However, opponents of the ban, including some restaurateurs and foie gras producers, argue that it will hurt small businesses and jobs in the industry. While opinions on the ban may differ, it is clear that the issue of animal welfare in the food industry is a pressing concern. As consumers become more aware of the conditions in which their food is produced, there will likely be increasing pressure on governments and businesses to address these concerns and take steps towards more ethical production practices."},{"instruction":"my sister the same as she in this sentence?

When it comes to cleaning a cast iron skillet, it's essential to avoid using soap or dish detergent. Unlike other types of cookware, soap can actually cause harm to your cast iron skillet.

This divide is apparent in every aspect of politics, from casual debates to heated elections, and ultimately, it's harming the entire nation. There's no question that political polarization poses an enormous challenge to the functioning of democracy in America. Instead of working together for a common goal, politicians and citizens alike seem more concerned with \\"winning\\" their side than doing what's best for the country. However, bridging this divide is crucial if we want to make progress on the most pressing issues facing America today. One issue that demands our attention is the economy. With wages stagnant for decades and wealth concentrating among the elite, many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Finding solutions to these economic challenges will require cooperation between both major political parties. Another area of concern where ending the divide is necessary is climate change. This issue affects everyone in the world, and it requires serious collaboration between politicians to come up with comprehensive solutions. Moreover, if we want to address systemic racism in America, we must put aside political differences to push for justice and equality. The fighting between political parties leads to the exclusion of some voices that should be heard. In conclusion, bridging the political divide in America is the only way to make progress on the most critical issues facing our country. We must recognize that people with diverse political opinions can come together and find commonalities. The importance of cooperation, compromise, and mutual respect cannot be overstated, and we all must work together to make a positive change."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Natasha: Hey, did you finish that book I lent you?

Both nations had established a two-way travel bubble in April, which allowed for quarantine-free travel between them. However, rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in Australia have led to New Zealand suspending the travel bubble. The bubble was a major lifeline for both countries' economies and their citizens' mental and emotional wellbeing. The New Zealand government has stated that the suspension will initially last for two months. It will be reviewed regularly but may remain in place longer if Covid-19 cases in Australia continue to rise. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, said the decision was not taken lightly and was based on evidence and advice from health officials. New Zealand has so far managed to contain outbreaks of Covid-19 with border controls and a quick lockdown approach. The country has one of the world's highest vaccination rates, with over 20% of its population vaccinated. Despite this, it remains vigilant and cautious about the spread of the virus and is choosing to hold back from opening up to countries with a high number of cases. In conclusion, the decision of New Zealand to suspend the travel bubble with Australia is a major setback for both countries but reflects the importance of containing the spread of Covid-19. As we continue to battle the pandemic, countries around the world must be cautious and work together to protect their citizens and economies."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

Part of the reason for this change was that notes, on average, lasted only nine months in general circulation, while coins could last forty years or more. The government also believed that the growing vending industry would benefit from the introduction of a one-pound coin. The new cupro-nickel coin was introduced on 21 April 1983 and the one pound note ceased to be legal tender on 11 March 1988. Bank of England £1 notes are still occasionally found in circulation in Scotland, alongside Royal Bank of Scotland £1 notes. This is because Scotland has no concept of Legal Tender, and any Sterling bank note, of any age, may be used provided the trader is content to accept it. The Bank of England will exchange old £1 notes for their face value in perpetuity."},{"instruction":"he blind in the movie book of el","output":"Eventually, Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house.

A live shoe that is not a ringer, but comes to rest six inches (6'') or closer to the stake, has a value of one (1) point (alternate scoring methods give 2 points if the horseshoe leans on the stake. Aka a \`\`leaner''). If both of one player's horseshoes are closer than the opponent's, two points are scored. A ringer scores three points. In the case of one ringer and a closer horseshoe, both horseshoes are scored for a total of four points. If a player throws two ringers, that player scores six points. If each player throws a ringer, the ringers cancel and no points are scored. If two ringers are thrown by one player and one ringer by the opponent, the player throwing two ringers scores three points. This is typically called \`\`two dead and three'' or \`\`three ringers three'' for score keeping purposes. Such occurrences are called \`\`dead ringers'' and are still used toward the pitcher/ringer average. Back-yard games can be played to any number of points that is agreed upon, but are usually to 21 points, win by 2.

Magnetic field lines only exist as loops, they cannot diverge from or converge to a point like electric field lines can (see Gauss's law for magnetism). The magnetic field lines follow the longitudinal path of the solenoid inside, so they must go in the opposite direction outside of the solenoid so that the lines can form a loop. However, the volume outside the solenoid is much greater than the volume inside, so the density of magnetic field lines outside is greatly reduced. Now recall that the field outside is constant. In order for the total number of field lines to be conserved, the field outside must go to zero as the solenoid gets longer."},{"instruction":"has a man won great british bake off","output":"The programme was originally presented by Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, with judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s, Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected hunter/prey relationship. Their Jerry Mouse, an \`\`incurable scene stealer'', served more or less as the protagonist of most of the films; instead of being a \`\`cowering victim'' of his pursuer, Tom, he took delight in besting, and often torturing, his antagonist (though sometimes, Tom is just following orders or is even just minding his own business and is antagonized by Jerry).

If a judge dismisses the case or concludes the trial without deciding the facts in the defendant's favor (for example, by dismissing the case on procedural grounds), the case is a mistrial and may normally be retried. Furthermore, if a jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial and order a retrial as was addressed in United States v. Josef Perez, 22 U.S. 579 (1824). When the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, even if the prosecutor or judge caused the error that forms the basis of the motion. An exception exists, however, where the prosecutor or judge has acted in bad faith. In Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667 (1982), the Supreme Court held that \`\`only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to 'goad' the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.''"},{"instruction":"illegal to be paid off the book","output":"Unreported employment; working under the table, off the books, cash-in-hand, illicit work or (in UK English) moonlighting, is illegal employment that is not reported to the government.

The Berlin Wall stretched approximately 28 miles (45 km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120 km) around the edges of West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of the Berlin Wall in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of the Berlin Wall reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for the number of visitors to the Berlin Wall, as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the Berlin Wall received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit the Berlin Wall, which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so long as they were presented as educational in nature."},{"instruction":"does the snake river flow into the columbia river","output":"The Snake River is the thirteenth longest river in the United States.

Other occasions include retirement celebrations, housewarming parties, births, etc. The protocol for toasting at weddings is comparatively elaborate and fixed. At a wedding reception, the father of the bride, in his role as host, regularly offers the first toast, thanking the guests for attending, offering tasteful remembrances of the bride's childhood, and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together. The best man usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds. A best man's toast takes the form of a short speech (3--5 minutes) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity. The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom's expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom, amongst others. The actual \`\`toast'' is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy, healthy, loving life together. The maid of honor may follow suit, appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride. The groom may offer the final toast, thanking the bride's parents for hosting the wedding, the wedding party for their participation, and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids."},{"instruction":"was back to the future 1 and 2 filmed at the same time","output":"Filming wrapped after 100 days on April 20, 1985, and the film was delayed from May to August. But after a highly positive test screening (\`\`I'd never seen a preview like that,'' said Frank Marshall, \`\`the audience went up to the ceiling''), Sheinberg chose to move the release date to July 3. To make sure the film met this new date, two editors, Arthur Schmidt and Harry Keramidas, were assigned to the picture, while many sound editors worked 24-hour shifts on the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth before rescuing Lorraine, as well as much of Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Zemeckis almost cut out the \`\`Johnny B. Goode'' sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. Industrial Light & Magic created the film's 32 effects shots, which did not satisfy Zemeckis and Gale until a week before the film's completion date.

Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system). However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose."},{"instruction":"he incredible hulk part of the avenger","output":"The first film in the series was Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures.

The brain and spinal cord from the central nervous system are connected with organs that have smooth muscle, such as the heart, bladder, and other cardiac, exocrine, and endocrine related organs, by ganglionic neurons. The most notable physiological effects from autonomic activity are pupil constriction and dilation, and salivation of saliva. The autonomic nervous system is always activated, but is either in the sympathetic or parasympathetic state. Depending on the situation, one state can overshadow the other, resulting in a release of different kinds of neurotransmitters. There is a lesser known division of the autonomic nervous system known as the enteric nervous system. Located only around the digestive tract, this system allows for local control without input from the sympathetic or the parasympathetic branches, though it can still receive and respond to signals from the rest of the body. The enteric system is responsible for various functions related to gastrointestinal system."},{"instruction":"does tara really die in sons of anarchy","output":"When Eli leaves, stating he'll be outside, Tara calls for Wayne, assuming his truck outside meant he was in the house.

The blood--brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation, allowing antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the blood-brain barrier. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the blood-brain barrier include toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia (Lyme disease), Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions."},{"instruction":"do all toyota 4runners have 4 wheel drive","output":"Because the drive train was still developed from the same source, the available engines were identical: The same 2.4 L four-cylinder (22R-E) and 3.0 L V6 (3VZ) engines were available in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive layouts.

On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, 599 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na ) and chloride (Cl ) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/L. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/L at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F). The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured −2.6 °C (27.3 °F). Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4.

Americans on the western frontier demanded that interference be stopped. There is dispute, however, over whether or not the American desire to annex Canada brought on the war. Several historians believe that the capture of Canada was intended only as a means to secure a bargaining chip, which would then be used to force Britain to back down on the maritime issues. It would also cut off food supplies for Britain's West Indian colonies, and temporarily prevent the British from continuing to arm the Indians. However, many historians believe that a desire to annex Canada was a cause of the war. This view was more prevalent before 1940, but remains widely held today. Congressman Richard Mentor Johnson told Congress that the constant Indian atrocities along the Wabash River in Indiana were enabled by supplies from Canada and were proof that \`\`the war has already commenced...

The photoautotrophs are the main primary producers, converting the energy of the light into chemical energy through photosynthesis, ultimately building organic molecules from carbon dioxide, an inorganic carbon source. Examples of chemolithotrophs are some archaea and bacteria (unicellular organisms) that produce biomass from the oxidation of inorganic chemical compounds, these organisms are called chemoautotrophs, and are frequently found in hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean.

On Diesel engines the Diesel fuel is still needed to ignite the gas mixture, so a mechanically regulated Diesel engine's \`\`stop'' linkage and probably \`\`throttle'' linkage must be modified to always give the engine a little bit of injected fuel, often under the standard idle per-injection volume. Wood can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a wood gasifier is attached. This was quite popular during World War II in several European, African and Asian countries, because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil. In more recent times, wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries, or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine. Compared to World War II technology, gasifiers have become less dependent on constant attention due to the use of sophisticated electronic control systems, but it remains difficult to get clean gas from them. Purification of the gas and feeding it into natural gas pipelines is one variant to link it to the existing refueling infrastructure. Liquefaction by the Fischer--Tropsch process is another possibility."},{"instruction":"he movie split part of a trilogy","output":"The Unbreakable film series, also referred to as the Eastrail 177 Trilogy, is an American thriller, psychological horror, and superhero film series involving the derailment of the fictitious Eastrail #177 train.

Non-price determinants of demand are those things that will cause demand to change even if prices remain the same--in other words, the things whose changes might cause a consumer to buy more or less of a good even if the good's own price remained unchanged. Some of the more important factors are the prices of related goods (both substitutes and complements), income, population, and expectations. However, demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a good under the prevailing circumstances; so, any circumstance that affects the consumer's willingness or ability to buy the good or service in question can be a non-price determinant of demand. As an example, weather could be a factor in the demand for beer at a baseball game."},{"instruction":"an the nfl draft out of high school","output":"Rules only state that a player must be three years removed from high school graduation, regardless of what the prospective draftee did during that time.

Both tissues include a number of glial cells (although the white matter contains more), which are often referred to as supporting cells of the central nervous system. Different forms of glial cells have different functions, some acting almost as scaffolding for neuroblasts to climb during neurogenesis such as bergmann glia, while others such as microglia are a specialized form of macrophage, involved in the immune system of the brain as well as the clearance of various metabolites from the brain tissue.

The projector is either a Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing device or Sony's reflective LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon). A push-pull electro-optical liquid crystal modulator called a ZScreen is placed immediately in front of the projector lens to alternately polarize each frame. It circularly polarizes the frames clockwise for the right eye and counter-clockwise for the left eye. The audience wears circularly polarized glasses that have oppositely polarized lenses that ensures each eye sees only its designated frame. In RealD Cinema, each frame is projected three times to reduce flicker, a system called triple flash. The source video is usually produced at 24 frames per second per eye (total 48 frames/s), which may result in subtle ghosting and stuttering on horizontal camera movements. A silver screen is used to maintain the light polarization upon reflection and to reduce reflection loss to counter some of the significant light loss due to polarization filter absorption.

Cards speak for themselves: the actual value of a player's hand prevails in the event a player mis-states the value of his hand. Because exposing a losing hand gives information to an opponent, players may be reluctant to expose their hands until after their opponents have done so and will muck their losing hands without exposing them. Robert's Rules of Poker state that the last player to take aggressive action by a bet or raise is the first to show the hand--unless everyone checks (or is all-in) on the last round of betting, then the first player to the left of the dealer button is the first to show the hand."},{"instruction":"were the characters in blue lagoon brother and sister","output":"The story centers on two cousins, Dicky and Emmeline Lestrange, who are marooned with a galley cook on an island in the South Pacific following a shipwreck.

When this happens, it can cause serious problems. For example, if an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files, as is common on Microsoft Windows antivirus applications, a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable. Recovering from such damage to critical software infrastructure incurs technical support costs and businesses can be forced to close whilst remedial action is undertaken. For example, in May 2007 a faulty virus signature issued by Symantec mistakenly removed essential operating system files, leaving thousands of PCs unable to boot."},{"instruction":"here gonna be a season 8 of nurse jackie","output":"Nurse Jackie is an American medical comedy-drama series.

After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's U.S. market share hit a low 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \`\`a fine company that's past its prime'' and the cereal market was being regarded as \`\`mature''. Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers age 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior. The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, worth 3.7 billion at retail in 1983, totaled 5.4 billion by 1988 and had expanded three times as fast as the average grocery category. Kellogg's also introduced new products including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan.

Maps take place in the Star Wars galaxy, with battlezones varying in theme and size. Across the battlefield are multiple \`\`command posts'' (objectives) that act as spawn points, and can be controlled by either the player or the computer. Units can spawn from any friendly command post, and vehicles regularly spawn at their respective command posts when destroyed. Units can capture neutral or hostile command posts by approaching them and standing within the immediate vicinity for about 30 seconds. The time to capture quickens with more friendly units within the capture zone. Some vehicles act as mobile command posts, and must be destroyed as they can not be captured. On some maps (such as Hoth or Endor), certain structures also act as command posts that can not be captured. Command post capturing works differently on certain campaign missions as well.

In North America, grizzly bears previously ranged from Alaska down to Mexico and as far east as the western shores of Hudson Bay; the species is now found in Alaska, south through much of western Canada, and into portions of the northwestern United States (including Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wyoming), extending as far south as Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. It is most commonly found in Canada. In Canada, there are approximately 25,000 grizzly bears occupying British Columbia, Alberta, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the northern part of Manitoba. An article published in 1954 suggested they may be present in the tundra areas of the Ungava Peninsula and the northern tip of Labrador-Quebec. In British Columbia, grizzly bears inhabit approximately 90% of their original territory. There were approximately 25,000 grizzly bears in British Columbia when the European settlers arrived. However, population size has since significantly decreased due to hunting and habitat loss. In 2003, researchers from the University of Alberta spotted a grizzly on Melville Island in the high Arctic, which is the most northerly sighting ever documented. In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears. Population estimates for British Columbia are based on hair-snagging, DNA-based inventories, mark-and-recapture, and a refined multiple regression model.

In general, a pressure is a force per unit area, across a surface. A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force, which can result in an acceleration according to Newton's second law of motion, if there is no additional force to balance it. The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. When a fluid is in an equilibrium state (i.e. there are no net forces, and no acceleration), the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. In the case of atmospheres, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. In Earth's atmosphere, for example, air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth's surface, thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"he abdomen and the stomach the same thing","output":"The abdomen contains most of the tubelike organs of the digestive tract, as well as several solid organs.

The spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands also lie within the abdomen, along with many blood vessels including the aorta and inferior vena cava. Anatomists may consider the urinary bladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries as either abdominal organs or as pelvic organs. Finally, the abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the peritoneum. A fold of peritoneum may completely cover certain organs, whereas it may cover only one side of organs that usually lie closer to the abdominal wall.

During the day, they remain motionless, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their bellies, and shut their red eyes. Thus, they appear almost completely green, and well hidden among the foliage. The large red eyes serve as a defensive adaptation through deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed treefrog detects an approaching predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee."},{"instruction":"do all countries in south america speak spanish","output":"Portuguese is the majority language of South America, by a small margin.

Austin in 1823. The original ranger force consisted of ten men charged with protecting settlers from Indian attacks. Though the rangers of this era are today considered law enforcement officers, they rarely wore badges and were little more than volunteers; the Mexican military was officially in charge of law enforcement in the then-Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. The Rangers later served as a paramilitary force on the U.S.-Mexico border and in several armed military conflicts, including the Texas Revolution, the Mexican--American War, and the American Civil War. They continued to fill basic law enforcement and frontier protection roles until the close of the \`\`wild west'' era. In the early 1900s, they transformed into a criminal investigative agency. The history and legacy of the Texas Rangers has spawned numerous depictions in popular culture. The colloquial image of a Texas Ranger \`\`always (getting) their man'' has likewise made the Rangers a revered and highly competitive agency within law enforcement, with fewer than 1 in 100 applicants being considered for a single position."},{"instruction":"e any of the hogan's heroes still alive","output":"Robert Clary (born Robert Max Widerman; March 1, 1926) is a French-American actor, published author, artist and lecturer.

In games played under the Official Baseball Rules that govern all professional play in the United States and Canada, a balk results in a dead ball or delayed dead ball. In certain other circumstances, a balk may be wholly or partially disregarded. Under other rule sets, notably in the United States under the National Federation of High Schools (Fed or Federation) Baseball Rules, a balk results in an immediate dead ball. In the event a balk is enforced, the pitch is generally (but not always) nullified, each runner is awarded one base, and the batter (generally) remains at bat, and with the previous count.

It is used as a biological stain for microscopic analysis of cell biology and tissue samples. In the Gimenez staining method, basic fuchsin stains bacteria red or magenta, and malachite green is used as a blue-green counterstain. Malachite green is also used in endospore staining, since it can directly stain endospores within bacterial cells; here a safranin counterstain is often used. Malachite green can also be used as a saturable absorber in dye lasers, or as a pH indicator between pH 0.2--1.8. However, this use is relatively rare. Leuco-malachite green (LMG) is used as a detection method for latent blood in forensic science. Hemoglobin catalyzes the reaction between LMG and hydrogen peroxide, converting the colorless LMG into malachite green. Therefore, the appearance of a green color indicates the presence of blood."},{"instruction":"an coefficient of variation be more than 1","output":"The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation σ (displaystyle sigma ) to the mean μ (displaystyle mu ) : c v = σ μ . (displaystyle c_(rm (v))=(frac (sigma )(mu )).) It shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the population. The coefficient of variation should be computed only for data measured on a ratio scale, as these are the measurements that can only take non-negative values. The coefficient of variation may not have any meaning for data on an interval scale. For example, most temperature scales (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit etc.) are interval scales that can take both positive and negative values, whereas the Kelvin temperature can never be less than zero, which is the complete absence of thermal energy. Hence, the Kelvin scale is a ratio scale. While the standard deviation (SD) can be derived on both the Kelvin and the Celsius scale (with both leading to the same SDs), the CV is only relevant as a measure of relative variability for the Kelvin scale."},{"instruction":"do robins have more than one set of eggs per year","output":"The American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to its summer range.

It is a combination of an exhaust-driven turbocharger and an engine-driven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other. A belt-driven or shaft-driven supercharger offers exceptional response and low-rpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positive-displacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twin-screw and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger -- if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the low-rpm range -- the proper combination of the two can offer a zero-lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for small-displacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range."},{"instruction":"do mainland chinese need a visa for taiw","output":"Nationals of the People's Republic of China with residency (hukou) in Mainland China (including those who are non-permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macau and have relinquished their hukou in Mainland China) require prior approvals from Taiwanese government and are required to hold an Exit and Entry Permit prior to travelling to Taiwan.

Many scientists, including Pasteur, had unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation enzyme from yeast. Success came in 1897 when the German chemist Eduard Buechner ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this \`\`dead'' liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts. Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of biochemistry. The \`\`unorganized ferments'' behaved just like the organized ones. From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was then understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes that are produced by microorganisms. In 1907, Buechner won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work."},{"instruction":"a pinky a finger yes or no","output":"The little finger, or pinky finger (in American English), also known as the fourth digit, or pinkie, is the most ulnar and smallest finger of the human hand, opposite the thumb, and next to the ring finger."},{"instruction":"verhead press the same as shoulder pre","output":"The press, overhead press or shoulder press is a weight training exercise, typically performed while standing, in which a weight is pressed straight upwards from racking position until the arms are locked out overhead."},{"instruction":"j license an enhanced driver's license","output":"Enhanced Driver's Licenses are available to U.S. citizens who reside in the states of Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington."},{"instruction":"does everyone on are you the one get a million dollar","output":"Are You the One?, sometimes abbreviated as AYTO?, is an American reality television series on MTV, in which young singles try to find love.

Instead, they rely solely on compression to raise the temperature of the air to a point where the diesel combusts spontaneously when introduced to the hot high pressure air. The high pressure and spray pattern of the diesel ensures a controlled, complete burn. The piston rises, compressing the air in the cylinder; this causes the air's temperature to rise. By the time the piston reaches the top of its travel path, the temperature in the cylinder is very high. The fuel mist is then sprayed into the cylinder; it instantly combusts, forcing the piston downwards, thus generating power. The pressure required to heat the air to that temperature, however, requires a large and strong engine block."},{"instruction":"has dominican republic ever been to the world cup","output":"The Dominican Republic national football team is the national team of Dominican Republic and is controlled by the Dominican Football Federation.

Later, the idea was expanded to more complex populations, like humans. For the human population, more complex variables such as sanitation and medical care are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment. As population density increases, birth rate often increases and death rate typically decreases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the \`\`natural increase''. The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase. Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a regulating factor. Population size decreases above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the species concerned, but can include insufficient space, food supply, or sunlight. The carrying capacity of an environment may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including: food availability, water supply, environmental conditions and living space. The origins of the term \`\`carrying capacity'' are uncertain, with researchers variously stating that it was used \`\`in the context of international shipping'' or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms. A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the US Secretary of State to the US Senate."},{"instruction":"an a fully licensed driver drive with p plates o","output":"If either method is used, and the driver has obtained their licence in an Automatic transmission vehicle, an \`\`A'' condition is placed on the licence, for a period of 12 months.

Their coordination and strength improve. They play-fight with their litter-mates and begin to explore the world outside the nest or den. They learn to wash themselves and others as well as play hunting and stalking games, showing their inborn ability as predators. These innate skills are developed by the kittens' mother or other adult cats, who bring live prey to the nest. Later, the adult cats demonstrate hunting techniques for the kittens to emulate. As they reach three to four weeks old, the kittens are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food, with weaning usually complete by six to eight weeks. Kittens generally begin to lose their baby teeth around three months of age, and have a complete set of adult teeth by nine months. Kittens live primarily on solid food after weaning, but usually continue to suckle from time to time until separated from their mothers.

Even in spite of their huge firepower and protection, battleships were increasingly vulnerable to much smaller and relatively inexpensive weapons: initially the torpedo and the naval mine, and later aircraft and the guided missile. The growing range of naval engagements led to the aircraft carrier replacing the battleship as the leading capital ship during World War II, with the last battleship to be launched being HMS Vanguard in 1944. Four battleships were retained by the United States Navy until the end of the Cold War for fire support purposes and were last used in combat during the Gulf War in 1991.

However, in 1991 scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (USA) succeeded in making solid HCO samples. They did so by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy proton radiation, and then warming to remove the excess water. The carbonic acid that remained was characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid HO + CO mixture, or even by irradiation of dry ice alone, has given rise to suggestions that HCO might be found in outer space or on Mars, where frozen ices of HO and CO are found, as well as cosmic rays. It was announced in 1993 that solid carbonic acid had been created by a cryogenic reaction of potassium bicarbonate and HCl dissolved in methanol. Later work showed that in fact the methyl ester had been formed, but other methods were successful. Theoretical calculations showed that a single molecule of water can catalyze the decomposition of a gas-phase carbonic acid molecule to carbon dioxide and water. In the absence of water, the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid has been predicted to be very slow, with a half-life of 180,000 years. This only applies if the molecules are few and far between, because it has also been predicted that gas-phase carbonic acid will catalyze its own decomposition by forming dimers, which then break apart into two molecules each of water and carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"he national park service a non prof","output":"The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all national parks, many national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations.

In the state of Kentucky, the electric chair has been retired, except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, and who choose electrocution; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection.

The team that scored the touchdown then kicks off as normal. This is rare because of the infrequent use of the two-point conversion and the rarity of blocked conversion kicks, combined with the difficulty of returning the ball the full length of the field.

Though many believe the shotgun is a great firearm for inexperienced shooters, the truth is, at close range, the spread of shot is not very large at all, and competency in aiming is still required. A typical self-defense load of buckshot contains 8--27 large lead pellets, resulting in many wound tracks in the target. Also, unlike a fully jacketed rifle bullet, each pellet of shot is less likely to penetrate walls and hit bystanders. It is favored by law enforcement for its low penetration and high stopping power."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],z={key:0},R={key:1};function F(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
