However, they both share a love for knowledge and have a sincere desire to understand the world around them. They may bond over their curiosity and their love of science and nature. Double D might appreciate Lila's open-mindedness and willingness to try new things, while Lila could be drawn to Double D's intelligence and attention to detail.

Double D's tendency to overthink and Lila's tendency to space-out could conflict. Plus, Double D's friends, Ed and Eddy, might tease him mercilessly about dating someone who's not from their cul-de-sac.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"RECREATED ARTICLES OF THE DAIJCHEAN LAW CHAPTER 1: THE WORLD WITHOUT SUMMER Article 1: Abolition of Sexual Distortions - Any form of sexual approach or deviation is strictly prohibited and will result in severe punishment, including lethal injection.

Отношения: В B2B общение ведется между двумя компаниями, которые действуют на рынке как партнеры. В B2C компания общается с конечными потребителями и преследует цель продажи товаров и услуг. 2. Способ коммуникации: В B2B коммуникация ведется более формально и профессионально, чаще всего посредством электронных писем, звонков и встреч на переговорах. В B2C же компании часто используют социальные сети, SMS-рассылки, интернет-рекламу, телевидение и другие каналы для привлечения внимания к своим продуктам. 3. Продолжительность продажи: В B2B продажа может занимать много времени, иногда до года и более. Это связано с тем, что покупатель принимает решение не только на основе цены, но и на основе многих других факторов: качества товара, доставки, условий оплаты и т.д. В B2C продажи происходят намного быстрее, так как покупатель принимает решение на основе своих личных предпочтений и характеристик товара. 4. Объем продаж: Объемы продаж в B2B в целом гораздо больше, чем в B2C. Это связано с тем, что компании могут приобретать товары и услуги в больших объемах, а также существует большое число покупателей на рынке B2B. В B2C же продажи ограничены числом конечных потребителей, которые приобретают товары в небольших объемах. 5. Наличие персонального менеджера по продажам: В B2B обычно есть персональные менеджеры по продажам, которые работают с клиентами и помогают им с выбором товара и услуг, а также оказывают поддержку после продажи. В B2C клиенты обычно обслуживаются клиентским сервисом, который работает в онлайн режиме и обеспечивает быстрое решение вопросов.

CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD WITHOUT SUMMER It had been years since summer had disappeared. The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"The social norms portrayed in the world without summer revolve around efficiency, technological advancement, and coldness.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"The social norms portrayed in the world without summer are heavily focused on efficiency, technology, and coldness.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss.

CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD WITHOUT SUMMER It had been years since summer had disappeared. The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"It is unclear whether this is a benevolent dictatorship or not. The DBs, who have won three consecutive terms in Parliament and have a majority, define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race through science and technology. They have ensured high levels of comfort and safety for citizens. However, the society they have created has eradicated many human emotions and differences, with a strong focus on efficiency and coldness.

CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD WITHOUT SUMMER It had been years since summer had disappeared. The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"Based on the information given, it could be argued that the government in this world is a benevolent dictatorship.

CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD WITHOUT SUMMER It had been years since summer had disappeared. The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended.

Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"1.

Jahrhunderts. Sie ereignete sich in der Nacht vom 31. Januar auf den 1. Februar 1953 und betraf große Teile der niederländischen und britischen Küste sowie in geringerem Ausmaß Belgien.', 'Durch das gleichzeitige Auftreten einer ausgeprägten Springflut und eines schweren Sturms aus Nordwest stieg die Nordsee in Southend/Essex auf 2,74 Meter und bei King’s Lynn in Norfolk auf 2,97 Meter. Bei Hoek van Holland wurde ein Stand von 3,85 Metern über NAP gemessen, wobei dort der normale Tidenhub bei 80 Zentimetern lag; bei Brouwershaven stieg das Wasser auf 4,25 Meter, in Vlissingen auf 4,55 Meter und in Kruiningen auf 5,25 Meter.', 'Trotz groß angelegter Rettungsaktionen kostete die Flut viele Menschenleben. Nach offiziellen Angaben starben in den Niederlanden 1835 Personen, der größte Teil davon in der Provinz Zeeland; in Großbritannien fanden 307 Menschen den Tod, in Belgien 14 und auf See 252 beim Untergang einer Fähre und mehrerer Fischerboote. Der Sturm wütete auch über der deutschen und dänischen Nordseeküste, wo er als mittlere Sturmflut ohne Verlust von Menschenleben auftrat. Insgesamt kamen bei der Katastrophe 2408 Menschen ums Leben.', 'Der letzte beschädigte Deich konnte erst zehn Monate später, im November 1953, bei Ouwerkerk auf Schouwen-Duiveland geschlossen werden. Die Katastrophe wurde in den Niederlanden zum Auslöser eines beispiellosen Hochwasserschutzprogramms, des Delta-Plans. Die seeländische und südholländische Küste wurde durch die Anlage von Hunderten Kilometern neuer Deiche befestigt und die breiten und tiefen Mündungen von Maas und Schelde mittels Sperrwerken von der See abgeriegelt. Der Bau dieser gewaltigen Schutzbauten schuf eine ganz neue Infrastruktur und verband zugleich das bis dahin wirtschaftlich schwächere Zeeland mit dem mehr industrialisierten Süd-Holland. In Großbritannien führte die Katastrophe zur Planung des Flutschutzwehrs Thames Barrier, das allerdings erst 20 Jahre später verwirklicht werden sollte. Auch in Belgien war die Katastrophe Anstoß für umfassende Überlegungen; das Projekt Sigma-Plan wurde aber erst ins Leben gerufen, nachdem das Land 1976 eine weitere Flutkatastrophe hatte überstehen müssen.', 'Situation vor der Katastrophe.', 'Information und Warnung.', 'Im jetzigen Medienzeitalter der digitalen und elektronischen Nachrichtenverbreitung ist es selbstverständlich, in Sekundenschnelle Nachrichten und Neuigkeiten aus aller Welt zu empfangen und zu verbreiten. Im Nachkriegseuropa war das anders. Das Nachrichtenwesen beschränkte sich auf Zeitungen und Radiosendungen, wobei die Rundfunkanstalten nur in wenigen Ballungsgebieten ganztägig sendeten. Es gab in vielen Ländern ebenso keine Sonntagszeitungen. Das Fernsehen steckte in seinen Kinderschuhen und sendete nur wenige Stunden wöchentlich. Private Haushalte verfügten nur selten über ein Fernsehgerät oder Telefon.', 'Auch waren Wetter- und Flutvorhersagen nicht annähernd so weit entwickelt. 1953 gab es noch keine internationale Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der Wetterwarnungen, ohne Computer und Wettersatelliten waren die Vorhersagen ungenau. Wetterwarnungen waren den Behörden vorbehalten und wurden meist nicht an die Bevölkerung verbreitet.', 'Wetterlage.', 'Der Januar 1953 ging mit folgender Wetterlage zu Ende: Über Skandinavien lag ein umfangreiches Tiefdruckgebiet, während südlich von Island ein kleines, zunächst unscheinbares Randtief entstand, das in der Nacht zum 30. Januar in einer Zickzacklinie südlich zog. Gegen Mittag lag es über Schottland, wo es sich erheblich verstärkte und zum Orkan entwickelte. In der Nacht zum 31. Januar zog das System an Schottland und den Shetlandinseln vorbei, bevor es die Nordsee erreichte, wo gerade Flut herrschte. Über Dänemark und der Deutschen Bucht erreichte der Sturm am Abend des 31. Januar Windstärke 11, an der niederländischen Küste Windstärke 10. Er schwächte sich im weiteren Verlauf kaum ab; im Südwesten der Niederlande wurde 20 Stunden lang Windstärke 9 gemessen und ein enormer Windstau erzeugt, bei dem das Wasser nicht mehr abfließen konnte. So konnte es auch keine Ebbe geben; vielmehr drückte das Nordseewasser gegen die Deiche und unterspülte sie. In den frühen Morgenstunden des 1. Februar erreichte das Tief Ostfriesland und zog über das europäische Festland weiter bis in das östliche Mitteleuropa, wo es sich abschwächte. Zwischen dem Tief und einem sich verstärkenden Hoch über Nordwesteuropa setzte sich die skandinavische Kaltluft in Mitteleuropa durch. Die höchsten Windgeschwindigkeiten im Bereich des Tiefs wurden am 31. Januar im Norden Schottlands mit 180 Kilometern pro Stunde gemessen. Auch an den holländischen Küsten gab es verbreitet Orkanböen mit Spitzenwerten bis 144 km/h.', 'Dennoch war die Bevölkerung der betroffenen Küstengebiete nicht sonderlich beunruhigt, sondern rechnete damit, dass der Sturm nachts an Kraft verlieren würde. Selbst der Wetterbericht, der um 18 Uhr vom niederländischen Radiosender gesendet wurde („Über dem nördlichen und westlichen Gebiet der Niederlande wütet ein schwerer Sturm von Nordwest/Nord …“), ließ zwar auf eine unruhige Nacht, nicht aber eine Katastrophe schließen. Die Einwohner Zeelands und Südhollands fuhren umso unbeeindruckter fort, den 15. Geburtstag von Prinzessin Beatrix zu feiern und das Wochenende zu genießen, als sie den Wetterbericht eher als eine Warnung für die nördlichen Niederlande denn für ihren Küstenbereich verstanden. Es war auch beinahe niemandem bewusst, dass es sich bei der einsetzenden Flut um eine Springflut handelte. Gegen 22:30 Uhr hätte nach der Gezeitentabelle die Ebbe einsetzen müssen, doch das Wasser zog sich nicht zurück. Die Kraft des Sturms durchbrach die Gezeitenbewegung. Viele Menschen hatten bei Ebbe das Wasser noch nie so hoch stehen sehen; gleichwohl ergriffen nur wenige konkrete Maßnahmen, die meisten gingen schlafen.', 'Zustand der Deiche.', 'Rund ein Viertel der Niederlande liegt unter dem Meeresspiegel, und viele Deiche im Mündungsgebiet von Rhein, Maas und Schelde Südhollands und Zeelands (\\"Deltagebiet\\" genannt) waren schon seit langem schwach, schlecht gepflegt oder nicht hoch genug. Vor dieser Gefahr war von niederländischen Wissenschaftlern bereits in den 1920er Jahren gewarnt worden, 1929 wurde vom Rijkswaterstaat eine „Untersuchungskommission für Flüsse, Meeresarme und Küsten“ ins Leben gerufen, die 1934 eine Studie über die Folgen der Einpolderung des holländischen Biesbosch-Gebietes erstellte. Aus der Studie geht hervor, dass die meisten Deiche zu niedrig waren und insbesondere in West-Brabant den Sicherheitsanforderungen nicht entsprachen. So arbeitete Rijkswaterstaat an Plänen, um die Seegatten zu schließen. Zunächst aber wurde der Abschlussdeich (ndl.: \\"afsluitdijk\\") in der nördlichen Provinz Noord-Holland in Angriff genommen und 1932 fertiggestellt.', 'Aus finanziellen Erwägungen entschloss man sich, die als besonders gefährdet eingestuften Deiche nur mit einer aufgesetzten Betonmauer zu erhöhen, einer nach ihrem Erfinder \\"Robert Rudolph Lodewijk de Muralt\\" benannten Muraltmauer. Auf diese Weise wurden bis 1935 insgesamt 120 Kilometer Deich, vor allem auf der Insel Schouwen und der Halbinsel Zuid-Beveland erhöht.', 'Im April 1943 gab es einen außergewöhnlich hohen Wasserstand, an verschiedenen Stellen floss das Wasser über die gerade erhöhten Deiche. Erneut untersuchte die Kommission den Zustand sowie die Breite und Höhe der Deiche und Wehre, und erneut wurden zahlreiche ernsthafte Mängel festgestellt, vor denen die Kommission nachdrücklich warnte. Nach dem Gutachten bestand ein hohes Risiko, dass die Deiche einer hohen Sturmflut nicht würden standhalten können. Dennoch erfolgten außer weiteren Studien keine Verbesserungen. Stattdessen konzentrierte man sich auf die Einpolderung der Zuiderzee, weil seitens der Regierung die Landgewinnung als besonders dringlich angesehen wurde.', 'Die Situation verschärfte sich weiter, als im Zweiten Weltkrieg viele Deiche bombardiert oder von den Niederländern absichtlich beschädigt wurden, um die deutsche Besatzung zu behindern. Erst nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg, nachdem der Wiederaufbau in Gang gekommen und im Februar 1946 alle Deiche notdürftig repariert und wieder dicht waren, wandte man sich einer Erhöhung der kritischen Deiche in Zeeland zu: 1950 wurden \\"Botlek\\" und \\"Brielse Maas\\", beides Nebenarme der Nieuwe Maas, und 1952 \\"Braakman\\", ein Seearm der Westerschelde, aufgedammt. Anschließend sollte mit der Ausführung des Drei-Inseln-Plans \\"(Drie Eilandenplan)\\" begonnen werden, dessen tatsächlicher Baubeginn aber mehrfach hinausgeschoben wurde.', 'Nachdem seit vielen Jahren keine schwere Sturmflut mehr aufgetreten war – die Flutkatastrophe von 1825 kannten die Menschen nur vom Hörensagen, und die Flut von 1916 hatte fast ausschließlich die nördlichen Niederlande um die Zuiderzee betroffen – wiegten sich Bevölkerung und Regierung in Sicherheit und konzentrierten sich auf andere Investitionen, wie die Lösung des Problems der Versalzung als Folge zunehmenden Eindringens von Meerwasser in das Landesinnere, nachdem im Deltagebiet die Wasserwege beständig vertieft worden waren.', 'Die Katastrophe.', 'In den Niederlanden.', 'Das niederländische Wetteramt Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut (KNMI) verschickte am Samstag, dem 31. Januar, um 11 Uhr an die Gemeinden Rotterdam, Willemstad, Gorinchem und Bergen op Zoom per Fernschreiber eine Warnung vor', 'das in der kommenden Nacht erwartet werde.', 'Gleichwohl ging das Leben im Deltagebiet weiter seinen gewohnten samstäglichen Gang, manch ein Verantwortlicher, der die Warnung las, legte das Schreiben erst einmal beiseite, in dem Vertrauen darauf, dass die Deiche schon halten würden.', 'Um 17:15 Uhr entschloss sich das KNMI zu einem allgemeinen Warntelegramm folgenden Wortlauts:', 'Die Landesbehörden sowie die Städte und Gemeinden, die diesen Wetterbericht abonniert hatten, waren verantwortlich für das Ergreifen weiterer Maßnahmen.

In der Philologie ist er besonders als Herausgeber der Werke des spätantiken Rhetors Libanios bekannt. Weitere grundlegende Editionen lieferte er zu den Physiognomikern und dem spätantiken Rhetor Chorikios von Gaza. In der Archäologie trat er vor allem durch seine Arbeiten zur Laokoon-Gruppe und topographische Studien zu Antiochia am Orontes, Libanios’ Heimatstadt, hervor.

Er ermöglichte seinem Sohn Richard den Besuch der Bürgerschule und des Gymnasiums Augustum (ab 1852).', 'Nach der Reifeprüfung im Februar 1861 studierte Richard Foerster ab dem Sommersemester 1861 an der Universität Jena. Zu Anfang schwankte er zwischen den Fächern Theologie und Philologie. Er besuchte Vorlesungen und Übungen der Philologen Karl Wilhelm Göttling, Carl Nipperdey und Moritz Schmidt, daneben auch theologische, historische, philosophische, archäologische und sprachwissenschaftliche Veranstaltungen. Foerster war Mitglied der Burschenschaft Arminia auf dem Burgkeller.', 'Zum Wintersemester 1861/1862 wechselte Foerster an die Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Breslau, wo er sich ganz auf die Altertumswissenschaft konzentrierte. Deren Vertreter in Breslau hatten sehr unterschiedliche Profile: Friedrich Haase war auf Textkritik und Grammatik ausgerichtet, Martin Hertz behandelte weite Bereiche der lateinischen Literatur, Rudolf Westphal war Spezialist für antike Musik, August Rossbach verband Philologie und Archäologie. Von diesen akademischen Lehrern erfuhr Foerster vielfältige Anregung und Prägung.', 'Die Anfänge seiner wissenschaftlichen Arbeit standen unter Haases Einfluss, der Foersters Aufmerksamkeit auf die griechische Satzlehre (Syntax) lenkte. Vier Jahre lang verfolgte Foerster das Phänomen der Kasusattraktion bei verschiedenen griechischen Autoren. Seine Beobachtungen insbesondere an den Tragödien des Aischylos legte er 1866 in seiner Dissertation nieder, mit der er am 28. Juni 1866 zum Dr. phil. promoviert wurde.', 'Als Gymnasiallehrer: Beruf und Weiterqualifikation (1866–1868).', 'Nach der Staatsprüfung im November 1866 schlug Foerster die Lehrerlaufbahn ein, die sicheren Lebensunterhalt bot. Bereits seit Ostern hatte er eine Hilfslehrerstelle am Magdalenengymnasium zu Breslau vertreten. Ab November arbeitete er als Lehramtskandidat und unterrichtete Griechisch, Latein, Deutsch und Religion. Nach Ablauf des Probejahres wurde Foerster im September 1867 als Collaborator angestellt, womit er eine Übergangsstellung zwischen Kandidat und Oberlehrer innehatte.', 'Seine wissenschaftlichen Studien setzte Foerster neben seiner Unterrichtstätigkeit fort. Er veröffentlichte kleinere Abhandlungen über die Ikonografie der Göttin Hera und habilitierte sich am 23. Oktober 1868 an der Universität Breslau mit einer Fortsetzung seiner Dissertation für die Fächer Philologie und Archäologie.', 'Wanderjahre in Italien (1868–1870).', 'Kurz nach seiner Habilitation trat Foerster eine zweijährige Reise nach Italien an, für die er bis Ostern 1871 Urlaub nahm. Ermöglicht wurde diese Reise durch das Reisestipendium des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, das Foerster für die Jahre 1868/1869 und 1869/1870 erhielt.', 'In Italien knüpfte Foerster vielfältige Kontakte, aus denen teilweise mehrjährige Freundschaften entstanden. Zu denen, die er in Rom kennenlernte, gehörten der Maler Arthur Blaschnik (1823–1918), der Historiker Ferdinand Gregorovius, die Archäologen Heinrich Brunn, Karl Dilthey, Wilhelm Henzen und Wolfgang Helbig sowie der Berliner Philologe Rudolf Hercher.', 'Foerster nutzte die Jahre in Italien vornehmlich zur Kollation verschiedener lateinischer und griechischer Handschriften. Seine Schwerpunkte setzte er auf Anregung von Hercher auf die Handschriften des spätantiken Rhetors Libanios.

Daneben hielt er als Privatdozent philologische und archäologische Vorlesungen und Übungen ab. Sein erstes Kolleg las er im Wintersemester 1870/1871 „Über die Altertümer von Pompeji“. Zur Auswertung seiner Forschungsergebnisse gewährte ihm die Schulbehörde im Winter 1872/1873 einen halbjährigen Urlaub.', 'Foersters Vorlesungen und Übungen behandelten eine große Bandbreite von Themen: Griechische und lateinische Literatur, Sprachwissenschaft, Gerichtswesen, Wandmalerei, Topografie und Architektur. Da er als Privatdozent kein festes Einkommen hatte, war er auf seine Stelle am Gymnasium angewiesen, so dass er Forschung, akademische Lehre und Schulunterricht nebeneinander betrieb. Diese Situation änderte sich, als im Oktober 1873 ein neues Extraordinariat für Klassische Philologie an der Universität eingerichtet wurde. Diese Professur erhielt Foerster, da er der älteste habilitierte Dozent seines Faches war. Am 21. Oktober 1873 wurde er zum a.o. Professor ernannt. Zwei Jahre später wurde seine Stelle im Etat verankert und blieb damit für die Zukunft gesichert, auch nachdem Foerster ein auswärtiges Angebot angenommen und die Universität Breslau verlassen hatte.', 'Professor in Rostock (1875–1881).', 'Zum 1. Oktober 1875 ging Foerster als o. Professor an die Universität Rostock. Hier wirkte er als Kollege der hochbetagten Professoren Ludwig Bachmann und Franz Volkmar Fritzsche. Die schlechte Ausstattung der Seminarbibliothek, der geringe Etat des philologischen Seminars und die schwierige Zusammenarbeit mit Bachmann und Fritzsche erschwerten seine Tätigkeit. Foerster verkehrte vor allem mit den jüngeren Kollegen in der Fakultät, besonders mit dem Historiker Friedrich Wilhelm Schirrmacher und dem Nationalökonomen Hermann Roesler.', 'In der Fakultät trat Foerster als Verfechter der Lehrqualität hervor. Besonders ein Ereignis des Jahres 1876 gab ihm Gelegenheit, sich zu profilieren: Im Zuge der Plagiatsaffäre um den Berliner Bibliothekar Wilhelm Dabis, der 1873 in Rostock \\"in absentia\\" promoviert worden war, hatte Theodor Mommsen in einer Streitschrift die Praxis der Absenzpromotion angeprangert, die nur an wenigen Universitäten noch möglich war und nach Mommsens Ansicht eine Gefahr für das Ansehen des Doktortitels darstellte. Foerster bemühte sich nun darum, die Promotionsstatuten der Universität Rostock zu reformieren, und gewann dabei die Unterstützung vieler Fakultätsmitglieder. Sein Ansehen stieg dadurch innerhalb und außerhalb der Universität. Im akademischen Jahr 1879/1880 fungierte er als Dekan der philosophischen Fakultät.', 'Seine Forschungsarbeit setzte Foerster unverändert fort. Mit Unterstützung der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften reiste er 1880 nach Spanien, Frankreich und England, wo er zahlreiche Handschriften des Libanios und des Geschichtsschreibers Chorikios von Gaza kollationierte. Auf diesen Reisen lernte er den französischen Handschriftenforscher Charles Graux kennen, der ihn kurzzeitig bei seinen Forschungsvorhaben unterstützte.', 'Professor in Kiel (1881–1890).', 'Im Januar 1881 erhielt Foerster den Ruf als o. Professor der Klassischen Philologie und der Eloquenz an die Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, dem er zu Ostern 1881 als Nachfolger seines Schwagers Eduard Lübbert folgte. In Kiel waren die Studenten zahlreicher als in Rostock und die Universitätsbibliothek Kiel war besser ausgestattet, so dass Foerster eine fruchtbare Lehrtätigkeit entfalten konnte. Während seine Kieler Kollegen Peter Wilhelm Forchhammer und Friedrich Blass hauptsächlich gräzistische Lehrveranstaltungen anboten, konzentrierte sich Foerster auf die Latinistik. Im akademischen Jahr 1885/1886 war er Dekan der Philosophischen Fakultät. 1886/87 war er Rektor der CAU. In seiner Rektoratsrede \\"\\" nahm er eine Standortbestimmung und methodische Bestandsaufnahme seines Faches auf. Das Ideal des Altertumsforschers sah er in der Anbindung eigenständiger Forschungsarbeit an die Geschichte des Faches und in der Synthese von neuen und alten Erkenntnissen. Gleichzeitig warnte er vor einseitiger Spezialisierung, deren Folge sei, dass der Geist und Gehalt der antiken Welt nicht mehr empfunden, geschweige denn verstanden würde.', 'Trotz der günstigen Arbeitsbedingungen in Kiel ergriff Foerster gern die Gelegenheit, an seine Alma Mater Breslau zurückzukehren. Dort war im August 1889 nach dem Tod Wilhelm Studemunds ein Lehrstuhl freigeworden. Der zuständige Ministerialdirektor Friedrich Althoff zog sofort Erkundigungen nach einem möglichen Nachfolger bei seinem Berater Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff ein. In einem Brief vom 22. August 1889 empfahl Wilamowitz Richard Foerster. Entscheidend war für ihn die Tatsache, \\"„daß er schon in Breslau [als Privatdozent und Extraordinarius, 1870–1875] lehrerfolg gehabt hat, in Rostock sehr gut gewirkt (er hat die doctorschande dort vertilgt) und in Kiel allein wirkung hat. ich kenne ihn gar nicht, er hat viele gegner; aber die arbeiten, die er hervorruft,: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Altphilologie, Archäologie, Kunsthistoriker, Libanios, Laokoon-Gruppe, August Boeckh, Italien, Gymnasiallehrer, Kiel, Breslau"},{"instruction":"Напиши письмо от имени девушки из Украины мужщине, исходя из описания его анкеты прокоментируй.

more intensely than it had since the death of Franklin Roosevelt fourteen years before. Thousands lined up outside the National Cathedral in Washington to pass by his bier. Dignitaries from around the world, led by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany and Madame Chiang Kaishek of Taiwan, came to the funeral. It was broadcast live on the ABC and CBS television networks. Many who watched agreed that the world had lost, as President Eisenhower said in his eulogy, “one of the truly great men of our time.” Two months later, Eisenhower signed an executive order decreeing that in tribute to this towering figure, the new super-airport being built at Chantilly, Virginia, would be named Dulles International. Enthusiasm for this idea waned after Eisenhower left the White House in 1961. The new president, John F. Kennedy, did not want to name an ultramodern piece of America’s future after a crusty Cold War militant. As the airport neared completion, the chairman of the Federal Aviation Authority announced that it would be named Chantilly International. He left open the possibility that a terminal might be named for Dulles. That sent partisans into action. One of them was Dulles’s brother, Allen, who had run the Central Intelligence Agency for nearly a decade. Pressure on Kennedy grew, and he finally relented. On November 17, 1962, with both Eisenhower and Allen Dulles watching, he presided over the official opening of Dulles International Airport. “How appropriate it is that this should be named after Secretary Dulles,” Kennedy said in his speech. “He was a member of an extraordinary family: his brother, Allen Dulles, who served in a great many administrations, stretching back, I believe, to President Hoover, all the way to this one; John Foster Dulles, who at the age of 19 was, rather strangely, the secretary to the Chinese delegation to The Hague, and who served nearly every Presidential administration from that time forward to his death in 1959; their uncle, who was secretary of state, Mr. Lansing; their grandfather, who was secretary of state, Mr. Foster. I know of few families and certainly few contemporaries who rendered more distinguished and dedicated service to their country.” Then, in what became a newsreel clip seen around the world, Kennedy pulled back a curtain and unveiled the airport’s symbolic centerpiece: a larger-than-life bust of John Foster Dulles. It was on a pedestal overlooking an evocative reflecting pool at the center of the airport that the architect, Eero Saarinen, hoped would calm travelers’ turbulent spirits. Half a century after Dulles’s death stunned Americans, few remember him. Many associate his name with an airport and nothing more. Even his bust has disappeared. During renovations in the 1990s, the reflecting pool at Dulles International Airport was filled. The bust was removed. When the renovation was complete, it did not reappear. No one seemed to notice. After several fruitless inquiries, I finally tracked down the bust. A woman who works for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority arranged for me to view it. It stands in a private conference room opposite Baggage Claim Carousel #3. Beside it are plaques thanking the Airports Authority for sponsoring local golf tournaments. Dulles looks big-eyed and oddly diffident, anything but heroic. Dedicated by the president of the United States while the world watched, now shunted into a little-used room opposite baggage claim, this bust reflects what history has done to the Dulles brothers. A biography published three years after John Foster Dulles died asserted that “he provoked an extraordinary mixture of veneration and hatred during his lifetime, and since his death, in spite of a surge of emotion in his favor towards the end, his memory has remained contentious and intriguing.” That memory faded quickly. In 1971 a journalist wrote that although the Dulles name had not been completely forgotten, “certainly most of the éclat had gone out of it.” John Foster Dulles was, as one biographer wrote, “a secretary of state so powerful and implacable that no government in what was then fervently referred to as the Free World would have dared to make a decision of international importance without first getting his nod of approval.” Another biographer called his brother, Allen, “the greatest intelligence officer who ever lived.” “Do you realize my responsibilities?” Allen asked his sister when he was at the peak of his power. “I have to send people out to get killed. Who else in this country in peacetime has the right to do that?” These uniquely powerful brothers set in motion many of the processes that shape today’s world. Understanding who they were, and what they did, is a key to uncovering the obscured roots of upheaval in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. A book tracing these roots could not have been written in an earlier era. Only long after the Dulles brothers died did the full consequences of their actions become clear. They may have believed that the countries in which they intervened would quickly become stable, prosperous, and free. More often, the opposite happened. Some of the countries they targeted have never recovered. Nor has the world. This story is rich with lessons for the modern era. It is about exceptionalism, the view that the United States is inherently more moral and farther-seeing than other countries and therefore may behave in ways that others should not. It also addresses the belief that because of its immense power, the United States can not only topple governments but guide the course of history. To these widely held convictions, the Dulles brothers added two others, both bred into them over many years. One was missionary Christianity, which tells believers that they understand eternal truths and have an obligation to convert the unenlightened. Alongside it was the presumption that protecting the right of large American corporations to operate freely in the world is good for everyone. The story of the Dulles brothers is the story of America. It illuminates and helps explain the modern history of the United States and the world. ترجم النص بالكامل الى اللغة العربيى ترجمة ادابية","output":"عندما توفي جون فوستر دولس في 24 مايو 1959 ، لم ينعى الأمة الحزينة شخصًا بنفس الشدة منذ وفاة فرانكلين روزفلت قبل أربعة عشر عامًا. حضر الآلاف من الناس جنازته في كاتدرائية القومية في واشنطن. وحضر هذه الحفلة رجال ونساء دوليين، يتقدمهم المستشار كونراد أديناور من غرب ألمانيا والسيدة تشيانغ كاي شيك من تايوان. وكان يتم بث الحدث على شبكات التلفزيون الرئيسية ABC و CBS. وقد اتفق العديد ممن شاهدوا الحدث على أن العالم قد فقد ، كما قال الرئيس إيزنهاور في خطابه ، \\"واحدًا من الرجال الكبار حقًا في عصرنا.\\" بعد شهرين ، وقع إيزنهاور أمراً تنفيذياً يقضي بأنه تكريمًا لهذا الرجل الطويل، فإن المطار الجوي الكبير الجديد الذي يجري بناؤه في تشانتيلي ، فرجينيا، سوف يطلق عليه مطار دولس الدولي. تلاشت حماسة هذه الفكرة بعد رحيل إيزنهاور عن البيت الأبيض في عام 1961. فلم يكن الرئيس الجديد، جون إف. كينيدي، يريد تسمية قطعة فائقة الحداثة لمستقبل أميركا على اسم رجل بارد في الحرب الباردة. وعندما اقترب المطار من الانتهاء، أعلن رئيس سلطة الطيران الاتحادية أنه سيطلق عليه مطار شانتيلي الدولي. ترك الباب مفتوحًا لإمكانية تسمية المحطة بإسم دولس. أدى هذا إلى تحركات من أنصار دولس فأخت المتقدم طلب الجنازة، ألين، الذي أدار وكالة المخابرات المركزية لمدة تقترب من عقد. وتزايدت الضغوط على كينيدي ، وقرر أخيرًا الانحناء للضغوط. في 17 نوفمبر 1962، وبحضور إيزنهاور وألين دولس، شرف بإفتتاح مطار دولس الدولي الرسمي. \\"كم هو مناسب أن يطلق عليه اسم الأمين دولس\\"، قال جون كينيدي في خطابه. \\"كان عضوًا في عائلة استثنائية: شقيقه ، ألين دولس ، الذي خدم في العديد من الإدارات الرئاسية ، تمتد إلى الرئيس هوفر ، من كل الرؤساء بدءًا من ذلك الوقت إلى وفاته في عام 1959 ، خالهم ، الذي كان وزيرًا للخارجية ، السيد لانسينغ ؛ جدهم ، الذي كان وزيرًا للخارجية ، السيد فوستر. لا أعرف الكثير من العائلات وبالتأكيد قلائل الحاضرين الذين خدموا بكل تفانٍ من أجل بلدهم.\\" ثم، في مقطع الأخبار الذي أصبح مشاهدة على نطاق واسع في جميع أنحاء العالم، قدم كينيدي ستارةً وكشف عن الأشياء الرمزية للمطار: تمثال برأس ضخم لجون فوستر دولس. وكان على قاعدة تطل على بركة انعكاسية مثيرة في وسط المطار \\"على أمل أن تهدئ روح المسافر\\". نسي الكثيرون جون فوستر دولس بعد نصف قرن من وفاته. لدى العديد من الناس، يرتبط اسمه بالمطار ولا شيء أكثر. حتى التمثال الخاص به قد اختفى. خلال أعمال التجديد في التسعينيات ، تم ملء بركة التنعيم في مطار دولس الدولي. تم إزالة التمثال. عندما تم الانتهاء من التجديد، لم يظهر مرة أخرى. ولم يلاحظ أحد ذلك. بعد بضعة تحقيقات بلا جدوى، تعقبت تمثال. نسّقت لي امرأة تعمل لسلطة مطارات واشنطن العاصمة لأشاهده. يقع التمثال في غرفة مؤتمرات خاصة مقابل جهاز استلام الأمتعة رقم 3. يجثو السيد دولس الكبير العينين وغير متفائل وغير بطولي مطلقًا. قالت سيرة نشرت بعد ثلاث سنوات من وفاة جون فوستر دولس إنه \\"أثار مزيجًا مذهلاً من الولاء والكراهية خلال حياته ، ومنذ وفاته ، على الرغم من موجة العاطفة المتزايدة في صالحه في النهاية ، ما زال ذكراه مثير للجدل والتشويق\\". ولكن سرعان ما تلاشت هذه الذاكرة. في عام 1971 ، كتب صحفي أنه على الرغم من أن اسم دولس لم ينسى بالكامل ، \\"إلا أن معظم الأهمية قد اخرجت\\". كان جون فوستر دولس كما كتب أحد المؤرخين \\"وزير خارجية قوي وعنيد لدرجة أنه لا يجرؤ أي حكومة فيما كان يُشار إليه بشدة في عالم حر للقيام بأي قرار ذي أهمية دولية بدون الحصول على موافقته\\". وقال مؤرخ آخر إن شقيقه ، ألين ، كان \\"أعظم ضابط استخباراتي عاش على الإطلاق\\". \\"هل تدرك مسؤولياتي؟\\" سأل آلان شقيقته عندما كان على قمة قوته. \\"يجب أن أرسل الناس للموت. من هنا في هذا البلد في وقت السلمي لم يكن لأي شخص آخر الحق في القيام بذلك؟\\" تضمنت أفعال هؤلاء الأخوة القوية عددًا كبيرًا من العمليات التي تشكل حاليًا العالم. وفهم من هم وما فعلوه يمكن أن يساعد في كشف جذور الاضطراب في آسيا وأفريقيا وأمريكا اللاتينية. لا يمكن كتابة كتاب يتبع هذه الجذور في فترة سابقة. لم يصبح العواقب الكاملة لأفعالهم واضحة حتى بعد وفاتهم. وربما كانوا يعتقدون أن الدول التي تدخلوا فيها ستصبح مستقرة وازدهارًا وحريّة. وغالبًا ما حدث العكس. ولم تتعاف بعض الدول التي استهدفوها. ولم يتعاف العالم أيضًا. تحتوي هذه القصة على دروس غزيرة الثمر للعصر الحديث. إنه يتعلق بالاستثنائية ، وهو الرأي بأن الولايات المتحدة أكثر إخلاصًا وأكثر رؤيةً من الدول الأخرى ، وعليها أن"},{"instruction":"Перепиши текст так чтобы нельзя было уличить в плагиате.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"5 Good things made by the DBs: 1.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"5 Good things made by the DBs: 1.

Heroes and villains from each dimension must join together to save their universes and uncover the truth behind this chaotic crossover. Chapter 1: A Strange Encounter In the world of Team Fortress 2, RED and BLU teams face off in a typical battle for control. But suddenly, they are interrupted by a bizarre phenomenon. A bright, swirling vortex appears, delivering unexpected guests: Sash Lilac, Carol Tea, and Milla Basset from Freedom Planet, Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, and Amy Rose, and the Mane Six from Equestria: Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie. The vortex disappears as quickly as it had appeared, leaving the heroes in a state of confusion. Chapter 2: Unlikely Allies Fearing these new arrivals may be a threat, the RED and BLU teams decide to unite for the time being. They soon discover that the other heroes are just as confused and concerned as they are. After some discussion, the different groups come to a realization: they must join forces to return to their respective worlds and restore order to the interconnected universe. They form an unlikely alliance, comprised of mercenaries, anthropomorphic creatures, and magical ponies. Chapter 3: A Common Enemy The heroes' journey leads them to discover the main antagonist behind the merging of worlds: a powerful villain named Paradox who seeks to control all dimensions and time. Paradox has succeeded in recruiting some of the most nefarious enemies of each realm: Gray Mann from Team Fortress 2, Lord Brevon from Freedom Planet, Dr. Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog, and Lord Tirek from Equestria. These villains have united under Paradox's command to create chaos and instability throughout the multiverse. Chapter 4: Clashes and Conquests The newly formed alliance faces numerous obstacles and challenges as they traverse the combined dimensions. The heroes experience intense battles against each other's enemies, struggling to overcome unfamiliar foes and unusual settings. They learn from one another, adapting techniques and strategies from different worlds. Along the way, they acquire powerful artifacts from each realm that will play a crucial role in their ultimate confrontation with Paradox. Chapter 5: United We Stand The heroes finally confront Paradox, who greets them smugly in his fortress, located in a twisted hybrid of their combined universes. The final battle commences, seeing the heroes facing off against the gathered villains of all dimensions. Despite difficulties and their differences, the heroes fight valiantly, drawing on the strengths and experiences of each other's worlds to ensure victory. As the battle reaches its climax, the artifacts acquired earlier in the adventure are used to create a powerful force capable of imprisoning Paradox and his allies. Chapter 6: Restoring the Multiverse With the evil mastermind defeated and their enemies subdued, the heroes celebrate their victory. However, they are still left with the challenge of unraveling the dimensional chaos caused by Paradox. Working together, they use their combined knowledge to reverse the temporal disturbances and return each world to its rightful place. Bidding each other farewell, the heroes part as newfound friends, forever bonded by their shared experiences. Epilogue: Stories Shared Back in their respective worlds, the heroes regale their friends with tales of their incredible adventures in the chaotic multiverse. They express gratitude for the bonds they formed, the lessons learned, and the victories they achieved. And, as they return to their daily lives, the heroes carry memories of the crossover that brought them together - a brief but unforgettable brush with the chaos of dimensions."},{"instruction":"Напиши с использованием высокочастотных слов SEO-описание раздела сайта содержащего праздники, выходные дни и памятных даты в сентябре","output":"Отметьте все значимые праздники, выходные дни и памятные даты сентября на нашем обновленном разделе сайта!

As gripping and refreshing as the game felt in 2010, its release never generated enough revenue to cover the development costs. Remedy Entertainment went on to pursue other IPs in the years to come which led to the emergence of Control, and Quantum Break, but the team always had the looming urge to revisit Bright Falls one more time — believe me, they weren’t the only ones. Well, that’s finally happening now since Alan Wake 2 is in full-scale production, and it’s arriving way sooner than you’d think. The sequel’s going to be a part of the much larger Remedy Connected Universe, and oh boy are there a bazillion things to talk about. Remedy Confirmed Alan Wake 2 Is Fully Playable In an earnings report published by Remedy Entertainment in February 2023, the studio included a detailed roadmap of its upcoming titles, and it also mentioned the development status of each game. Remedy’s CEO Tero Virtala stated: “Alan Wake 2 is in full production……. and it is playable from start to finish.” That’s the first official piece of information regarding the game since the announcement teaser during The Game Awards in 2021. The teaser confirmed that Alan Wake 2 will be released in 2023, and concluding from the earnings briefing, Remedy’s right on schedule. A fully playable state means that the game has reached its alpha build and that it’s now in early beta. According to Remedy, this stage lasts 3 to 6 months for them, and it comprises mostly polishing the game with bug fixes, adding the finishing touches, and quality assurance before a title is market ready. Considering Alan Wake 2 reached this point in February, I’d be willing to bet that a Fall 2023 release date is what they’re aiming for. Alan Wake 2 Should Be Showcased Soon Sam Lake, writer and director of the series promised that we’ll see official gameplay for Alan Wake 2 during Summer Game Fest 2022, but when judgment day arrived, Remedy was a total no-show. The studio backtracked by saying a demo would’ve taken months of valuable time, and that they would rather finish the game instead. - Advertisement - It’s all but a done deal that Alan Wake 2 will release in 2023, and that leaves very little time for showcasing what’s new, so an in-depth look should be right around the corner. The best time for this would be either at this year’s Summer Game Fest (SGF) in June, or the rumored PS5 Showcase being held before then. Xbox’s Starfield Direct and games showcase is also taking place as a part of SGF 2023. The Elder Scrolls 6, and Gears of War 6 may make an appearance too, which is why there’s a lot of hype surrounding the event. But I think Alan Wake 2 will be featured during the PS5 Showcase alongside other highly anticipated games like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and Rise of the Ronin. In any case, there isn’t much time left, so it’s okay if you can’t “Control” your excitement anymore. This Time The Focus Is Survival Horror After years of speculation, Remedy has finally given in to the fact that Control, Quantum Break, and Alan Wake are set in the “Remedy Connected Universe“. As a result, it’s likely that Alan Wake 2 will share some similarities with Control’s gameplay mechanics, albeit with a focus on resource management and evasion tactics rather than rushing into battles like Jesse did. It’s been an unimaginably long time since the first game, so there being massive changes with Alan Wake 2 was always predetermined. The biggest confirmed overhaul is that it’ll be a survival horror game. But wasn’t that always the genre? Well, no, because I’d hardly call a game where I’ve always got loads of ammunition, grenades, and flare guns — nothing short of rocket launches against The Taken — a survival horror game. The original was more of an action game with eerie elements, but this time, Sam’s claimed that Alan Wake 2 will be Remedy’s first foray into the survival horror genre. It’s difficult to predict what their interpretation of the words survival horror will entail, perhaps something similar to The Evil Within or Resident Evil. The studio’s track record hasn’t ever disappointed, and if they can truly manage to send jitters down our spines, then they’re more than welcome to mess around with new ideas. Control Serves As A Prequel To Alan Wake 2 - Advertisement - If we’re being specific, 2010 wasn’t actually when we last saw Alan. Remedy has put many easter eggs about him in their games over the years, but 2019’s Control took that to a whole other level. Aside from the usual cryptic mentions, Control’s base game had a cutscene in which Alan could be seen using his typewriter, and there was even a case displaying his signature coffee thermos collectible. Following that, Control’s Altered World Event (AWE) expansion delved deeper into the enigmatic town of Bright Falls. The Federal Bureau of Control’s team journeyed to the town to investigate the unexplained phenomena that occurred, and encountered The Dark Presence. Among the hostile forces they faced was Emil Hartman, one of the secondary antagonists of Alan Wake 1, who had become a Taken and was subsequently captured by the FBC. However, during The Hiss invasion of the Oldest House, Emil’s corruption worsened, and he managed to break free from his confinement, eventually leading to his death at the hands of Jesse. During the DLC’s missions, there were numerous cutscenes of Alan and everything started making sense. The DLC ended with Alan exclaiming “you have been warned” to Jesse, but that isn’t even the best part. The final sequence showed an alert in the FBC of a new Altered World Event occurring in — brace yourselves — Bright Falls, with the date being in the future which indirectly hinted at when Alan Wake 2 will take place. Alan’s Always Been In Control If you’re a cult follower of the series, I presume you’ve picked up on the secrets in the teaser for Alan Wake 2. The foremost is that a banner of “Deer Fest 81” is visible in one shot, confirming that the sequel is set 13 years after the original. - Advertisement - Another massive easter egg is that the Oceanview Motel from Control can be seen in the background. The number of nods to Control specifically is insane. There’s a wild theory going around the fandom right now, and I’m convinced it’s true. It’s that Alan may have created Control’s story — spooky and scary is his signature writing style after all. It sounds bonkers when you put it like that, but when you look at the evidence it just makes sense. Alan needed a way out of Cauldron Lake, and to do so, he engineered the entire events of Control. The AWE expansion of Control also hints at this in great detail. And speaking of, the timing of Alan Wake 2’s release is simply too odd to be considered unconnected to Control. Alan’s name for the script he wrote in the original, which is also the game’s actual plot, was titled “Departure”, and coincidentally, if it can be even considered that, Alan departed from the world in the ending. Quantum Break hinted at there being 3 novels to Alan’s story titled “Departure, Initiation, and Return”. The events of Alan Wake 2 are teased to be “The Return“, so it’s possible Control was “The Initiation”. What’s being foreshadowed here is unpredictable, but one thing’s for sure, the people at Remedy are geniuses for creating games this intricate. Alan Wake 2 Is Only The Beginning There are limitless directions Alan Wake 2 could take, but since Remedy has established a shared universe now, Jesse might come to Bright Falls to aid our hero on a hiatus. Alan’s fight with The Dark Presence doesn’t seem like it’ll end anytime soon either. The Hiss, The Dark Presence, and the innumerable Altered World Events appear to be pieces of a much larger puzzle, so even if Alan’s successful in vanquishing his demons, that won’t be the end of it. Control 2 is in development as well, and should be ready by the time Remedy finishes supporting Alan Wake 2 with post-launch content that’s mentioned in their annual report. Similar to what the studio did by teasing Alan’s return in Control’s expansion, they could also set the stage for Jesse’s next big tussle with the supernatural. Guessing what Alan Wake 2 will be about or what it could potentially mean for future IPs within the universe is a rabbit hole that keeps getting bigger the more you talk about it, and Alan’s writer’s block has managed to infest me too, so this looks like the perfect paragraph to end my script on. For the time being anyways, until Alan Wake 2 finally launches later this year on the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"Five good things made by the DBs: 1.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"Good things made by the DBs: 1.

I hope do hope that at some point in the future, you will be able to communicate through the email addresses that we have for each other. I did not mind sharing my private history with you though as I mentioned, I would have preferred to speak with you privately through the email address. The reason why I have made such a connection with you is that, you have proved quite persistent in wanting my attention, and you also have been so expressive of what you would want from our union, namely the wish to be loved, and also invited to the UK as soon as possible. Your comments struck a chord with me as you seem to want a real meeting as soon as possible rather than the endless letter writing that seem to be the preference of so many of the other people on this site; I just want to reiterate that, I am here for a serious aim, and not just a Pen Pal situation that appears to be quite common. I must admit though that, a number of women here have been critical of men they have got to know however, when it comes to taking things to the next level, the men have not proved sincere, and have left the women very disappointed. I will admit that, I do still feel uncomfortable with the number of people vying for attention however, there has been something about you that has made me believe that maybe you are the woman I have been destined to communicate with having been here for some time. My work is still a demand on my time, and it will continue to restrict how often I am here, until I am able to change my career for one last time. I felt that due to the letters we have exchanged so far, I could be open with you regarding all aspects of most aspects of my life, no doubt, once we have met, I would have no problems sharing other very intimate and private areas with you. This is why I did not mind sharing with you details of my first love, as you are correct, I feel I can trust you with this. Thank you for your words of support regarding my quest to find new employment that I will find more beneficial to myself, and hopefully for our future if things continue to be positive between us. I believe that being positive at work can only have in turn a positive impact on our personal lives, and this is my aim, as life really is too short. I was happy to read you enjoyed me telling you about my first love, and you are correct, I only shared this with you as I do have a trusting connection with you, and I do hope we can both share more of our history with each other. The one additional thing I learned from my first love was her advice, which I still remember word for word today. Natalie said to me; \\"Steve, we are women, we are not aliens, and asking us for a date is not rocket science. So, whatever happens our us, if in the future you see a woman you like, and you fancy your chances, just ask her for a date, as even if she declines, you have not lost anything, as you never had her in the first place\\". When I met my wife many years later, Natalie's advice was still in my mind, I did not hesitate to approach my wife when I saw her. However, when she died in 2017; I was in a dark place, and had lost interest in life, doing only what I needed to do to stay functionable. It was only in 2021 that I decided to join this site following my years of dark turmoil due to my loss. I really do hope I can meet you very soon, as despite the language barrier, I believe we have a connection that is very positive, and that we should be more than happy to take to the next level. I will share with you in the future dates what I hope to share with you if you are broad-minded enough to come on adventures with me. I would more than love for you to be my partner in all aspects of life, and the sooner the better, as I believe we deserve each other. Kiss Steve","output":"Dear Steve, Thank you for your letter.

This time, the assignment takes place in Pondicherry, India, where the daughter of a prominent businessman has been kidnapped and held for ransom. Malcolm, under the guise of Big Momma, must infiltrate the ranks of the kidnappers and rescue the young girl before time runs out. As Malcolm arrives in Pondicherry, he quickly discovers the cultural differences and language barriers prove to be a challenge. Nevertheless, he adapts and finds ways to blend in with the locals, taking on various disguises to avoid detection. Along the way, he teams up with a feisty Indian detective who is initially skeptical of Malcolm's intentions but eventually comes around to see his worth and helps him navigate through the dangerous streets of Pondicherry. As Malcolm gets closer to finding the kidnappers' hideout, he realizes that the young girl is not the only hostage they have in their clutches. With time running out, Malcolm must call upon his wit and courage to not only rescue the young girl but also ensure the safety of the other captives before the kidnappers' plan can be carried out. In the end, Big Momma's undercover mission is a success, and the kidnapped victims are safely returned to their families.

Es decir, se centra en la tarea que se quiere realizar y busca la eficacia y eficiencia en la transmisión de la información. Ejemplos de F son las instrucciones dadas por un supervisor a sus empleados, las recomendaciones de un médico a su paciente, las indicaciones para realizar un experimento en un laboratorio, entre otros. - NF (No funcional): se refiere a la comunicación que se da en un ambiente más informal y en la que se transmiten sentimientos, emociones e ideas personales. El objetivo de la NF es crear un clima de confianza y cercanía entre las personas, y no necesariamente tiene un objetivo específico. Ejemplos de NF son las conversaciones entre amigos, las charlas agradables con un compañero de trabajo, los momentos de relajación entre colegas, entre otros. Ambas formas de comunicación son importantes en cualquier entorno, ya que ambas permiten una interacción fluida y efectiva entre las personas involucradas. Además, en muchas ocasiones es importante combinar ambas formas de comunicación para lograr un resultado óptimo. Por ejemplo, en un equipo de trabajo es necesario una buena comunicación F para transmitir objetivos y tareas, pero también es importante una comunicación NF para generar un ambiente positivo y motivador entre los miembros del equipo."},{"instruction":"Y en electrónica?","output":"En electrónica, F y NF pueden hacer referencia a diferentes aspectos de la comunicación: - F (Funcional): En el contexto de la electrónica, F se refiere a la comunicación digital orientada a la transmisión de datos de manera precisa y sin errores. Este tipo de comunicación se basa en sistemas de transmisión de datos que garantizan una alta tolerancia a fallos y una velocidad de transmisión adecuada. Un ejemplo de comunicación F en electrónica es la comunicación entre dos dispositivos a través de un protocolo de red, como Ethernet, que permiten la transferencia de datos de manera confiable. - NF (No funcional): En electrónica, NF se refiere a aspectos más subjetivos de la comunicación que no están relacionados con la transmisión de datos. Por ejemplo, la interface de usuario o la apariencia de un dispositivo pueden ser considerados aspectos de la comunicación NF, ya que no están relacionados directamente con la funcionalidad del dispositivo, pero pueden afectar la percepción que tiene el usuario sobre el mismo. En resumen, ya que la electrónica es una disciplina muy amplia y que incluye tanto aspectos técnicos como de diseño, F y NF pueden ser relevantes en diferentes contextos de la comunicación electrónica."},{"instruction":"Que relación tiene el factor de ruido F y NF en electrónica","output":"El factor de ruido (F) y la comunicación NF (No Funcional) no están directamente relacionados en electrónica.

Por otro lado, la comunicación NF está relacionada con los aspectos subjetivos de la comunicación que no están directamente relacionados con la transmisión de datos. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que tanto el factor de ruido como la comunicación NF pueden ser relevantes en el diseño y desarrollo de sistemas electrónicos. Por ejemplo, en el diseño de un circuito receptor de señales de radio, es importante tener un bajo factor de ruido para poder captar la señal de manera clara y precisa. Por otro lado, en el diseño de dispositivos electrónicos para el consumidor, la comunicación NF es una consideración importante para generar una buena experiencia de usuario y una percepción positiva del producto.

The cold had extended to all seasons, so it was no surprise that the sky was always gray, the rain fell with discreet regularity, and seaside hoteliers were failing one after the other. No matter which continent one was on, frost and rain had taken over the globe. On the other hand, the conditions of the metropolis had greatly improved. Tall buildings began to sprout up like mushrooms, true spaces tailored to humans where citizens felt protected and safe. The elections had been won for the third consecutive term by the so-called DBs: they loved to define themselves as a group dedicated to the improvement of the human race, which according to them could only be achieved by focusing efforts on science and technology. For this reason, they had always guaranteed high levels of comfort and safety to citizens. With a majority in parliament and an executive so well disposed towards technology, the Klavatrean State, which occupied the entire western strip of the American continent, soon became the most advantageous place for technology corporations, of which DST had the most luck. DST stood for Dob Systems & Technologies, a mega-corporation that had branches all over the world, with a net worth of around nine hundred billion. The reasons for this success were many and synergistic. Firstly, the founder, Michelle Suzanne Dob, had a degree in electrical engineering, and alongside her were the best minds of the time. Furthermore, DST’s products, although all electronic or alchemic, ranged from various sectors. The third reason lay in the simplicity and efficiency of its products. Dylan’s two-room apartment was equipped with some of these technologies. Internet access was provided by a power outlet, without the need for other wires, as was the case throughout the region. He had not had the opportunity to delve into it, but it seemed that the network signal was directly added to the meter. To improve the efficiency of such a system, phase and neutral were shielded according to the law. A plate controlled the door, interfacing with Dylan’s alchemic system and checking for the presence or absence of a 256-bit code within him. All he had to do was to put his finger on it, and MainDOB did the rest. Regarding the wristwatch computer, the same applied. The one in his head was more than enough, but sometimes there was a need for features that were not implanted. At that moment, Dylan was lounging on the single bed with bare feet, watching an interview with Kommander Aedostul, the head of government. Everything using only the system in his head. “Look around you, citizens,” said Aedostul with a suave, deep, and emotional voice. “Look at what we have created. Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it what you have always wanted?” Aedostul had well-groomed black hair, held back with gel. And just like Dylan, blue eyes. Aedostul had a more intellectual air and was a bit taller. He always wore elegant clothes. In that interview, for example, a white shirt with a navy jacket and a thin black tie. Dylan appreciated Aedostul very much. Not only for the similarity of their hair and eyes - which everyone noticed - but also because he was a man who never lost his composure, always ready to reflect intelligently on every problem. Moreover, Aedostul possessed a vast lexicon, expressed himself in cultured ways, with an authoritative and understanding tone. Dylan had interrupted the video, perhaps to hear the raindrops tapping against the window, when a dark blue panel with white writing appeared on MainDOB. COMMUNICATION INCOMING - VALIS There were two buttons underneath. One was red to hang up, and one was green to answer the call. Dylan focused on the green one. “What do you want?” Dylan asked. “Zanner and Rutis want to see you,” Valis explained. Dylan looked up. They probably had something to do with the last mission, and they wanted him to report or something like that. “Alright. Tell them I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” and here Dylan’s calm and cold tone came back into play. He heard Valis say something, but he had already hung up. He gave up MainDOB to focus on the desolation in his room. In front of him was the so-called Aedostul flag: a blue background with two black stripes on the right and a white one on the left. This flag was universally recognized as the symbol of the DB and was very present in public spaces or places of the State - such as the barracks to which he belonged - but it was rare to find it in private homes. At least not unless it was the house of an avid supporter of the party, like him. Aedostul had written some books, such as Lost Elite, Manifesto of the DB, A New Era, and others, all present on a shelf on the left. Dylan had read each one of them several times, but they were not enough given the complex mass of topics treated by Aedostul. So he lived with the constant impression of not having fully understood them, or that his point of view was somehow distorted. Dylan did not own many possessions, not because he could not afford them, but because he was not interested in them. There were some sports equipment, several other books, and a small collection of firearms and swords. Gas was too rare and expensive for civilian use, but not electricity: the stoves were induction and little used, as he mainly ate proteins and legumes. As a civilian, Dylan was used to wearing gray, blue, or neutral clothes, with his hair combed forward aggressively. The commando uniform, well kept to his left and already ironed, was solid blue, except for the sleeve outlets, elbows and shoulders, which instead were black. The colors of the Aedostul flag were recycled in every way possible - Dylan thought - and other uniforms featured different combinations. With the black military boots, the sworn commando who he used to be had returned. Then, ignoring the state of his home, he left, closing the door behind him. DYLAN NEAR read the sign outside the door, even though it was just a piece of paper printed, cut, and attached with double-sided tape. He wanted to add Commando, but it was prohibited by condominium rules. Anyway, everyone in the city already knew who he was and what he did. “Work calls?” said an old voice. It was Mrs. Yashmil, an elderly lady with unpleasant features and thinning hair. A quiet neighbor thought Dylan, if it weren’t for the volume of the TV always blasting. He just nodded at her. “You guys are doing a really great job. Having you as a neighbor makes me feel more relaxed.” Dylan gave her a fake and strained smile. “Scientia Perfectio Est,” said Dylan. That was the motto of the DB, which meant knowledge is perfection. He was well aware that it had nothing to do with it, but he suddenly felt like showing off. Impressed and taken aback, Mrs. Yashmil simply stared at Dylan with silent admiration. He made a comment, then headed down the stairs. He was on the ninth floor and everyone else used the elevator. But he wanted to keep himself in shape. Finally, he found himself in the city. A city with tall skyscrapers and digital lights in the background. On its left, two robots were caring for the condominium gardens and in front of it was a smooth and high-quality asphalt road. Even the lamp posts were in excellent condition and illuminated the street with a strong white light. All ground-floor shops had plexiglass windows where their products were displayed. At the end of the avenue, in a small square, a huge LED screen displayed advertisements. This was Nordent, a city, as the name suggests, north of the Nation, a few kilometers away from the Iron Mountain valley. It was in the midst of development, with scaffolding scattered around and towering cement and steel skyscrapers that appeared to want to crush the tiny commuters heading somewhere, amidst traffic lights, advertising screens, and LED lights at building entrances. At an intersection, the tram tracks were filled with serious and silent people returning from work, dressed impeccably as recommended. Yet, it was also a place where people felt extraordinarily lonely: Apart from Dylan, there were very few people left, dominated by the urban and artificial space. The verb of the blue era, as Aedostul called that present, was the domination of technology and science over humans. As a result, more things had been built – and were still being built – than were needed even in the best-case scenario. It was as if the air was saturated with some new energy that could only be released by following one’s own manual skills and ingenuity. It was not only difficult to imagine an “open” environment without overcrowded buildings but also without alchemical and electronic devices, which seemed to fill the world to bursting point. At every corner, there was always a flickering light connected to a computer, intent on signaling something. It was impossible to do without all those technological innovations: The entrances had plates similar to Dylan’s apartment, banking operations were now only done electronically, as were purchases, driving cars, registering somewhere, and even parking required online communication (each place had a virtual 3D model). One could thank MainDOB, nicknamed the universal operating system, for making everything work. The DST operating system had generated as a side effect a certain uniformity of design, both in electronic interfaces and object aesthetics. In return, everything was interconnected and compatible with any other machine, which was an absolutely fantastic result. MainDOB was also programmable to a certain extent, allowing automations to adapt to every need. But the real breakthrough was in biosystems like the one Dylan had implanted, where the boundary between thought and external information was not so defined. He just had to imagine something, like an image and transfer it to MainDOB, which could save it to the system disk or even share or print it. Someone - not him - could even have long conversations without speaking. Or watch a movie, listen to music without lifting a finger. The fact that MainDOB - among other things - also operated external equipment and its predisposition to interoperability could make possible actions that until then had been only dreamed of, such as turning off lights with one’s thoughts or using telepathy to see what was happening at home when one was away. Dylan knew very little about alchemical technology, but one thing he was certain of - and even children knew it - was that alchemy was made of the same substance as thoughts and as such, they changed. Hence the name alchemy. How it also worked with computers and electronic devices was a mystery that had always fascinated Dylan (and was fairly easy to unravel with a simple search), but he preferred to maintain the image of Michelle Suzanne Dob, the brilliant founder of DST, as a hero capable of doing the impossible. Another innovation of the DST were the small metallic robots working on a construction site on the right side of the street. The official name was an unpronounceable combination of numbers and letters, but everyone called them Dob’s Children. They were small aluminum and whitish plastic humanoid robots with lunatic camera-eyes, a round and bulging head, and an expression that expressed a tender mix of childlike surprise and shyness. They were not only equipped with rather agile joints for androids, but were also able to carry out any task that their owner had explained to them clearly enough. All one had to do was speak in natural language, and if a real person could understand, then a child could too. For example, in the case of an order like “wash the dishes and put them in the second drawer”, the child already knew that the drawer in question couldn’t be the pantry. If, once opened, it did not contain the expected contents, it closed it to try elsewhere. A marvel of robotics that DST competitors had not even come close to, despite numerous attempts. Like other artifacts of the company, they were equipped with an internal anti-analysis mechanism that overloaded the android as soon as someone tried to take it apart. Alchemy, moreover, by its very nature, was difficult to interpret. Dylan had promised himself to buy one as soon as he could afford it - he was holding back expenses just for that purpose - not that he needed it much, but it was one of those experiences to try. And who would ever say no to a faithful servant ready to execute any order at any time? “Hey beautiful,” the boy said. A real street punk, with scruffy jeans and a black synthetic leather coat. He had a blocky expression, a pointed chin, and gold earrings in his earlobes. The girl, on the other hand, said nothing. She was pretty small and gave the impression of being a journalist or psychologist. “Can you hear me, dear? I’m talking to you.” “Leave me… alone… you beast,” she said. In response, the guy grabbed the gray bag she had slung over her shoulder. “Come on, let’s just get to know each other, huh? Let’s grab a coffee…” “She said no,” someone behind them said, a deep male voice. The guy turned, only to find himself face to face with a blue uniform at his own height. He had to lift his head to see a face. Dylan’s face. That look was so cold and loaded with hatred… he felt an instant shiver. “People like you are trash, you know that?” The seducer tried to make a move, but it was no match for Dylan’s modules. “You’re not such a tough guy anymore, are you? See what happens when you act like a pig?” And the guy began to struggle like a caught prey. “Let go of me, let go of me… you half-man without balls!” “You violated Article 4 of the Daijchean-bis law. I should shoot you…” Then Dylan turned his gaze to the woman. “What do you say, miss? Should I shoot him?” “N…no! Don’t do it, officer!” “I’m a ranger,” Dylan muttered. It was unclear whether he was more disappointed because she had confused him with a simple policeman or because he had been prevented from shooting. Dylan snorted slightly, then gestured for the man to let go. He took advantage of the opportunity to try to move away. He couldn’t have done anything more wrong: Dylan was still holding him by the wrist. With his other arm, he raised his fist and brought down all the force he had on the guy’s elbow. Finally, he collapsed to the ground. With a broken arm. A piercing scream followed, while a circle of onlookers applauded Dylan. “You should get some pepper spray, miss. Or better yet, a gun,” Dylan said. The woman nodded, trembling from what had just happened. “Th…thank you…” She only realized afterwards that she had said those words to the wind because Dylan had already left. That little incident had stolen too much of his time. Such sexual deviant techniques were already rare events, but the Daijchean law - in force for about two years - had officially abolished that deplorable practice. Daijchean (the legislator) was a woman about thirty-five years old, a good friend of Aedostul and a former DST employee. The DB’s objective was to remove all sexual distortions from human affairs: they firmly believed that once freed from such distractions, human beings would develop the highest professionalism possible and focus on scientific advancement and efficiency. Any sexual approach, like the one Dylan had witnessed, was severely punished, or even with lethal injection. Another article of the Daijchean law established a sort of “scale of morality” that ranged from 1 to 10. Morally “healthy” people, i.e., cold and detached, had high scores, and if the score was below 6, they could be denied some career opportunities. Individuals with low scores were strongly discriminated against by society, to the point where Dylan considered them trash. The Daijchean law also advocated gender equality. For the DB, men and women were perfectly equal, to the point where it was impossible to assume whether an electrician or a mechanic was male or female. Clothes were now unisex, with colors ranging from blue, gray, and beige. For this reason, Daijchean was considered a heroine of female advancement in society. Moreover, the DB and society had become so focused on efficiency and coldness that they abolished terms like “he” and “she,” replaced by “it.” For example, if talking in the third person about someone, one had to say “it told me” or “it is tired now,” regardless of whether they were referring to a man or a woman. Human beings called each other using “it,” just like objects. Dylan vividly remembered a interview of Daijchean on the matter\\" “I’m neither a feminist nor a masculinist. To me, these concepts are meaningless. I’m interested in the intellectual value of human beings; the rest can disappear”. The law passed with surprisingly little opposition and rapid times (it was clear that it represented a milestone in DB ideology), followed by a media and social revolution aimed at what Aedostul had clearly defined as the annihilation of differences.","output":"MainDOB is a universal operating system created by DST, a mega-corporation that has branches all over the world.

These drugs target specific components of the fungal cell, which are either absent or significantly different from human cells, thereby minimizing harm to the host. 1. Azoles: This class of antifungal drugs includes fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole. Azoles work by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of the fungal cell membrane. The inhibition of ergosterol synthesis leads to an altered cell membrane structure and function, ultimately causing fungal cell death. Human cells use cholesterol instead of ergosterol in their cell membranes, so azoles do not have the same effect on human cells. 2. Echinocandins: This group includes caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. Echinocandins work by inhibiting the synthesis of β-glucan, a major component of the fungal cell wall. This leads to a weakened cell wall and ultimately, cell lysis. Human cells do not contain β-glucan in their cell walls, so echinocandins do not harm human cells. 3. Polyenes: Amphotericin B and nystatin are examples of polyene antifungal drugs. They work by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, creating pores that disrupt the membrane's integrity and cause leakage of cellular contents, leading to fungal cell death. Since human cells do not contain ergosterol, polyenes have a lower affinity for human cell membranes, reducing their toxicity to human cells. However, they can still bind to cholesterol in human cell membranes, which can lead to side effects. 4. Allylamines: Terbinafine is a common allylamine antifungal drug. It works by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol. This leads to a depletion of ergosterol and an accumulation of squalene, causing fungal cell death. Human cells do not rely on squalene epoxidase for cholesterol synthesis, so allylamines do not affect human cells in the same way. In summary, common antifungal drugs target specific components of fungal cells that are either absent or significantly different from human cells, allowing them to combat fungal infections without causing significant harm to human cells. However, some side effects may still occur due to the similarities between fungal and human cell components."},{"instruction":"What are the most effective antifungal treatments for a particular fungal infection and what factors should be considered when determining the appropriate treatment plan?","output":"The most effective antifungal treatments for a particular fungal infection depend on several factors, including the type of fungus causing the infection, the severity of the infection, the location of the infection, and the patient's overall health and medical history. Here are some common antifungal treatments and factors to consider when determining the appropriate treatment plan: 1. Topical antifungal medications: These are applied directly to the skin, nails, or mucous membranes and are effective for treating mild to moderate fungal infections. Examples include clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine, and nystatin. Topical treatments are usually the first choice for skin and nail infections. 2. Oral antifungal medications: These are taken by mouth and are used to treat more severe or widespread fungal infections. Examples include fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine, and griseofulvin. Oral medications are often used for infections that do not respond to topical treatments or for infections in areas that are difficult to reach with topical medications, such as the lungs or deep tissues. 3. Intravenous antifungal medications: These are administered directly into the bloodstream and are used for severe or life-threatening fungal infections. Examples include amphotericin B, caspofungin, and voriconazole. Intravenous treatments are typically reserved for patients with compromised immune systems or those who are critically ill. Factors to consider when determining the appropriate treatment plan: 1. Type of fungus: Identifying the specific fungus causing the infection is crucial for selecting the most effective treatment. Some antifungal medications are more effective against certain types of fungi than others. 2. Severity and location of the infection: The severity and location of the infection will help determine whether a topical, oral, or intravenous treatment is most appropriate. For example, mild skin infections may be treated with topical medications, while severe lung infections may require intravenous treatment. 3. Patient's overall health: The patient's overall health and medical history should be considered when selecting a treatment plan. Some antifungal medications may have side effects or interact with other medications the patient is taking. Patients with compromised immune systems may require more aggressive treatment. 4. Drug resistance: Some fungi can develop resistance to certain antifungal medications, making them less effective. If a patient has a history of recurrent or persistent fungal infections, it may be necessary to choose a different antifungal medication or use a combination of treatments. 5. Cost and availability: The cost and availability of antifungal medications may also be a factor in determining the most appropriate treatment plan, particularly for patients without insurance or with limited access to healthcare. In conclusion, the most effective antifungal treatment for a particular fungal infection depends on several factors, including the type of fungus, the severity and location of the infection, and the patient's overall health. A healthcare professional should evaluate these factors and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan for each individual patient."},{"instruction":"What is the most effective treatment for a patient suffering from a systemic fungal infection?","output":"The most effective treatment for a patient suffering from a systemic fungal infection typically involves the use of antifungal medications. The choice of medication depends on the specific type of fungus causing the infection, the severity of the infection, and the patient's overall health. Some common antifungal medications used to treat systemic fungal infections include: 1. Amphotericin B: This is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication often used as a first-line treatment for severe systemic fungal infections. It is administered intravenously and can have significant side effects, so it is usually reserved for severe or life-threatening infections. 2. Azoles: This class of antifungal medications includes fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole. They are available in oral and intravenous forms and are commonly used to treat a variety of systemic fungal infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis. 3. Echinocandins: This class of antifungal medications includes caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. They are administered intravenously and are particularly effective against Candida species, including those resistant to azoles. 4. Flucytosine: This antifungal medication is often used in combination with other antifungal agents, particularly amphotericin B, to treat systemic fungal infections caused by Cryptococcus neoformans or Candida species. The choice of antifungal medication and the duration of treatment will depend on the specific fungal pathogen, the location and severity of the infection, and the patient's overall health and response to treatment. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove infected tissue or drain abscesses. It is essential for the treating physician to closely monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust the therapy as needed. In some cases, antifungal resistance may develop, requiring a change in medication or the use of combination therapy."},{"instruction":"Which antifungal drugs are most effective in treating common fungal infections, such as candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcal meningitis, and what are the mechanisms by which they work?","output":"There are several antifungal drugs that are effective in treating common fungal infections such as candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcal meningitis. The choice of antifungal drug depends on the specific fungal infection, the severity of the infection, and the patient's overall health.

Azoles: This class of antifungal drugs includes fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole. They are commonly used to treat candidiasis and aspergillosis. Azoles work by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. This inhibition leads to a decrease in ergosterol production, causing disruption of the cell membrane and ultimately leading to fungal cell death. 2. Echinocandins: This class includes caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. They are primarily used to treat invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis. Echinocandins work by inhibiting the synthesis of beta-1,3-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. This inhibition leads to cell wall instability and ultimately, fungal cell death. 3. Polyenes: Amphotericin B is the most commonly used polyene antifungal drug. It is used to treat severe fungal infections, including cryptococcal meningitis, aspergillosis, and some cases of candidiasis. Amphotericin B works by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, creating pores that disrupt the membrane's integrity and cause leakage of cellular contents, ultimately leading to fungal cell death. 4. Flucytosine: This antifungal drug is often used in combination with other antifungal agents, particularly amphotericin B, to treat cryptococcal meningitis and severe candidiasis. Flucytosine works by entering the fungal cell and being converted into 5-fluorouracil, which inhibits fungal RNA and DNA synthesis, leading to fungal cell death. 5. Allylamines: Terbinafine is an example of an allylamine antifungal drug, which is commonly used to treat dermatophyte infections. Allylamines work by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase, which is involved in ergosterol synthesis. This inhibition leads to a decrease in ergosterol production and an accumulation of squalene, causing disruption of the cell membrane and ultimately leading to fungal cell death.

Amphotericin B is effective against a broad spectrum of fungal pathogens, including Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus species. 4. Flucytosine (5-FC): This antifungal agent is often used in combination with other antifungal drugs, particularly amphotericin B. Flucytosine is a pyrimidine analog that gets converted into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) within fungal cells. 5-FU then inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis, leading to cell death. Flucytosine is primarily effective against Candida and Cryptococcus species. 5. Allylamines: Terbinafine is an example of an allylamine antifungal drug. It works by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase, which is involved in ergosterol synthesis.

The most effective antifungal agents for treating candidiasis include: 1. Azoles: These are the most commonly used antifungal agents for treating candidiasis. They include fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole. Azoles work by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of the fungal cell membrane. This disruption leads to altered membrane permeability and eventually, fungal cell death. 2. Echinocandins: These are a newer class of antifungal agents that include caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. Echinocandins work by inhibiting the synthesis of β-(1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. This results in cell wall instability and ultimately, fungal cell death. Echinocandins are particularly effective against invasive candidiasis and are often used as first-line therapy for severe infections. 3. Polyenes: This class of antifungal agents includes amphotericin B and nystatin. Polyenes work by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, creating pores that lead to increased membrane permeability, leakage of cellular contents, and ultimately, fungal cell death. Amphotericin B is a potent antifungal agent used for severe systemic candidiasis, but its use is limited by its toxicity. 4. Allylamines: Terbinafine is the most common allylamine antifungal agent. It works by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase, which is involved in ergosterol synthesis. This leads to a deficiency of ergosterol and an accumulation of squalene, causing fungal cell death. Terbinafine is primarily used for treating dermatophyte infections but can also be effective against some Candida species. 5. Flucytosine: This antifungal agent is a pyrimidine analogue that works by inhibiting fungal DNA and RNA synthesis. Flucytosine is often used in combination with other antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B, to treat severe or resistant Candida infections. The choice of antifungal agent depends on the severity of the infection, the specific Candida species involved, the patient's immune status, and the potential for drug interactions or side effects. In some cases, a combination of antifungal agents may be used to enhance efficacy and prevent the development of resistance."},{"instruction":"What is the most effective treatment for the common fungal infection called candidiasis, and what are the potential side effects of this treatment?","output":"The most effective treatment for candidiasis, a common fungal infection caused by the Candida species, usually involves the use of antifungal medications.

They contribute to the development of chronic infections in humans through several specific mechanisms: 1. Enhanced resistance to antibiotics: Bacteria within biofilms exhibit increased resistance to antibiotics compared to their planktonic (free-floating) counterparts. This is due to the EPS matrix, which acts as a barrier that prevents or slows down the penetration of antibiotics, and the presence of persister cells, which are dormant bacterial cells that are less susceptible to antibiotics. 2. Evasion of the host immune system: The EPS matrix also provides protection against the host immune system by preventing immune cells from reaching and attacking the bacteria. Additionally, biofilms can modulate the host immune response, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. 3. Genetic exchange and horizontal gene transfer: Biofilms provide an environment that facilitates the exchange of genetic material between bacteria, including the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors. This can lead to the emergence of more resistant and virulent strains. 4. Persistence and reactivation: Biofilms can persist on both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) surfaces, allowing them to survive for extended periods. They can also disperse planktonic cells that can colonize new sites and form new biofilms, leading to the spread of infection. Potential strategies for preventing, diagnosing, and treating biofilm-associated infections include: 1. Prevention: Developing new materials and coatings that prevent biofilm formation on medical devices and implants, as well as promoting proper hygiene and disinfection practices in healthcare settings. 2. Early diagnosis: Developing new diagnostic tools and techniques that can rapidly and accurately detect biofilm-associated infections, such as imaging techniques, biomarkers, and molecular methods. 3. Targeting biofilm-specific properties: Designing new therapeutic agents that specifically target biofilm-related features, such as the EPS matrix, quorum sensing (cell-to-cell communication), and persister cells. 4. Combination therapy: Using a combination of antibiotics and other agents, such as enzymes that degrade the EPS matrix, to enhance the penetration and efficacy of antibiotics. 5. Immunotherapy: Developing vaccines or immune-based therapies that target biofilm-associated antigens or modulate the host immune response to better combat biofilm infections. 6.

Biofilms are complex, structured communities of bacterial cells that are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. This matrix is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The formation of biofilms provides several advantages to bacteria, including enhanced nutrient availability, protection from environmental stresses, and increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. There are several mechanisms by which biofilms contribute to antibiotic resistance: 1. Limited penetration of antibiotics: The EPS matrix can act as a physical barrier that restricts the penetration of antibiotics into the biofilm. This results in a reduced concentration of the antibiotic reaching the bacterial cells, which may be insufficient to kill or inhibit their growth. 2. Altered microenvironment: The biofilm microenvironment can create local conditions, such as low oxygen levels and acidic pH, that can reduce the effectiveness of certain antibiotics. For example, aminoglycoside antibiotics require oxygen to be taken up by bacterial cells, and their activity is reduced under low oxygen conditions. 3. Slow growth and dormancy: Bacteria within biofilms often exhibit slow growth rates and can enter a dormant state, known as persister cells. Many antibiotics target actively growing cells, so slow-growing or dormant cells can be less susceptible to antibiotic treatment. 4. Horizontal gene transfer: Biofilms provide an environment that facilitates the exchange of genetic material between bacterial cells through processes such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. This can lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria within the biofilm. 5. Enhanced mutation rates: Bacteria within biofilms may exhibit increased mutation rates, which can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance through the selection of resistant mutants. The potential implications of biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance for human health are significant: 1. Treatment failure: The increased resistance of biofilm-associated infections to antibiotics can lead to treatment failure, prolonged illness, and increased morbidity and mortality. 2. Chronic infections: Biofilm-associated infections are often difficult to eradicate and can become chronic, requiring long-term antibiotic therapy and repeated treatments. 3. Medical device-related infections: Biofilms can form on medical devices, such as catheters, prosthetic joints, and heart valves, leading to device-related infections that are difficult to treat and may require surgical intervention. 4. Increased healthcare costs: The increased difficulty in treating biofilm-associated infections can result in longer hospital stays, more intensive treatments, and increased healthcare costs. To address the challenges posed by biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance, researchers are exploring various strategies, including the development of new antibiotics that can penetrate biofilms, the use of combination therapies, and the development of anti-biofilm agents that can disrupt or prevent biofilm formation. Additionally, improved diagnostic techniques to detect biofilm-associated infections and increased awareness among healthcare professionals about the importance of biofilms in antibiotic resistance are crucial in managing and preventing these infections."},{"instruction":"w can the formation and persistence of bacterial biofilms in the human body be prevented or treated in order to reduce their negative impact on human health?","output":"Bacterial biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms that adhere to surfaces and produce a protective extracellular matrix.

The structure and composition of bacterial biofilms contribute to their ability to evade the immune system and resist antibiotic treatment in several ways, leading to adverse human health outcomes such as chronic infections and increased mortality rates. 1. Physical barrier: The EPS matrix, composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, forms a protective barrier around the bacterial cells within the biofilm. This barrier limits the penetration of immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, and prevents them from effectively phagocytosing and killing the bacteria. The EPS matrix also hinders the diffusion of antibiotics, reducing their concentration within the biofilm and limiting their effectiveness. 2. Altered microenvironment: The biofilm structure creates a heterogeneous microenvironment with gradients of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products. Bacteria in different regions of the biofilm experience different environmental conditions, leading to phenotypic variation and the development of subpopulations with distinct characteristics. Some of these subpopulations may be more resistant to immune attack or antibiotic treatment. 3. Slow growth and dormancy: Bacteria within biofilms often exhibit slower growth rates compared to their planktonic counterparts. Slow-growing or dormant bacteria, known as persister cells, are less susceptible to antibiotics that target actively growing cells, such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Additionally, the immune system is less effective at targeting and eliminating slow-growing or dormant bacteria. 4. Horizontal gene transfer: The close proximity of bacterial cells within biofilms facilitates the exchange of genetic material, including antibiotic resistance genes, through processes such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. This horizontal gene transfer can lead to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance within the biofilm community. 5. Enhanced stress response and adaptive resistance: Bacteria within biofilms exhibit an increased ability to withstand environmental stress, including exposure to antibiotics. This enhanced stress response is due to the activation of specific genes and regulatory networks that promote survival under adverse conditions. Moreover, bacteria within biofilms can develop adaptive resistance, a reversible, non-genetic form of resistance, in response to sublethal antibiotic exposure. 6. Quorum sensing and immune evasion: Bacteria within biofilms communicate with each other through a process called quorum sensing, which involves the production and detection of signaling molecules called autoinducers. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to coordinate their behavior, including the production of virulence factors and the modulation of immune responses. Some bacterial species can interfere with the host's immune signaling pathways, leading to immune evasion and persistent infections. In summary, the structure and composition of bacterial biofilms contribute to their ability to evade the immune system and resist antibiotic treatment through the formation of a protective EPS matrix, the creation of a heterogeneous microenvironment, the presence of slow-growing or dormant cells, horizontal gene transfer, enhanced stress response and adaptive resistance, and quorum sensing-mediated immune evasion. These factors contribute to the persistence of biofilm-associated infections and their resistance to conventional treatments, leading to adverse human health outcomes such as chronic infections and increased mortality rates."},{"instruction":"One precise problem for the student to solve could be: \\"How do bacterial biofilms contribute to chronic infections in the human body and what strategies can be developed to prevent or treat this issue?","output":"Bacterial biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms that adhere to surfaces and produce a protective extracellular matrix. In the human body, biofilms can form on various surfaces, such as medical devices, tissues, and organs, leading to chronic infections. The biofilm structure provides bacteria with increased resistance to the host's immune system and antibiotics, making it difficult to eradicate the infection. To solve this problem, we can approach it in the following steps: 1. Understand the formation and structure of bacterial biofilms: Biofilms develop through a series of stages, including initial attachment, microcolony formation, maturation, and dispersion. The extracellular matrix, composed of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA, provides structural stability and protection to the bacterial cells. Understanding the mechanisms behind biofilm formation and structure can help identify potential targets for intervention. 2. Investigate the role of biofilms in chronic infections: Research has shown that biofilms are involved in various chronic infections, such as cystic fibrosis, periodontitis, and chronic wounds. Identifying the specific bacterial species and their role in the infection can help develop targeted therapies. 3. Develop strategies to prevent biofilm formation: One approach to prevent biofilm formation is to develop surface coatings or materials that inhibit bacterial attachment and colonization. For example, antimicrobial coatings on medical devices can reduce the risk of device-related infections. Additionally, understanding the signaling pathways involved in biofilm formation can lead to the development of molecules that interfere with these processes, preventing biofilm development. 4. Develop strategies to treat existing biofilms: Since biofilms are resistant to conventional antibiotics, alternative treatment strategies are needed. Some potential approaches include:    a. Enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix: By breaking down the matrix, the biofilm structure can be disrupted, making the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics and the host's immune system.        b. Targeting bacterial communication: Bacteria within biofilms communicate through a process called quorum sensing. Inhibiting quorum sensing can prevent biofilm maturation and promote dispersion, making the bacteria more vulnerable to treatment.        c. Combination therapies: Using a combination of antibiotics and other agents, such as matrix-degrading enzymes or quorum sensing inhibitors, can increase the effectiveness of treatment against biofilms.        d. Phage therapy: Bacteriophages, or viruses that infect bacteria, can be used to target and kill specific bacterial species within biofilms. 5. Evaluate the effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies: Conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the efficacy of these strategies is crucial.

This process, known as horizontal gene transfer, can lead to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance within the biofilm community and potentially to other bacteria in the hospital setting. 4. Nosocomial infections: The persistence of biofilms on medical devices and hospital surfaces increases the risk of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections. Patients with compromised immune systems, such as those in intensive care units or undergoing surgery, are particularly vulnerable to these infections. The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within biofilms makes these infections more difficult to treat, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. To mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance and nosocomial infections associated with bacterial biofilms, it is essential to implement effective infection control measures, such as proper sterilization of medical equipment, regular cleaning and disinfection of hospital surfaces, and the development of new antimicrobial strategies targeting biofilms. Additionally, research into understanding the mechanisms of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance can help in the development of novel therapeutic approaches to combat these persistent infections."},{"instruction":"What are the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation and how do they contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance, and ultimately impact human health?","output":"Bacterial biofilm formation is a complex, multi-step process that allows bacteria to adhere to surfaces, aggregate, and develop a protective extracellular matrix. This process contributes to antibiotic resistance and can have significant impacts on human health. The mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation can be broadly divided into the following stages: 1. Initial attachment: Bacteria in their planktonic (free-swimming) state come into contact with a surface, such as a medical device, tissue, or environmental surface. The attachment is facilitated by various bacterial surface structures, such as flagella, pili, and adhesins, which interact with the surface and promote bacterial adhesion. 2. Irreversible attachment: Once attached, bacteria begin to produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which include polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. These substances strengthen the attachment of bacteria to the surface and to each other, making the attachment irreversible. 3. Microcolony formation: As bacteria multiply, they form microcolonies, which are clusters of bacterial cells embedded in the EPS. The EPS provides a protective barrier against environmental stressors, such as the host immune system and antimicrobial agents. 4. Biofilm maturation: Over time, the biofilm grows and develops a complex, three-dimensional structure with channels for nutrient and waste exchange. Bacteria within the biofilm can communicate with each other through a process called quorum sensing, which allows them to coordinate gene expression and adapt to their environment. 5. Dispersion: Eventually, some bacteria may detach from the biofilm and return to their planktonic state, allowing them to colonize new surfaces and form new biofilms. Biofilm formation contributes to antibiotic resistance in several ways: 1. Physical barrier: The EPS matrix can act as a physical barrier, preventing antibiotics from reaching the bacterial cells within the biofilm. 2. Altered microenvironment: The biofilm microenvironment can have altered pH, oxygen levels, and nutrient availability, which can affect the efficacy of antibiotics. 3. Slow growth: Bacteria within biofilms often grow more slowly than planktonic bacteria, which can make them less susceptible to antibiotics that target actively growing cells. 4. Horizontal gene transfer: Biofilms can facilitate the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacterial cells through processes such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. 5. Persister cells: Some bacteria within biofilms can enter a dormant, non-growing state called persister cells. These cells are highly tolerant to antibiotics and can survive treatment, leading to recurrent infections. The impact of bacterial biofilms on human health can be significant, as they are associated with chronic infections, increased antibiotic resistance, and reduced efficacy of medical treatments. Biofilms can form on medical devices, such as catheters and prosthetic joints, leading to device-related infections. They can also contribute to chronic infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, chronic wounds, and periodontal disease.

The formation of biofilms is a highly regulated process that involves several mechanisms. These biofilms contribute to chronic infections and diseases in humans due to their increased resistance to antibiotics and the host immune system. The various mechanisms involved in the formation of bacterial biofilms include: 1. Initial attachment: The first step in biofilm formation is the reversible attachment of planktonic (free-floating) bacteria to a surface. This attachment is facilitated by weak, non-specific interactions such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. Bacterial surface structures, such as flagella and pili, also play a role in this initial attachment. 2. Irreversible attachment: After the initial attachment, bacteria start producing adhesins, which are cell surface proteins that facilitate stronger, irreversible attachment to the surface. Adhesins interact with specific receptors on the surface, leading to the formation of microcolonies. 3. Early development and maturation: As bacteria multiply and form microcolonies, they begin to produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which include polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The EPS forms a protective matrix around the bacterial cells, providing structural support and protection from environmental stresses, such as desiccation, pH changes, and antimicrobial agents. 4. Quorum sensing: Bacteria within the biofilm communicate with each other through a process called quorum sensing. This involves the production and detection of signaling molecules called autoinducers. As the concentration of autoinducers increases, it triggers the expression of specific genes involved in biofilm formation, maturation, and maintenance. 5. Mature biofilm: The mature biofilm is a highly structured, heterogeneous community of bacterial cells embedded within the EPS matrix. The biofilm may contain water channels that facilitate the diffusion of nutrients and waste products. Bacteria within the biofilm exhibit altered gene expression and metabolic activity compared to their planktonic counterparts. 6. Dispersion: The final stage of biofilm development is dispersion, where bacterial cells detach from the biofilm and return to the planktonic state. This can occur through passive mechanisms, such as erosion or sloughing, or active mechanisms, such as the production of enzymes that degrade the EPS matrix. Bacterial biofilms contribute to chronic infections and diseases in humans through the following ways: 1. Increased antibiotic resistance: Bacteria within biofilms are up to 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than planktonic cells. This is due to the reduced penetration of antibiotics through the EPS matrix, altered metabolic activity of the bacteria, and the presence of persister cells, which are a subpopulation of dormant cells that are highly tolerant to antibiotics. 2. Evasion of the host immune system: The EPS matrix provides a physical barrier that protects bacteria from the host immune system, including phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, bacteria within biofilms can modulate their surface antigens, making them less recognizable to the host immune system. 3. Chronic inflammation: Biofilms can trigger a persistent inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage and the development of chronic diseases. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients can cause chronic inflammation and progressive lung damage. 4. Persistence and recurrence of infections: The ability of biofilms to withstand antibiotic treatment and evade the host immune system can lead to the persistence and recurrence of infections. This is particularly problematic in cases of implant-associated infections, where biofilms can form on medical devices such as catheters, prosthetic joints, and heart valves. In conclusion, bacterial biofilms are complex structures that contribute to chronic infections and diseases in humans through various mechanisms, including increased antibiotic resistance, evasion of the host immune system, chronic inflammation, and persistence of infections.

Biofilms are complex, structured communities of bacteria that are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. This matrix is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA, which provide protection and support to the bacteria within the biofilm. 1. Physical barrier: The EPS matrix acts as a physical barrier, limiting the penetration and diffusion of antibiotics into the biofilm. This results in a reduced concentration of the antibiotic reaching the bacteria, which may be insufficient to kill or inhibit their growth. 2. Slow growth rate: Bacteria within biofilms often exhibit a slower growth rate compared to their planktonic (free-floating) counterparts. Since many antibiotics target actively growing cells, the reduced growth rate can lead to decreased antibiotic efficacy. 3. Phenotypic heterogeneity: Biofilms are composed of bacterial cells with diverse phenotypes, including those that are more resistant to antibiotics. This heterogeneity allows for the survival of a subpopulation of cells that can withstand antibiotic treatment and repopulate the biofilm once the treatment is discontinued. 4. Horizontal gene transfer: Biofilms provide an environment that facilitates the exchange of genetic material between bacterial cells, including genes that confer antibiotic resistance. This can lead to the rapid spread of resistance genes within the biofilm community. 5. Persister cells: Biofilms often contain a small population of dormant, non-growing cells called persister cells. These cells are highly tolerant to antibiotics and can survive treatment, leading to the recurrence of infections. Strategies to prevent or disrupt biofilms to improve treatment outcomes for human infections: 1. Prevention of biofilm formation: Inhibiting the initial attachment of bacteria to surfaces can prevent biofilm formation.

Disruption of established biofilms: Enzymes that degrade the EPS matrix, such as DNase, proteases, or glycoside hydrolases, can be used to disrupt established biofilms, making the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics. 3. Combination therapy: Using a combination of antibiotics with different mechanisms of action can help overcome resistance and increase the likelihood of successful treatment. Additionally, combining antibiotics with agents that specifically target biofilms, such as dispersal agents or matrix-degrading enzymes, can enhance the efficacy of the treatment. 4. Quorum sensing inhibitors: Quorum sensing is a cell-to-cell communication system used by bacteria to coordinate their behavior, including biofilm formation. Inhibiting quorum sensing can prevent biofilm development and disrupt established biofilms, making the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics. 5. Bacteriophage therapy: Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria.

These microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of the host, including digestion, immune system function, and even the production of certain vitamins. In recent years, research has shown that the gut microbiota can also impact gut-brain communication and influence mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, which includes the brain. This communication occurs through various pathways, including the vagus nerve, immune system, and the production of neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules by gut bacteria. The composition of gut microbiota can impact gut-brain communication and mental health in several ways: 1. Production of neurotransmitters: Some gut bacteria can produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which play essential roles in regulating mood, anxiety, and stress response. An imbalance in the gut microbiota may lead to altered levels of these neurotransmitters, contributing to anxiety and depression. 2. Inflammation and immune system activation: Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota, can lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules and activation of the immune system. This inflammation can affect the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, allowing inflammatory molecules to enter the brain and potentially contribute to the development of anxiety and depression. 3. Modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: The HPA axis is a critical neuroendocrine system involved in the stress response. Some studies have shown that certain gut bacteria can modulate the HPA axis, influencing the release of stress hormones such as cortisol. Dysregulation of the HPA axis has been implicated in anxiety and depression. 4. Impact on neurogenesis and brain plasticity: The gut microbiota can also influence the production of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which play a role in neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) and synaptic plasticity (the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time). Reduced levels of BDNF have been associated with anxiety and depression. 5. Direct neural communication: Some gut bacteria can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate, which can directly influence the activity of the vagus nerve, a key component of the gut-brain axis. Altered SCFA production due to dysbiosis may disrupt vagal nerve signaling and contribute to anxiety and depression. In summary, the composition of gut microbiota can significantly impact gut-brain communication and influence the development of mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between the gut microbiota and the brain, as well as to develop potential therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota for the treatment of these disorders."},{"instruction":"w does an imbalance in the gut microbiota contribute to the development of specific diseases, and what steps can be taken to restore a healthy balance?","output":"An imbalance in the gut microbiota, also known as dysbiosis, can contribute to the development of specific diseases by disrupting the normal functioning of the gut and its interaction with the immune system.

They aid in digestion, produce essential vitamins, and help regulate the immune system. When the balance of these microorganisms is disrupted, it can lead to various health issues. Dysbiosis has been linked to several diseases, including: 1. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Imbalances in the gut microbiota can lead to chronic inflammation in the gut, which can cause conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 2. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Dysbiosis can contribute to the development of IBS by altering gut motility and increasing the sensitivity of the gut to pain. 3. Obesity and metabolic syndrome: An imbalance in the gut microbiota can affect the way the body processes and stores energy, leading to weight gain and metabolic issues. 4. Type 2 diabetes: Dysbiosis can contribute to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 5. Allergies and asthma: Imbalances in the gut microbiota can affect the immune system's response to allergens, leading to the development of allergies and asthma. 6. Autoimmune diseases: Dysbiosis can trigger an overactive immune response, leading to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. To restore a healthy balance in the gut microbiota, several steps can be taken: 1. Diet: Consuming a diverse and balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fermented foods can help promote a healthy gut microbiota. These foods are high in fiber and contain beneficial bacteria that can help restore balance. 2. Probiotics: Probiotic supplements containing live beneficial bacteria can help restore the balance of gut microbiota. It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic with strains that have been proven to be effective. 3. Prebiotics: Prebiotics are non-digestible food components that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Foods high in prebiotics include onions, garlic, bananas, and asparagus. 4. Antibiotic use: Antibiotics can disrupt the balance of gut microbiota, so it is essential to use them only when necessary and as prescribed by a healthcare professional. After a course of antibiotics, taking probiotics and consuming a healthy diet can help restore gut balance. 5. Stress management: Chronic stress can negatively impact gut health, so practicing stress management techniques such as meditation, exercise, and getting enough sleep can help maintain a healthy gut microbiota. 6. Avoiding unnecessary use of antimicrobial products: Overuse of antimicrobial products, such as antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizers, can disrupt the balance of gut microbiota.

The gut microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms that reside in the gastrointestinal tract and play a crucial role in maintaining overall health. These microorganisms contribute to various physiological processes, including digestion, metabolism, immune system regulation, and protection against pathogens. When the balance of gut microbiota is disrupted, it can lead to several negative consequences for human health. Some potential implications of dysbiosis for diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity are discussed below. 1. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): IBD, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Dysbiosis has been implicated in the development and progression of IBD. A disrupted gut microbiota can lead to an imbalance in the production of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory molecules, resulting in an overactive immune response and chronic inflammation. This can damage the intestinal lining, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Restoring a healthy balance of gut microbiota through interventions like probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may help alleviate symptoms and improve the overall quality of life for individuals with IBD. 2. Obesity: The gut microbiota plays a significant role in energy metabolism and the regulation of body weight. Dysbiosis can alter the efficiency of energy extraction from food and influence the production of hormones that regulate appetite and energy expenditure. In some cases, an imbalance in gut microbiota can promote weight gain and contribute to the development of obesity. For example, certain gut bacteria can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can enhance energy harvest from the diet and promote fat storage. Additionally, dysbiosis can trigger low-grade inflammation, which has been linked to insulin resistance and the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes. Modulating the gut microbiota through dietary interventions, probiotics, or prebiotics may help prevent or treat obesity and its associated health complications. In conclusion, a disruption in the balance of gut microbiota can have significant implications for human health, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease and obesity. Maintaining a healthy gut microbiota through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management is essential for overall health and well-being. In some cases, targeted interventions like probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may be necessary to restore a healthy balance of gut microorganisms and improve disease outcomes."},{"instruction":"w does the composition and activity of microbial communities in oceans change in response to climate change and what are the potential ecological consequences of altered microbial processes in marine environments?","output":"The composition and activity of microbial communities in oceans are influenced by various factors, including temperature, pH, nutrient availability, and dissolved organic matter.

Optimizing these factors and selecting appropriate microbial strains can significantly improve the effectiveness of bioremediation in removing heavy metals from polluted sites."},{"instruction":"What are the mechanisms of action of microbial bioremediation on the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil?","output":"Microbial bioremediation is a process that uses microorganisms to degrade and remove contaminants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, from soil and water. This process is an eco-friendly and cost-effective method for cleaning up polluted environments. The mechanisms of action of microbial bioremediation on the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil involve several processes, including: 1. Biodegradation: Microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, break down complex petroleum hydrocarbons into simpler compounds through metabolic processes. These microorganisms use the hydrocarbons as a source of carbon and energy, converting them into water, carbon dioxide, and biomass. The biodegradation process can occur under aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions, depending on the type of microorganisms and environmental conditions. 2. Biosurfactant production: Some microorganisms produce biosurfactants, which are surface-active compounds that increase the solubility and bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons. Biosurfactants reduce the surface tension between hydrophobic contaminants and water, allowing the hydrocarbons to be more easily accessed and degraded by the microorganisms. 3. Bioaugmentation: This involves the addition of specific microorganisms or microbial consortia to contaminated soil to enhance the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. These microorganisms may be naturally occurring or genetically engineered to be more efficient at breaking down the contaminants. 4. Biostimulation: This process involves the addition of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, or electron acceptors, such as oxygen, to stimulate the growth and activity of indigenous microorganisms capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons. Biostimulation can also involve adjusting environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, and moisture, to optimize microbial activity. 5. Cometabolism: In this process, microorganisms degrade petroleum hydrocarbons while simultaneously metabolizing another substrate, such as methane or ammonia. The presence of the primary substrate enhances the degradation of the hydrocarbon by providing additional energy and nutrients for the microorganisms. 6. Redox reactions: Some microorganisms can mediate redox reactions, which involve the transfer of electrons between molecules. These reactions can lead to the transformation and degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, either directly or indirectly, by altering their chemical structure and making them more susceptible to biodegradation. In summary, microbial bioremediation relies on the metabolic activities of microorganisms to break down and remove petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated soil. This process can be enhanced through the production of biosurfactants, bioaugmentation, biostimulation, cometabolism, and redox reactions."},{"instruction":"w effective are microbial bioremediation techniques in cleaning up soil contaminated with heavy metals such as lead or cadmium?","output":"Microbial bioremediation techniques have shown promise in cleaning up soil contaminated with heavy metals such as lead or cadmium. These techniques involve the use of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and algae, to transform or immobilize heavy metals, making them less toxic and more easily removed from the environment. The effectiveness of microbial bioremediation depends on several factors, including the type and concentration of the heavy metal, the characteristics of the contaminated soil, and the specific microorganisms used. Some microorganisms have a higher affinity for certain heavy metals, while others are more effective at tolerating or transforming them. Several mechanisms are involved in microbial bioremediation of heavy metals: 1. Biosorption: Microorganisms can bind heavy metals to their cell surfaces or intracellular components, effectively removing them from the soil. 2. Bioprecipitation: Some microorganisms can transform heavy metals into insoluble forms, such as metal sulfides or phosphates, which can then be more easily removed from the environment. 3. Bioaccumulation: Certain microorganisms can accumulate heavy metals within their cells, effectively sequestering them from the environment. 4. Bioreduction: Some microorganisms can reduce the oxidation state of heavy metals, making them less toxic and more easily removed from the environment. 5. Biotransformation: Microorganisms can transform heavy metals into less toxic or more easily removed forms through various metabolic processes. The effectiveness of microbial bioremediation techniques can be enhanced by optimizing environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, and nutrient availability, to promote the growth and activity of the desired microorganisms. Additionally, genetic engineering and synthetic biology approaches can be used to create microorganisms with enhanced heavy metal removal capabilities. However, there are some limitations to microbial bioremediation techniques. In some cases, the process can be slow, and it may not be effective for very high concentrations of heavy metals. Additionally, the introduction of non-native microorganisms to a contaminated site may have unintended ecological consequences. In summary, microbial bioremediation techniques can be effective in cleaning up soil contaminated with heavy metals such as lead or cadmium, but their success depends on various factors, including the specific microorganisms used and the environmental conditions at the contaminated site. Further research and development are needed to optimize these techniques and overcome their limitations."},{"instruction":"w can the use of microbial bioremediation be optimized to efficiently remove heavy metals from contaminated environments?","output":"To optimize the use of microbial bioremediation for the efficient removal of heavy metals from contaminated environments, several strategies can be employed: 1. Selection of appropriate microorganisms: Identify and select microorganisms with high metal resistance and bioremediation capabilities. These microorganisms can be native to the contaminated site or can be introduced from other sources. The use of genetically modified microorganisms with enhanced metal resistance and bioremediation potential can also be considered. 2. Enhancing microbial activity: Optimize environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability to promote the growth and activity of the selected microorganisms. This can be achieved by monitoring and adjusting these parameters to the optimal levels for the specific microorganisms involved in bioremediation. 3. Use of bioaugmentation: Introduce additional microorganisms with known metal bioremediation capabilities to the contaminated site to enhance the overall bioremediation process. This can be particularly useful in cases where the native microbial community is not sufficient for effective bioremediation. 4. Use of biostimulation: Stimulate the growth and activity of the native microbial community by adding nutrients, electron donors, or electron acceptors to the contaminated environment. This can help promote the bioremediation process by enhancing the metabolic activities of the microorganisms involved. 5. Monitoring and assessment: Regularly monitor the progress of the bioremediation process by measuring the reduction in heavy metal concentrations and assessing the overall improvement in environmental quality. This information can be used to adjust the bioremediation strategy as needed to achieve the desired results. 6.

Drug cycling: This involves periodically changing the antibiotics used in a clinical setting. By cycling different antibiotics, the selective pressure on bacteria to develop resistance to a specific drug is reduced. This can slow down the development of resistance and maintain the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. 2. Combination therapy: Using multiple antibiotics with different mechanisms of action can help prevent the development of resistance. When bacteria are exposed to multiple drugs, the likelihood of developing resistance to all of them simultaneously is significantly reduced. 3. Developing new antibiotics: Continuously researching and developing new antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action can help combat the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This requires investment in research and development, as well as collaboration between academia, industry, and government. 4. Targeted therapy: Developing antibiotics that specifically target pathogenic bacteria without affecting the beneficial microbiota can reduce the selective pressure for resistance development. This can be achieved through the use of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, or by designing antibiotics that target specific bacterial proteins or pathways. 5. Reducing antibiotic misuse: Educating healthcare professionals and the public about the appropriate use of antibiotics can help reduce the overuse and misuse of these drugs. This includes prescribing antibiotics only when necessary, completing the full course of treatment, and avoiding the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics when a more targeted therapy is available. 6. Monitoring and surveillance: Implementing robust monitoring and surveillance systems can help track the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This information can be used to inform treatment guidelines, antibiotic stewardship programs, and research priorities. 7. Promoting bacterial competition: Encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria that can outcompete pathogenic bacteria for resources can help reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains. This can be achieved through the use of probiotics or by promoting a healthy microbiome through diet and lifestyle choices. 8. Developing alternative therapies: Researching and developing alternative therapies, such as immunotherapy, vaccines, and bacteriophage therapy, can provide additional options for treating bacterial infections and reduce the reliance on antibiotics. By implementing these strategies, the co-evolution of bacteria and antibiotics can be manipulated to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance and preserve the effectiveness of existing antibiotics for future generations."},{"instruction":"w can the understanding of the mechanisms behind the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria help in the development of new antibiotics to combat resistant strains?","output":"Understanding the mechanisms behind the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is crucial for the development of new antibiotics to combat resistant strains. This knowledge can help in several ways: 1. Identifying new targets: By studying the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, researchers can identify new targets for antibiotics. These targets can be proteins or other molecules that are essential for bacterial survival, growth, or reproduction, and are not affected by existing resistance mechanisms. Developing antibiotics that target these new sites can potentially overcome the resistance problem. 2. Designing drugs with multiple targets: Understanding the resistance mechanisms can help in designing antibiotics that target multiple sites in bacteria. This approach makes it more difficult for bacteria to develop resistance, as they would need to acquire multiple mutations simultaneously to survive the antibiotic treatment. 3. Developing inhibitors of resistance mechanisms: By understanding how bacteria develop resistance, researchers can develop drugs that specifically target and inhibit these resistance mechanisms. For example, some bacteria produce enzymes called beta-lactamases that break down beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin. Researchers can develop beta-lactamase inhibitors that can be combined with beta-lactam antibiotics to make them more effective against resistant bacteria. 4. Predicting resistance evolution: Understanding the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance can help predict the emergence of resistant strains. This knowledge can be used to develop strategies to minimize the spread of resistance, such as implementing antibiotic stewardship programs that promote the judicious use of antibiotics. 5. Personalized medicine: Studying the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance can also help in developing personalized medicine approaches. By analyzing the genetic makeup of a bacterial infection, doctors can choose the most effective antibiotic treatment for a specific patient, reducing the chances of resistance development. 6. Drug modification: Understanding the resistance mechanisms can help researchers modify existing antibiotics to overcome resistance. For example, by altering the chemical structure of an antibiotic, it may be possible to prevent it from being recognized and inactivated by bacterial resistance mechanisms. 7. Combination therapies: Knowledge of resistance mechanisms can also guide the development of combination therapies, where two or more antibiotics are used together to target different aspects of bacterial growth and survival. This approach can make it more difficult for bacteria to develop resistance, as they would need to evolve multiple resistance mechanisms simultaneously. In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms behind the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is essential for the development of new antibiotics and strategies to combat resistant strains. By identifying new targets, designing drugs with multiple targets, developing inhibitors of resistance mechanisms, predicting resistance evolution, and implementing personalized medicine, drug modification, and combination therapies, researchers can work towards overcoming the challenge of antibiotic resistance."},{"instruction":"What are the main mechanisms by which bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics, and how can healthcare professionals prevent the overuse of antibiotics and slow down the development of antibiotic resistance?","output":"Bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics through several main mechanisms: 1. Genetic mutations: Spontaneous mutations in bacterial DNA can lead to changes in the structure or function of antibiotic target sites, reducing the effectiveness of the antibiotic. These mutations can be passed on to future generations through vertical gene transfer. 2. Horizontal gene transfer: Bacteria can acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through processes such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. Conjugation involves the direct transfer of plasmids (small, circular DNA molecules) containing resistance genes between bacteria. Transformation occurs when bacteria take up free DNA containing resistance genes from their environment. Transduction involves the transfer of resistance genes between bacteria via bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). 3. Efflux pumps: Some bacteria possess efflux pumps that actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, reducing their intracellular concentration and thus their effectiveness. 4. Enzymatic inactivation: Bacteria can produce enzymes that inactivate antibiotics, such as beta-lactamases, which break down the beta-lactam ring in penicillin and related antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. To prevent the overuse of antibiotics and slow down the development of antibiotic resistance, healthcare professionals can adopt the following strategies: 1. Antibiotic stewardship: Implementing guidelines for the appropriate use of antibiotics, including prescribing them only when necessary and using the correct dosage and duration of treatment. 2. Diagnostic testing: Using rapid diagnostic tests to determine whether an infection is bacterial or viral, as antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. 3. Infection prevention and control: Implementing strict hygiene and infection control measures in healthcare settings to reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 4. Patient education: Educating patients about the appropriate use of antibiotics, the importance of completing the full course of treatment, and the risks associated with antibiotic resistance. 5. Surveillance and monitoring: Regularly monitoring antibiotic resistance patterns in bacterial populations and adjusting treatment guidelines accordingly. 6. Research and development: Encouraging the development of new antibiotics, alternative therapies, and rapid diagnostic tests to stay ahead of evolving bacterial resistance. By adopting these strategies, healthcare professionals can help slow down the development of antibiotic resistance and preserve the effectiveness of existing antibiotics for future generations."},{"instruction":"What is the mechanism behind the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and how can this information be used to develop more effective treatment options for bacterial infections?","output":"The mechanism behind the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria primarily involves genetic mutations and the process of natural selection. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how antibiotic resistance develops: 1. Genetic mutations: Bacteria reproduce rapidly, and during the process of replication, genetic mutations can occur. Some of these mutations may provide the bacteria with resistance to certain antibiotics. This resistance can be due to various factors, such as changes in the bacterial cell wall, alterations in the antibiotic target site, or the production of enzymes that inactivate the antibiotic. 2. Natural selection: When a bacterial population is exposed to an antibiotic, the bacteria that are susceptible to the antibiotic will be killed, while the resistant bacteria will survive. Over time, the resistant bacteria will continue to reproduce, leading to an increase in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the population. 3. Horizontal gene transfer: In addition to the vertical transmission of resistance genes through replication, bacteria can also acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through a process called horizontal gene transfer. This can occur through conjugation, transformation, or transduction, which allows bacteria to share genetic material, including antibiotic resistance genes, with other bacteria. To develop more effective treatment options for bacterial infections, the information about the evolution of antibiotic resistance can be used in the following ways: 1. Combination therapy: Using a combination of antibiotics with different mechanisms of action can help to prevent the development of resistance, as it is less likely that a single mutation will confer resistance to multiple antibiotics. 2. Developing new antibiotics: Understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance can help researchers to design new antibiotics that are less susceptible to resistance. This can be achieved by targeting novel bacterial pathways or modifying existing antibiotics to overcome resistance mechanisms. 3. Antibiotic stewardship: Promoting the judicious use of antibiotics, such as prescribing them only when necessary and using the appropriate dosage and duration, can help to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance. This includes educating healthcare professionals and the public about the responsible use of antibiotics. 4. Monitoring and surveillance: Regularly monitoring the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and tracking the emergence of new resistance mechanisms can help to inform treatment guidelines and the development of new antibiotics. 5. Alternative therapies: Research into alternative therapies, such as bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, or immunotherapies, can provide new options for treating bacterial infections and reduce the reliance on antibiotics. By understanding the mechanisms behind the evolution of antibiotic resistance and applying this knowledge to develop more effective treatment strategies, we can help to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections."},{"instruction":"What are the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and how can this knowledge be applied to develop new antibiotics or alternative treatments for bacterial infections?","output":"The development and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria are primarily due to the following molecular mechanisms: 1. Mutation: Spontaneous mutations in bacterial DNA can lead to changes in the target proteins of antibiotics, making them less susceptible to the drug. For example, mutations in the genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins can render bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. 2. Efflux pumps: Some bacteria possess membrane proteins called efflux pumps that actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, reducing their intracellular concentration and thus their effectiveness. Overexpression of these pumps can lead to increased resistance to multiple antibiotics. 3. Enzymatic inactivation: Bacteria can produce enzymes that inactivate antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. For example, beta-lactamases are enzymes that hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring of penicillins and cephalosporins, making them inactive. 4. Target modification: Bacteria can modify their antibiotic targets, making them less susceptible to the drug. For example, methylation of the 23S ribosomal RNA in some bacteria can confer resistance to macrolide antibiotics. 5. Bypass mechanisms: Bacteria can develop alternative metabolic pathways that bypass the target of the antibiotic, allowing them to survive in the presence of the drug. 6. Horizontal gene transfer: Antibiotic resistance genes can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. This allows for the rapid spread of resistance genes within bacterial populations. To develop new antibiotics or alternative treatments for bacterial infections, the knowledge of these molecular mechanisms can be applied in the following ways: 1. Targeting resistance mechanisms: Designing drugs that specifically target and inhibit the molecular mechanisms responsible for antibiotic resistance, such as efflux pump inhibitors or beta-lactamase inhibitors, can help restore the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. 2. Developing novel antibiotics: By understanding the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance, researchers can design new antibiotics that target previously unexplored bacterial processes or structures, thereby circumventing known resistance mechanisms. 3. Combination therapies: Combining antibiotics with different mechanisms of action can help prevent the development of resistance, as bacteria are less likely to simultaneously develop resistance to multiple drugs. 4. Phage therapy: Bacteriophages, or viruses that infect bacteria, can be used as an alternative to antibiotics. Phages are highly specific to their bacterial hosts and can evolve to overcome bacterial resistance mechanisms. 5. Immunotherapy: Enhancing the host's immune system to better combat bacterial infections can be an alternative approach to treating infections. This can be achieved through the use of vaccines, immunomodulatory agents, or passive immunization with antibodies. 6. Antivirulence strategies: Targeting bacterial virulence factors, such as toxins or adhesins, can help disarm bacteria without exerting selective pressure for resistance, as these strategies do not directly target bacterial survival. By understanding the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and applying this knowledge to develop new treatments, we can combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections."},{"instruction":"What are the mechanisms underlying the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and how can this understanding be used to develop new strategies for combating antibiotic resistance?","output":"The mechanisms underlying the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria involve genetic mutations and the exchange of genetic material between bacteria. Understanding these mechanisms can help develop new strategies for combating antibiotic resistance. Here are the primary mechanisms and potential strategies: 1. Spontaneous mutations: Random genetic mutations can occur in bacterial DNA, which may lead to antibiotic resistance. For example, a mutation in a gene encoding a protein targeted by an antibiotic may alter the protein's structure, making the antibiotic ineffective. Strategy: Developing new antibiotics that target multiple sites or pathways in the bacteria can reduce the likelihood of resistance emerging due to spontaneous mutations. Additionally, using combination therapies with multiple antibiotics can also help prevent the development of resistance. 2. Horizontal gene transfer: Bacteria can exchange genetic material through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction. This allows antibiotic resistance genes to spread rapidly between different bacterial species. Strategy: Limiting the use of antibiotics and implementing antibiotic stewardship programs can help reduce the selective pressure that drives the spread of resistance genes. Additionally, developing strategies to disrupt or inhibit the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer can help slow down the spread of resistance. 3. Efflux pumps: Some bacteria possess efflux pumps that actively expel antibiotics from the cell, reducing their intracellular concentration and rendering them ineffective. Strategy: Developing efflux pump inhibitors can help increase the effectiveness of existing antibiotics by preventing their expulsion from bacterial cells. Combining antibiotics with efflux pump inhibitors can be a promising strategy to combat resistance. 4. Enzymatic inactivation: Bacteria can produce enzymes that inactivate antibiotics, such as beta-lactamases that break down penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Strategy: Developing new antibiotics that are less susceptible to enzymatic inactivation or using enzyme inhibitors in combination with existing antibiotics can help overcome this resistance mechanism. For example, the combination of clavulanic acid (a beta-lactamase inhibitor) with amoxicillin (a beta-lactam antibiotic) is used to treat infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. 5. Target modification: Bacteria can modify their cellular targets to reduce the binding affinity of antibiotics, making them less effective. Strategy: Designing new antibiotics that can bind to the modified targets or developing strategies to prevent target modification can help combat resistance due to this mechanism. 6. Adaptive resistance: Bacteria can develop temporary resistance to antibiotics through physiological changes, such as forming biofilms or entering a dormant state (persisters). Strategy: Developing new drugs that target biofilm formation or persisters can help combat adaptive resistance. Additionally, using antibiotics in a pulsed or intermittent manner may help prevent the development of adaptive resistance. In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria can help inform the development of new strategies for combating resistance. These strategies may include the development of new antibiotics, combination therapies, efflux pump inhibitors, enzyme inhibitors, and drugs targeting biofilm formation or persisters. Additionally, implementing antibiotic stewardship programs and limiting the use of antibiotics can help reduce the selective pressure driving the evolution of resistance."},{"instruction":"What are the current strategies being used to combat the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and how effective are they?","output":"The evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a significant global health concern.

This phenomenon occurs when bacteria develop the ability to survive and grow in the presence of antibiotics that were previously effective in killing them or inhibiting their growth. There are several ways in which this has happened: 1. In medicine, antibiotics are often prescribed unnecessarily for viral infections, against which they are ineffective. This exposes bacteria to antibiotics without any therapeutic benefit, increasing the selective pressure for resistance. 2. Patients may not complete their full course of antibiotics, leading to the survival of partially resistant bacteria that can continue to evolve and spread resistance genes. 3. In agriculture, antibiotics are frequently used as growth promoters and for prophylactic purposes in livestock. This widespread use exposes a large number of bacteria to sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics, promoting the selection of resistant strains. 4. The release of antibiotics into the environment through human and animal waste, as well as manufacturing processes, further contributes to the spread of resistance. The potential consequences of antibiotic resistance for human health and the environment are severe: 1. Increased morbidity and mortality: As antibiotic resistance spreads, the effectiveness of these drugs decreases, leading to longer and more severe illnesses, increased hospitalization rates, and higher mortality rates from bacterial infections. 2. Limited treatment options: The emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers, as there are fewer effective treatment options available. 3. Increased healthcare costs: The treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections often requires more expensive and toxic drugs, longer hospital stays, and additional medical interventions, leading to increased healthcare costs. 4. Threat to modern medicine: Many medical procedures, such as surgeries, organ transplants, and cancer treatments, rely on effective antibiotics to prevent and treat infections. The rise of antibiotic resistance threatens the success and safety of these procedures. 5. Environmental impact: The spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment can lead to the contamination of water sources, soil, and food, posing risks to both human health and ecosystems. To mitigate the consequences of antibiotic resistance, it is crucial to promote the responsible use of antibiotics in both human medicine and agriculture, invest in research and development of new antibiotics and alternative treatments, and implement effective infection prevention and control measures. Additionally, public awareness campaigns and international collaboration are essential to address this global health threat."},{"instruction":"What are the mechanisms by which viruses contribute to the development of cancer, and how can this knowledge be used to develop effective treatments for viral-associated cancers?","output":"Viruses can contribute to the development of cancer through several mechanisms.

These viruses can contribute to cancer progression through various mechanisms, such as by integrating their genetic material into the host's genome, causing chronic inflammation, or by producing proteins that interfere with the host's normal cellular processes. Here are some of the specific viruses and the cancers they are associated with: 1. Human papillomavirus (HPV): HPV is a group of more than 200 related viruses, some of which are known to cause cancer. High-risk HPV types, such as HPV 16 and 18, are responsible for most cases of cervical cancer, as well as a significant proportion of anal, oropharyngeal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal cancers. HPV contributes to cancer progression by producing oncoproteins E6 and E7, which interfere with the host's tumor suppressor proteins p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. 2. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV): Both HBV and HCV are associated with an increased risk of developing liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). These viruses can cause chronic liver inflammation, which can lead to cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer. Additionally, HBV can integrate its DNA into the host's genome, leading to genetic instability and promoting cancer development. 3. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): EBV is a herpesvirus that is associated with several types of cancer, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some types of gastric cancer. EBV can contribute to cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis (cell death), and inducing genomic instability. 4. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1): HTLV-1 is a retrovirus that is associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). The virus can contribute to cancer progression by producing the Tax protein, which interferes with the host's cell cycle regulation and promotes cell proliferation. 5. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV): Also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), KSHV is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. KSHV contributes to cancer progression by producing viral proteins that promote cell proliferation, angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and immune evasion. 6. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV): MCPyV is a polyomavirus that is associated with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of skin cancer. The virus contributes to cancer progression by producing the large T antigen, which interferes with the host's tumor suppressor proteins, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. These viruses can be transmitted through various routes, such as sexual contact, blood transfusions, or from mother to child during birth. Prevention strategies, such as vaccination (for HPV and HBV), practicing safe sex, and avoiding exposure to infected blood, can help reduce the risk of developing virus-associated cancers."},{"instruction":"What are the specific mechanisms by which viruses cause cancer and what strategies could be employed to prevent or treat virus-induced cancers?","output":"Viruses can cause cancer through several specific mechanisms. The primary ways include the integration of viral oncogenes into the host genome, the activation of cellular oncogenes, the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and the induction of chronic inflammation. Here's a brief overview of these mechanisms: 1. Integration of viral oncogenes: Some viruses carry oncogenes, which are genes that have the potential to cause cancer. When these viruses infect a cell, they can integrate their oncogenes into the host cell's genome. The expression of these viral oncogenes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and eventually cancer. Examples of such viruses include the human papillomavirus (HPV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV). 2. Activation of cellular oncogenes: Viruses can also cause cancer by activating cellular oncogenes, which are genes that promote cell growth and division. This can occur through the insertion of viral DNA near a cellular oncogene, leading to its overexpression, or by the production of viral proteins that interact with and activate cellular oncogenes. An example of this mechanism is the activation of the cellular oncogene c-myc by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). 3. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes: Tumor suppressor genes are responsible for regulating cell growth and preventing the formation of tumors. Some viruses can inactivate these genes by producing proteins that bind to and inhibit their function. For example, HPV produces the E6 and E7 proteins, which inactivate the tumor suppressor genes p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), respectively. 4. Induction of chronic inflammation: Chronic inflammation can promote the development of cancer by causing DNA damage, promoting cell proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis (cell death). Some viruses, such as the hepatitis C virus (HCV), can cause chronic inflammation by persistently infecting cells and evading the immune system. Strategies to prevent or treat virus-induced cancers include: 1. Vaccination: Vaccines can be used to prevent infection with oncogenic viruses. For example, the HPV vaccine can protect against the most common cancer-causing strains of HPV, and the hepatitis B vaccine can prevent HBV infection and its associated liver cancer risk. 2. Antiviral therapy: Antiviral drugs can be used to treat infections with oncogenic viruses, potentially reducing the risk of cancer development. For example, antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B and C infections can reduce the risk of liver cancer. 3. Screening and early detection: Regular screening for virus-induced cancers can help detect precancerous lesions or early-stage cancers, allowing for more effective treatment.

These viruses are known as oncogenic viruses or tumor viruses. They can cause cancer through various mechanisms, including: 1. Integration of viral DNA into the host genome: Some viruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), can integrate their DNA into the host cell's genome. This integration can disrupt the normal functioning of cellular genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancer. For example, HPV integration can disrupt the function of tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), leading to cervical cancer. 2. Viral oncoproteins: Oncogenic viruses can produce proteins that interfere with the normal function of cellular proteins involved in regulating cell growth and division. For example, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins produced by high-risk HPV types can inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor proteins, respectively, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancer. 3. Chronic inflammation: Some viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), can cause chronic inflammation in the infected tissues. This persistent inflammation can lead to DNA damage, cell proliferation, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can contribute to the development of cancer. 4. Immunosuppression: Some viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can weaken the immune system, making it less able to detect and eliminate cancerous cells. This can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 5. Epigenetic changes: Oncogenic viruses can also cause epigenetic changes in the host cell, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which can alter gene expression and contribute to the development of cancer.

These viruses are called oncoviruses, and they can cause cancer through various mechanisms. Some of the most well-known oncoviruses include Human papillomavirus (HPV), Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV), and Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1). Here are some of the mechanisms through which oncoviruses contribute to cancer development: 1. Integration of viral DNA into the host genome: Some oncoviruses, such as HPV, can integrate their DNA into the host cell's genome. This integration can disrupt the normal functioning of cellular genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. In some cases, the viral DNA may integrate near or within a tumor suppressor gene, causing its inactivation and promoting the development of cancer. 2. Activation of oncogenes: Oncoviruses can activate cellular oncogenes, which are genes that have the potential to cause cancer when they are mutated or overexpressed. For example, the Hepatitis B virus can activate cellular oncogenes through the production of viral proteins that interact with cellular signaling pathways, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. 3. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes: Tumor suppressor genes are responsible for regulating cell growth and division, and their inactivation can lead to cancer development. Oncoviruses can inactivate tumor suppressor genes through various mechanisms, such as producing viral proteins that bind to and inhibit the function of these genes. For example, the E6 protein of HPV can bind to and degrade the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. 4. Immune evasion: Oncoviruses can evade the host's immune system, allowing them to persist in the body and continue to promote cancer development. For example, the Hepatitis C virus can suppress the host's immune response by inhibiting the production of interferons, which are proteins that help the immune system fight viral infections. 5. Chronic inflammation: Chronic inflammation caused by viral infections can contribute to cancer development. For example, chronic Hepatitis B and C infections can cause inflammation in the liver, leading to the development of liver cancer. Inflammation can promote cancer development by causing DNA damage, promoting cell proliferation, and inhibiting cell death. 6. Epigenetic modifications: Oncoviruses can cause epigenetic modifications, which are changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These modifications can lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, promoting cancer development. In summary, oncoviruses contribute to cancer development by disrupting normal cell growth and division through various mechanisms, including integration of viral DNA into the host genome, activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, immune evasion, chronic inflammation, and epigenetic modifications.

This occurs when a virus infects a host cell and alters its normal functioning, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of tumors. Approximately 10-15% of human cancers worldwide are attributed to viral infections. There are several ways in which viruses can contribute to the development of cancer: 1. Insertional mutagenesis: Some viruses can integrate their genetic material into the host cell's DNA. This can disrupt the normal functioning of cellular genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. 2. Oncogene activation: Viruses can carry oncogenes, which are genes that have the potential to cause cancer when activated. When a virus infects a host cell, it can introduce these oncogenes, leading to the activation of cellular pathways that promote cell growth and division. 3. Tumor suppressor gene inactivation: Some viruses can inactivate tumor suppressor genes, which are responsible for regulating cell growth and preventing the formation of tumors. When these genes are inactivated, cells can grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to the development of cancer. 4. Immune system evasion: Viruses can evade the host's immune system, allowing infected cells to escape detection and destruction. This can enable the survival and proliferation of cells with cancer-causing mutations. 5. Chronic inflammation: Persistent viral infections can cause chronic inflammation, which can damage cellular DNA and promote the development of cancer. To prevent viral-mediated oncogenesis, several strategies can be implemented: 1. Vaccination: Vaccines can be developed to protect against viruses known to cause cancer, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine. These vaccines can help prevent infection and reduce the risk of developing virus-associated cancers. 2.

Immunosuppression: Some viruses, like EBV and HTLV-1, can suppress the host's immune system, making it difficult for the body to recognize and eliminate infected cells. This can allow infected cells to proliferate and potentially transform into cancer cells. Several factors can make some individuals more susceptible to viral-induced tumor formation than others: 1. Genetic predisposition: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more susceptible to viral infections and cancer development. For example, certain gene mutations can impair the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate infected cells. 2. Co-infections: Infections with multiple viruses or other pathogens can increase the risk of cancer development. For example, co-infection with HIV can impair the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to cancer-causing viral infections. 3. Environmental factors: Exposure to certain environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke, radiation, or certain chemicals, can increase the risk of viral-induced cancer by causing DNA damage or impairing the immune system. 4. Age: The risk of developing cancer generally increases with age, as the immune system becomes less effective at eliminating infected cells and DNA damage accumulates over time. 5. Lifestyle factors: Certain lifestyle factors, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and excessive alcohol consumption, can impair the immune system and increase the risk of viral-induced cancer. In summary, viruses can cause cancer in humans through various mechanisms, including integration of viral DNA into the host genome, production of viral proteins that interfere with cellular processes, chronic inflammation, and immunosuppression.

Narrow host range: The high specificity of bacteriophages can also be a limitation, as it may be necessary to identify the exact bacterial species causing the infection to select an appropriate phage. This can be time-consuming and may not be feasible in emergency situations. 2. Immune response: The human immune system may recognize and neutralize bacteriophages, reducing their effectiveness. This can be particularly problematic for repeated phage therapy treatments, as the immune system may develop a stronger response with each exposure. 3. Regulatory and manufacturing challenges: The development and approval of bacteriophage-based therapies face regulatory challenges, as they do not fit neatly into the existing frameworks for drug development. Additionally, the production of phages requires specialized facilities and expertise, which may limit their availability and accessibility. 4. Bacterial resistance: Although bacteriophages can co-evolve with their bacterial hosts, there is still a risk that bacteria may develop resistance to phage therapy. This can occur through mechanisms such as the production of phage-resistant mutants or the acquisition of anti-phage defense systems. In conclusion, bacteriophages offer a promising alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections, with several advantages such as high specificity, self-limiting behavior, and the potential to overcome antibiotic resistance. However, there are also limitations to consider, including the narrow host range, immune response, regulatory challenges, and the potential for bacterial resistance.

Further research and development are needed to optimize phage therapy and overcome these limitations."},{"instruction":"What is the mechanism of action of bacteriophages and how can they be utilized as a potential alternative to antibiotics in treating bacterial infections?","output":"Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that specifically infect and replicate within bacteria. They have a unique mechanism of action that can be harnessed as a potential alternative to antibiotics in treating bacterial infections. The mechanism of action of bacteriophages can be divided into several steps: 1. Attachment: The bacteriophage recognizes and binds to specific receptors on the surface of the bacterial cell. This interaction is highly specific, meaning that each phage can only infect a particular species or strain of bacteria. 2. Injection: After binding to the bacterial cell, the bacteriophage injects its genetic material (either DNA or RNA) into the host cell. The phage's genetic material then takes control of the bacterial cell's machinery. 3. Replication: The phage's genetic material directs the host cell to produce new phage particles. This involves replicating the phage's genetic material, producing phage proteins, and assembling new phage particles within the bacterial cell. 4. Lysis: Once a sufficient number of new phage particles have been produced, the bacterial cell is lysed (broken open), releasing the new phage particles. These new phages can then go on to infect other bacterial cells, repeating the process. The ability of bacteriophages to specifically target and kill bacteria makes them an attractive alternative to antibiotics, especially in the face of increasing antibiotic resistance. Some potential advantages of using bacteriophages as antibacterial agents include: 1. Specificity: Bacteriophages are highly specific to their target bacteria, which means they can selectively kill pathogenic bacteria without harming the beneficial bacteria in the human microbiome. 2. Self-limiting: Bacteriophages replicate only when their target bacteria are present. Once the bacterial infection is cleared, the phage population declines, reducing the risk of side effects and environmental impact. 3. Adaptability: Bacteriophages can evolve to counter bacterial resistance, making them a potentially sustainable solution to the problem of antibiotic resistance. 4. Synergy with antibiotics: In some cases, bacteriophages can be used in combination with antibiotics to enhance their effectiveness or to target bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics. Despite these advantages, there are also challenges in developing bacteriophage-based therapies, such as the need for a thorough understanding of phage-host interactions, potential immune responses to phage treatment, and regulatory hurdles. However, ongoing research and development in this area hold promise for the future use of bacteriophages as a viable alternative to antibiotics in treating bacterial infections."},{"instruction":"What is the effectiveness of using bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics in preventing bacterial infections and overcoming antibiotic resistance in microbiology?","output":"The use of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics in preventing bacterial infections and overcoming antibiotic resistance has shown promising results in both laboratory and clinical settings. Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria, making them a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics. Effectiveness of bacteriophages: 1. Specificity: Bacteriophages are highly specific to their target bacteria, which means they can selectively kill pathogenic bacteria without affecting the beneficial bacteria in the human microbiome. This is an advantage over antibiotics, which can have broad-spectrum activity and disrupt the balance of the microbiome. 2. Self-replication: Bacteriophages can replicate within the infected bacteria, increasing their numbers and enhancing their effectiveness in eradicating the bacterial infection. This allows for lower doses and shorter treatment durations compared to antibiotics. 3. Overcoming resistance: Bacteriophages can evolve to overcome bacterial resistance mechanisms, making them a potential solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the use of phage cocktails, which are mixtures of different phages targeting the same bacteria, can help prevent the development of phage-resistant bacterial strains. 4. Synergy with antibiotics: Some studies have shown that combining bacteriophages with antibiotics can enhance the effectiveness of the treatment, potentially allowing for lower antibiotic doses and reducing the risk of resistance development. 5. Biofilm degradation: Bacteriophages can penetrate and degrade bacterial biofilms, which are complex structures that protect bacteria from antibiotics and the host immune system. This makes phages an attractive option for treating biofilm-associated infections. However, there are also some challenges and limitations associated with the use of bacteriophages: 1. Narrow host range: The high specificity of bacteriophages can also be a limitation, as it requires the identification of the exact bacterial strain causing the infection to select the appropriate phage. 2. Immune response: The human immune system can neutralize bacteriophages, potentially reducing their effectiveness. This can be addressed by using phage cocktails or modifying the phage surface to evade the immune system. 3. Regulatory and manufacturing challenges: The development and approval of bacteriophage-based therapies face regulatory challenges due to their unique properties as biological entities. Additionally, large-scale production and purification of phages can be technically challenging and costly. In conclusion, bacteriophages have the potential to be an effective alternative to antibiotics in preventing bacterial infections and overcoming antibiotic resistance. However, further research, development, and clinical trials are needed to address the challenges and limitations associated with their use."},{"instruction":"w do bacteriophages compare to antibiotics in terms of their effectiveness and potential risks in treating bacterial infections?","output":"Bacteriophages and antibiotics are both used to treat bacterial infections, but they have different mechanisms of action, effectiveness, and potential risks. 1. Mechanism of action: Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria. They attach to the bacterial cell surface, inject their genetic material, and use the bacterial machinery to replicate themselves. Eventually, the bacterial cell bursts, releasing new bacteriophages that can infect other bacteria. Antibiotics, on the other hand, are chemical compounds that inhibit or kill bacteria by targeting essential cellular processes, such as cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, or DNA replication. 2. Effectiveness: Bacteriophages are highly specific, meaning they only target specific bacterial strains. This can be advantageous because it allows for targeted treatment of infections without harming the beneficial bacteria in the body. However, this specificity can also be a limitation, as bacteriophages may not be effective against all strains of a particular bacterial species. Antibiotics have a broader spectrum of activity, meaning they can target a wider range of bacterial species. This can be beneficial in treating infections caused by multiple bacterial species or when the causative agent is unknown. However, the broad-spectrum activity of antibiotics can also disrupt the normal microbiota, leading to secondary infections or other complications. 3. Potential risks: One of the main risks associated with bacteriophage therapy is the development of bacterial resistance. Bacteria can evolve resistance to bacteriophages through various mechanisms, such as altering their cell surface receptors or producing enzymes that degrade the bacteriophages. However, the rate of resistance development is generally lower than that for antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is a significant global health concern. The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are difficult to treat and can cause severe infections. Additionally, antibiotics can cause side effects, such as allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and secondary infections due to the disruption of the normal microbiota. 4. Environmental impact: Bacteriophages are naturally occurring and can be found in various environments, such as soil and water. They are biodegradable and have a minimal environmental impact. In contrast, antibiotics can persist in the environment and contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in various ecosystems. In conclusion, bacteriophages and antibiotics have their advantages and disadvantages in treating bacterial infections. Bacteriophages offer a targeted approach with fewer side effects and a lower risk of resistance development, while antibiotics provide a broader spectrum of activity but can cause disruption of the normal microbiota and contribute to antibiotic resistance. The choice between bacteriophages and antibiotics depends on the specific infection, the causative agent, and the patient's medical history. In some cases, a combination of both therapies may be beneficial."},{"instruction":"w effective are bacteriophages compared to antibiotics in treating bacterial infections, and what are the potential benefits and limitations of using bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics in microbiology?","output":"Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria.

Here are the main differences between them: 1. Mechanism of action: Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria by injecting their genetic material into the bacterial cell, replicating, and eventually causing the cell to burst. Antibiotics, on the other hand, are chemical compounds that target specific cellular processes or structures in bacteria, inhibiting their growth or killing them. 2. Specificity: Bacteriophages are highly specific, targeting only certain strains or species of bacteria. This can be advantageous as it reduces the impact on the normal bacterial flora (microbiome) in the body. Antibiotics can be either broad-spectrum, affecting a wide range of bacteria, or narrow-spectrum, targeting specific groups of bacteria. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt the normal microbiome, leading to secondary infections or other complications. 3. Resistance development: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a significant and growing problem worldwide. Bacteriophages are less likely to contribute to resistance development, as they co-evolve with their bacterial hosts. However, bacteria can still develop resistance to bacteriophages, although the likelihood is lower than with antibiotics. 4. Safety and side effects: Antibiotics can cause side effects, such as allergic reactions, gastrointestinal issues, or interactions with other medications. Bacteriophages are generally considered safe, with fewer side effects, as they specifically target bacteria and do not affect human cells. 5. Production and availability: Antibiotics are widely available and can be mass-produced relatively easily. Bacteriophage production is more complex, as each phage is specific to a particular bacterial strain, making it challenging to create a \\"one-size-fits-all\\" treatment. When considering the use of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics, several factors should be taken into account: 1. Bacterial strain: The bacterial strain causing the infection should be identified to determine if a suitable bacteriophage is available for treatment. 2. Resistance patterns: If the bacterial strain is resistant to multiple antibiotics, bacteriophage therapy may be a more effective option. 3. Patient factors: The patient's medical history, including allergies, underlying conditions, and current medications, should be considered when deciding on the most appropriate treatment. 4. Severity of infection: In severe or life-threatening infections, a combination of bacteriophages and antibiotics may be considered to increase the chances of successful treatment. 5. Regulatory and logistical issues: Bacteriophage therapy is not yet widely available or approved for use in many countries, which may limit its accessibility.

Sample collection: Collect samples from various environments where the target bacteria are likely to be present, such as sewage, water, soil, or even animal feces. These samples are expected to contain a diverse population of bacteriophages. 2. Bacterial host preparation: Isolate the target bacterial pathogen and grow it in a suitable culture medium. This bacterial culture will be used to screen for bacteriophages that can infect and kill the target bacteria. 3. Enrichment and isolation of bacteriophages: Mix the environmental samples with the bacterial host culture and incubate for a specific period. This allows the bacteriophages present in the sample to infect and lyse the bacteria. Centrifuge and filter the mixture to remove bacterial debris and obtain a phage suspension. Perform serial dilutions and plaque assays to isolate individual bacteriophages. 4. Characterization of bacteriophages: Analyze the isolated bacteriophages for their host range, morphology, and genetic composition. This information helps in selecting the most suitable bacteriophages for further modification and application. 5. Modification of bacteriophages: To enhance the efficacy of bacteriophages and reduce the risk of bacterial resistance, several strategies can be employed:    a. Genetic engineering: Modify the bacteriophage genome to improve its ability to infect and kill target bacteria, or to introduce genes that can disrupt bacterial resistance mechanisms.    b. Phage cocktails: Combine multiple bacteriophages with different target specificities and modes of action to increase the overall efficacy and reduce the likelihood of bacterial resistance development.    c.

Here, we will compare bacteriophages and traditional antibiotics in terms of their effectiveness and potential side effects. Effectiveness: 1. Specificity: Bacteriophages are highly specific to their target bacteria, which means they only kill the pathogenic bacteria without affecting the beneficial bacteria in the body. This is an advantage over traditional antibiotics, which often have a broader spectrum of activity and can disrupt the normal microbiota, leading to secondary infections or other complications. 2. Resistance: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing concern worldwide. Bacteriophages have a lower likelihood of inducing resistance compared to antibiotics, as they can co-evolve with their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phage cocktails (mixtures of different phages) can be used to target multiple strains of bacteria, further reducing the chance of resistance development. 3. Biofilm penetration: Bacteriophages can penetrate and disrupt biofilms, which are complex bacterial communities that are often resistant to traditional antibiotics. This makes phages a promising option for treating chronic and difficult-to-treat infections. Potential side effects: 1. Immunogenicity: One concern with using bacteriophages as a treatment is their potential to trigger an immune response in the host. This could lead to the rapid clearance of the phages from the body, reducing their effectiveness. However, this issue can be addressed by selecting phages with low immunogenicity or by modifying their surface proteins. 2. Endotoxin release: When bacteriophages kill bacteria, they can cause the release of endotoxins, which are toxic substances present in the cell walls of certain bacteria. This can lead to an inflammatory response and potential side effects. However, this issue is not unique to phage therapy, as traditional antibiotics can also cause endotoxin release. 3. Regulatory and safety concerns: The use of bacteriophages for treating bacterial infections is still relatively new, and there are concerns regarding their safety, efficacy, and regulation. More research and clinical trials are needed to establish standardized protocols and guidelines for phage therapy. In conclusion, bacteriophages have several advantages over traditional antibiotics, including their specificity, lower likelihood of inducing resistance, and ability to penetrate biofilms. However, there are also potential side effects and concerns that need to be addressed through further research and clinical trials. As antibiotic resistance continues to rise, bacteriophages may become an important alternative or complementary treatment option for bacterial infections."},{"instruction":"w does the effectiveness of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics vary in relation to the type of bacteria being targeted?","output":"The effectiveness of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics can indeed vary depending on the type of bacteria being targeted. Bacteriophages, or phages for short, are viruses that specifically infect and replicate within bacteria. They have been considered as an alternative to antibiotics due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, there are several factors that can influence the effectiveness of phages in targeting different types of bacteria. 1. Host specificity: Bacteriophages are highly specific to their bacterial hosts. This means that a phage that is effective against one type of bacteria may not be effective against another. This specificity can be advantageous in that it allows for targeted treatment without affecting the beneficial bacteria in the body. However, it also means that a broad-spectrum phage therapy would require a cocktail of different phages to target a wide range of bacterial species. 2. Bacterial defense mechanisms: Bacteria have evolved various defense mechanisms to protect themselves from phage infections. These include the production of extracellular polysaccharides that can prevent phage attachment, alteration of surface receptors to prevent phage recognition, and the use of CRISPR-Cas systems to degrade phage DNA. The effectiveness of a phage in targeting a specific type of bacteria can be influenced by the presence and efficiency of these defense mechanisms. 3. Phage resistance: Just as bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics, they can also develop resistance to phages. This can occur through spontaneous mutations or horizontal gene transfer. The rate at which phage resistance develops can vary depending on the type of bacteria and the specific phage being used. 4. Phage life cycle: The life cycle of a phage can also impact its effectiveness against specific types of bacteria. There are two main types of phage life cycles: lytic and lysogenic. Lytic phages infect and rapidly kill their bacterial hosts, while lysogenic phages integrate their DNA into the host genome and can remain dormant for extended periods. Lytic phages are generally considered more effective for therapeutic purposes, as they can quickly reduce bacterial populations. 5. Environmental factors: The effectiveness of phages can also be influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, and the presence of other microorganisms. These factors can impact phage stability, infectivity, and replication, and may vary depending on the type of bacteria being targeted. In conclusion, the effectiveness of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics can vary significantly depending on the type of bacteria being targeted. Factors such as host specificity, bacterial defense mechanisms, phage resistance, phage life cycle, and environmental factors can all influence the success of phage therapy. To optimize the use of phages as an alternative to antibiotics, it is essential to consider these factors and develop strategies to overcome potential limitations."},{"instruction":"What is the mechanism of action of bacteriophages and how do they specifically target and kill bacterial cells, compared to conventional antibiotics?","output":"Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that specifically infect and kill bacterial cells. They have a unique mechanism of action compared to conventional antibiotics, which generally target essential cellular processes in bacteria. The mechanism of action of bacteriophages can be divided into several key steps: 1. Recognition and attachment: Bacteriophages are highly specific in targeting bacterial cells. They recognize and bind to specific receptors on the surface of the bacterial cell, such as lipopolysaccharides, teichoic acids, or proteins. This specificity ensures that phages only infect their target bacteria and do not harm other cells, including human cells. 2. Injection of genetic material: Once attached to the bacterial cell, the bacteriophage injects its genetic material (either DNA or RNA) into the host cell. This genetic material then hijacks the bacterial cell's machinery to replicate the phage's genetic material and produce new phage particles. 3. Replication and assembly: The phage's genetic material takes control of the bacterial cell's replication machinery, forcing it to produce new copies of the phage genome and synthesize phage proteins. These components then assemble into new phage particles within the bacterial cell. 4. Lysis and release: After the assembly of new phage particles, the bacterial cell is lysed, or broken open, releasing the newly formed phages. These phages can then go on to infect and kill more bacterial cells. Some phages produce enzymes called endolysins, which break down the bacterial cell wall, causing the cell to burst and release the new phage particles. The specificity of bacteriophages in targeting bacterial cells offers several advantages over conventional antibiotics. First, phages do not harm human cells or the beneficial bacteria that reside in our body, reducing the risk of side effects and damage to the microbiome. Second, the development of resistance to phages is less likely compared to antibiotics, as phages can evolve alongside bacteria. Finally, phages can be used in combination with antibiotics to enhance their effectiveness or to target antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In summary, bacteriophages specifically target and kill bacterial cells through a unique mechanism involving recognition, attachment, injection of genetic material, replication, assembly, and lysis. This mechanism differs from conventional antibiotics, which typically target essential cellular processes in bacteria. The specificity and adaptability of phages make them a promising alternative or supplement to conventional antibiotics in the fight against bacterial infections."},{"instruction":"What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics in treating bacterial infections, and how can we effectively implement the use of bacteriophages in clinical settings?","output":"Advantages of using bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics: 1.

What are the most effective methods of preserving food using microorganisms and how do they work?","output":"Microorganisms can be controlled or manipulated to preserve food and prevent spoilage through various methods, including fermentation, use of probiotics, and competitive inhibition. The most effective methods of preserving food using microorganisms are: 1. Fermentation: Fermentation is a process in which microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, or fungi, convert carbohydrates (e.g., sugars) into other molecules, such as alcohol, lactic acid, or acetic acid. These byproducts can help preserve food by creating an environment that is inhospitable to spoilage-causing microorganisms. Some examples of fermented foods include yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles.    How it works: During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) convert sugars into lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the food. This acidic environment inhibits the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms and helps preserve the food. 2. Use of probiotics: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, provide health benefits to the host. They can be used in food preservation by inhibiting the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms.    How it works: Probiotic bacteria produce antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins, which can inhibit the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms. Additionally, probiotics can compete with spoilage-causing microorganisms for nutrients and attachment sites, thus limiting their growth. 3. Competitive inhibition: This method involves introducing harmless microorganisms into food to compete with spoilage-causing microorganisms for resources, such as nutrients and space.    How it works: By introducing harmless microorganisms that have similar nutrient requirements as spoilage-causing microorganisms, the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms can be limited. The harmless microorganisms outcompete the spoilage-causing microorganisms for resources, thereby preventing their growth and subsequent spoilage of the food. 4. Use of starter cultures: Starter cultures are mixtures of specific microorganisms that are added to food to initiate and control the fermentation process. They can be used to ensure that the desired microorganisms dominate the fermentation process, thereby preventing the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms.    How it works: Starter cultures contain specific strains of microorganisms that have been selected for their ability to produce desirable fermentation products, such as lactic acid or alcohol. By adding these starter cultures to food, the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms can be inhibited, and the food can be preserved. In conclusion, controlling or manipulating microorganisms to preserve food and prevent spoilage can be achieved through various methods, such as fermentation, use of probiotics, competitive inhibition, and the use of starter cultures. These methods work by creating an environment that is inhospitable to spoilage-causing microorganisms, inhibiting their growth, or outcompeting them for resources."},{"instruction":"What are the common microorganisms that cause food spoilage and what are the different preservation methods that can be used to prevent or delay their growth in food?","output":"Common microorganisms that cause food spoilage include bacteria, yeasts, and molds.

These enzymes are primarily derived from microorganisms such as bacteria, molds, and yeasts. The two main enzymes involved in cheese production are rennet and starter culture enzymes. 1. Rennet: Rennet is a mixture of enzymes, primarily chymosin, which is responsible for coagulating milk proteins (casein) and turning liquid milk into a solid curd. Traditionally, rennet was obtained from the stomach lining of young ruminants, such as calves or lambs. However, due to the increasing demand for cheese and the need for a more consistent and reliable source of enzymes, microbial rennet is now widely used. Microbial rennet is produced by genetically modified microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi, which express the chymosin gene. This type of rennet is suitable for vegetarians and has a more consistent quality compared to animal-derived rennet. 2. Starter cultures: Starter cultures are mixtures of specific bacteria, molds, or yeasts that are added to milk during cheese production to initiate fermentation. These microorganisms produce enzymes that break down milk components, such as lactose, proteins, and fats, into simpler compounds. This process not only helps preserve the cheese but also contributes to its unique taste and texture. The main enzymes produced by starter cultures include: a. Proteases: These enzymes break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. The type and activity of proteases determine the texture and flavor of the cheese. For example, strong proteolytic activity results in a soft, creamy texture and a more pungent flavor, as seen in blue cheeses. b. Lipases: Lipases break down milk fats into simpler fatty acids and glycerol. The release of free fatty acids contributes to the development of characteristic flavors in cheese. For example, lipases from molds like Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium camemberti are responsible for the distinct taste of blue and Camembert cheeses, respectively. c. Lactases: These enzymes convert lactose, the primary sugar in milk, into lactic acid. The production of lactic acid lowers the pH of the cheese, which helps control the growth of spoilage microorganisms and contributes to the cheese's tangy flavor. Different types of cheese require specific combinations of starter cultures and enzymes, which contribute to their unique taste and texture. For example, the use of Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in the production of Cheddar cheese results in a mild, nutty flavor, while the addition of Penicillium roqueforti in blue cheese production leads to a strong, pungent taste. In conclusion, microbial enzymes play a vital role in cheese production by coagulating milk proteins, initiating fermentation, and breaking down milk components into simpler compounds that contribute to the unique taste and texture of different types of cheese. The choice of enzymes and starter cultures used in the cheese-making process determines the final product's characteristics and quality."},{"instruction":"w does the process of using microbial enzymes in industrial applications differ from traditional chemical methods? What are the benefits and drawbacks of using microbial enzymes in industrial processes?","output":"The process of using microbial enzymes in industrial applications differs from traditional chemical methods in several ways. Microbial enzymes are proteins produced by microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and yeast, that act as biological catalysts to accelerate chemical reactions. Traditional chemical methods, on the other hand, rely on synthetic chemicals or inorganic catalysts to facilitate reactions. Benefits of using microbial enzymes in industrial processes: 1. Specificity: Microbial enzymes are highly specific in their action, meaning they target only specific substrates and reactions. This reduces the chances of unwanted side reactions and by-products, leading to higher product purity and yield. 2. Efficiency: Enzymes can catalyze reactions at a much faster rate than traditional chemical catalysts, which can significantly reduce the time and resources required for a process. 3. Environmentally friendly: Microbial enzymes are biodegradable and typically function under mild conditions (temperature, pH, and pressure), reducing the need for harsh chemicals and energy-intensive processes. This results in a lower environmental impact and reduced waste production. 4. Renewable: Microbial enzymes can be produced through fermentation processes using renewable resources, such as agricultural waste or biomass, making them a sustainable option for industrial applications. Drawbacks of using microbial enzymes in industrial processes: 1. Cost: The production and purification of microbial enzymes can be expensive, especially when compared to traditional chemical catalysts. However, advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering have led to significant improvements in enzyme production, which may help to reduce costs in the future. 2. Stability: Enzymes can be sensitive to changes in temperature, pH, and other environmental factors, which may lead to reduced activity or denaturation. This can be a challenge in industrial processes, where conditions may be difficult to control. However, enzyme engineering and immobilization techniques can help improve enzyme stability and reusability. 3. Regulatory concerns: The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for enzyme production may raise regulatory and public acceptance concerns in some regions. This can potentially limit the adoption of microbial enzymes in certain industries or countries. In conclusion, microbial enzymes offer several advantages over traditional chemical methods, such as specificity, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. However, there are also challenges, such as cost, stability, and regulatory concerns, that need to be addressed for their widespread adoption in industrial processes."},{"instruction":"Analyse the below meeting transcript fragment, and fill in the possibly blank action items table that follows it.

He had no idea what was about to happen in the gym. NAME_1 had been training with NAME_2 for about a year now, and she had developed a good sense of humor and an easy rapport with him.

In the middle of their workout, NAME_1 suddenly stopped and turned to NAME_2. She confessed that she wanted him to see the results of their hard work. She wanted him to see her body, to appreciate it, and to desire it. NAME_2 was taken aback by her boldness, but he couldn't deny that he had been secretly attracted to her. He had even fantasized about her during their training sessions. And he knew that NAME_3, her husband, had a fantasy of her being with another man. NAME_1 was nervous, but she couldn't deny the excitement she felt at the thought of being with another man. And during one particularly passionate moment with NAME_3, she had even fantasized about being seduced by NAME_2 during a workout. It had turned her on, but it had also left her feeling conflicted. But now, as she stood in front of NAME_2, she knew what she wanted. She wanted him to fulfill her fantasy, to make her feel desired and wanted.

If you’ve ever published a book, you’ll know that authors are expected to take on the lion’s share of the marketing. As a result, many independent authors are forced to spend a great deal of time selling their self-published books, rather than writing new ones. Of course, for some authors, marketing is enjoyable! It’s a chance to promote their work and interact with readers firsthand. But for others, it can be a real burden — after all, book marketing requires specialist skills that many authors haven’t had the chance to develop.

Also includes tips for choosing the right wicks and fragrance combinations.","output":"Making your own candles using essential oils and natural soy wax is not only fun, but it also allows you to create customized scents and designs that are perfect for your space or gifting to others. Below is a step-by-step guide to melt the wax, add fragrance, pour into jars, and wick. **What you'll need:** - Natural soy wax - Essential oils (for fragrance) - Candle wicks - Glass jars or containers - A double boiler or a heatproof bowl and saucepan - A thermometer - A stirring utensil - Wick stickers or a hot glue gun - Wick centering devices or clothespins **Step 1: Prepare your workspace** Choose a clean, clutter-free area for your candle-making. Cover your work surface with newspaper or a disposable tablecloth to catch any wax drips. **Step 2: Prepare your jars** Clean your jars thoroughly and make sure they are dry. Install the wick using a wick sticker or a dab of hot glue at the base of the jar. Center the wick in the jar and secure it using a wick centering device or a clothespin. **Step 3: Melt the soy wax** Depending on the size of your jar, measure the required amount of soy wax (you can estimate by filling the jar twice with wax flakes). Place the wax in a double boiler over medium heat or use a heatproof bowl resting on a saucepan filled with a few inches of water. Let the wax melt slowly, stirring occasionally. It should reach a temperature of around 180°F (82°C). Use your thermometer to monitor the temperature. **Step 4: Add essential oils** Once the wax has melted and reached the correct temperature, remove it from heat. Let the wax cool down to around 160°F (71°C) before adding your essential oils. It is essential to wait until the wax cools down to prevent the oils from losing their fragrance due to high heat. You can use around 6-10% of oil per volume of wax, but be sure to follow the recommendation on your essential oils' package. Stir the wax and oils thoroughly. **Step 5: Pour the wax into jars** Carefully pour the wax into your prepared jars, ensuring the wicks stay centered. Fill each jar, leaving a small empty space at the top. Let the candles cool and solidify, undisturbed, for about 24 hours. **Step 6: Trim the wick and enjoy** Once the candles have completely hardened, remove the centering device or clothespins and trim the wick to about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). Your candles are now ready to be enjoyed or gifted. **Tips for choosing the right wicks and fragrance combinations:** 1. For wicks, make sure to choose the appropriate size for the diameter of your jar. A wick that is too small will create a small burn pool and may lead to tunneling, while a too-large wick may cause sooting and an unsafe flame. Most wick packaging will indicate the recommended jar diameter. 2. Experiment with various essential oil combinations to create a unique fragrance. Some popular options include lavender and chamomile, eucalyptus and mint, and citrus blends. 3. Be mindful of the potency of your essential oils. Some scents may require more oil, while others may require less. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines for the specific oils you are using. 4. For added visual appeal, embellish your candles with dried flowers, colored wax layers, or glitter (ensure these additions are non-flammable and placed safely away from the wick). Always remember to consider safety when designing your candles."},{"instruction":"Formulate questions about the information mentioned in a given passage.

Input: By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring However, photographs said to be of the suspect, Zarar Haider Khan, published in mainstream and social media show a completely innocent individual who resides in the United States. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said that Mr Haider is the joint secretary of the Ministry of Industries and Production in Pakistan, and that an investigation is being launched into the theft from the Kuwaiti diplomat. An official document was subsequently published for inclusion in Pakistan's Official Gazette, noting Mr Haider's suspension. Mr Haider is a grade BS-20 official, one of the higher ranks in Pakistan's civil service, and the incident has opened the government to \\"severe embarrassment\\", Islamabad newspaper The News says. What happened? The six-second clip of close-circuit television footage shows the suspect pocketing the wallet which had been left on a table at the Economic Affairs Division, Dawn newspaper reports. The paper says that the theft only came to light after the Kuwaiti delegation - who were in Pakistan to discuss future trade between Kuwait and the new government in Islamabad - lodged a complaint with their hosts when they realised that the wallet had gone missing. The wallet contained \\"a significant sum of Kuwaiti dinars\\", the paper said, and the suspect was named only after the CCTV footage was reviewed by officials. According the Pakistani press, the \\"extremely angry\\" Kuwaiti delegation insisted that the suspect be identified. Mistaken identity Unsurprisingly, the footage went viral on South Asian social media after it appeared on television news broadcasts, with Pakistani Twitter users expressing their shame over the theft from visiting dignitaries. Indian social media users noted the theft with no little glee, with several saying \\"This is what small officials of a small country do when they see big people's wallet\\". However, a photograph accompanying media reports - on television and on social media - was not of Zarar Haider Khan, but of Ziad Haider, a US-based risk analyst who has worked for the State Department in Washington DC. He is also a White House fellow and a Senior Associate at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Pakistan Today reports. Online news portal Daily Pakistan said that photographs of the wrong Mr Haider were posted on the internet \\"with insulting remarks and comments\\". Asked on Twitter if he was aware that he was trending in Pakistan, the entirely innocent Ziad Haider replied with thanks, saying: \\"My name is Ziad - not Zarar - Haider and, as other publications in Pakistan have already noted, this is indeed fake news\\". However, videos uploaded by Pakistani broadcasters incorrectly showing the blameless Ziad Haider were still accessible on YouTube on 1 October. No images of Zarar Haider Khan are available. You might also be interested in: What next?

Input: Paragraph: After its first two-day meeting in Geneva, the WHO panel of gene editing experts - which was established in December after a Chinese scientist said he had edited the genes of twin babies - said it had agreed a framework for setting future standards. It said a central registry of all human genome editing research was needed “in order to create an open and transparent database of ongoing work”, and asked the WHO to start setting up such a registry immediately. “The committee will develop essential tools and guidance for all those working on this new technology to ensure maximum benefit and minimal risk to human health,” Soumya Swamanathan, the WHO’s chief scientist, said in a statement. A Chinese scientist last year claimed to have edited the genes of twin baby girls. News of the births prompted global condemnation, in part because it raised the ethical specter of so-called “designer babies” - in which embryos can be genetically modified to produce children with desirable traits. Top scientists and ethicists from seven countries called last week for a global moratorium on gene editing of human eggs, sperm or embryos that would result in such genetically-altered babies - saying this “could have permanent and possibly harmful effects on the species”. The WHO panel’s statement said any human gene editing work should be done for research only, should not be done in human clinical trials, and should be conducted transparently. “It is irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing.”  The WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, welcomed the panel’s initial plans. “Gene editing holds incredible promise for health, but it also poses some risks, both ethically and medically,” he said in a statement. The committee said it aims over the next two years to produce “a comprehensive governance framework” for national, local and international authorities to ensure human genome editing science progresses within agreed ethical boundaries.

Input: The word second can refer to ordinal #2 (that which comes after first), or a unit of time, 1/60 of a minute. Ordinarily you might think that this is just a coincidence, but in Spanish, the word segundo also means both a second (of time) and ordinal #2, which suggests that there's some actual link between the two meanings somewhere. So, why is there a 'second' of time but not a 'first'?. Output:","output":"[Question]: Why is there a 'second' of time but not a 'first'? [Answer]: When we talk about time, the word 'second' is used as a unit of measurement, specifically 1/60 of a minute. This unit of time is a standard globally recognized as part of the International System of Units (SI). However, the question arises as to why we have a 'second' and not a 'first'.  The reason lies in the historical development of these units of time. The earliest known system of dividing the day came from the ancient Babylonians who divided the day into 24 equal periods, which we now know as hours. These hours were further divided into 60 minutes each, and each minute into 60 seconds. The Babylonians used a base-60 system, also known as a sexagesimal system, which might seem arbitrary to us now, but it made arithmetic and geometric calculation easier in those times.  The Babylonians based their system on the movement of the sun and the stars, but they didn't use the word 'first' or 'second' to denote these units of time. Instead, the division of time into 'seconds' was actually a result of the Greek and Roman systems of dividing the hour into smaller parts. They used a system of fractions to divide the hour into smaller and smaller parts.  The Romans, building on the Greek system, divided the hour into 45 minutes, each minute into 45 seconds, and so on. This was based on their own numeric system, which was based on the numbers 5 and 12 (which is why we have 60 seconds in a minute and 360 degrees in a circle). However, they did not use the words 'first' or 'second' for any of these units.  The words 'first', 'second', 'third', etc., used to denote time, are typically used in reference to time intervals, not units of time. For example, if you start doing something, you might say that you are in the \\"first\\" minute, or that you've been doing it for \\"two\\" minutes.  This is in contrast to the use of 'first' and 'second' in ordinal numbers, where 'first' denotes the thing that comes before all others and 'second' denotes the thing that comes after the first. This concept of 'first' and 'second' in ordinal numbers is not as directly applicable to time, where the unit 'second' is a standard measurement, not a relative place in order. So, the reason why we have a 'second' and not a 'first' in time units is due to the historical development of time measurement systems, which were initially based on orders of magnitude and later on historical conventions and mathematical convenience. The use of 'first' and 'second' in ordinal numbers is a relatively separate concept, and it is not as directly applicable to the standard units of time.

Input: What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Michele Cagan ? For instance  single women receiving child support often donât realize they may be able to use the head of household filing status. âThey file as single and they lose a lot of money â says  Michele Cagan  a CPA in Baltimore . People who recently married or divorced also are especially prone to using the wrong filing status  which results in botched returns  overpaid or underpaid taxes  and other headaches   she  adds. âJust because you guys arenât living in the same house doesnât mean youâre divorced for tax purposes â  she  says. âIf your state has legal separation  which not every state does  that counts as divorce for taxes  but otherwise if youâre technically married on Dec. 31  youâre married and you have to file married.â Sometimes people decide to file their tax returns after the April deadline because they canât afford to pay to the IRS what they owe. Thatâs a huge mistake   Cagan  says. Filing late compounds money problems. âThere are pretty big fines and penalties for not filing on time  especially if you owe â  she  warns. Late-filing penalties typically cost 5% of your unpaid tax for each month your tax return is late. And late-payment penalties run 0.5% of your unpaid tax for each month your tax payment is late. Thatâs just at the federal level  and it excludes interest. Filing an extension doesnât get you more time to pay   she  says. Itâs just an extension of the time to file. Thereâs also no reason to procrastinate on preparing your return. âIf you file early  you donât have to pay early. Thatâs another thing people donât know â  Cagan  says. âYou can file early  owe money  and as long as you pay by the deadline  youâre fine.â The rules about who counts as a dependent can be complicated  but one thing is clear: Two people canât claim the same person as a dependent. Divorced couples mess it up all the time  though   Cagan  says. Both parents mistakenly claim the kids as dependents  or neither does. âPeople donât talk to each other  because theyâre getting divorced and they donât want to talk to each other â  she  says. People often use the same tax software version for far too long   Cagan  says. They assume that what worked last year also will work this year. But events such as buying a house  having a baby or getting married can create more-complex tax situations  she says.

Given a movie frame  you want to understand what's happening in it â and what will happen next. That balance of wonder and dread is a fundamental draw of film  and a touchstone of the horror genre. The questions Kendall R. Phillips asks in A Place of Darkness: The Rhetoric of Horror in Early American Cinema are: How did we get from the nickelodeon special-effects \\"cinema of attractions\\" to understanding horror narratives as their own genre? And what does America's relationship with horror tell us about the idea of being American in the first place? A Place of Darkness is about as academic as they come; expect discussion of the \\"paradigm of monstration\\" and the ways weird films \\"provided a counternarrative to the emerging American rationalist epistemology.\\" But the book's central arguments make for great reading  as  Phillips  lays out the ways that proto-horror movies contained distinct and disparate rhythms (suspense  surprise  superstition)  how the need for legitimacy led to literary adaptation as a horror standard  how movies developed alongside audiences to bring new immediacy to onscreen dread  and how shifting visions of the Other forced movies to constantly renegotiate what  exactly  people were meant to be afraid of.  Phillips  draws these elements together under the idea of horror as an exploration of cultural fears within 'acceptable' parameters. When \\"the pressure to create a homogeneous American culture necessitated securing the popular American movie screen for the purpose of indoctrinating immigrants \\" the past was an old world fraught with terrors  and the present was a new one full of uncertainty. \\"Both on the screen and in the discussions surrounding early screen practice  a line of demarcation was drawn between the incredulous  civilized  white American male and the superstitious  uncivilized  gendered  and racialized Other.\\" (Though this book ends with Dracula and Frankenstein  there's a straight line to the cultural conversations modern films are having with their own genre histories â look no further than Get Out for a horror movie that tackles this dynamic head-on and radically redraws that line of demarcation.) As with many academic texts  this effort to frame a new argument means the book only scrapes the surface of some of its most interesting suggestions. We're duly warned that  Phillips  intended \\"an exercise in rhetorical criticism  in that  its  focus has been on the way these horrific elements were depicted  discussed  and contested \\" but that question of American identity and the shifting Other is compelling enough to overwhelm some of the rhetorical specifics. (Several early thrillers that use inheritances  wagers  and other greed as the motive for crime and terror are listed in order to slot them into the 'melodrama' aspect of emerging horror. But was this merely a reason to fill a house with false ghosts? Was there some deeper American unease about money and the wealthy in the late 1920s that spurred so many successful movies in which the unscrupulous rich made life miserable for others? Perhaps the book's designed to prompt such questions from the reader; if there's one thing an academic text will tell you  there's always room for more research.)

Input: Abstract: Of a total of 1561 patients registered in the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) as of May 1983, 78 patients (5%) were younger than 1 year of age. These infants did not differ from the older children (1-20 years of age) in male/female ratio, clinical grouping, or survival rates. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma, 18% versus 7% in older children (P less than 0.005). Infants also had a significantly greater proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology, 10% versus 4% in older children (P less than 0.005). When reviewed by the newly proposed IRS cytopathologic classification, there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age groups. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children, 24% versus 10% (P less than 0.05). In addition, infants tended to receive less of the prescribed doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children, and to develop more toxicity to treatment than older children. Despite these differences, the overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar. In contrast to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, in which age (less than 1 year) is a favorable prognostic factor, age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma.   Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Infants younger than 1 year of age with rhabdomyosarcoma. option2: Evaluation of dietary screening tools appropriate for dental practices. Output:","output":"The apt title for the abstract is: Option 1: Infants younger than 1 year of age with rhabdomyosarcoma. The abstract discusses the clinical and pathological features of rhabdomyosarcoma in infants younger than 1 year of age, including their frequency, clinical grouping, survival rates, and differences in pathological types compared to older children. The abstract concludes that age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma, in contrast to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma.

No bacteria can live in fat. Going rancid is a chemical reaction in which the fat molecules break down. So \\"leaving out\\" is not a problem. The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. The above assumes pure, well-strained fat. Pieces of fried meat left over in the fat are a safety risk, even tiny ones.  <sep>  Q: How long does grease take to go bad/rancid when sitting out?

Input: Paragraph: \\"In metro Atlanta, the land of smog alerts and farmland-turned-to-suburbs, one local county makes a bold claim about its efforts to be environmentally conscious. DeKalb County, its website says, is \\"\\"the greenest county in America.\\"\\" Let's put that on some recycled paper and send it to each of the county's estimated 750,000 residents. DeKalb's communications director, Burke Brennan, sent PolitiFact Georgia an e-mail making the case for the county. It includes: \\"\\"In DeKalb County, we are taking the lead on sustainability ...  we are one step closer to being the greenest county in America,\\"\\" DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis said in 2009 when the county was honored by the ARC. Many folks we discussed this claim with used phrases like \\"\\"bold\\"\\" or \\"\\"ambitious\\"\\" to describe DeKalb's audacity, not willing to publicly dismiss it. Some were willing to criticize the claim. \\"\\"That's all a good case for them to be one of the greenest counties in Georgia,\\"\\" said Mark Woodall, Georgia chapter chairman of the Sierra Club, which claims to be the largest grassroots environmental organization in the state. \\"\\"DeKalb being the greenest county in America seems pretty unthinkable.\\"\\" Being \\"\\"green,\\"\\" means many things these days. Some organizations have occasionally released surveys rankings America's greenest cities, but we found few similar rankings of counties. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to improve health and health care for Americans, earlier this year looked at the environmental health of each U.S. county. One category was physical health. The foundation used data put together by researchers from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the physical health of each county. The criteria included how many days the air was unhealthy, the number of days the air was unhealthy due to ozone, access to healthy foods and how many liquor stores were in a county. DeKalb ranked near the bottom of Georgia counties, 153rd, in terms of physical health. Some categories that DeKalb is bragging about are difficult to compare. In other areas, such as the number of LEED-certified buildings, Dekalb has competition. Gwinnett had three LEED-certifiied structures, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. DeKalb is an Energy Star partner -- a federal effort to protect the environment through energy-efficient practices -- but so are Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta. On hiking and biking trails, DeKalb may run into some argument about having the most in Georgia. Cobb County, for example, lists about 75 miles of trails within its cities and unincorporated areas. It was suggested we look at Arlington County, Va. to find another county that could make a case it is greener than DeKalb. The county has a page on its website with more than a dozen awards and recognition for its sustainable community and environmental efforts. Arlington won two National Association of Counties Achievement Awards this year for its recycling efforts. That organization also named Arlington its Outstanding Civil Engineering Project award in 2006 for its Green Building Program. Other counties, like Boulder, Colo., have goals such as reducing outdoor water use by 50 percent by using indigenous plants and recycling 50 percent of construction waste. DeKalb's case was muddied in December when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined 453,000 for 836 sewage spills over the last five years. The EPA estimates there are about 40,000 spills from the nation's 25,000 sewage systems a year. California officials reported about 2,000 spills into the San Francisco Bay in 2008. Brennan noted the day after the fine was announced, county commissioners voted 6-1 to spend 1.345 billion to make repairs to its water and sewer system, nearly twice as much money as the EPA recommended. DeKalb taxpayers will pay higher water and sewer bills to help fund the work. Despite the fine, Brennan stuck by DeKalb's claim. \\"\\"Nobody here is claiming perfection, but based on the programs, awards, designations and initiatives DeKalb has in place and ongoing, I am sticking with the motto 'DeKalb is the greenest county in America,' \\"\\" Brennan told us in an e-mail. \\"\\"After all, 'Cowboy Capital of the World' was already taken,\\"\\" added Brennan, referring to Oakdale, Calif.  DeKalb has certainly tried to make its mark as an environmentally conscious county. But DeKalb's claim of being the \\"\\"greenest county\\"\\" in the nation ignores critical facts that would give a visitor to its web site a different impression.\\" Claim: The Greenest County in America. Output:","output":"Confidence: 70% The claim \\"The Greenest County in America\\" is more accurately classified as \\"0\\" as there is at least one piece of contradictory evidence in the paragraph in the form of the fine imposed by the EPA for 836 sewage spills over the last five years.

After adjusting for age, sex, PD duration, diabetes mellitus, mean blood pressure, and history of CV disease, the association between AoAC grading and mortality were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard model.', 'Age (pxa0<xa00.001), PD duration (pxa0=xa00.004), history of CV disease (pxa0<xa00.001), and renal Kt/V (pxa0=xa00.031) were associated with AoACS. After a mean follow-up of 55.1xa0±xa032.1xa0months, patients with Grade 2 (pxa0=xa00.011) or Grade 3 (pxa0<xa00.001) AoAC had higher all-cause mortality than patients with Grade 0 AoAC. In addition, patients with Grades 2 and 3 AoAC had higher CV-related mortality than those with Grades 0 and 1 AoAC (pxa0=xa00.013). Grade 2 [hazard ratio (HR)xa0=xa02.736; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.038-7.211; pxa0=xa00.042] and Grade 3 AoAC (HRxa0=xa03.289; 95% CI, 1.156-9.359; pxa0=xa00.026) remained associated with all-cause mortality after adjustment. Similarly, Grades 2 and 3 AoAC (HRxa0=xa036.05; 95% CI, 3.494-372; pxa0=xa00.026) significantly correlated with CV mortality after adjustment. Output:","output":"Based on the provided passage, the definite objective/aim/goal of the study is to evaluate the association between aortic arch calcification (AoAC) grading and mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). The study aims to answer the following questions: 1. What is the prevalence of AoAC in patients undergoing PD? 2. What are the factors associated with AoAC grading in these patients? 3. Is there an association between AoAC grading and mortality in these patients? The study uses a cohort design and includes 190 patients undergoing PD. The authors use chest X-rays to detect AoAC and grade it according to a specific score. They then use multiple regression analyses to determine the factors associated with AoAC grading and mortality. The study has a clear objective/aim/goal and a well-defined methodology to achieve it, which makes it a well-structured and well-designed study.

Input: Passage: Insulators In contrast to metals, electrical insulators are materials that conduct electricity poorly because their valence bands are full. The energy gap between the highest filled levels and the lowest empty levels is so large that the empty levels are inaccessible: thermal energy cannot excite an electron from a filled level to an empty one. The valence-band structure of diamond, for example, is shown in part (a) in . Because diamond has only 4 bonded neighbors rather than the 6 to 12 typical of metals, the carbon 2s and 2p orbitals combine to form two bands in the solid, with the one at lower energy representing bonding molecular orbitals and the one at higher energy representing antibonding molecular orbitals. Each band can accommodate four electrons per atom, so only the lower band is occupied. Because the energy gap between the filled band and the empty band is very large (530 kJ/mol), at normal temperatures thermal energy cannot excite electrons from the filled level into the empty band. Thus there is no pathway by which electrons can move through the solid, so diamond has one of the lowest electrical conductivities known.

This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Input: Question: What is the primary cause of air movement in the troposphere? Answer: differences in heating Output:","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are some supporting facts for the answer that differences in heating are the primary cause of air movement in the troposphere: 1. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, extending from the surface up to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) high. This layer is where most of the Earth's weather occurs, and air movement in this layer is driven by differences in heating. 2. The sun heats the Earth's surface unevenly, with more energy being absorbed near the equator than at higher latitudes. This creates a gradient in temperature from the equator towards the poles, with the warmest air rising and cooler air sinking. This gradient is the primary driver of air movement in the troposphere. 3. The rate of heating of the air also plays a role in air movement. As air is heated, it expands and becomes less dense, causing it to rise. This is known as convection, and it is the primary mechanism for transporting heat and moisture in the troposphere. 4. The Coriolis force, which is caused by the Earth's rotation, also plays a role in air movement in the troposphere. As air moves towards the equator, it is deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection creates large-scale circulation patterns, such as trade winds and westerlies, which help to distribute heat and moisture around the globe. 5. Finally, the Earth's topography, including mountains and valleys, can also influence air movement in the troposphere. As air moves over and around these features, it can be forced to rise or fall, leading to the formation of clouds and precipitation. In summary, differences in heating are the primary cause of air movement in the troposphere, with the gradient in temperature, the rate of heating, the Coriolis force, and the Earth's topography all playing a role in shaping the large-scale circulation patterns that dominate this layer of the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Given a sentence and a label in Croatian, select the correct answer.

Two hundred forty-one patients with dilation of 271 coronary sites were randomized at the time of hospital discharge to receive nifedipine, 10 mg (123 patients), or placebo (118 patients) four times daily for 6 months. No patient was known to have coronary artery spasm. The mean duration of therapy was 4.4 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) months for nifedipine and 4.3 +/- 2 months for placebo. A restudy angiogram was available in 100 patients (81%) in the nifedipine group and 98 patients (83%) in the placebo group. A recurrent coronary stenosis was noted in 28% of patients in the nifedipine group and in 29.5% of those in the placebo group (p = NS). The mean diameter stenosis was 36.4 +/- 23% for the nifedipine group and 36.7 +/- 23% for the placebo group (p = NS). By pill count, 78% of patients receiving nifedipine and 82% of those receiving placebo complied with the study drug regimen. Coronary stenosis recurred in 33% of patients in the placebo group and in 29% of patients in the nifedipine group who complied with the regimen and had angiograms (p = NS).

Baker and his son C. Graham Baker. , A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition., High Roller : The Stu Ungar Story is a 2003 biopic focusing on the life of American professional poker and gin player Stu Ungar .

Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person., Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as the hole cards or hold cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards (\\"the flop\\"), later an additional single card (\\"the turn\\" or \\"fourth street\\") and a final card (\\"the river\\" or \\"fifth street\\"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from the combination of the community cards and their own hole cards. If a player's best five card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called \\"playing the board\\". Players have betting options to check, call, raise or fold.

Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize.

The combs beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a Mexican wave. From each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows, and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows.

The protein of FLK in the supernatants of cells was determined by ELISA. The chemotactic effect of the supernatants on monocytes was assessed by the in vitro chemotaxis assay. The phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK was assessed by Western blot.', 'Treatment of the cells with CTGF enhanced the mRNA expression of FLK and concentration of FLK in the supernatants. Pretreatment of the supernatants of CTGF-treated cells with anti-FLK antibodies partially inhibited the chemotactic effect of the supernatants on monocytes.

According to the passage, CTGF stimulation of mesangial cells resulted in enhanced mRNA expression of FLK and increased concentration of FLK in the supernatants. Additionally, pretreatment of the supernatants of CTGF-treated cells with anti-FLK antibodies partially inhibited the chemotactic effect of the supernatants on monocytes, suggesting that FLK is involved in the chemotactic effect of CTGF. Furthermore, CTGF treatment increased the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK, and pretreatment of the cells with inhibitors of phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK (PD98059 or UO126) decreased the CTGF-induced expression of phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK and concentration of FLK in the supernatants.

Avoid creating summaries that (i) contains additional information which is not present in reviews, (ii) look exactly like the review, and (iii) uses 5 or more same consecutive words or phrases given in the reviews. Input: Review_1: Nice quality for the case. Little window is convenient for seeing color crystals. Convenient shape for my purposes. Works as well as any other brands I've had. Case looks durable.I use these for protecting very expensive microphones I keep in sealed Tupperware style cases., Review_2: I put this in my safe because some things in it seemed to be 'Soggy. I had to recharge it by baking it. The only this I would change was to buy a couple or get a bigger one to extract more water., Review_3: I'm really not sure how good this is going to work. According to the instructions when the indicator turns green you are suppose to put it in the oven and dry it out. When I got mine the indicator was already mostly green., Review_4: Even though the humidity in the areas I used them ranges from 40% to 57%, the dry packs turned green much too quickly to be worth ordering more. I bought ten, and with a week or so, already some require 2 hours in the oven to dry out. Way too much energy. I'll probably need a stationary dehumidier., Review_5: Love this little unit. Small enough to place in any container I chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. Color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. Recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable weaponry or jewelry., Review_6: This dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, I even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. I keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack., Review_7: My husband is a Farrier and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. He has been using Silica Gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item.

We have placed the dry-pack silican gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. The slender dimension allowed us to do that. So far, we've had fewer jams. I've also used a larger replenishable desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper.

Input: This DVD is a MUST!!!! . I've been studying pilates and gyrotonics for six years with some of the top instructors in NYC but with the increasing popularity of pilates, the sessions have gotten absurdly expensive, which is why I wanted to try a DVD. I have never been one to work out in my home, but ths is truly an amazing workout and not only have I saved so much money by doing this DVD instead of my beloved studio sessions, but I'm able to incorporate it into my busy schedule and do it much more often than I ever could with the sessions.     As the reviews before me have indicated, the DVD is broken up into four segments that each target a specific area, but I think that's slightly misleading. While about sixty or seventy percent of the exercises in each section do target the area they are labeled under, each section also contains a variety of stretches and counter-workouts as well, which make for a more overall workout, whether you're doing one section or four at a time. For instance, in the section entitled \\"abs\\" you'll also find exercises that strengthen the back muscles and legs. Therefore, you're able to get a lot of variety and a great overall workout!     ******NOTE:  I recommend this highly for intermediates and advanced students of pilates, but NOT for beginners!!!  In order to do these exercises correctly, you must know the basic pilates foundation such as pelvic placement, breathing techniques, and proper alignment. If you are attempting these exercises as a beginner, they may seem straightforward, but without the proper foundation and knowledge (which is NOT explained), you may not be doing the exercises properly and worse, could get hurt.*******    For those who are newer to pilates, I would recommend perhaps watching the video first, as it moves at what I would consider a fast intermediate pace.

Here's why: * The reviewer uses very positive language throughout the review, such as \\"MUST!\\", \\"amazing workout\\", \\"save so much money\\", \\"incorporate it into my busy schedule\\", and \\"great overall workout\\". * The reviewer mentions that the DVD is divided into four segments that target specific areas of the body, but also includes a variety of stretches and counter-workouts, which makes it a well-rounded workout. * The reviewer provides a warning for beginners, stating that they should have a good foundation in pilates before attempting the exercises, as they can be challenging and potentially dangerous if not done correctly.
