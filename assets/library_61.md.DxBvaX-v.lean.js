Важно использовать кавалерию для прорывов в слабые места врага. - Армия 2, обладающая большей мобильностью и мощными существами, должна сосредоточиться на использовании своих превосходств в воздухе, маневренности и ударном потенциале драконов для нанесения максимального ущерба. **Вывод:** Имея в виду мощь и уникальные возможности армии 2, включая многоцелевую атаку гидр, огромную мощь драконов и маневренность кентавров и грифонов, всё это дает им существенное превосходство. Армия 1, несмотря на разнообразие и численность, будет иметь значительные трудности в сражении с высокомобильными и мощными юнитами армии 2. **Однозначный ответ:** Армия 2 имеет больше шансов на победу благодаря своей мобильности, мощи и уникальному составу существ, способных наносить колоссальные уроны как в дальнем, так и в ближнем бою."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, riveting, drama-filled, action-packed, military-action-packed, magical action-filled dialogue-filled excerpt set in a cyberpunk, science fiction, high fantasy, science fantasy setting for a crossover fanfic between the Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai [Unbreakable Machine-Doll| Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai|] light novel, manga and anime franchise , the Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!

Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the 3 January 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute Imperial Royal parliamentary monarchy but de jure feudal royal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu's more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan |the sei-i taishōgun| during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 in Japanese history who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun's more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the collection of various powers that supported the bakufu and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun/sei-i taishōgun and nominally to the Japanese emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], [the Tokugawa bakufu] ruling [the Tokugawa bakufu] over Japan and Okinawa, [the Meiji Restoration in the Tokugawa bakufu] that [the Meiji Restoration] allowed the Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty to [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] reclaim its [the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] executive power over the Japanese government and [the Meiji Restoration] dissolved the Tokugawa shogunate and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the formation of the post-1868, pre-1947 the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled unitary Imperial parliamentary democratic Royal monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Third Japanese Empire/Great Japan/Imperial Japan/Empire of Japan ruling [the Great Japanese Empire] over [the Great Japanese Empire's territories] the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Russia's Sahalkin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands, Okinawa/Ryūkū, the Caroline's, the Marinas and Palau from [the Great Japanese Empire's homebase and stronghold] the Japanese Home Islands and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the rise of Japan as a political, military, economic and industrial superpower, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] does not lead to the displacement of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns and the samurai class due to the Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato regaining its power due to the Meiji Restoration as in OTL, but [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] is [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [what the Meiji Restoration is in this timeline] a compromise between the conservative feudal elites that support the Tokugawa clan and the bakufu system and the liberal democrats who support the imperial family in Tokugawa bakufu-ruled feudal Japan, with the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan maintaining their [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan's] positions as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan but [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] effectively only controlling Japanese local government in this timeline and [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] also leading the Japanese military into battle, with the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty in their [ the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] role as Japanese Emperors/Empresses being Japanese head of state and also the head of the Japanese armed forces. The buke/samurai and the daimyō are [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] not abolished [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] like in OTL but rather [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] into the Great Japanese Empire's post-1868, post-1947 hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [Magnificent/Exalted lineage |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The industrial, economic and military development that made Japan into a great power after the Meiji Restoration in OTL continues unhindered and the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, is [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] still [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] formed [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] in 3 January 1868 like in OTL, however the centuries-earlier victory of the Japanese in the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched [the Imjin Wars] by the hereditary military dictatorship of the Ashikaga bakufu de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in the entire Korean peninsula and the state it [Great Joeson] was [Great Joeson] a vassal [Great Joeson] to, the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" ruling over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, Yunnan and Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|] unlike in OTL and the subsequent annexation of post-Imjin Wars Korea into Ashikaga bakufu-ruled feudal Japan as the Japanese province of Chōsen with with Hideyoshi taking the last King of Joeson before the Imjin Wars in this timeline, Seonjo's daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong as his [Hideyoshi's] latest concubine after the Imjin Wars in this timeline and compliant members of Korea's indigenous slave-owning, sex-slave owning, China loving, resistant to change, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility, the yangaban, [compliant members of the yangaban] along with compliant members of the Korean royal family [the House of Jeonju Yi] being [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] married off [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] into Japanese royalty, aristocracy and nobility after the Japanese victory in the Imjin Wars and the subsequent dissolution of Joeson and the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan as Chōsen in this timeline with buke/samurai and daimyō from the Japanese Home Islands slowly replacing the yangaban and the now-dissolved Joeson's ground force in this timeline, the now-dissolved Joeson Army as the main aristocratic and military presence within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea with anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi after its [post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea's in this timeline] annexation into Japan as Chōsen being [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi] hunted down and [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] either killed, reeducated or [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan] deported [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] to the Ming dynasty by the Japanese, who [the Japanese] then [the Japanese in this timeline] after [the Japanese in this timeline] liberating the mostly illiterate, uneducated, impoverished and starving Korean people from the yangaban and the useless Korean royals [the House of Jeonju Yi] due to [the Japanese in this timeline] winning the Imjin Wars in this timeline, [the Japanese in this timeline] undertake a comprehensive education, primitive industrial and religious reform system in the post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korean peninsula, with schools being opened up for the common Korean people to get an education for themselves and their children and land reform in Korea being initiated by Hideyoshi by having seized yangban and House of Jeonju Yi estates go to ethnic Korean peasant farmers and ex-slaves within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea in this timeline. The native Korean script for writing the Korean language, Hangul is [Hangul in this timeline] discovered [Hangul in this timeline] by the Japanese after the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan and [Hangul in this timeline] subsequent spread and promoted as the way [Hangul in this timeline] to [Hangul in this timeline] write Korean by the Japanese in the timeline, who [the Japanese in this timeline] also promote the spread of the Japanese language and the heavily modified traditional Chinese characters used to write the Japanese language, Kanji, over the traditional Chinese characters used to write Korean utilized by the yangban and the House of Jeonju Yi, Hangul. The Japanese in this timeline also [the Japanese in this timeline] promote the Japanese indigenous national religion and state religion of Shinto, Zen Buddhism and even Christianity over traditional Korean shamanism, Taoism and Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea as well in this timeline, with the liberated Korean masses flocking to these new religions [ Shinto, Zen Buddhism and Christianity] in droves. The Japanese also [the Japanese in this timeline] begin a massive effort to [the Japanese in this timeline] absorb the Koreans into the Greater Japanese race and [the Japanese in this timeline] also integrate the Koreans into the Japanese political, social and economic systems, [the Japanese in this timeline] encouraging many Korean commoners in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea to take Japanese names and let their children think of themselves as Japanese, speaking, writing and thinking in Japanese. This is hugely successful and the Koreans are [the Koreans in this timeline] eventually assimilated [the Koreans in this timeline] into the Japanese nation as the centuries go by, mostly thinking, speaking and writing in Japanese by the time of the alternate Meiji Restoration in this timeline, although a now heavily Japanese, Manchu/Manchurian and Chinese influenced Korean language still exists as a \\"dialect\\" of Japanese in this timeline, with Korea and the Koreans having roughly the same status as Okinawa and the Okinawans in both OTL Japan and this version of Japan in this timeline Hideyoshi also [Hideyoshi] conquers Russia's Sakhalin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands in this timeline after Imjin Wars in this timeline, which [Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in this timeline] become the Japanese province of Karufuto By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Japanese Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Japanese Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still [the Jurchens in this timeline] emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Japanese conquering the Tungning Kingdom in this timeline] on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Japanese also [the Japanese] work to assimilate the Chinese refugees from the Ming that make up the Tungning Kingdom's population and the main indigenous people in Taiwan who also make up 70% of Taiwan's population, the Han Chinese, or rather subgroup who speak Hokkien, a Southern Min language and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo, [the Japanese working to assimilate the Hoklo] and the other indigenous tribes of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese population in this timeline using the same methods as used in Korea in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Returning to the alternate version of late 19th century to early 20th century Japan after the alternate version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces' ground warfare branch, the Imperial Japanese Army is [the Imperial Japanese Army] still [the Imperial Japanese Army] formed in February 1872 like in OTL but [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] is [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] significantly stronger than its [[the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline's] OTL counterpart due to the earlier conquest and subsequent integration of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Korea and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in Japan along with the discovery and exploitation of the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] by the Japanese The IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] is [the Kempeitai in this timeline] still [the Kempeitai in this timeline] formed on 4 January 1881 like in OTL The Cantonese Hakka-medical student turned Han nationalist, revolutionary, politician and statesman Dr. Sun Wen, [Wen] better known as Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is [Wen/Yat-Sen] assassinated [Wen/Yat-Sen] by a joint team of the UK's foreign intelligence M16 and the Russian Empire's combined secret police and foreign intelligence agency, the Okhrana when [Wen/Yat-Sen] studying in the Great Japanese Empire under the Japanese alias Kikori Nakayama [when Wen/Yat-Sen studied in the Japanese Empire under the name Nakayama] from 1899 to 1903. The mixture of steampunk and early diesel technology and sorcery known as Machinart [Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai], circuits [Machinart] made from spells that [the Machinart circuits] are [the Machinart circuits] put [the Machinart circuits] into objects [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] bring them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to life and simultaneously [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] give them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence, [the development of the Machinart circuits] continues [the development of the Machinart circuits] in the United Kingdom in the early 20th century. These Automatons [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] were [the Automatons] developed as a military weapon by the British government and spread throughout the world; the humans in charge of them [the Automations] became known as puppeteers. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution fought [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched and fought in the Xinhai Revolution] the anti Manchu Han nationalist and Cantonese nationalist revolutionary group adhering to republican, nationalist, and socialist objectives of the Tongmenghui which [the Tongmenghui] was [the Tongmenghui] founded by Wen/Yat Sen in 1905 in OTL which, [the Tongmenghui both in OTL and this timeline] later became the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society/revolutionary of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the Xinhai Revolution and the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] had [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people before and after the Xinhai Revolution, [the Kuomingtang, Tongmenghui and Yellow Sand Society launching the Xinhai Revolution] against the Manchu dominated, Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Manchuria, whose [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal was [the goal of the Xinhai Revolution both in OTL and in this timeline] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\" in other words [Overthrow Qing and restore Ming] restoring the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government [the Ming dynasty] of a post-Qing Han China, [the Xinhai Revolution fought to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming dynasty as the government of post-Qing Han China] still [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] happens despite Wen's/Yat Sen's earlier death due to the strength and influence of Han nationalism and Han monarchist groups in Qing-occupied Han China and the covert and open support Japan gives to the Tongmenghui both in OTL and in this timeline. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China all [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] break away [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] from Manchuria like Han China during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. The post-1912, pre-1928 and then post-1937, pre-1945 the stratocratic [military dominated] Beiyang Government-ruled presidental parliamentary democratic republic of the First Republic of China is [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] still [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] formed [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] as the government [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] of post-Qing, post-Xinhai Han China like in OTL while Manchuria still [Manchuria] comes [Manchuria] under the control of [which faction took over Manchuria] the Han Chinese bandit clique/military junta/Han Chinese government faction of the Fengtian Clique headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the Fengtian Clique's leader] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhang] known [Zhang] as [Zhang] \\"the Old Marshal\\", [Manchuria falling under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] despite the Qing Imperial Court continuing [the Qing Imperial court] still [the Qing Imperial court] existing in Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. When former top dog in the Great Qing Empire's modernized army corps envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang Government after the Xinhai Revolution and later the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China's first President, Yuan Shikai, [Shikai] still [Shikai] makes Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the unitary constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy of the Empire of China on 12 December 1915 like in OTL, everyone expects him [Shikai] to [Shikai] become Emperor [Shikai] of Han China. But unlike in OTL, he [Shikai] dies a day after [Shikai] forming the Empire of China in this timeline and so The Beiyang Government's armed wing and thus the first Republic of China's combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, [the Beiyang Army] built [the Beiyang Army] from both the Manchu and Han units of the now-dissolved New Army within Han China and the Beiyang Government's and thus the first Republic of China's and the Empire of China's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and House of Representatives, the National Assembly, [the Beiyang Army and the National Assembly] assume joint control over the Empire of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline, due to Yuan Shikai's eldest son, the half Korean Yuan Keding who [Keding] had [Keding] become Chinese Crown Prince under the combined era and regal name of Yuntai after Shikai formed the Empire of China, [Yuntai] refusing to become Emperor of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline. In order to stay afloat and not be toppled by the Chinese people like the Great Qing Empire, the Empire of China in this timeline decides to promote industrialization, development as well as the development of a National railway system in Han China along with [the Empire of China in this timeline] adopting a federalist, democratic system with the eighteen provinces of Han China proper being allowed autonomy, akin to the system of government in the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire and the USA. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China also sends many students to Japan for training, education and constitutional lessons, along with having the IJAF and the German Empire's unified ground and air force, the Imperial German Army both train and build up the Beiyang Army into a ultra-modern, developed, ready force. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline also reluctantly allows for the secession of Yunnan from Han China, which [Yunnan] subsequently restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government with support from the Japanese The joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China/Nationalist China based [Nationalist China] in [Nationalist China's] stronghold of [Nationalist China's stronghold and homebase] Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|], [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] still [Nationalist China] formed [Nationalist China] in this timeline due to the strong desire of the Cantonese people for independence from both Manchu and Han dominion and the large amount of Han nationalists and imperialists in the Cantonian population and [Nationalist China in this timeline] still [Nationalist China in this timeline] launches the Chinese Civil War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 known as the National Protection War against the Empire of China like in OTL, but [Nationalist China in this timeline] loses the National Protection War due to [why Nationalist China loses the National Protection War in this timeline] the massive corruption and incompetence in the Kuomingtang, the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army and the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan, along with the fact that most Cantonese don't want to be a part of China, whether Manchu or Han-dominated as well as Sun's/Yat-Sen's earlier death in this timeline denying Nationalist China the charismatic leadership it needs, An anti-Chinese unification, pro-Cantonese independence, pro-buisness, merchant-backed faction eventually grows strength in Nationalist China and launches a putsch that sees the take over of the Kuomingtang and the Legislative Yuan as the Beiyang Army decimates the NRA, leading to the leaders of the Kuomintang and the generals of the Beiyang Army agreeing to an armistice that sees the independence of Nationalist China and the abandonment of the territory of the Qing Empire by Nationalist China. British and French soldiers firing on Japanese soldiers helping the Beiyang Army against the NRA during the National Revolutionary War leads to the Japanese joining the Central Powers consisting of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [Japan joining the Central Powers in this timeline] in WW1 instead of the Central Powers' rivals consisting of the British Empire, the French supremacist, French imperialist, facist totalitarian dictatoral republic of the Third French Republic and the post-1861, pre-1947, French-Italian cadet branch of the German-Italian House of Savoy, the House of Savoy-Carignano ruled Unitary Constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy ruling over Italy, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritia and Somalialand, the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium ruling [the Russian Empire] over Siberia, the Baltics, the Caucuses, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Ukraine, Central Asia, Chechenya and Kalymkia from [the Russian Empire's homebase] European Russia, the Entente [Japan joining the Central Powers instead of the Entente like in OTL] with the IJAF destroying the Russian Asian fleet and [the IJAF] also providing support to liberation movements within the European colonies in Asia and Oceania, typing up European forces. The Japanese also seize control of the imperial Russian protectorate of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, Unitary Buddhist absolute monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State in Greater Mongolia and [the Japanese] use the Great Mongolian State to [the Japanese] assault Russian Siberia and Central Asia while the Imperial German Army assaults the Russian Empire from Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces, Austria-Hungary's combined land, sea and air combat forces [the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces] along with the combined armed forces of the Tsardom of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Imperial Armed Forces, clean up Russia's Serbian and Montenegrin puppets. The post-1842 army of the Ottoman Empire, after the country was reorganized along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period, the Modern Ottoman Army, eats out the flower of the Russian Empire's combined armed forces, divided into a standing army consisting of regular troops and two forces that served on separate regulations: the Cossack troops and the Muslim troops and a state militia, the Imperial Russian Army in the Caucuses and even along with the border with Iran. The Kempeitai also has former child refugee from the Confederate States during the American civil war turned failed professor and Confederate revisionist, Woodrow Wilson assassinated before he [Wilson] can [Wilson] become US President like in OTL and [Wilson in OTL] drag the USA into WW1. Without a charismatic figurehead [Wilson] to lead the movement to victory against the hated US Republicans, the American religious right, the civil rights movement and Germans in the USA, the American Democrat Party, more specifically its [the Democrat Party's] white nationalist, Anglophile, England worshipping, anti-Semitic, white supremacist, anti-German Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's armed wing, the KKK, [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] never launch the New Freedom Revolution of 1912 against the American government and the Republicans and [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] eventually fade from the political scene in the USA in this timeline, with some of them migrating to England or to British-controlled Canada. The Russian Empire is [the Russian Empire] forced [the Russian Empire] to [the Russian Empire] sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers. The terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk see the German Empire creating the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled absolute feudal royal monarchy of the United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the German Empire creating] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the German Empire] creating the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the restored German Empire creating] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal imperial absolute monarchy of the Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire] forming the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the German Empire] restoring the hereditary royal absolute tribal Buddhist monarchy of the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and [the restored German Empire restoring] the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire also restores the constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the side branch of the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. The Ottomans liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Khongirad-ruled absolute hereditary Islamic royal imperial monarchy of the Khanate of Khiva in western Uzbekistan, southwestern Kazakhstan and much of Turkmenistan and [the Ottomans] also liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Manghud-ruled absolute imperial royal monarchy of the Emirate of Bukhara in eastern Uzbekistan, western Tajikistan, parts of southern Kazakhstan, parts of Turkmenistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. The Great Japanese Empire establishes the Japanese protectorate of the constitutional presidential parliamentary republic of the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. After the defeat of the Russians in the war, the Germans and Austria-Hungarians are able to focus all their efforts on the Western front. The demise of the Democrat Party in the USA leads to the US government launching a crackdown on pro-British groups and organizations and so the Allies are unable to get any help from the Americans, so the Imperial German Army, with help from the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces, [the Imperial German Army and the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces] march into the French capital of Paris, with the British being forced to surrender when the Labor Party of England storms Parliament with the help of the British people and forces the British government to an armistice with the Central Powers. The shock of being defeated by an hated enemy is simply too much for the British to bear and so loyalist elements of the British army and public forcefully transport the British government and the current British royal family [the British branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha] to the British colonial dominion of British North America ruling over Canada, [the forced transport of the British government and royal family to Canada after the British defeat in WW1 in this timelien] leading to the formation of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Afghanistan and India] and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands in this timeline. At this timeline's Treaty of Versailles presiding over the division of the defeated Western Entente's territories, signed [this timeline's version of the Treaty of Versalies] in the Austrian City of Linz in this timeline, the Labor-dominated British government recognizes the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as legitimate and the Entente as the initiators of WW1 and [the British] accepting German control of the German House of Wettin-ruled federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Belgium, which [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] takes the French region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais to [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] form Greater Belgium. The Labor-dominated British government also recognizes the German annexation of Luxembourg and the loss of Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi to the Germans. The British also recognize the Albanian Muhammad Ali dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Egypt in Egypt's formal status as an Ottoman protectorate and also the independence of Sudan from the British and also the independence of all of Ireland as a unitary parliamentary royal monarchy under the rule of the Irish House of O'Neill Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1903 Austrian protectorate of the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] removes the imperial Russian puppet fake Serbian royal family, the Serbian House of Karađorđević from power in post-WW1 Serbia. Austria-Hungary also demands that Serbia take full responsibility for starting WW1 by [Serbia] murdering Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Serbian nationalist terror organization that started WW1 by murdering the last pre-1903 King of Serbia and then Franz Ferdinand, the Black Hand be [the Black Hand] treated as war criminals. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia's combined armed forces, the Royal Serbian Army is [the Royal Serbian Army] placed under Austrian supervision. The Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Montenegro becomes an Austrian puppet state as well, with The Kingdom of Montenegro's combined armed forces, Royal Montenegrin Army under Austrian supervision. The German House of Wied-Neuwied-ruled Constitutional royal monarchy of the Principality of Albania in Albania takes Kosovo. Bulgaria subsequently receives the Moesia plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountains range (Stara Planina), Thrace from Greece and Macedonia from Serbia. The German House of Wittelsbach-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Greece becomes a Austrian puppet state as well. The Empire of China receives Singapore and Hong Kong from the British and Macau from the Portuguese. The Japanese also liberate the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The Germans also take Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon from the French. The Germans also take the Congo from Belgium. The Germans combine Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon in addition to Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi into one massive Central African German colony, Mittleafrika [Middle Africa |Mittleafrika|]. Austria also takes Veneto from the Kingdom of Italy. Thus the Treaty of Linz in this timeline ends with a decisive Central Powers victory and the end of British and French influence over the world. The Empire of China in this timeline remains under an extended regency for a year or two after the National Protection War due to Yuntai refusing the Chinese throne in this timeline, that is until the goal of the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline [\\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\"] is remembered and so the surviving descendants of the Chinese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] are [the Zhu descendants] invited [the Zhu descendants] by [who invites the Zhu descendants] the National Assembly under pressure of the Yellow Sand Society, [the Zhu descendants being invited by the National Assembly] to [what the National Assembly invites the Zhu descendants to do] reclaim their [the Zhu descendants'] rightful position as the rulers [the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China, which they [the Zhu descendants] reluctantly [the Zhu descendants] accept, [the Zhu descendants] seeing [the Zhu descendants] that the people of the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in Han China support them [the Zhu descendants] and the monarchy [the Ming dynasty]. Yuntai relinquishes his [Yuntai's] claim to the Chinese throne and [Yuntai] allows his [Yuntai's] children and [Yuntai's] siblings to be absorbed into the Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Han China after the National Protection war in this timeline is compared to this timeline's version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline. The Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China ruling over Han China still has the official name of the \\"Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. A modified version of the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag becomes its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the Kuomintang's White Sun with a white-outer rayed, red inner-rayed yellow sun with the Chinese character for \\"Ming\\" in the middle of the yellow sun in tribute to the original Ming blue sky and red outer rayed yellow sun flag while the crossed 18-star iron blood flag of the Xinhai Revolution becomes the Chinese army flag. The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. The pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" era and the pre-Great Qing Empire, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility is [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] subsequently [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] restored, restructured, readjusted and modified for the modern world of the late 20th century, [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] being [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] merged [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] with the system of peerage Yuan Shikai had [Yuan Shikai] created when he [Yuan Shikai] formed the Empire of China in 1915. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] begins efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary democratic federalist Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing and also to initiate massive industrial, railway and educational development works in Han China with the help of international aid. The Beiyang Army is [the Beiyang Army] retooled, restaffed and rebuilt into a modern incarnation of the Great Ming State's combined ground warfare and naval combat force, the Great Ming Army after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China with help from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. Jingwei even becomes the Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet from 1939-1943, during which [Jingwei's first term as Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty] time the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the unitary parliamentary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] imperial dynastic monarchy of the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, which [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] remains [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] the form [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] that the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] takes [the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Ming dynasty] from 1938-1954, and [Wang Jingwei becoming Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet] again from 1945-1951. Before Jingwei, the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang still becomes the first Prime Minister of the Empire of China from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922, and Jingwei is [Jingwei] succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP in this timeline due to the Empire of China winning the National Protection War in this timeline, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members in this time, then Wu Shih-wen of the KMT from 20 May 2000 – 1 February 2002, Chiang Chung-ling of the KMT from March 2000 – 30 March 2003 , then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. After the Treaty of Linz in this timeline, France and the British Isles are stripped off all their power, influence and strength and subsequently become international pariahs. A revolution launched by socialist, communist and syndicalist groups against the fascist French regime in around 1918-1919 leads to the flight of the French fascists to French North Africa [French occupied Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia] and the subsequent joint invasion of the French mainland by the Imperial German Army and the Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. Mainland France soon falls quickly and the French House of Bourbon-ruled parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of France is [the Kingdom of France] restored [the Kingdom of France] as the government [the Kingdom of France] of Northern France by Austria-Hungary while the Germans restore the Feudal royal parliamentary monarchy of the Dutchy of Brittany in Brittany and [the Germans] establish an independent Occitan kingdom in Southern France. A communist takeover of the British Isles minus Ireland leads to the invasion of the British Isles by Germany and Austria-Hungary and the division of the British Isles into their separate Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Scotland in Scotland ruled by the German House of Wittelsbach, the Kingdom of England in England ruled by the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Dutchy of Wales ruled by the Welsh House of Anwyl of Tywyn. The Central Powers and the Japanese also sent aid to the monarchist, Russian nationalist, Russian fascist Whites fighting against the Communist Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War with the Whites winning the Russian Civil War, unlike in OTL. Germany makes European Russia a German protectorate under the Romanovs while the Bolsheviks flee to Siberia. The Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi/Pahlavi dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Imperial State of Iran is [the Imperial State of Iran] still formed in Iran in 1925, but Iran takes Dagestan from the restored Russian Empire, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Uzbekistan's and Turkmenistan's shared Khwarazm province, and [Iran] subsequently absorbs Afghanistan into itself [Afghanistan]. The Imperial State of Iran's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces receives training from the Germans and the Austria-Hungarians and become a modern, developed force. Due to WW1 ending with a Central Powers victory and fascism being contained to Italy and the Third French Republic in this timeline and communism being wiped out, national liberation movements never occur in Africa. The Central Powers and their satellite states surviving post-WW1 means that democracy is ironically more secure than OTL. The Brittanians use trickery and deceit to seize the former Confederate States of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina and integrate them [South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina] into British North America during a time of political chaos and instability in the USA, along with [the Brittanians] taking New England. This forces the Germans to make Texas into the Kingdom of Texas ruled by a side branch of the Hohenzollerns and the Japanese to seize the American West Coast, which [the American West Coast] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the Pacific States of America. The Japanese also seize Hawaii and [the Japanese] restore the Hawaiian House of Kawānanakoa-ruled semi-constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii in Hawaii. The influence of the Manchuria based division of the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground warfare division, the Imperial Japanese Army protecting the South Manchuria railway in Manchuria from Han Chinese bandits, the Kwangtung Army along with the IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] in Manchuria means that the Japanese are [the Japanese] able [the Japanese] to [the Japanese] push out Zhuolin and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria while [the Japanese] increasing the influence of the Qing Imperial Court and the indigenous Manchu nobility, aristocracy and royalty in Manchuria, [the Japanese decreasing the influence of the Fengtian Clique and increasing the influence of the Qing imperial court within post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] leading to it [post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becoming the pre-WW2 and WW2-era, post-1932, pre-1945 Imperial Japanese protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s, with the Great Qing Empire's last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, [Pu-Yi] becoming [what Pu-Yi becomes after the formation of Manchukuo] the first Emperor [Pu-Yi after Manchukuo's formation] of Manchukuo like in OTL. After Pu-Yi's death in [when Pu-Yi dies in this timeline] around 1970, his [Pu-Yi's] younger half brother Aisin-Gioro Puren becomes [Puren in this timeline] the Emperor of Manchukuo, [Puren in this timeline] followed by his [Puren's] son, Aisin-Gioro Yuzhang after his [Yuzhang's] death in [when Puren died] 2015, who [Yuzhang] intends [Yuzhang] to [Yuzhang] make his [Yuzhang's] daughter, Jin Xin Empress of Manchukuo upon his [Yuzhang's] death. The Cantonese statesman, diplomat and calligrapher Zheng Xiaoxu is the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo like in OTL, followed by the Manchurian general, warlord and politician Zhang Jinghui like in OTL, followed by Hu Qili, then Jiang Zemin. The armed Wing and thus the combined armed forces of the Fengtian Clique formed from Zhuolin's bandit forces and what remained of the Manchu Bannermen and the Qing New Army in Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution, the National Pacification Army, [the National Pacification Army] becomes a modern, well equipped military force under the watchful eye of the Kwangtung Army with help from the Imperial German Army and Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. The National Pacification Army eventually becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria becomes Manchukuo with Fengtian Clique and pro-China unification elements within the NPA being discredited, given extended sentences of leave to Nationalist China or the restored Ming dynasty, or otherwise removed in various ways. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria. Zhuolin's eldest son and his [Zhuolin's] heir to the leadership to the Beiyang Clique and thus of post-Xinhai Revolution, the pro-KMT, pro-Chinese unification, anti-Japanese Zhang Xueliang, [Xueliang] is [Xueliang] sent [Xueliang] to the restored Ming dynasty after Zhuolin's death via [Zhuolin's death] having his [Zhuolin's train] bombed, [Xueliang being sent to the restored Ming dynasty] in 1928. The New People's Society, a political organ [the New People's Society] that [the New People's Society] was [the New People's Society] designed [the New People's Society] to spread the Chinese government's [Reorganized Government of the Empire of China's] ideas to the Chinese public and [the New People's Society] mobilize economic and military support for the Chinese Reorganized Government and Japan, while [the new People's Society] training future civil servants, sending Chinese students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Han Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily with the core values emphasized were Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship, [the New People's Society] proves useful in getting the Chinese people to [the Chinese people] support the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and Japan, [the New People's Society] becoming the Han Chinese equivalent of the Concordia Association. When Yat-Sen's more famous student, the Cantonese revolutionary turned corrupt politician and then dictator who was Stalin’s puppet in China, Jiǎng Jièshí, who [Jièshí] was [Jièshí] better known as [Jièshí’s more famous alias] “Chiang Kai Shek”, [Jièshí/\\"Chiang\\"] [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí] attempts to [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek \\"in this timeline] seize control over both the KMT and Nationalist China and [Kai-Shek in this timeline] launch the 9 July 1926 – 29 December 1928 military campaign launched by the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army against both the Fengtian Clique and the Beiyang Government to reunify China, the Northern Expidition like in OTL, [Kai-Shek in this timeline attempting to seize control of Nationalist China and launch the Northern Expedition like in OTL] he [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] is [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí in this timeline] instead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] shot dead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] by a disgruntled Cantonese citizen and the ruling pro-Cantonese independence, anti-Chinese unification faction dominating the Legislative Yuan, [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] retakes power after Kai-Shek's death and [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] calls off the Northern Expedition. The Northern Expedition failing unlike in OTL allows Nationalist China, Manchukuo the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire to [Nationalist China, Manchukuo, the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire] survive post-1947 into the later half of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond. A short war between the Central Powers and the Canadian-based Brittanians, a Soviet rump republic and the North African-based Fourth French Republic in exile from around 1939-1947 which is this story's version of the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku] leads to the Japanese seizing Australia and New Zealand along with [the Japanese] participating in the liberation of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Burma from the British colonial occupation of the British Raj. Pakistan restores the Sunni Muslim Uzbek-Mongolian Imperial House of Babur-ruled Turko-Mongol khanate and Islamic sultanate of the Mughal Empire as its [Pakistan's] government after its [Pakistan's] liberation and [Pakistan] also takes Jannu and Kashmir. India proper becomes a federation of restored Muslim princely states, Muslim tribal duties and Muslim Kingdoms under the rule of the Uzbek Sunni Muslim Asaf Jahi dynasty ruling over Hyberdad. The Japanese also still liberate Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and East Timor from French and English colonial occupation but make Indochina into a federation of Muslim sultantes, tribal duties and local Kingdoms. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan in OTL, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] are [the JSDF] still formed in this timeline, but only as a defence force within the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units' respective cockpits in the respective units' prominent 'hump back', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass], [Brittania still developing the Knightmare Frames] in around 1955 like in canon Code Geass but Japanese spies steal the designs for the Knightmare Frames and mass produce their [the Japanese's] own, with German and Austria-Hungarian spies doing the same.

Raynare later [Raynare] decides to [Raynare] resume attending Majima as Yūma in order to [Raynare] get closer to Issei in this story while Mittelt in this story uses a fake human identity to [Mittelt in this story] attend Majima's middle school division in disguise while Kalawarna in this story becomes one of Majima's nurses. The excerpt should focus on Achika in this story as Miki giving birth to Issei as Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou watches, with Kiss-Shot observing in amusement disguised as a nurse. At the hospital room door, IJAF troops and JSDF troops stand guard along with Imperial German Army and Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces troops The 125th emperor of Japan with the same era and regal name, Heisei, and the current real-life head of the Tokugawa clan and thus the current shogun of Japan in this story, Tokugawa Iehiro, [Iehiro and Heisei in this story] both [Iehiro and Heisei in this story] pay a visit to the \\"commoner princess\\" [Miki as the Japanese Imperial Court knows her] and the \\"emperor who could never be\\" [Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou], with the then Emperor of Manchukuo Puren in this story along with the then Prime Minister of Manchukuo Zemin, the then Empire of China's Prime Minister Chiang Chung-ling, and the then Emperor of the Empire of Han China, Zhu Cǎiyī along with the then-Bogd Khan of the Great Mongolian State, the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, Jambalnamdolchoyjijantsan, and the current real-life head of the House of Hohenzollern and thus the then German Emperor in this excerpt, Georg Friedrich, along with the then real-life head of the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine and thus the then-Emperor of Austria-Hungary in this story, Otto von Habsburg, and the then-head of the House of Romanov and thus the then Russian Tsar in this story, Nicholas III also paying a visit, with the German Kaiser [Georg Friedrich] commenting to the Austria-Hungarian Kaiser [Otto] that Japan is the Asian combination of the UK and the Germanic states combined into one, it [Japan] has an Emperor acting as head of state and of the armed forces but a king [a shogun] to lead its [Japan's] forces into battle and a Prime Minister chosen from the winning party of the democratic elections to head the government. Otto then [Otto] reminds Georg Friedrich of the time when the German Empire in this story foolishly backed Kai-Shek because Kai-Shek had fooled the Germans into thinking he [Kai-Shek] wasn't influenced by the Soviets and that the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China would threaten German interests, only for the Empire of China to beat Nationalist China and [the Empire of China] restore the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. Manchukuo's Emperor Puren chuckles and comments that it was a good thing Kai-Shek failed [at unifying China] then, with Manchukuo's Prime Minister Zemin agreeing. Tsar Nicholas III of Russia just hopes that the then-Japanese royal princess' [Achika in this story as Miki's] then being born son [Issei as Achika in this story as Miki gives birth to him] won't assault Russia any further, with the then-Bogd Khan of the Great Mongolian State Jambalnamdolchoyjijantsan reminding him [Tsar Nicholas III of Russia] that Russia occupied large parts of Asia before WW1. Achika in this story as Miki finishes giving birth to Issei and Emperor Heisei of Japan along with Shogun Iehiro of Japan rush in along with the German Kaiser [Georg Friedrich] commenting to the Austria-Hungarian Kaiser [Otto] and the Chinese Emperor [Cǎiyī] only to see a mysterious woman [Kiss-Shot] besides a tired Achika in this story as Miki, [Kiss-Shot] petting Issei's kitsune ears and [Kiss-Shot] feeling Issei's soft, fluffy kitsune tails as she [Kiss-Shot] states he [newborn Issei] is [newborn Issei] destined for greatness and that she [Kiss-Shot] will [Kiss-Shot] lead and guide him [Kiss-Shot] to his [Issei's] destiny. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","output":"In the hospital room bathed in soft, artificial light, Nobuyuki—as Gorou—stands at Miki's side, his hand gripping hers firmly. Despite his unfathomable experiences across timelines and identities, the birth of his son carves a unique epitome of anxiety and excitement within him, emotions raw and genuine. Miki, even in exhaustion, maintains an admirable demeanor, her deep breaths syncing with the rhythmic beeps of the heart monitor. As a final, decisive push echoes softly, a new cry pierces the tranquility—an affirmation of life that has successfully embarked on its journey. \\"Congratulations,\\" the attending physician announces with a warm smile, carefully wrapping the newborn in a soft blanket before handing him to his mother. \\"You have a healthy baby boy.\\" Nobuyuki watches, a mix of pride and wonder painting his features, as Miki cradles the baby close. His gaze, however, momentarily shifts to a nurse standing unobtrusively at the corner, her identity known only to him as Kiss-Shot, her presence a testament to the intertwining fates and the concealed magical underpinnings of their world. At the doorway, an unusual congregation forms—a spectacle of eras and empires represented through their leaders. Their discussions hover around politics and past conflicts, but all fall silent as Kiss-Shot's voice, resonant yet soothing, fills the room. \\"He bears the marks of future greatness,\\" she states mysteriously, her eyes never leaving the infant, who quiets down as if in recognition of her words. \\"His journey will be pivotal, not just for Japan, but for the balance of our world. I shall ensure his guidance.\\" Outside, the gathered dignitaries exchange looks of intrigue and apprehension. The alliances and rivalries, the shared histories of their nations now seem to converge on this singular point in time, represented by the birth of this child. Emperor Heisei steps forward, his expression solemn yet hopeful. \\"May this new life herald a new era of peace and understanding amongst us,\\" he declares, his voice resonating with the weight of centuries of leadership. Shogun Iehiro nods in agreement, his thoughts on the future path of Japan and its place in the geopolitical tapestry. Kaiser Georg Friedrich, intrigued by the mention of the child's destined greatness, leans in, his curiosity piqued. \\"A child of prophecy, then? Our nations have seen the turmoil of war and the blossoming of peace. Let us ensure his legacy is one of unity and strength.\\" Otto von Habsburg adds, his tone reflective, \\"Indeed, our pasts are interwoven with victories and losses. May his story weave a future where the past's mistakes are lessons, not repetitions.\\" As discussions quietly swirl about destinies and legacies, Nobuyuki remains fixed on Miki and their son, Issei. The weight of Kiss-Shot's words does not escape him; he knows too well the intertwining of fate and free will. Yet, in this moment, as he observes his son—ears and tails unnoticed by the others, save for Kiss-Shot—he embraces a simple, incontrovertible truth: beyond prophecies and magic, here lies his family. And in the sanctuary of this hospital room, amidst a convergence of historical powerhouses, it's the silent vow he makes to guide and protect Issei—not just towards greatness, but towards happiness—that rings the most profound."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Крестьяне с серпами будут слабыми в бою, но могут служить как пушечное мясо. Лучники и рейнджеры с копейщиками и мечниками образуют основу армии, обеспечивая гибкость в ближнем бою. Копейщики, особенно ветераны, могут быть эффективны против кавалерии. Мечники и мастера меча предлагают высокую боевую мощь в ближнем бою. Кавалерия, включая всадников, чемпионов и паладинов, является ударной силой армии, крестоносцы же представляют собой элиту с высокими боевыми способностями. Тактика этой армии будет заключаться в использовании крестьян как первой линии для поглощения удара, затем включения стрелков и копейщиков для удержания врага на расстоянии, в то время как кавалерия и элитные юниты могут прорывать уязвимые места и наносить решающие удары. **Армия 2:** Армия 2 является более уникальной и фантазийной, состоящей из разнообразных существ с различными способностями. Полурослики с пращами представляют собой слабую дальнобойную поддержку. Боровы могут быть сильными в ближнем бою благодаря своим клыкам. Железные и стальные големы представляют собой тяжелую бронированную ударную силу, практически неуязвимую для обычного оружия. Птицы рух имеют воздушное превосходство, что может быть использовано для нападения с воздуха. Маги и архимаги добавляют эффективность сил армии за счет использования магии, что может быть критическим преимуществом. Гиганты и титаны являются разрушительной силой благодаря метательной молнии, представляя серьёзную угрозу даже для самых защищённых противников. Тактика этой армии будет заключаться в использовании магических и тяжелых юнитов для прорыва и уничтожения ключевых элементов вражеской армии, при этом воздушные и легкобронированные юниты будут обеспечивать поддержку и гибкость на поле боя. **Вывод:** Учитывая силу и разнообразие армии 2, в частности, за счет наличия магических способностей, высокой бронированности големов и воздушного преимущества, скорее всего, именно этой армии будет проще адаптироваться к различным тактическим ситуациям и противостоять угрозам, которые предлагает армия 1. К тому же, особое внимание следует обратить на эффективность магических атак против традиционно вооруженных сил, что может служить решающим фактором.

Армия 1 имеет в своем составе разнообразный набор существ, которые обладают уникальными способностями. Кентавры с луками могут обеспечивать дальнобойную поддержку и гибкость на поле боя, горгульи и грифоны могут атаковать с воздуха, что дает преимущество в мобильности. Минотавры и их цари представляют значительную угрозу в ближнем бою с их мощными секирами, в то время как гидры, благодаря своей регенерации, могут выдерживать повреждения длительное время. Драконы, особенно чёрный, представляют собой значительную силу на поле боя с их огненным дыханием, способным нанести разрушения массового поражения. Армия 2 также имеет мощный состав, включая полуросликов с пращами, которые могут действовать как легкая пехота, выступая в роли разведчиков или дистанционных бойцов. Боровы предоставляют мощную ближнюю атаку, в то время как железные и стальные големы добавляют крайне тяжелую броню и ударную мощь. Птицы рух и маги, включая архимагов, могут предложить значительную магическую и воздушную поддержку. Гиганты и титаны, акцентирующие метательную молнию, могут вызвать серьезные разрушения, особенно против скоплений сил противника или особо крупных существ. Тактически, Армия 1 может попытаться максимально использовать свои преимущества в подвижности и способности наносить урон на расстоянии, воздушное господство с грифонами и горгульями для атак во фланги и сзади, в то время как драконы могут атаковать ключевые объекты и силы противника. Однако, сила их существ в некоторой степени зависит от ближнего боя, где минотавры и гидры могут быть эффективны. В ответ, Армия 2 может использовать своих големов как живые баррикады для защиты более уязвимых единиц, таких как маги и полурослики, которые могут наносить урон на расстоянии. Магическая сила от магов и архимагов может быть ключом к противодействию драконам и другим тяжелым единицам противника. Гиганты и титаны с их способностью к метанию молнии могут нанести существенный урон по сосредоточенным силам противника или ключевым целям. Однозначный вывод о том, у кого больше шансов на победу, сложен, учитывая разнообразие и мощь представленных единиц.

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import java.sql.SQLException; @Configuration public class H2ServerConfiguration { @Bean(initMethod = \\"start\\", destroyMethod = \\"stop\\") public Server h2Server() throws SQLException { return Server.createTcpServer(\\"-tcp\\",\\"-tcpAllowOthers\\",\\"-tcpPort\\",\\"9092\\"); } } \`\`\` 这段代码中，\`createTcpServer\`方法通过几个参数配置了 TCP 服务器。其中： - \`-tcp\` 表示启动 TCP 服务器。 - \`-tcpAllowOthers\` 允许除了本机以外的其他计算机连接到数据库。 - \`-tcpPort\` 指定了服务器监听的端口号，这里为\`9092\`。 **注意**：如果您的应用程序已经在使用\`9092\`端口，您需要选择一个不同的端口。 经过上述配置，您的 H2 数据库就可以在服务器模式下运行了，而且可以接受外部软件的连接请求。确保您的防火墙设置允许通过所配置的端口进行通信。 最后，使用您喜欢的数据库管理工具（例如：DBeaver, H2 Console, etc.），使用前面配置的用户名、密码和 JDBC URL（类似于\`jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/test\`）来连接到数据库。"},{"instruction":"你的意思是，h2数据库不在由springboot指定存放文件了，而是作为独立数据库了","output":"抱歉，如果我的回答造成了混淆。让我更清晰地解释一下： H2数据库可以以两种模式运行：**嵌入式**（Embedded）模式和**服务器**（Server）模式。在嵌入式模式中，数据库是作为应用程序的一部分运行的，只能由当前应用程序访问。而在服务器模式下，H2数据库作为一个独立的服务器进程运行，可以被同一网络上的其他客户端访问。 从你的原始配置来看，使用的是嵌入式模式（通过jdbc:h2:file:...），这种模式下数据库文件是被直接存储在文件系统中，并且默认情况只能被运行这个数据库的应用程序访问。 如果你想要让其他数据库管理软件接入，你需要让H2数据库以**服务器模式**运行，而不仅仅是启用一个额外的服务器端口。当以服务器模式运行时，H2数据库会作为一个独立进程运行，并且监听特定的TCP/IP端口以接受来自其他客户端的连接。这样，不仅Spring Boot应用程序，其他程序也可以通过网络连接到这个H2数据库实例。 上面的解释对于“由Spring Boot指定存放文件”和“作为独立数据库运行”可能有些混淆，重新澄清一下： - **嵌入式模式**：数据库与应用程序紧密集成，在同一个JVM中运行。数据库文件是由应用程序指定，并且由它独占。 - **服务器模式**：数据库在自己的JVM进程中运行，允许多个客户端通过网络连接。这使得即使应用程序关闭了，其他程序（如数据库管理软件）仍然可以访问数据库。 要实现后者，即**服务器模式**，你可以按照我上一条回复中的步骤操作：将JDBC URL从文件模式改为TCP服务器模式，并通过额外的配置来启动H2的TCP服务器。 重要的是，无论使用哪种模式，你都可以指定数据库文件的位置（对于嵌入式模式），或者在服务器模式下，数据库仍然会存储在某个位置，但可以被多个客户端访问。"},{"instruction":"也就是说让h2数据库和spring脱钩了，相当于像mysql那样的独立服务了，springboot也不知道h2数据库文件在哪里","output":"是的，您的理解是正确的。将 H2 数据库配置为服务器模式，使其工作得更像是一个常规的数据库服务器（如 MySQL 或 PostgreSQL），意味着它会作为一个独立的服务运行，而不是嵌入到 Spring Boot 应用中。在这种配置下，Spring Boot 应用（或任何其他应用程序）通过网络连接到 H2 服务器，就像连接到任何其他远程数据库服务器一样。 在这种模式下，Spring Boot 应用（和其他可能的客户端）确实不需要知道数据库文件的实际位置。它们只需要知道如何通过网络（使用正确的地址和端口）连接到 H2 服务器。数据库文件的管理（例如，其存放的位置）是在 H2 服务器端进行配置的，与 Spring Boot 应用是分离的。 这种方式有几个优点： 1. **独立管理**：数据库可以独立于应用程序管理和运行，这在多个应用服务需要共享同一数据库时特别有用。 2. **更易于访问**：由于数据库监听在网络端口上，因此开发人员和数据库管理员可以使用标准的数据库管理工具远程连接到数据库进行查询、监控和管理。 3. **更接近生产环境配置**：在开发环境中使用与生产环境相似的数据库配置可以提高配置一致性，减少上线时出现的问题。 要实现这种配置，您需要手动启动 H2 服务器（或者通过应用程序自动启动，如之前例子所示），并确保您的 Spring Boot 应用（以及其他任何需要访问数据库的客户端）的配置用的是正确的网络连接字符串。同时，您还要确保网络安全设置（如防火墙规则）允许这种类型的连接。 总之，将 H2 配置为服务器模式提供了更多的灵活性和可访问性，但也需要您负责管理数据库服务器的启动、配置和维护。"},{"instruction":"CommandLineRunner和ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent> 为什么在SpringBootTest的时候，CommandLineRunner里面使用bean时，ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>里的bean没被加载，而正常启动的时候没问题","output":"在 Spring Boot 应用中，\`CommandLineRunner\`接口和\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`接口提供了两种在应用启动完成后执行代码的方式。然而，它们在应用启动过程中的执行时机稍有不同，这可能会导致在不同场景（如正常启动 vs. 使用\`@SpringBootTest\`进行测试）下行为表现不一致。 # \`CommandLineRunner\` 实现\`CommandLineRunner\`接口的组件会在所有 Spring Beans 都初始化之后、应用启动完成之前被调用。这意味着此时 ApplicationContext 已经完全准备好，所有的 Beans 都已经加载和初始化完成。 # \`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\` 实现\`ApplicationListener\`接口并监听\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`的组件会在 Spring 的\`ApplicationContext\`被初始化或刷新时被调用。通常，\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`事件会在所有的 Bean 都被初始化后发布，这听起来和\`CommandLineRunner\`的执行时机很相似。 # 测试环境下的差异 在使用\`@SpringBootTest\`进行测试时，Spring Boot 的测试环境设置使得上述组件的行为可能会有所不同。\`@SpringBootTest\`为测试准备了一个 Spring 应用上下文，但其行为可能与正常启动应用时略有差异，特别是在事件发布和命令行运行方面。测试环境可能会更加注重测试上下文的准备和控制，而不是完全模拟正常的应用启动流程。 当你在\`CommandLineRunner\`中访问一个 Bean 时，这个 Bean 可能由于以下原因之一在\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`中尚未完全初始化或配置： 1. **测试上下文管理**：测试环境可能会根据需要延迟某些 Bean 的初始化，或者根据不同的测试策略采取不同的初始化顺序。 2. **事件发布的时机**：在测试环境中，\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`事件的发布可能会被影响，导致监听该事件的组件在不同的时间点被调用。 3. **加载和依赖差异**：测试时，Spring Boot 可能会根据测试配置创建一个略有不同的 Bean 定义和依赖注入图。这可能会影响 Bean 的加载顺序和可用性。 # 解决方法 如果您在测试环境中遇到这样的问题，您可以考虑以下解决方法： - **显式的 Bean 依赖定义**：确保您在关键执行点依赖的 Bean 被正确地和明确地定义了依赖，这样可以在 Bean 初始化时就考虑到它们。 - **测试配置调整**：调整您的\`@SpringBootTest\`配置，确保需要的 Beans 被正确加载和配置。有时，指定不同的\`@ContextConfiguration\`或使用模拟（Mock）对象代替一些真实的 Beans 可以避免问题。 - **使用\`@DependsOn\`注解**：在某些场景中，使用\`@DependsOn\`注解可以强制 Spring 按照指定的顺序来初始化 Beans。 最后，请确保您的测试环境尽可能地接近您的生产环境配置。这有助于减少环境差异导致的问题。"},{"instruction":"您提供的解决方案不显示，我只需要确保CommandLineRunner永远在ApplicationListener <ContextRefreshedEvent>之后执行","output":"如果您的目标是确保\`CommandLineRunner\`在\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`之后执行，您可以采用一些策略调整它们的执行顺序。因为\`ContextRefreshedEvent\`是在上下文（包括所有Bean）准备好后发布的，而\`CommandLineRunner\`同样是在Spring Boot完全启动后执行。他们的执行顺序并不是固定的，特别是在集成测试时可能会有所不同。这里有几种方法可以尝试： # 方法1: 使用\`@Order\`或实现\`Ordered\`接口 Spring框架允许使用\`@Order\`注解或是直接实现\`Ordered\`接口来设定Beans的加载顺序。虽然这两者通常用来控制Bean的加载顺序，但它们也可以间接影响\`ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>\`与\`CommandLineRunner\`的执行顺序，因为Bean的加载和初始化顺序会影响这些组件的执行。 \`\`\`java import org.springframework.core.Ordered;

} @Override public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) { this.applicationContext = applicationContext; } @Override public FXMLLoader getObject() throws Exception { FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader(fxmlLocation.getURL());

// 根据您加载FXML是否需要独立实例来决定 } } \`\`\` # 注册工厂Bean 然后，您可以在您的\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`实现中使用这个工厂bean来注册您的\`FXMLLoader\`实例： \`\`\`java import org.springframework.beans.factory.support.BeanDefinitionBuilder;

builder.addPropertyValue(\\"fxmlLocation\\", resource); registry.registerBeanDefinition(resource.getFilename(), builder.getBeanDefinition()); } } \`\`\` 这种方法解决了\`ApplicationContextAware\`在\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`阶段之后被调用的顺序问题，因为它把\`FXMLLoader\`实例的创建延后到工厂bean实际需要被创建的时刻，而此时\`ApplicationContext\`已经是可用的了。这样，您就可以在工厂bean中安全地使用\`ApplicationContext\`了。"},{"instruction":"我的配置用的这种方式定义的： @Data @Configuration public class JFXConfig { @Value(\\"{spring.fx.fxml-scan:/**/*.fxml}\\") private String fxmlScan;

\`\`\` # 2. 延迟\`JFXConfig\`的使用： 如果直接通过\`Environment\`不符合您的情况，而您需要在\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`中使用\`JFXConfig\`，一种方法是在确保\`JFXConfig\`已经初始化后再使用它。但这在\`postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry\`的上下文中可能不直接可行。 # 3. 修改配置获取方式： 考虑改用一个更符合\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`阶段的策略。例如，如果您需要在该阶段动态注册基于Fxml的beans，可以将Fxml路径配置作为固定的或通过环境变量设置的值，然后在\`postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry\`中直接使用这些值。 # 总结： 确保您从\`Environment\`或任何Spring管理的组件中读取配置时配置键是正确的，并且配置源（如\`application.properties\`或\`application.yml\`）已经加载。如果在\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`中直接使用注入的配置类（如\`JFXConfig\`）带来问题，考虑调整策略以配合Spring的生命周期。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.

The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I'd list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV's case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world's first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these \\"peaceful\\" Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don't laugh: it's cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don't count","output":"Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV's Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That's right! Shaman King's inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I'm curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It's such an underrated gem. But let's talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it's like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It's interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment's approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they're considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don't forget those shorts! Even though they're not considered part of the \\"main\\" lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It's always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I'm eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more \\"normal toons\\" to CW4Kids or if they'll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it's like they're trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what's next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they're aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We're thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support!

And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV!

But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It's always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let's hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It's the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV.

It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together.

With the big shuffle in CW4Kids' lineup and some classics making an exit, I'm curious about where fans of “Viva Pinata” and “GoGoRiki” are heading next. Both shows had that unique blend of humor, heart, and wild antics. Any guesses or hopes for what they might introduce to fill the void? ToonSleuth: Good question! Both “Viva Pinata” and “GoGoRiki” brought a lot of color and creativity to the table. I'm hoping CW4Kids leans into something equally vibrant. Maybe a show with strong world-building and quirky characters? Something that captures that same magic. AnimationAficionado: Definitely feeling the gap they’re leaving behind. Considering CW4Kids’ recent direction, I wouldn’t be surprised if they introduced another show with a rich, immersive world. Perhaps something with an environmental twist? Both “Viva Pinata” and “GoGoRiki” subtly encouraged appreciation for nature in their own ways. RetroToonFan: I've always appreciated how “Viva Pinata” managed to be both entertaining and somewhat educational without it feeling forced. “GoGoRiki” had this clever way of presenting life lessons amidst the humor. It'd be great to see a new series that can blend those elements—entertainment with a sprinkle of learning. CartoonConnoisseur: While it's sad to see them go, change does bring opportunity for something fresh. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for something with a similar charm but maybe with a bit more adventure? CW4Kids has been broadening their scope, so there's definitely potential for something exciting and new. DigitalDoodler: “GoGoRiki” in particular had such unique animation and style. I'm hoping for something that stands out visually and storytelling-wise. Maybe a show that leans into the fantastical or even tech-based, considering the recent trend toward more digitally-influenced series. NatureToon: For fans of “Viva Pinata”, a new show focusing on environmental themes but with a fantastical twist could be really appealing. Something that captures the imagination and plays into the gardening/building aspect, but within a cartoon setting. ToonMasterJay: There was something so soothing about “Viva Pinata'' but also hilariously chaotic with “GoGoRiki”. Maybe CW4Kids is planning to blend those vibes into a new creation. Can't wait to see what they come up with. Remember, every ending is just a new beginning in the world of cartoons! Admin_CW4KidsRevamp: We're always listening to our fans and taking note of what you love about our shows. While saying goodbye is never easy, we’re excited about the future and bringing new adventures to your screens. Stay tuned for announcements—you won’t be disappointed.

Besides “World of Quest”, they’re also nudging us towards “Pokémon Horizons: The Series”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, and “Code Lyoko”. Seems like a solid mix of fantasy, adventure, and tech vibes. Smart move by CW4Kids to guide the audience to new favorites. PixelPioneer: Love the initiative! “World of Quest” definitely fills the quirky adventure slot. I’m curious about how fans of the more laid-back “Viva Pinata” feel about diving into something as action-packed as “Pokémon Horizons: The Series” though. Could be an interesting shift! RetroToonFan: I think it’s a great way to keep the community engaged and exploring new series. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has that creative charm and humor that “GoGoRiki” fans might appreciate. And “Code Lyoko” offers a deeper narrative for those looking for more complex storytelling. AnimationAficionado: It’s a well-rounded selection. “World of Quest” brings that adventurous spirit, while “Code Lyoko” delivers on the intrigue and tech angle. And with “Pokémon Horizons” and “Gloopy and Glitter”, there’s no shortage of fantastical worlds and creatures. Seems like they’ve covered all bases for fans seeking new realms.

He's able to outsmart the crooks that try to sell him a 'miracle' joint cure :)","output":"Title: \\"The Wisdom of Age\\" Opening Scene: The show kicks off with Fletcher, now an older gentleman in his seventies, enjoying a peaceful retirement. Our beloved character, once known for his quick wit and street smarts during his days at HMP Slade, is now navigating the challenges of being an OAP (Old Age Pensioner). Despite his age, Fletcher hasn't lost his charm or his cunning nature. Plot Summary: Fletcher's peaceful retirement takes a turn when he becomes the target of a group of smooth-talking con artists. These crooks, recognizing Fletcher as an elderly man potentially desperate for a cure to his aching joints, decide to pitch him a \\"miracle\\" joint cure. The product, they claim, is the result of years of research and promises immediate relief with no side effects. Fletcher, initially intrigued, agrees to meet with the crooks for a demonstration. However, it doesn't take long for his old instincts to kick in. He starts to notice inconsistencies in their story and product details that don't add up. Instead of confronting them immediately, Fletcher decides to play along, pretending to be fully convinced and eager to buy their product. He invites them to his home, promising them that he'll convince his network of fellow OAP friends to invest in their miracle cure, hinting at a lucrative opportunity for the crooks. Eager for a big payday, they agree, not realizing they've just walked into a carefully laid trap by Fletcher. With the help of some old friends from his HMP Slade days, who are now also enjoying a quieter life, Fletcher sets up a sting operation. As the crooks arrive at his place, ready to scam not just Fletcher but his unsuspecting friends, they're met instead with a surprise. Fletcher reveals his awareness of their scam, having gathered enough evidence to expose them, including their lack of any real product and previous attempts to scam others. The episode climaxes with a humorous yet poignant confrontation, where Fletcher, using his legendary wit, manages to not only save himself and his friends from being scammed but also teaches the crooks a lesson. He enlightens them on the value of honesty and the detriments of preying on the vulnerable, especially the elderly. In the final scene, Fletcher is seen sharing a laugh with his friends over a cup of tea, reminiscing about the old days while celebrating their victory. He reminds them and the viewers that no matter the age, a sharp mind and a bit of skepticism can go a long way in outsmarting those who wish to do harm. Closing Thoughts: The episode, while humorous and light-hearted in its approach, touches upon important issues such as the vulnerability of the elderly to scams and the importance of staying vigilant. Fletcher, with his old wits about him, serves as a beacon of wisdom, showing that age is just a number and that experience can sometimes be the best defense against deceit. This hypothetical episode of \\"Going Straight\\" would be a testament to the enduring appeal of Fletcher's character, proving that no matter his age, he remains a beloved figure capable of outsmarting the crooks of the world with his wit and street smarts."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Episode of the Young Ones - 40 Years on - Done in the style of the 7/14/21 up etc films.. This episode follows up on the charcters from \\"The Young Ones\\" (such as Rick, Vivan and others.) in 2023, ...","output":"Title: \\"The Not-So-Young Ones: A Reunion in Disarray\\" Opening Scene: The camera pans over modern London, bustling and vibrant, a stark contrast to the chaotic, cluttered house of the 1980s where we first met the anarchic ensemble of \\"The Young Ones\\". A text overlay reveals it's 2023, and an invitation with a retro design flies through various scenes, finally landing in the hands of our once young rebels, now facing the tempests of middle age. Plot Summary: The premise kicks off with the much-anticipated, albeit apprehensive reunion of Rick, Vyvyan, Neil, and Mike, set against the backdrop of a world far removed from the one they wreaked havoc upon in their youth. Inspired by the \\"7 Up\\" series style, we catch glimpses into their lives every seven years, leading up to the present day, where they've swapped anarchist manifestos and wild parties for midlife crises and suburban ennui. Rick, once the self-proclaimed \\"People's Poet,\\" has ironically found himself in a career of middle management. Though he outwardly projects success, inside, he wrestles with the empty promises of his youthful ideologies. Vyvyan, the punk rocker and walking disaster, has inexplicably become a successful inventor of extreme sports equipment, channeling his penchant for destruction into a lucrative business. Neil, the perpetual downtrodden hippie, stumbled into an eco-conscious startup, becoming an unwitting influencer in the vegan lifestyle movement. Lastly, Mike, the smooth operator and ladies' man, struggles to adapt his schemes to the digital age, having dabbled in various internet ventures with varying degrees of legality and success. The reunion, suggested by Neil in a moment of nostalgia, takes place in a rental house that eerily mirrors their old abode's chaos. The initial joy of reconnection quickly devolves as old dynamics resurface. The documentary-style narrative allows for introspective monologues, juxtaposing their current realities with their past ambitions and dreams. As they spend a weekend together, forced to confront their differences and the paths they've taken, the series utilizes flashbacks and \\"what could have been\\" scenarios, blending the show's signature surreal humor with poignant moments of reflection. The highlight comes during an attempt to relive their youth with a riotous party that instead reveals their middle-aged limitations, leading to a series of slapstick mishaps and existential crises. Throughout the episode, surreal and anarchic elements reminiscent of the original series keep the atmosphere unpredictable and wildly entertaining. From a sudden musical performance that parodies modern pop culture to an encounter with a talking pet reminiscent of their past bizarre adventures, \\"The Not-So-Young Ones\\" embraces its heritage while reflecting on the passage of time. In the concluding act, amidst the chaos of their failed party, the characters find solace in their enduring, if complicated, friendship. They come to realize that while life might not have turned out as they expected, they still carry a piece of their youthful rebellion within them. The episode closes with them sitting together, watching the sunrise, reflecting on the notion that you're only as old as you feel. Closing Thoughts: \\"The Not-So-Young Ones: A Reunion in Disarray\\" serves as a nostalgic, humorous, and often touching ode to aging, change, and the enduring spirit of youth, even in the face of time's relentless march. Through its clever blend of documentary-style storytelling and the anarchic humor that defined the original, the episode captures the essence of what it means to grow up, but not necessarily grow old."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Episode of : Gordon Brittass - A Carrer in Sports Management - It's presented as a badly made VHS corporate film about Gordon Britass, from his time as a lesuire centre manager, and his rise to be a a Sports comissioner for the EU, until Brexit cut short his future...","output":"Title: \\"The Unstoppable Rise and Sudden Fall of Gordon Brittas: A Sporting Legacy\\" Opening Scene: A grainy VHS tape begins to play, introducing the audience to the unmistakable pomp and circumstance of a promotional corporate film from the late '90s. The title sequence is accompanied by overly dramatic music and a montage of sports facilities, each clip more grandiose than the last, culminating in a freeze-frame of Gordon Brittas, beaming in front of the Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. Narrator: In a tone that's a mix of awe and forced enthusiasm typical of the era, the narrator introduces Gordon Brittas as a visionary leader, whose innovative management style and unparalleled commitment to public leisure services have left an indelible mark on the world of sports and recreation. Segment One: \\"The Whitbury Years\\" We're taken on a whirlwind tour of Brittas's tenure as the manager of the Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. The segment is full of comically low-quality reenactments, featuring stand-ins for beloved characters such as Laura, Tim, and Julie engaging in zany, Brittas-inspired antics, from disastrous motivational talks to improbable health and safety disasters. Clips of Brittas's most memorable (and catastrophic) initiatives are interspersed with \\"testimonials\\" from staff and patrons (actors hamming up their roles), praising Brittas's leadership with backhanded compliments. Segment Two: \\"To Europe and Beyond\\" Brittas's ascension to a high-ranking position as a Sports Commissioner for the European Union is chronicled through a series of staged \\"news\\" reports and interviews. The segment shows Brittas unveiling ambitious projects, like an attempt to standardize the size of swimming pools across Europe, and introducing universal swimming badges that somehow cause international tensions. His boundless confidence and tendency to disregard expert advice lead to a series of humorous and cringe-worthy diplomatic faux pas. Segment Three: \\"Brexit and the Brittas Legacy\\" The tone shifts as the segment delves into Brittas’s obliviousness to the political undercurrents of Brexit. It becomes clear that his career is in jeopardy as EU officials grow weary of his eccentricities. Through dramatized sequences, we witness Brittas confidently proposing increasingly outlandish sports initiatives intended to “unite” Europe, oblivious to the crumbling political foundation beneath his feet. The segment culminates in a melodramatic reenactment of Brittas's last stand: an impassioned, yet wildly misguided speech about the power of synchronized swimming to heal political divides, delivered just as news of his dismissal breaks. Ending Credits: As the screen fades to the rolling credits, overlaid with a soft-focus image of Gordon Brittas saluting the European flag, the narrator summarizes Brittas's impact on the sports management and leisure sectors with an overtly saccharine tribute. Despite his fall from grace, we're assured that Brittas's legacy will live on, not just in the EU, but wherever there's a need for \\"unconventional\\" leadership in sports. Closing Scene: The tape ejects from a VCR, and for a moment, we see a present-day Brittas, wearing a slightly outdated suit, picking up the tape and looking directly at the camera. With a wink, he quips about his next venture: bringing his unique management style to space tourism. Fade to black on Brittas's trademark clueless optimism, leaving the viewer to imagine the cosmic scale of his next series of blunders. This episode serves as a satirical homage to the enduring character of Gordon Brittas, blending nostalgia with a critique of his well-intentioned yet disastrously executed management style, highlighting the thin line between ambition and delusion in the pursuit of sporting excellence."},{"instruction":"The closing scene, would work better given the space tourism angle, if he drops in a line about banning curry in space for health reasons ( a nod to another role of the actor concerned..) ...","output":"Closing Scene Reimagined: As the tape fully ejects from a vintage VCR, we transition from the grainy footage to the contemporary sharpness of a real-world setting. We find Gordon Brittas, having barely aged, in a nostalgically outdated but pristine suit. He delicately places the VHS tape onto a shelf, already brimming with similarly themed tapes, each chronicling another of his grand, though often misguided, ventures. Brittas turns towards the camera, a glint of indefatigable optimism in his eyes, reminiscent of his days at Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He begins to speak with his characteristic mix of confidence and obliviousness, \\"And now, onto the final frontier, space. Where, I assure you, for health and safety reasons, we shall strictly prohibit the consumption of curry.\\" The camera lingers on Brittas's self-satisfied nod at his own remark—a subtle yet humorous nod to actor Chris Barrie's renowned role as Rimmer in \\"Red Dwarf,\\" where curries are a recurring theme and source of amusement. This clever crossover not only serves to delight fans familiar with Barrie's body of work but also reinforces Brittas's well-meaning, though often comically misguided approach to management, extending it to the boundless and untested realms of space tourism. As Brittas's smile widens with the prospect of applying his unique brand of leadership beyond Earth, the scene fades to black, encapsulating the indomitable spirit of Gordon Brittas. Through his untiring, albeit eccentric, dedication to improving whatever domain he finds himself in—be it leisure centres, the European Union, or the vast expanse of space—Brittas remains a timeless example of ambition, perseverance, and the quintessentially British brand of comedy."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical TV sitcom episode : - The post Maplins Carrer's of the Yellow Coats are detailed.. Ted Bovis is in rehab though... his jokes weren't funny by the 1970's...","output":"Title: \\"After the Laughter: The Yellow Coats' New Ventures\\" Opening Scene: The iconic \\"Hi-de-Hi!\\" catchphrase echoes one last time over the scenes of an empty Maplins holiday camp, the laughter and chaos of the past giving way to quiet nostalgia. The camera pans over memorabilia in a dimly lit room—a whistle, a yellow blazer, and photos of the staff in their prime. The somber tone is quickly broken by the unmistakable sound of a record scratching. Plot Summary: It's been years since the heyday of Maplins Holiday Camp, and the beloved Yellow Coats find themselves navigating the complexities of life beyond the camp’s fences. Each character, from chalet maid to entertainment manager, embarks on journeys that reflect their aspirations, quirks, and inevitable growth after the curtains closed on their Maplins careers. Ted Bovis, once the heart and arguably the trouble of the entertainments team, finds himself in an unexpected place: rehab. Known for his quick wit and knack for pushing the boundaries of 1970’s humor, Ted’s realization that his jokes no longer resonate with audiences propels him on a journey of self-discovery and reinvention. Ted’s storyline offers a mix of heartfelt moments and humor, spotlighting the challenges of adapting to a world that has moved beyond slapstick and one-liners. Ted's reevaluation of his career and comedic style runs parallel to the stories of his former colleagues, each pursuing new paths: - Peggy, the ever-optimistic chalet maid with dreams of becoming a Yellow Coat, has finally realized her dream in the most unexpected way. She's launched a successful online platform for aspiring entertainers, blending her unflagging enthusiasm with practical advice gleaned from years of observing the entertainment crew. Peggy's segments are a whirlwind of comedic tutorials and heartfelt pep talks, showcasing her journey from underdog to unexpected entrepreneur. - Gladys Pugh, the fiercely disciplined chief Yellow Coat, finds herself at a crossroads between her desire for order and her love for entertainment. Her story unfolds as she becomes a community theater director, where her authoritarian style both clashes and comically merges with the free-spirited nature of amateur actors. Her segments highlight the hilarity that ensues when different worlds collide, underscored by her unwavering passion for the arts. - Jeffrey Fairbrother, the well-meaning but often out-of-depth entertainment manager, has returned to academia but discovers his true calling lies in motivational speaking. Using lessons learned from managing the chaotic entertainments team, Jeffrey’s segments deal with his attempts to inspire others, often with humorous detours as he applies Maplins' logic to real-world problems. Midway through the episode, the characters cross paths at a charity event organized by Peggy to support entertainers in transition. The reunion is bittersweet, filled with laughter, reflective conversations about the past, and discussions about the future. Ted, fresh out of rehab and armed with a new sense of comedic timing that resonates with the modern audience, performs a stand-up routine that cleverly addresses and satirizes his journey. Closing Scene: The charity event ends with the group gathered on stage, leading the audience in a rousing, albeit slightly off-key, rendition of the Maplins anthem. The camera pulls back to show the former Yellow Coats surrounded by fans old and new, illustrating that while their paths have diverged, the spirit of Maplins and their bond remains unbroken. The episode balances nostalgia with the characters' evolution, showing how the end of one era can be the beginning of something new and equally meaningful. By blending humor with moments of introspection, \\"After the Laughter: The Yellow Coats' New Ventures\\" offers a touching yet funny homage to the enduring impact of Maplins on its staff and the importance of adapting with grace and humor."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical TV sitcom episode : Patsy and Edina a life in fashion and PR . There is also a staged 'un-civil' ceremony, that's a staged PR event where Patsy and Edina don't get hitched. :)","output":"Title: \\"Absolutely Fabulous: Fashionably Unwed\\" Opening Scene: The always-glamorous duo, Patsy Stone and Edina Monsoon, are seen bustling through the chaotic streets of London's fashion district. Amidst a whirlwind of shopping bags and the latest trends, they're plotting their grandest, most headline-grabbing scheme yet: a faux \\"un-civil\\" ceremony to promote Eddy's latest PR venture, a daring new fashion line that cleverly blurs the line between haute couture and streetwear. Plot Summary: The episode kicks off with Edina in a frenzy, her PR company barely clinging to relevance in the fast-paced world of fashion publicity. Eddy, in a stroke of intoxicated genius, concocts a plan to announce the most avant-garde event the London fashion scene has ever seen—her own \\"un-civil\\" ceremony to her lifelong partner in crime, Patsy. This staged event is designed not just to shock and awe but to serve as the launch party for a revolutionary fashion line that challenges every convention. Patsy, ever the willing accomplice, dives headfirst into the scheme, seeing it as the perfect opportunity to cement her status as a fashion icon. The preparations for the event are nothing short of chaotic, with theme ideas that range from punk rock meets royal wedding to an outrageous space-age love affair. Along the way, the pair enlist the help of their usual entourage: Saffy, Edina's perpetually disapproving daughter, finds herself tasked with keeping the event from devolving into total anarchy; Mother is inadvertently roped into a viral marketing campaign; and Bubble, Edina's eccentric assistant, somehow ends up being mistaken for a cutting-edge designer by the fashion elite, adding to the confusion and chaos. However, as the big day approaches, the reality of their extravagant stunt begins to dawn on Eddy and Patsy. Amid the frenzy of final preparations and a guest list that reads like a who's who of the fashion world and tabloid darlings, the pair start to have second thoughts. Their friendship is tested as they confront the possibility that their outrageous plan might actually lead to some unwelcome changes in their relationship. In true Patsy and Edina fashion, a series of comedic mishaps and revelations leads up to the event, including a lost venue, a wardrobe malfunction of epic proportions, and a misplaced guest of honor—none other than a confused but somehow game fashion icon mistaking the event for a genuine ceremony. The climax of the episode is the \\"un-civil\\" ceremony itself, held in an absurdly decorated space that seamlessly combines trash chic with luxe opulence. Just as the pair are about to go through with their plan, they break into laughter, unable to maintain the facade. Amid the confusion, Edina grabs the microphone and delivers an impromptu speech about the enduring power of friendship, fashion, and the importance of not taking oneself too seriously. The event, though it doesn't go as planned, becomes legendary, catapulting Edina's PR firm and Patsy's status as a fashion icon to new heights. Closing Scene: The episode closes with Patsy and Edina, arm in arm, watching the sunrise over London from the rooftop of a trendy after-party venue. Surrounded by remnants of their outrageous celebration, they share a heartfelt moment of reflection. In a world obsessed with labels and definitions, they rejoice in their undefinable, chaotic, and absolutely fabulous bond. Tagline/Catchphrase: \\"Darling, who needs vows when you've got style?\\" This episode of \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\" captures the essence of Patsy and Edina's wild, unconventional adventures, while offering a satirical look at the fashion industry, PR stunts, and the concept of marriage—all wrapped in the show's signature blend of humor, satire, and heartfelt moments between its unforgettable characters."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical TV Drama episode - Sherlock Holmes - The Espionage Years..

The camera pans over the iconic landmarks, now draped with the somber signs of war. Amid this eerie silence, the scene shifts to 221B Baker Street, where an aging Sherlock Holmes, his features sharper and his eyes more penetrating with age, meticulously studies a coded message sprawled across numerous telegrams. Plot Summary: It's the year 1915, and Sherlock Holmes has reluctantly found himself drawn into the dark world of espionage. His retirement is interrupted by a visit from Mycroft Holmes, his brother and a key figure in the British government, who presents Sherlock with a case of national importance. A network of spies, known under the codename \\"The Shadow League,\\" has infiltrated the highest echelons of British Intelligence. Mycroft, knowing only Sherlock possesses the keen intellect necessary to unravel this web of deceit, implores him for assistance. Reluctant yet compelled by the challenge and the duty to his country, Sherlock embarks on a journey that spans the troubled years between 1914 and 1948. The episode is structured around a series of flashbacks, interwoven with scenes of a contemporary historian in the late 20th century uncovering Sherlock’s classified case files. With Dr. John Watson by his side, now a decorated veteran with deeper scars than those left by any battlefield, Sherlock navigates the treacherous waters of wartime London. Their investigation leads them from the dimly lit back alleys of the East End to the opulent halls of the War Office, encountering a complex cast of characters including double agents, disillusioned soldiers, and even a femme fatale who poses a particular challenge to Holmes. As Holmes and Watson delve deeper into the mystery, they uncover a sinister plot that could change the course of the war. The duo's detective skills are put to the ultimate test, involving cryptography, the early art of signals intelligence, and Holmes's mastery of disguise and deductive reasoning. In a gripping climax, Sherlock orchestrates a daring sting operation to capture the mastermind of The Shadow League during a clandestine meeting in an abandoned warehouse. The operation is fraught with danger, testing not just Sherlock's intellect but the bravery and loyalty of his closest allies. Closing Scene: As peace finally returns to London's streets, a reflective Holmes stands atop the Tower Bridge at dawn. He's joined by Watson, and together they watch the sun rise over the city they've protected in shadow. Sherlock muses on the changing nature of crime and justice in the new world order, contemplating his legacy and the secret battles fought in the name of peace. As the screen fades to black, a voice-over from the historian reveals that it would be nearly 70 years before Sherlock Holmes's critical role in shaping the outcome of both World Wars would be revealed, cementing his legacy not only as the world's greatest detective but also one of its most unsung heroes. Tag: \\"In the shadows of war, the brightest minds illuminate the truth.\\" \\"Sherlock Holmes: Shadows of War\\" melds the classic detective narrative with the intrigue of spy fiction, exploring a lesser-known chapter in Holmes's illustrious career.

Today, they're excited to guide viewers through crafting their very own Clangers moonscape — a tribute to the enchanting world of the beloved early '70s stop-motion animation series. Materials Needed: - A large, shallow cardboard box (this will be the base of your moonscape) - Old newspapers - PVA glue (white school glue) - Water - Paint (black, grey, white, and any other colors you'd like for your moonscape) - Paintbrushes - Small rocks and pebbles - Aluminum foil - Plasticine or modeling clay (for making your very own Clangers and props) - Scissors - A mixing bowl for the papier-mâché paste Step 1: Prepare the Papier-Mâché Base The presenter explains that the first step to creating our moonscape is to form the base using papier-mâché. They show how to tear old newspapers into strips and mix PVA glue with water in a bowl to create the paste. Once mixed, they dip the newspaper strips into the glue mixture then layer them over the cardboard box, molding small hills and craters to form the terrain. This would be left to dry overnight. Step 2: Painting the Moonscape Once the papier-mâché has dried thoroughly, it's time to paint. The presenter demonstrates how to mix black and grey paint to get a moon-like color and advises starting with a darker base, adding lighter shades for highlights and to define the moonscape's features. White and yellow paints can be dabbed gently with a sponge to create a starry background around the edges of the box. Step 3: Adding Texture and Features The presenter selects small rocks and pebbles, placing them around the moonscape to add realism. They emphasize the importance of letting creativity guide the process — suggesting the use of aluminum foil to create futuristic structures or spacecraft, gently molding them into shape and placing them within the scene. Step 4: Crafting the Clangers Using plasticine or modeling clay, the presenter offers a simple tutorial on crafting small Clanger figures. They show how to roll the clay into shapes for the body, head, and snout, demonstrating how tiny details make each Clanger character come to life.

Let's embark on a nostalgic journey back to a hypothetical mid-1980s episode of Blue Peter where they showed us how to create Halloween skulls using paper mâché. While this exact make might not have aired in the 1980s, it captures the spirit of the era and the innovative DIY ethos of the show. **Materials Needed:** - Balloons - Newspaper - White flour and water (for the paper mâché paste) - A paintbrush or two - White and black paint - Varnish (optional, to make it weather-resistant if kept outside) - Craft knife (to be used by an adult) **Instructions:** 1. **Prepare Your Work Area:** Begin by covering your work surface with old newspapers to keep it clean. Paper mâché can get messy! 2. **Make the Paper Mâché Paste:** Mix one part water with one part flour to create a smooth paste. If it's too thick, you can add a little more water. 3. **Prepare Your Paper:** Tear the newspaper into strips. The strips can be about an inch wide and several inches long. You'll need enough to cover your balloon multiple times. 4. **Blow Up a Balloon:** Inflate a balloon to the desired size of your skull. This will serve as your mold. 5. **Apply Your Paper Mâché:** Dip the newspaper strips into the flour-water paste, removing excess paste by running the strip between your fingers. Then, apply the strips to the balloon, smoothing each one down to avoid air bubbles. Cover the balloon with three to four layers of paper mâché. Leave a small opening around the tied end of the balloon – this will allow you to remove the balloon later and also create an opening in the base of the skull. 6. **Let It Dry:** Once you’ve covered the balloon in several layers of newspaper, leave it to dry thoroughly. This could take up to 24 hours, depending on the humidity and temperature. 7. **Adding Skull Features:** Once your base is dry, you can add more layers to define skull features, such as cheekbones and the brow ridge, by molding pieces of paper mâché and attaching them with your paste. 8. **Pop the Balloon and Paint:** When the skull is completely dry, and the features are added, pop the balloon and remove it through the base. Use white paint as the base coat for your skull. Once that’s dry, you can add details with black paint, like the eyes, nose cavity, and teeth. 9. **Varnish (Optional):** If you plan to display your skull outside, you may want to apply a coat of varnish to protect it from moisture. 10. **Display Your Creation:** Once everything is dry, your Halloween skull is ready to display! This nostalgic make would have tied in perfectly with the Blue Peter aesthetic, promoting creativity, recycling, and hands-on fun. Viewers would have been encouraged to send in pictures of their own skulls, perhaps even featuring them in the show's iconic \\"Gallery\\" segment."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the 3 January 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute Imperial Royal parliamentary monarchy but de jure feudal royal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu's more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan |the sei-i taishōgun| during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 in Japanese history who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun's more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the collection of various powers that supported the bakufu and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun/sei-i taishōgun and nominally to the Japanese emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], [the Tokugawa bakufu] ruling [the Tokugawa bakufu] over Japan and Okinawa, [the Meiji Restoration in the Tokugawa bakufu] that [the Meiji Restoration] allowed the Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty to [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] reclaim its [the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] executive power over the Japanese government and [the Meiji Restoration] dissolved the Tokugawa shogunate and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the formation of the post-1868, pre-1947 the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled unitary Imperial parliamentary democratic Royal monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Third Japanese Empire/Great Japan/Imperial Japan/Empire of Japan ruling [the Great Japanese Empire] over [the Great Japanese Empire's territories] the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Russia's Sahalkin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands, Okinawa/Ryūkū, the Caroline's, the Marinas and Palau from [the Great Japanese Empire's homebase and stronghold] the Japanese Home Islands and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the rise of Japan as a political, military, economic and industrial superpower, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] does not lead to the displacement of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns and the samurai class due to the Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato regaining its power due to the Meiji Restoration as in OTL, but [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] is [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [what the Meiji Restoration is in this timeline] a compromise between the conservative feudal elites that support the Tokugawa clan and the bakufu system and the liberal democrats who support the imperial family in Tokugawa bakufu-ruled feudal Japan, with the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan maintaining their [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan's] positions as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan but [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] effectively only controlling Japanese local government in this timeline and [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] also leading the Japanese military into battle, with the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty in their [ the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] role as Japanese Emperors/Empresses being Japanese head of state and also the head of the Japanese armed forces. The buke/samurai and the daimyō are [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] not abolished [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] like in OTL but rather [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] into the Great Japanese Empire's post-1868, post-1947 hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [Magnificent/Exalted lineage |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The industrial, economic and military development that made Japan into a great power after the Meiji Restoration in OTL continues unhindered and the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, is [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] still [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] formed [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] in 3 January 1868 like in OTL, however the centuries-earlier victory of the Japanese in the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched [the Imjin Wars] by the hereditary military dictatorship of the Ashikaga bakufu de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in the entire Korean peninsula and the state it [Great Joeson] was [Great Joeson] a vassal [Great Joeson] to, the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" ruling over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, Yunnan and Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|] unlike in OTL and the subsequent annexation of post-Imjin Wars Korea into Ashikaga bakufu-ruled feudal Japan as the Japanese province of Chōsen with with Hideyoshi taking the last King of Joeson before the Imjin Wars in this timeline, Seonjo's daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong as his [Hideyoshi's] latest concubine after the Imjin Wars in this timeline and compliant members of Korea's indigenous slave-owning, sex-slave owning, China loving, resistant to change, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility, the yangaban, [compliant members of the yangaban] along with compliant members of the Korean royal family [the House of Jeonju Yi] being [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] married off [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] into Japanese royalty, aristocracy and nobility after the Japanese victory in the Imjin Wars and the subsequent dissolution of Joeson and the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan as Chōsen in this timeline with buke/samurai and daimyō from the Japanese Home Islands slowly replacing the yangaban and the now-dissolved Joeson's ground force in this timeline, the now-dissolved Joeson Army as the main aristocratic and military presence within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea with anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi after its [post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea's in this timeline] annexation into Japan as Chōsen being [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi] hunted down and [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] either killed, reeducated or [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan] deported [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] to the Ming dynasty by the Japanese, who [the Japanese] then [the Japanese in this timeline] after [the Japanese in this timeline] liberating the mostly illiterate, uneducated, impoverished and starving Korean people from the yangaban and the useless Korean royals [the House of Jeonju Yi] due to [the Japanese in this timeline] winning the Imjin Wars in this timeline, [the Japanese in this timeline] undertake a comprehensive education, primitive industrial and religious reform system in the post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korean peninsula, with schools being opened up for the common Korean people to get an education for themselves and their children and land reform in Korea being initiated by Hideyoshi by having seized yangban and House of Jeonju Yi estates go to ethnic Korean peasant farmers and ex-slaves within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea in this timeline. The native Korean script for writing the Korean language, Hangul is [Hangul in this timeline] discovered [Hangul in this timeline] by the Japanese after the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan and [Hangul in this timeline] subsequent spread and promoted as the way [Hangul in this timeline] to [Hangul in this timeline] write Korean by the Japanese in the timeline, who [the Japanese in this timeline] also promote the spread of the Japanese language and the heavily modified traditional Chinese characters used to write the Japanese language, Kanji, over the traditional Chinese characters used to write Korean utilized by the yangban and the House of Jeonju Yi, Hangul. The Japanese in this timeline also [the Japanese in this timeline] promote the Japanese indigenous national religion and state religion of Shinto, Zen Buddhism and even Christianity over traditional Korean shamanism, Taoism and Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea as well in this timeline, with the liberated Korean masses flocking to these new religions [ Shinto, Zen Buddhism and Christianity] in droves. The Japanese also [the Japanese in this timeline] begin a massive effort to [the Japanese in this timeline] absorb the Koreans into the Greater Japanese race and [the Japanese in this timeline] also integrate the Koreans into the Japanese political, social and economic systems, [the Japanese in this timeline] encouraging many Korean commoners in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea to take Japanese names and let their children think of themselves as Japanese, speaking, writing and thinking in Japanese. This is hugely successful and the Koreans are [the Koreans in this timeline] eventually assimilated [the Koreans in this timeline] into the Japanese nation as the centuries go by, mostly thinking, speaking and writing in Japanese by the time of the alternate Meiji Restoration in this timeline, although a now heavily Japanese, Manchu/Manchurian and Chinese influenced Korean language still exists as a \\"dialect\\" of Japanese in this timeline, with Korea and the Koreans having roughly the same status as Okinawa and the Okinawans in both OTL Japan and this version of Japan in this timeline Hideyoshi also [Hideyoshi] conquers Russia's Sakhalin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands in this timeline after Imjin Wars in this timeline, which [Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in this timeline] become the Japanese province of Karufuto By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Japanese Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Japanese Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still [the Jurchens in this timeline] emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Japanese conquering the Tungning Kingdom in this timeline] on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Japanese also [the Japanese] work to assimilate the Chinese refugees from the Ming that make up the Tungning Kingdom's population and the main indigenous people in Taiwan who also make up 70% of Taiwan's population, the Han Chinese, or rather subgroup who speak Hokkien, a Southern Min language and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo, [the Japanese working to assimilate the Hoklo] and the other indigenous tribes of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese population in this timeline using the same methods as used in Korea in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Returning to the alternate version of late 19th century to early 20th century Japan after the alternate version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces' ground warfare branch, the Imperial Japanese Army is [the Imperial Japanese Army] still [the Imperial Japanese Army] formed in February 1872 like in OTL but [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] is [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] significantly stronger than its [[the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline's] OTL counterpart due to the earlier conquest and subsequent integration of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Korea and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in Japan along with the discovery and exploitation of the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] by the Japanese The IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] is [the Kempeitai in this timeline] still [the Kempeitai in this timeline] formed on 4 January 1881 like in OTL The Cantonese Hakka-medical student turned Han nationalist, revolutionary, politician and statesman Dr. Sun Wen, [Wen] better known as Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is [Wen/Yat-Sen] assassinated [Wen/Yat-Sen] by a joint team of the UK's foreign intelligence M16 and the Russian Empire's combined secret police and foreign intelligence agency, the Okhrana when [Wen/Yat-Sen] studying in the Great Japanese Empire under the Japanese alias Kikori Nakayama [when Wen/Yat-Sen studied in the Japanese Empire under the name Nakayama] from 1899 to 1903. The mixture of steampunk and early diesel technology and sorcery known as Machinart [Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai], circuits [Machinart] made from spells that [the Machinart circuits] are [the Machinart circuits] put [the Machinart circuits] into objects [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] bring them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to life and simultaneously [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] give them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence, [the development of the Machinart circuits] continues [the development of the Machinart circuits] in the United Kingdom in the early 20th century. These Automatons [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] were [the Automatons] developed as a military weapon by the British government and spread throughout the world; the humans in charge of them [the Automations] became known as puppeteers. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution fought [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched and fought in the Xinhai Revolution] the anti Manchu Han nationalist and Cantonese nationalist revolutionary group adhering to republican, nationalist, and socialist objectives of the Tongmenghui which [the Tongmenghui] was [the Tongmenghui] founded by Wen/Yat Sen in 1905 in OTL which, [the Tongmenghui both in OTL and this timeline] later became the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society/revolutionary of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the Xinhai Revolution and the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] had [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people before and after the Xinhai Revolution, [the Kuomingtang, Tongmenghui and Yellow Sand Society launching the Xinhai Revolution] against the Manchu dominated, Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Manchuria, whose [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal was [the goal of the Xinhai Revolution both in OTL and in this timeline] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\" in other words [Overthrow Qing and restore Ming] restoring the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government [the Ming dynasty] of a post-Qing Han China, [the Xinhai Revolution fought to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming dynasty as the government of post-Qing Han China] still [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] happens despite Wen's/Yat Sen's earlier death due to the strength and influence of Han nationalism and Han monarchist groups in Qing-occupied Han China and the covert and open support Japan gives to the Tongmenghui both in OTL and in this timeline. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China all [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] break away [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] from Manchuria like Han China during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. The post-1912, pre-1928 and then post-1937, pre-1945 the stratocratic [military dominated] Beiyang Government-ruled presidental parliamentary democratic republic of the First Republic of China is [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] still [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] formed [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] as the government [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] of post-Qing, post-Xinhai Han China like in OTL while Manchuria still [Manchuria] comes [Manchuria] under the control of [which faction took over Manchuria] the Han Chinese bandit clique/military junta/Han Chinese government faction of the Fengtian Clique headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the Fengtian Clique's leader] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhang] known [Zhang] as [Zhang] \\"the Old Marshal\\", [Manchuria falling under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] despite the Qing Imperial Court continuing [the Qing Imperial court] still [the Qing Imperial court] existing in Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. When former top dog in the Great Qing Empire's modernized army corps envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang Government after the Xinhai Revolution and later the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China's first President, Yuan Shikai, [Shikai] still [Shikai] makes Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the unitary constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy of the Empire of China on 12 December 1915 like in OTL, everyone expects him [Shikai] to [Shikai] become Emperor [Shikai] of Han China. But unlike in OTL, he [Shikai] dies a day after [Shikai] forming the Empire of China in this timeline and so The Beiyang Government's armed wing and thus the first Republic of China's combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, [the Beiyang Army] built [the Beiyang Army] from both the Manchu and Han units of the now-dissolved New Army within Han China and the Beiyang Government's and thus the first Republic of China's and the Empire of China's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and House of Representatives, the National Assembly, [the Beiyang Army and the National Assembly] assume joint control over the Empire of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline, due to Yuan Shikai's eldest son, the half Korean Yuan Keding who [Keding] had [Keding] become Chinese Crown Prince under the combined era and regal name of Yuntai after Shikai formed the Empire of China, [Yuntai] refusing to become Emperor of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline. In order to stay afloat and not be toppled by the Chinese people like the Great Qing Empire, the Empire of China in this timeline decides to promote industrialization, development as well as the development of a National railway system in Han China along with [the Empire of China in this timeline] adopting a federalist, democratic system with the eighteen provinces of Han China proper being allowed autonomy, akin to the system of government in the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire and the USA. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China also sends many students to Japan for training, education and constitutional lessons, along with having the IJAF and the German Empire's unified ground and air force, the Imperial German Army both train and build up the Beiyang Army into a ultra-modern, developed, ready force. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline also reluctantly allows for the secession of Yunnan from Han China, which [Yunnan] subsequently restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government with support from the Japanese The joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China/Nationalist China based [Nationalist China] in [Nationalist China's] stronghold of [Nationalist China's stronghold and homebase] Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|], [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] still [Nationalist China] formed [Nationalist China] in this timeline due to the strong desire of the Cantonese people for independence from both Manchu and Han dominion and the large amount of Han nationalists and imperialists in the Cantonian population and [Nationalist China in this timeline] still [Nationalist China in this timeline] launches the Chinese Civil War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 known as the National Protection War against the Empire of China like in OTL, but [Nationalist China in this timeline] loses the National Protection War due to [why Nationalist China loses the National Protection War in this timeline] the massive corruption and incompetence in the Kuomingtang, the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army and the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan, along with the fact that most Cantonese don't want to be a part of China, whether Manchu or Han-dominated as well as Sun's/Yat-Sen's earlier death in this timeline denying Nationalist China the charismatic leadership it needs, An anti-Chinese unification, pro-Cantonese independence, pro-buisness, merchant-backed faction eventually grows strength in Nationalist China and launches a putsch that sees the take over of the Kuomingtang and the Legislative Yuan as the Beiyang Army decimates the NRA, leading to the leaders of the Kuomintang and the generals of the Beiyang Army agreeing to an armistice that sees the independence of Nationalist China and the abandonment of the territory of the Qing Empire by Nationalist China. British and French soldiers firing on Japanese soldiers helping the Beiyang Army against the NRA during the National Revolutionary War leads to the Japanese joining the Central Powers consisting of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [Japan joining the Central Powers in this timeline] in WW1 instead of the Central Powers' rivals consisting of the British Empire, the French supremacist, French imperialist, facist totalitarian dictatoral republic of the Third French Republic and the post-1861, pre-1947, French-Italian cadet branch of the German-Italian House of Savoy, the House of Savoy-Carignano ruled Unitary Constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy ruling over Italy, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritia and Somalialand, the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium ruling [the Russian Empire] over Siberia, the Baltics, the Caucuses, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Ukraine, Central Asia, Chechenya and Kalymkia from [the Russian Empire's homebase] European Russia, the Entente [Japan joining the Central Powers instead of the Entente like in OTL] with the IJAF destroying the Russian Asian fleet and [the IJAF] also providing support to liberation movements within the European colonies in Asia and Oceania, typing up European forces. The Japanese also seize control of the imperial Russian protectorate of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, Unitary Buddhist absolute monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State in Greater Mongolia and [the Japanese] use the Great Mongolian State to [the Japanese] assault Russian Siberia and Central Asia while the Imperial German Army assaults the Russian Empire from Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces, Austria-Hungary's combined land, sea and air combat forces [the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces] along with the combined armed forces of the Tsardom of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Imperial Armed Forces, clean up Russia's Serbian and Montenegrin puppets. The post-1842 army of the Ottoman Empire, after the country was reorganized along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period, the Modern Ottoman Army, eats out the flower of the Russian Empire's combined armed forces, divided into a standing army consisting of regular troops and two forces that served on separate regulations: the Cossack troops and the Muslim troops and a state militia, the Imperial Russian Army in the Caucuses and even along with the border with Iran. The Kempeitai also has former child refugee from the Confederate States during the American civil war turned failed professor and Confederate revisionist, Woodrow Wilson assassinated before he [Wilson] can [Wilson] become US President like in OTL and [Wilson in OTL] drag the USA into WW1. Without a charismatic figurehead [Wilson] to lead the movement to victory against the hated US Republicans, the American religious right, the civil rights movement and Germans in the USA, the American Democrat Party, more specifically its [the Democrat Party's] white nationalist, Anglophile, England worshipping, anti-Semitic, white supremacist, anti-German Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's armed wing, the KKK, [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] never launch the New Freedom Revolution of 1912 against the American government and the Republicans and [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] eventually fade from the political scene in the USA in this timeline, with some of them migrating to England or to British-controlled Canada. The Russian Empire is [the Russian Empire] forced [the Russian Empire] to [the Russian Empire] sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers. The terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk see the German Empire creating the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled absolute feudal royal monarchy of the United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the German Empire creating] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the German Empire] creating the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the restored German Empire creating] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal imperial absolute monarchy of the Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire] forming the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the German Empire] restoring the hereditary royal absolute tribal Buddhist monarchy of the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and [the restored German Empire restoring] the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire also restores the constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the side branch of the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. The Ottomans liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Khongirad-ruled absolute hereditary Islamic royal imperial monarchy of the Khanate of Khiva in western Uzbekistan, southwestern Kazakhstan and much of Turkmenistan and [the Ottomans] also liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Manghud-ruled absolute imperial royal monarchy of the Emirate of Bukhara in eastern Uzbekistan, western Tajikistan, parts of southern Kazakhstan, parts of Turkmenistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. The Great Japanese Empire establishes the Japanese protectorate of the constitutional presidential parliamentary republic of the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. After the defeat of the Russians in the war, the Germans and Austria-Hungarians are able to focus all their efforts on the Western front. The demise of the Democrat Party in the USA leads to the US government launching a crackdown on pro-British groups and organizations and so the Allies are unable to get any help from the Americans, so the Imperial German Army, with help from the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces, [the Imperial German Army and the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces] march into the French capital of Paris, with the British being forced to surrender when the Labor Party of England storms Parliament with the help of the British people and forces the British government to an armistice with the Central Powers. The shock of being defeated by an hated enemy is simply too much for the British to bear and so loyalist elements of the British army and public forcefully transport the British government and the current British royal family [the British branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha] to the British colonial dominion of British North America ruling over Canada, [the forced transport of the British government and royal family to Canada after the British defeat in WW1 in this timelien] leading to the formation of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Afghanistan and India] and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands in this timeline. At this timeline's Treaty of Versailles presiding over the division of the defeated Western Entente's territories, signed [this timeline's version of the Treaty of Versalies] in the Austrian City of Linz in this timeline, the Labor-dominated British government recognizes the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as legitimate and the Entente as the initiators of WW1 and [the British] accepting German control of the German House of Wettin-ruled federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Belgium, which [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] takes the French region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais to [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] form Greater Belgium. The Labor-dominated British government also recognizes the German annexation of Luxembourg and the loss of Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi to the Germans. The British also recognize the Albanian Muhammad Ali dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Egypt in Egypt's formal status as an Ottoman protectorate and also the independence of Sudan from the British and also the independence of all of Ireland as a unitary parliamentary royal monarchy under the rule of the Irish House of O'Neill Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1903 Austrian protectorate of the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] removes the imperial Russian puppet fake Serbian royal family, the Serbian House of Karađorđević from power in post-WW1 Serbia. Austria-Hungary also demands that Serbia take full responsibility for starting WW1 by [Serbia] murdering Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Serbian nationalist terror organization that started WW1 by murdering the last pre-1903 King of Serbia and then Franz Ferdinand, the Black Hand be [the Black Hand] treated as war criminals. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia's combined armed forces, the Royal Serbian Army is [the Royal Serbian Army] placed under Austrian supervision. The Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Montenegro becomes an Austrian puppet state as well, with The Kingdom of Montenegro's combined armed forces, Royal Montenegrin Army under Austrian supervision. The German House of Wied-Neuwied-ruled Constitutional royal monarchy of the Principality of Albania in Albania takes Kosovo. Bulgaria subsequently receives the Moesia plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountains range (Stara Planina), Thrace from Greece and Macedonia from Serbia. The German House of Wittelsbach-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Greece becomes a Austrian puppet state as well. The Empire of China receives Singapore and Hong Kong from the British and Macau from the Portuguese. The Japanese also liberate the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The Germans also take Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon from the French. The Germans also take the Congo from Belgium. The Germans combine Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon in addition to Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi into one massive Central African German colony, Mittleafrika [Middle Africa |Mittleafrika|]. Austria also takes Veneto from the Kingdom of Italy. Thus the Treaty of Linz in this timeline ends with a decisive Central Powers victory and the end of British and French influence over the world. The Empire of China in this timeline remains under an extended regency for a year or two after the National Protection War due to Yuntai refusing the Chinese throne in this timeline, that is until the goal of the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline [\\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\"] is remembered and so the surviving descendants of the Chinese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] are [the Zhu descendants] invited [the Zhu descendants] by [who invites the Zhu descendants] the National Assembly under pressure of the Yellow Sand Society, [the Zhu descendants being invited by the National Assembly] to [what the National Assembly invites the Zhu descendants to do] reclaim their [the Zhu descendants'] rightful position as the rulers [the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China, which they [the Zhu descendants] reluctantly [the Zhu descendants] accept, [the Zhu descendants] seeing [the Zhu descendants] that the people of the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in Han China support them [the Zhu descendants] and the monarchy [the Ming dynasty]. Yuntai relinquishes his [Yuntai's] claim to the Chinese throne and [Yuntai] allows his [Yuntai's] children and [Yuntai's] siblings to be absorbed into the Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Han China after the National Protection war in this timeline is compared to this timeline's version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline. The Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China ruling over Han China still has the official name of the \\"Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. A modified version of the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag becomes its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the Kuomintang's White Sun with a white-outer rayed, red inner-rayed yellow sun with the Chinese character for \\"Ming\\" in the middle of the yellow sun in tribute to the original Ming blue sky and red outer rayed yellow sun flag while the crossed 18-star iron blood flag of the Xinhai Revolution becomes the Chinese army flag. The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. The pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" era and the pre-Great Qing Empire, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility is [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] subsequently [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] restored, restructured, readjusted and modified for the modern world of the late 20th century, [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] being [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] merged [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] with the system of peerage Yuan Shikai had [Yuan Shikai] created when he [Yuan Shikai] formed the Empire of China in 1915. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] begins efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary democratic federalist Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing and also to initiate massive industrial, railway and educational development works in Han China with the help of international aid. The Beiyang Army is [the Beiyang Army] retooled, restaffed and rebuilt into a modern incarnation of the Great Ming State's combined ground warfare and naval combat force, the Great Ming Army after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China with help from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. Jingwei even becomes the Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet from 1939-1943, during which [Jingwei's first term as Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty] time the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the unitary parliamentary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] imperial dynastic monarchy of the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, which [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] remains [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] the form [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] that the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] takes [the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Ming dynasty] from 1938-1954, and [Wang Jingwei becoming Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet] again from 1945-1951. Before Jingwei, the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang still becomes the first Prime Minister of the Empire of China from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922, and Jingwei is [Jingwei] succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP in this timeline due to the Empire of China winning the National Protection War in this timeline, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members in this time, then Wu Shih-wen of the KMT from 20 May 2000 – 1 February 2002, Chiang Chung-ling of the KMT from March 2000 – 30 March 2003 , then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. After the Treaty of Linz in this timeline, France and the British Isles are stripped off all their power, influence and strength and subsequently become international pariahs. A revolution launched by socialist, communist and syndicalist groups against the fascist French regime in around 1918-1919 leads to the flight of the French fascists to French North Africa [French occupied Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia] and the subsequent joint invasion of the French mainland by the Imperial German Army and the Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. Mainland France soon falls quickly and the French House of Bourbon-ruled parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of France is [the Kingdom of France] restored [the Kingdom of France] as the government [the Kingdom of France] of Northern France by Austria-Hungary while the Germans restore the Feudal royal parliamentary monarchy of the Dutchy of Brittany in Brittany and [the Germans] establish an independent Occitan kingdom in Southern France. A communist takeover of the British Isles minus Ireland leads to the invasion of the British Isles by Germany and Austria-Hungary and the division of the British Isles into their separate Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Scotland in Scotland ruled by the German House of Wittelsbach, the Kingdom of England in England ruled by the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Dutchy of Wales ruled by the Welsh House of Anwyl of Tywyn. The Central Powers and the Japanese also sent aid to the monarchist, Russian nationalist, Russian fascist Whites fighting against the Communist Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War with the Whites winning the Russian Civil War, unlike in OTL. Germany makes European Russia a German protectorate under the Romanovs while the Bolsheviks flee to Siberia. The Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi/Pahlavi dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Imperial State of Iran is [the Imperial State of Iran] still formed in Iran in 1925, but Iran takes Dagestan from the restored Russian Empire, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Uzbekistan's and Turkmenistan's shared Khwarazm province, and [Iran] subsequently absorbs Afghanistan into itself [Afghanistan]. The Imperial State of Iran's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces receives training from the Germans and the Austria-Hungarians and become a modern, developed force. Due to WW1 ending with a Central Powers victory and fascism being contained to Italy and the Third French Republic in this timeline and communism being wiped out, national liberation movements never occur in Africa. The Central Powers and their satellite states surviving post-WW1 means that democracy is ironically more secure than OTL. The Brittanians use trickery and deceit to seize the former Confederate States of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina and integrate them [South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina] into British North America during a time of political chaos and instability in the USA, along with [the Brittanians] taking New England. This forces the Germans to make Texas into the Kingdom of Texas ruled by a side branch of the Hohenzollerns and the Japanese to seize the American West Coast, which [the American West Coast] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the Pacific States of America. The Japanese also seize Hawaii and [the Japanese] restore the Hawaiian House of Kawānanakoa-ruled semi-constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii in Hawaii. The influence of the Manchuria based division of the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground warfare division, the Imperial Japanese Army protecting the South Manchuria railway in Manchuria from Han Chinese bandits, the Kwangtung Army along with the IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] in Manchuria means that the Japanese are [the Japanese] able [the Japanese] to [the Japanese] push out Zhuolin and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria while [the Japanese] increasing the influence of the Qing Imperial Court and the indigenous Manchu nobility, aristocracy and royalty in Manchuria, [the Japanese decreasing the influence of the Fengtian Clique and increasing the influence of the Qing imperial court within post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] leading to it [post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becoming the pre-WW2 and WW2-era, post-1932, pre-1945 Imperial Japanese protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s, with the Great Qing Empire's last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, [Pu-Yi] becoming [what Pu-Yi becomes after the formation of Manchukuo] the first Emperor [Pu-Yi after Manchukuo's formation] of Manchukuo like in OTL. After Pu-Yi's death in [when Pu-Yi dies in this timeline] around 1970, his [Pu-Yi's] younger half brother Aisin-Gioro Puren becomes [Puren in this timeline] the Emperor of Manchukuo, [Puren in this timeline] followed by his [Puren's] son, Aisin-Gioro Yuzhang after his [Yuzhang's] death in [when Puren died] 2015, who [Yuzhang] intends [Yuzhang] to [Yuzhang] make his [Yuzhang's] daughter, Jin Xin Empress of Manchukuo upon his [Yuzhang's] death. The Cantonese statesman, diplomat and calligrapher Zheng Xiaoxu is the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo like in OTL, followed by the Manchurian general, warlord and politician Zhang Jinghui like in OTL, followed by Hu Qili, then Jiang Zemin. The armed Wing and thus the combined armed forces of the Fengtian Clique formed from Zhuolin's bandit forces and what remained of the Manchu Bannermen and the Qing New Army in Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution, the National Pacification Army, [the National Pacification Army] becomes a modern, well equipped military force under the watchful eye of the Kwangtung Army with help from the Imperial German Army and Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. The National Pacification Army eventually becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria becomes Manchukuo with Fengtian Clique and pro-China unification elements within the NPA being discredited, given extended sentences of leave to Nationalist China or the restored Ming dynasty, or otherwise removed in various ways. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria.

Young Issei, still somewhat naive and innocent [young Issei] asks why he [young Issei] needs to do that kung-fu stuff [martial arts] so early since he [young Issei] is [young Issei] pretty smart for his [young Issei's] age, [young Issei] having [young Issei] inherited both Bulma's and Wùfàn's high intellect and intelligence in this story, [young Issei] having created several innovative gadgets and devices out of boredom which [Issei's inventions] were [Issei's inventions] later stolen by Soviet and KKK spies within Japan looking for tech to steal, with the Soviet and Brittanian ambassors at the Conference of Vienna later presenting the details of Issei's inventions to the world as proof of Japanese imperialism, which resulted in further sanctions on Brittania from Germany and Austria-Hungary and key Soviet government officials dying mysteriously from unknown causes due to the leaders of the Central Powers knowing who the true inventor [Issei] of the tech stolen by the Klan and the Soviets was Nobuyuki as Gorou then replies that brains don't always win everything and that a little strength is sometimes necessary, [Nobuyuki as Gorou] giving the example of the Japanese seizure of the American West Coast in the 1920s and the subsequent formation of the Pacific States of America after Confederate revivalists and KKK members in California slaughtered Japanese citizens and attempted to take the Japanese concession in San Francisco, lead on greedy Blue Dogs and corrupt American soldiers.

Their surroundings were nothing short of surreal, an extended plain white void, courtesy of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber Capsule Corp had so graciously restored. Achika, his wife, heavy with their next child, Kunō, watched on with a mix of amusement and pride, a subtle hint of nervousness betraying her otherwise calm facade. Irisviel, holding the one-year-old twins Chloe and Illya, couldn't hide her curiosity, her eyes sparkling with an excitement mirrored by the children in her arms. \\"Why do I have to learn all this kung-fu stuff now, Dad?\\" Issei's voice pierced the heavy silence, his stance relaxing as he turned a questioning gaze up to his father. \\"I mean, I'm pretty smart already, aren't I? Why do I need to be strong too?\\" Gorou smiled, a gentle, understanding curve to his lips. \\"Brains are important, Issei, no doubt about that. But sometimes, brains alone aren't enough. There are times when strength, both of heart and body, makes all the difference in the world.\\" He knelt, bringing himself to Issei's level, his eyes serious yet soft. \\"Remember the stories of how Japan had to stand firm against enemies, how sometimes, only the willingness to fight protected its people and honor?\\" Issei nodded slowly, his forehead creasing in thought as he recalled tales from both history and bedtime stories alike. \\"Like when those big bad guys tried to take over the whole world, and Japan had to help stop them?\\" \\"Exactly.\\" Gorou stood, ruffling Issei's hair affectionately. \\"And that's why we train. Not to seek out fights, but so we're always ready to protect what's important to us.\\" Achika's voice chimed in, a note of steel beneath her warmth. \\"And so you can protect those you care about, Issei. Sometimes, the world isn't kind, and you'll find challenges that require more than just a keen mind.\\" Issei squared his small shoulders, a newfound determination lighting his amber eyes – the same eyes that had seen the underside of genius and the shadow of potential greatness. \\"Okay, Dad. I'll learn. For Mom, for you, for Kunō, and…\\" He glanced towards his stepmother and stepsisters. \\"For everyone.\\" Gorou offered a nod of approval before slipping into a stance, signaling the beginning of their session. \\"Good. Let's start with the basics then. We'll build you up, step by step.\\" As father and son engaged in a carefully choreographed dance of martial prowess and learning, Irisviel and Achika shared a glance, a silent understanding passing between them. They were raising a future leader, someone who could perhaps bridge worlds and mend fractures with both intellect and strength. The possibility of what Issei might become, what paths he might walk, filled the chamber with a sense of promise, a whisper of the future's potential. And somewhere, amidst the lessons of punches and kicks, beneath the watchful eyes of his family and the protective embrace of history's weight, Issei took his first steps towards a destiny that was uniquely his own – a symphony of brains, brawn, and the unyielding spirit of a warrior."},{"instruction":"(On the outskirts of Mondstadt City...)

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how car alarms bleat loudly and persistently that are triggered by a mere touch but go unanswered due to the driver being unaware that the alarm has signaled. Moreover, the car driver is probably not even in the vicinity of halt the alarm due to him being in a store if parked in a retail location, doing his job elsewhere while at work or asleep at night with the car alarm wailing and disturbing all that can hear it.","output":"In the labyrinth of urban cacophony, car alarms stand out as a particularly notorious contributor to noise pollution. Often set off by the slightest prompt—a mere brush against the vehicle by a passerby, a strong gust of wind, or the innocuous bounce of a basketball nearby—these alarms erupt into a fervent symphony of loud, persistent bleats. Designed to alert the owner of a potential security breach, these sonic sentinels instead often perform to an empty audience. The scenario unfolds typically across different daily activities and locations, casting a wide net of disturbance yet failing in their primary function of security alertness. Firstly, consider the setting of a bustling retail location. Large parking areas sprawl adjacent to shopping centers, where drivers park their vehicles to venture inside for groceries, clothing, or other needs. The alarms, triggered in the absence of the car's owner, transform from a protective device into an instrument of public nuisance. Despite their loud and repetitive noise designed to catch the attention of the car owner, these alarms often go unanswered. The reason is straightforward: the vehicle's owner, deeply engrossed in the act of shopping, remains blissfully unaware of the chaos unfurling outside. The distance between the owner and the vehicle, coupled with the insulating walls of the retail buildings, ensures that the alarm's bleating fails to reach its intended recipient's ears. Instead, it becomes a relentless auditory torment for anyone within its vicinity. The situation does not markedly improve in workplace scenarios. Cars parked in large office complexes face a similar fate. Here, the owner might be stationed at their desk, engrossed in meetings or concentrated on their computer screens, miles away from the parking spot where their car sits unguarded—except for the alarm, that is. Once triggered, the alarm's penetrating soundwaves ripple across the parking area, often setting off a domino effect where one car alarm triggers another, creating a choir of dissonance. Yet again, the sound fails to reach or alert the car's owner, leaving bystanders or fellow workers to endure the auditory assault. The owner's physical and mental preoccupation with their job ensures the car alarm's message is lost, dissipating into the air unheeded. The nighttime scenario presents perhaps the most ironic twist in the tale of car alarms. Vehicles parked in residential areas, near the owners' homes, or even in their driveways, are not immune to false triggers. A nocturnal setting amplifies the disturbance caused by a car alarm. As the surrounding environment quiets down for the night, the abrupt blaring of a car alarm slices through the silence with an almost malevolent force. The irony lies in the fact that while this might be when the alarm's alert is most crucial (given the cover of darkness is often preferred by thieves), it is also when it is most likely to go unanswered. The vehicle's owner, presumably asleep, remains oblivious to the outside disturbance. The alarm then, instead of serving as a protector, transforms into a nocturnal nemesis, disturbing the sleep and peace of the entire neighborhood. The relentless wail of the alarm through the still night air serves as a stark reminder of the device's inefficacy in situations where direct intervention by the car owner is required. Across these varied scenarios—be it in a bustling retail location, at a workplace during the day, or in the quiet of residential areas at night—the result remains consistent: car alarms, despite their loud and persistent signaling, often go unanswered. This systematic failure stems not from a lack of intention on the part of the alarm's design but from the practical dislocation of the owner from the vehicle. The alarms, in their zealous effort to alert, end up creating an atmosphere of noise pollution, inadvertently becoming a source of public irritation rather than security. This paradox highlights a fundamental flaw in relying solely on acoustic alerts in environments where the intended recipient is beyond reach. In essence, while car alarms continue to bleat their warnings into the void, they leave behind a trail of disturbed peace and questioning over their practicality in urban landscapes."},{"instruction":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how the manga and anime series Naruto is different in kind and lore from Disney animated cartoons that kids have grown up with such that Naruto is seen as more exciting and approachable to many pre-adolescents through its use of narrative and characterization that is lacking in many Disney movies and tv series.","output":"In the pantheon of animated narratives that have captivated the imaginations of pre-adolescents, the manga and anime series \\"Naruto\\" by Masashi Kishimoto stands as a monument to narrative depth, character development, and cultural impact, distinguishing itself starkly from the archetypal Disney animated cartoons. The differentiation rests not merely in the superficial elements of storytelling but in the foundational frameworks of lore, narrative structure, and the portrayal of complex, evolving characters which resonate with the audience on a profound level. These features collectively forge \\"Naruto\\" into an experience that is both thrillingly exciting and intimately approachable for its audience, in ways that many Disney creations struggle to match. At the heart of \\"Naruto's\\" appeal is its rich, elaborate lore that weaves together the fantastical elements of ninja arts with deep-seated human themes such as perseverance, loneliness, and the quest for acceptance. This universe is populated with villages that have their unique cultures, histories, and political intrigue, significantly more nuanced than the relatively straightforward settings found in Disney animations. For instance, the intricately detailed Hidden Leaf Village, with its own governance, traditions, and rivalries, offers a more layered and immersive world than the often one-dimensional kingdoms of Disney. This complexity of setting allows for a narrative that can explore socio-political issues, moral ambiguities, and the consequences of war, providing a fertile ground for storytelling that engages audiences in thoughtful reflection. Narrative structure in \\"Naruto\\" is another domain where it diverges sharply from Disney's formula. Unlike the linear, often predictable plotlines of Disney movies that wrap up neatly within a couple of hours, \\"Naruto\\" unfolds over hundreds of episodes, allowing for an expansive, multi-threaded saga that spans generations. This long-format storytelling facilitates deep character arcs and gradual world-building, enabling viewers to form lasting emotional attachments to the characters and the narrative universe. \\"Naruto's\\" plot is rife with twists, betrayals, and epic battles, yet it also dedicates considerable time to exploring the backstories of even minor characters, enriching the tapestry of its world. This complexity and depth are seldom found in Disney's offerings, where character development often takes a backseat to the narrative's moral lesson. Characterization in \\"Naruto\\" is, perhaps, its most marked departure from Disney standards. Characters in \\"Naruto\\" are multifaceted and undergo significant development, grappling with internal conflicts, moral dilemmas, and the harsh realities of their world. Naruto Uzumaki himself evolves from a lonely outcast to a hero of his village, struggling with the demon sealed within him while seeking acceptance and understanding. This portrayal of growth and vulnerability offers a stark contrast to the oftentimes static Disney protagonists, whose personalities and circumstances change little over the course of their stories. Furthermore, \\"Naruto\\" does not shy away from depicting the darker aspects of its characters’ journeys, including loss, failure, and redemption, themes that are frequently sanitized in Disney narratives for younger audiences. \\"Nararuto's\\" embrace of complex themes such as sacrifice, resilience in the face of adversity, and the value of hard work and friendship speaks to pre-adolescents in a language they are beginning to understand intimately. This realness, combined with the fantastical elements of ninja abilities and the allure of mastering one's skills, creates a compelling narrative that is as inspiring as it is entertaining. Disney, while successful in its own right, often resorts to clear-cut distinctions between good and evil, and simplistic resolutions that, though satisfying, fail to challenge young viewers in meaningful ways. In conclusion, \\"Naruto\\" distinguishes itself from Disney animated cartoons through its richly layered lore, sophisticated narrative structure, and deeply drawn characters that grow and evolve in complexity. These elements synergize to craft a narrative experience that is not only more exhilarating but also more personally resonant with pre-adolescents, offering them a nuanced view of the world through the lens of an epic saga. Through \\"Naruto,\\" viewers are not just entertained but are also invited to reflect on the nature of friendship, the costs of war, and the endless quest for personal growth and acceptance, themes that are woven into the very fabric of its storytelling."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly demonstrate how in comparing two long running tv series Naruto provides greater depth of character, background, plot advancement and theme than the Disney tv cartoon The Little Mermaid which was a prequel to the animated movie The Little Mermaid.","output":"Expanding upon the analysis that juxtaposes the narrative and thematic depth of \\"Naruto\\" with Disney's animated offerings, a focused comparison with Disney’s TV cartoon \\"The Little Mermaid\\" serves to further illuminate the stark contrast in storytelling complexity and character development between the two. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series, functioning as a prequel to the iconic Disney movie, ventures to explore the undersea world of Ariel before her encounter with Prince Eric. Despite the series' attempts to delve into new adventures and character insights, it pales in comparison to the nuanced and richly layered narrative presented in \\"Naruto,\\" especially in terms of character depth, background exposition, plot advancement, and thematic exploration. Character depth in \\"Naruto\\" is a composite of personal struggles, emotional growth, and a continuum of development that resonates deeply with audiences. Characters in \\"Naruto\\" are painted with broad strokes of grey, embodying both virtues and flaws that render them profoundly human, despite the fantastical setting. Naruto himself is an emblem of perseverance against societal rejection, his journey intricately tied to themes of loneliness, perseverance, and the pursuit of recognition. In contrast, Ariel’s character in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series exhibits a more one-dimensional pursuit of adventure and discovery, lacking significant personal growth or deep internal conflict. The prequel format restricts her character from evolving beyond the curious and rebellious teenager, as her destiny is already predetermined by the movie's narrative. The complexity of Naruto's character, marred by his internal demons and external societal challenges, offers a more profound and engaging character study than Ariel's relatively superficial struggles and triumphs. The background and lore in \\"Naruto\\" are meticulously crafted, with each village, clan, and character being a piece of a larger, intricate puzzle. The series does not merely create a setting for its characters but builds an entire world teeming with history, politics, and culture that significantly impact the plot and character motivations. For example, the historical animosity between the villages of Konoha and Suna is not just a backdrop but a vital storyline that drives character interactions and plot developments. On the other hand, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, while offering glimpses into Ariel's world before the events of the film, does not venture far into the cultural or political intricacies of the undersea kingdom. The setting serves more as a backdrop for episodic adventures rather than a fully realized world that shapes and is shaped by its inhabitants. Plot advancement in \\"Naruto\\" is both expansive and intricate, weaving together individual character arcs with overarching narrative threads. The series masterfully balances episodic encounters with long-term story arcs, ensuring that each episode contributes to character development or plot progression. This narrative structure allows for a deep exploration of themes such as the cyclical nature of hatred, the pain of loss, and the power of empathy. Conversely, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, constrained by its prequel status and episodic format, often resorts to formulaic plots that offer limited advancement of the overarching narrative or deep thematic exploration. The episodes, while entertaining, largely lack the consequential weight found in \\"Naruto's\\" storytelling, where actions have lasting impacts on the characters and their world. Thematically, \\"Naruto\\" ventures into territory that is seldom explored with such depth in children’s animation. It does not shy away from exploring the effects of war, the complexity of human emotions, and the moral ambiguities of its characters’ actions. These themes are interwoven with the narrative, offering viewers—a number of whom are pre-adolescents—a nuanced understanding of the world. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, in striving to maintain a light-hearted tone suitable for a young audience, steers clear of deep thematic engagement, opting instead for surface-level morals and lessons. In summation, comparing \\"Naruto\\" with Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series underscores the former's superior depth in character development, background exposition, plot advancement, and thematic richness. \\"Naruto\\" presents a tapestry of human experience set against a fantastical backdrop, offering viewers intricate character studies and a world teeming with lore and history. Meanwhile, \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" while a cherished part of Disney's animated pantheon, offers a narrative experience that is less complex, opting for episodic adventure over dynamic character growth or deep thematic exploration. Through this comparison, the superiority of \\"Naruto's\\" narrative structure and thematic ambition becomes unequivocally clear, providing a compelling canvas that engages audiences on multiple levels."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly explain how even if The Little Mermaid tv series wasn't constrained by the cartoon being a prequel to the movie, it still doesn't have the same impact in terms of literary significance as compared with the tv series Naruto.","output":"Expanding the analysis of \\"Naruto\\" versus Disney’s \\"The Little Mermaid\\" TV series, even if we momentarily disregard the constraint of the latter being a prequel to the movie, it still falls significantly short of achieving the same level of literary significance and impact as \\"Naruto.\\" This disparity manifests across multiple dimensions of narrative construction, character complexity, thematic exploration, and cultural resonance, underscoring the profound depth and sophistication embedded within \\"Naruto's\\" storytelling fabric as compared to the relatively simplistic and less impactful narrative offered by \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series. Firstly, the structural complexity and narrative ambition of \\"Naruto\\" far surpass what is attempted in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series. \\"Naruto\\" employs a sophisticated narrative architecture that interlaces multiple character arcs and intricate plot lines across a vast temporal landscape. It explores themes of legacy, destiny, and the consequences of past actions on present and future generations, lending a literary weight and gravitas to its storytelling. Each character in \\"Naruto\\" is vested with backstories that delve into themes of loss, redemption, and the quest for identity, making their journeys emblematic of universal human experiences. \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" even liberated from its prequel constraints, tends toward episodic storytelling that, while engaging, rarely builds towards a cumulative narrative payoff or delves deeply into character backstories in a meaningful way. Secondly, character evolution in \\"Naruto\\" is markedly more nuanced and dynamic. Characters undergo significant transformations, shaped by their experiences, failures, and successes. This dynamic character development facilitates a deeper exploration of themes like resilience, morality, and personal growth. For instance, Sasuke’s journey from a revenge-driven loner to a person who comprehends the value of friendship and community encapsulates a complex narrative arc of redemption and self-discovery. In contrast, characters in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, including Ariel, though beloved and charismatic, exhibit relatively static character development, their personalities and virtues largely unchanged by the events of the series. This lack of significant character growth limits the series' ability to engage with more profound or challenging themes in a manner that impacts the audience on a deeper level. The thematic richness and literary significance of \\"Naruto\\" are further augmented by its engagement with socio-political themes. The series delves into the intricacies of governance, the impact of war, the cyclical nature of hatred, and the possibility of societal reform and peace. These themes are not only explored through the narratives of the central characters but are also embedded within the very fabric of the series' world-building, from the structure of the ninja villages to the system of the Shinobi World. This results in a rich tapestry of interconnected stories that reflect on real-world issues, extending beyond the confines of its genre and appealing to a broader audience. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, by its design, focuses predominantly on adventure and exploration, themes that, while entertaining, offer limited scope for profound literary or thematic exploration. Lastly, the cultural impact and resonance of \\"Naruto\\" underscore its wider significance beyond entertainment. \\"Naruto\\" has not only garnered a massive global following but has also influenced pop culture, inspired discussions on its themes, and been the subject of academic inquiry. Its ability to resonate on multiple levels—emotional, intellectual, and philosophical—speaks to its literary importance. The reception of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, while positive, does not approach the same level of cultural or philosophical discourse, reflecting a less impactful narrative reach. In conclusion, even when considering \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series outside the constraints of its prequel status, it fails to match the literary depth, thematic sophistication, and cultural resonance achieved by \\"Naruto.\\" The disparity in narrative ambition, character complexity, thematic depth, and cultural impact between the two series illustrates the profound gap in their respective literary significances. \\"Naruto's\\" richly woven narrative, complex characters, and engagement with weighty themes render it a standout work of animated storytelling, resonating deeply with audiences and achieving a level of literary importance that \\"The Little Mermaid\\" series, despite its charms, cannot match."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Princess Zinzi sat across from her beloved brother, Prince Jabari, beneath the stern gazes of their ancestors, immortalized in grand portraits lining the chamber walls. Their conversation wove through dreams of enlightenment and strength for their vast empire. \\"We must fortify our trade routes, Jabari,\\" Zinzi suggested, her eyes alive with the fire of ambition. \\"And nurture the arts and maintain peace within our lands,\\" Jabari replied, the weight of potential envy from rivals heavy in his voice. As their hopes for Oyo's future soared, Jabari's hand wavered, his goblet of rich wine spilling its contents. \\"Zinzi, I—\\" A strange lightheadedness overcame him, causing his mighty form to collapse onto the cool marble floor. \\"Jabari! Oh, Jabari!\\" Zinzi's scream reverberated through the chamber as she rushed to his side, a distressed dove amidst the ruins of their aspirations. Yet, as she crouched by him, her features twisted into a dark, pleased smirk. \\"Rest well, dear brother,\\" she whispered venomously. Piece by piece, Zinzi removed her headdress and then skillfully began to peel away the face known as Zinzi's, revealing none other than Zara, the estranged and envious sister. \\"Sweet dreams, my dear brother,\\" Zara jeered mockingly, now wearing Zinzi's royal headdress. She placed the discarded mask into the fireplace to be consumed by flames. She then gleefully indulged in the meal her 'sister' had left unfinished, her treachery now complete. **Part II: The Craft of Deceit** Before the dawn, in the privacy of her sister's opulent chamber, Zara, wearing Amina's countenance, had betrayed her. She had rendered Amina unconscious using a vial of clear liquid, crafting an intricate plaster mold of her sister's noble features. In her own quarters, Zara used this template to create a mask so refined it mirrored Amina's visage too well. Upon gazing at her reflection, Zara slipped the mask over her face, transforming into the image of Amina. She then practiced Amina's voice, repeating her sister's phrases until, at last, the illusion was complete. As night encroached once again, Zara had perfected her impersonation, and the empire would awaken to a new Princess Amina, with Zara's unrelenting thirst for power hidden behind a sister's smile. **Part III: The Rightful Princess** The early hours of the Oyo Empire saw a servant girl approach the royal chamber. Her knock was soft, her voice steady yet laced with urgency. The false Princess Amina bade her enter, indulging this interruption with stolen grace. \\"There is a pressing matter that requires your attention, Your Highness,\\" the servant girl spoke, her words threading through the air with feigned anxiety. \\"What seems to be troubling you?\\" asked the usurper, her voice dipped in concern that masked her true terror of being unseated. In response, the servant girl produced a slender tube and swiftly blew a dart into Zara's neck. As the imposter slumped to the ground, the servant unveiled herself as none other than the true Princess Amina. Amina removed her sister's mask before discarding her own and reclaimed her headdress. Then, with the authority of her birthright and the morning sun enveloping her, she commanded the guards to take Zara away, assuring her unconscious betrayer that justice would soon follow. Oyo had been through a night of treachery, but as Amina stood amidst the dawn's golden rays, the empire felt the warmth of a new day. Reinstated, she would mend the fabric of her kingdom with threads of wisdom and strength. The rightful princess had returned, and the sun's glow promised rebirth and a brighter future."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but turn the dialogue, as best you can, into Shona, with English subtitles.","output":"**Part I: The Unseen Betrayal** Mumwenje werubvumo rwemadzongonyedze, imba huru yekudyira muumambo hweOyo yakazara nembiri.

Jest to także norma postępowania, która kieruje naszymi wyborami i decyzjami. W życiu codziennym często stajemy przed dylematami moralnymi, w których musimy ocenić, jakie działanie jest właściwe z punktu widzenia etyki. Pojęcie etyki dotyczy zarówno zachowań jednostki, jak i grup społecznych. Nasze decyzje i działania mają wpływ na innych ludzi, dlatego ważne jest, abyśmy podejmowali je świadomie i zgodnie z zasadami moralnymi. W dzisiejszym zglobalizowanym świecie, gdzie jesteśmy narażeni na różnorodne wpływy kulturowe i społeczne, musimy być świadomi swoich wartości i przekonań. W życiu codziennym często stajemy przed sytuacjami, w których musimy podjąć decyzje dotyczące naszego postępowania. Czy pomóc potrzebującemu na ulicy? Czy być lojalnym wobec przyjaciela, mimo że może to zaszkodzić innym? Czy oszukiwać w celu osiągnięcia własnych korzyści? To tylko kilka przykładów dylematów moralnych, które każdy z nas może napotkać w swoim życiu. Jednym z kluczowych pojęć w etyce jest zasada uniwersalności, która mówi, że to, co jest dobre dla jednego człowieka, powinno być dobre dla całej społeczności. To oznacza, że nasze decyzje powinny być oparte na zasadach, które można stosować wobec wszystkich ludzi, niezależnie od ich sytuacji czy przekonań. Ważne jest także rozważenie konsekwencji naszych działań i ich wpływu na innych. Ważne jest, abyśmy podejmowali świadome decyzje oparte na zasadach etycznych. Dyskusje na temat moralności i wartości powinny być prowadzone zarówno w sferze publicznej, jak i prywatnej, abyśmy mogli rozwijać naszą świadomość moralną i kształtować nasze postawy wobec innych ludzi.

Throughout history, human beings have been responsible for countless atrocities and injustices, from wars and genocides to slavery and exploitation. The annals of history are filled with tales of violence, cruelty, and barbarism committed by individuals and societies alike. The concept of human nature itself has been hotly debated, with some arguing that humans are inherently selfish, violent, and destructive. This perspective is supported by evidence from various disciplines, including psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, which suggest that aggression, dominance, and competition are deeply ingrained in the human psyche. Despite our capacity for compassion, creativity, and cooperation, the darker aspects of human nature continue to color our collective history. From the horrors of colonialism and imperialism to the systemic injustices of racism and sexism, humanity has a long and troubling track record of inflicting harm on one another. It is essential to confront this darker side of humanity and acknowledge the harm that has been done in order to learn from our mistakes and work towards a more just and compassionate future.

The pervasive sense of self-hatred that has emerged has led some to believe that humanity is irredeemable, and that the only solution is to voluntarily bring about our own extinction. This disturbing perspective has even gained traction among certain governments and organizations, who have joined forces in a twisted alliance to plan the deliberate eradication of the human race. The reasoning behind this is based on the belief that by removing humans from the equation, the Earth and all other living beings will be spared from the destructive tendencies of our species. This nihilistic approach reflects a deep sense of despair and resignation about the state of humanity and our impact on the planet. It also raises profound ethical and moral questions about the value of human life and the potential consequences of such a drastic course of action. While it is crucial to confront the darker aspects of our nature and strive for a more ethical and sustainable way of living, the idea of intentionally causing the extinction of humanity is a drastic and troubling response. Instead, it is imperative that we work towards positive change, healing, and reconciliation in order to build a better future for ourselves and the planet we call home.

Как это сделать с помощью Python CV2","output":"Сегментация драпированной ткани на изображении может быть довольно сложной задачей, в зависимости от качества и условий изображения, таких как освещение, тени, фон и так далее. Однако, предполагая, что у вас есть довольно чёткий контраст между тканью и фоном, вы можете использовать библиотеку OpenCV для Python, чтобы попытаться выполнить сегментацию. Вот базовая последовательность шагов, которые вы можете выполнить для сегментации драпированной ткани: 1. Загрузите изображение. 2. Преобразуйте изображение в оттенки серого. 3. Примените фильтрацию для сглаживания изображения. 4. Выполните пороговую обработку или используйте метод Canny для выделения краёв. 5. Найдите контуры, которые соответствуют ткани. 6. Сегментируйте область, соответствующую ткани, например, с помощью маски. 7. Отобразите сегментированную ткань или сохраните в файл. Ниже приведён пример кода, демонстрирующий некоторые из этих шагов: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np # Загружаем изображение image = cv2.imread('fabric.jpg') # Преобразуем в оттенки серого gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # Применяем Гауссово размытие blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0) # Применяем пороговую обработку или детектор границ Canny #_, thresh = cv2.threshold(blur, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY) edges = cv2.Canny(blur, 50, 150) # Находим контуры на изображении contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) # Предполагаем, что контур с наибольшей площадью - это ткань # (можно изменить условие выбора контура в зависимости от критериев) max_area = -1 for cnt in contours: area = cv2.contourArea(cnt) if area > max_area: max_area = area large_contour = cnt # Создаем маску для ткани mask = np.zeros_like(gray) cv2.drawContours(mask, [large_contour], -1, 255, -1) # Применяем маску к изображению, убирая всё кроме ткани segmented = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask) # Показываем изображение cv2.imshow('Segmented Fabric', segmented) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() # Сохраняем результат cv2.imwrite('segmented_fabric.jpg', segmented) \`\`\` Важно отметить, что эффективность этого подхода сильно зависит от характеристик изображения.

We do not need an explicit formula to calculate each number's sum with simple arithmetic. Instead, we will use a process of accumulation. Each letter's frequency is one more than its predecessor, starting at ten and incrementing by one each time. To cumulatively sum these without traditional arithmetic, I will repeat the process in a linear, calculated narration: Starting with A letter ten times, we have ten as our initial count. Adding the frequency of B, which is eleven times, we get a new total of twenty-one. Including C's twelve repetitions, our running total is now thirty-three. With D letter thirteen times, our sum becomes forty-six. By repeating E fourteen times, our cumulative number is now sixty. Counting F for fifteen times brings us to seventy-five. Adding sixteen Gs gets us to ninety-one. Seventeen Hs move the sum to one hundred and eight. Eighteen Is take my total to one hundred and twenty-six. Nineteen Js and we arrive at one hundred and forty-five. Twenty Ks make the sum one hundred and sixty-five. L repeated twenty-one times increases the total to one hundred and eighty-six. M twenty-two times means our count is now two hundred and eight. Adding twenty-three Ns gives us two hundred and thirty-one. Adding O written twenty-four times totals two hundred and fifty-five. Including P twenty-five times increases the tally to two hundred and eighty. Adding Qs twenty-six instances arrives at three hundred and six. Twenty-seven Rs now and our total is three hundred and thirty-three. Adding twenty-eight S letters makes the sum three hundred and sixty-one. Writing T twenty-nine times makes the cumulative amount three hundred and ninety. Including U thirty times gives us four hundred and twenty. V at thirty-one times reaches four hundred and fifty-one. W written thirty-two times takes the total to four hundred and eighty-three. Adding Xs thirty-three repetitions makes it five hundred and sixteen.

Results should be returned in a single cell on the same row in column Q using Textjoin","output":"Assuming you want to search for a term specified in cell B2, and you want to look for this term in columns C and E, and then return their corresponding values from columns O and P in the same row, combined in one cell in column Q, you could use an array formula that includes \`IF\`, \`ISNUMBER\`, \`SEARCH\`, \`TEXTJOIN\`, and \`INDEX\`. The general formula structure for row 2 would be like this: \`\`\`excel =TEXTJOIN(\\", \\", TRUE, IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(B2, C2)) * ISNUMBER(SEARCH(B2, E2)), INDEX(O:O, ROW()) & \\" \\" & INDEX(P:P, ROW()), \\"\\")) \`\`\` However, this formula is quite basic and would only work if both C2 and E2 contain the search term. If you want to find the search term in either C or E and concatenate all matches, you will need an array formula that checks each cell in columns C and E individually. To put this more sophisticated array formula together for row 2 you would use this structure: \`\`\`excel =TEXTJOIN(\\", \\", TRUE, IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(B2, C2:C100)), O2:O100, \\"\\"), IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(B2, E2:E100)), P2:P100, \\"\\")) \`\`\` Array formulas need to be entered with Ctrl + Shift + Enter in Excel 2016 and earlier. Starting from Excel 365 and Excel 2019, these formulas can be entered with just Enter, thanks to the introduction of dynamic arrays. However, the above formula assumes your data range goes down to row 100; adjust the ranges as necessary. Also, if you need to search for multiple terms or have multiple lookup values in columns C and E, the formula will get more complex. Remember that \`TEXTJOIN\` will ignore empty strings, which in this case are produced when the \`IF\` conditions return false (i.e., when the search term is not found in columns C or E). Ultimately the correct formula for you will vary depending on the specifics of your spreadsheet, the version of Excel you're using, and further details about how you want to handle edge cases. Always test your formula with a variety of inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

This wasn't just another match; it was the clash of the season between two schools renowned not for dainty displays, but for the grit and gusto with which their girls grappled in the grand game of rugby. The pitch itself looked like a tapestry of mud more than a field of play, especially around the try lines where the churned earth eagerly awaited new footprints. The center of the field was relatively solid, a tempting oasis of grass that teased the unwary. But surrounding it was a morass that promised to suck in boots, trap the unwary, and turn jerseys from bright school colors into a muddied brown. Referee whistle in mouth, the game kicked off under a brooding sky, and there was no mistaking the roar of the crowd as the Maidens' fly-half, Vanessa \\"Viper\\" Vincent, sent the ball hurtling towards Fillies' territory. Almost instantly, players from both sides were baptized in the day's first slather of sludge as they dove into rucks and mauls with reckless abandon. The Fillies were the first to adjust, showing a canny understanding of the mud's treachery. Their backline ran cleverly, avoiding the worst of the mire where they could. Charlotte \\"Charger\\" Chapman, the Fillies' burly center, powered through the Maidens' defense to score the opening try, her white jersey stained as if she'd been in a pottery class gone awry. Not to be outdone, the Maidens fought back, charging down the pitch with Sylvia \\"Sledgehammer\\" Smith bulldozing her way through tacklers. Yet, with each phase of play, the mud seemed to conspire against them, tripping up fleet-footed runs and bogging down their passes. As the first half waned, the Maidens found themselves trailing by twelve points, their spirits muddied but not quenched. In a team huddle, the girls, now unrecognizable from the mud caking their faces, brainstormed frantically under the guidance of their captain, Lucy \\"Lionheart\\" Lawson. \\"Listen up,\\" Lucy's voice cut through the wet air as the girls leaned in, \\"The mud's our friend today, not our foe. We've got to play smarter, use it to our advantage.\\" Eyes lit up as Lucy outlined a simple yet cunning plan: keep the ball tight among the forwards, where their opponents' speed would be negated. Instead of avoiding the quagmire, they'd draw the Fillies into it, tire them out in the tackle, and exploit the solid parts of the field when they presented themselves. The second half was a grueling testament to the Maidens’ resolve. Like gutsy generals, they fought their way through the sucking mud, working as one soiled, unified force. The ball, now a sodden, indistinct lump, hardly saw the light of day as it was protected by the Maidens' muddy vanguard. Slowly but surely, the points ticked up. Once, twice, thrice they crossed the line into Fairview territory, each try a monument to their strategy and daring. Amy \\"Anvil\\" Anderson scored the equalizing try, her joyous slide into the in-goal area sending a plume of mud high into the air, showering players and spectators alike. With minutes ticking away and the scores level, the Maidens' muddied determination paid off. In a moment of brilliance, \\"Viper\\" Vincent spotted a rare swath of grass and with a deft kick through, chased her own grubber, sliding over the line to plant the ball amidst the gasps and cheers of the crowd. As the final whistle blew, signaling a hard-fought 22-17 victory for the Maidens, the players from both teams erupted in cheers, their exhaustion eclipsed by their exuberance. Covered from head to toe in a badge of honor - the very earth they'd battled upon - they embraced and laughed, their rivaled spirits reflective of the very game they loved. Not just for the thrill of the win, or the clash of competition, but for the sheer, unadulterated joy of playing a game that let them be their fierce, filthy best."},{"instruction":"please provide a detailed description suitable for giving to an artist for a double page comic style version of a story like this (feel free to simplify to fit the constraints of a comic). describe each panel, which players are in that panel, what they look like (how muddy are they? color of kit? etc), what the ground is like, what they are saying and doing (eg diving into a mud puddle to ground the ball with a giant splash).","output":"For the comic-style adaptation, we will focus on a few key moments from the match to create six dynamic panels that convey the energy and excitement of the event. Each panel will be a standalone scene, bringing the muddy rugby match between the Maidstone Maidens and Fairview Fillies to life. **Panel 1: The Kickoff** - Layout: A wide shot that showcases the kickoff with the Maidstone Maidens (in royal blue and gold kits) on the left and the Fairview Fillies (in white and green kits) on the right. - Details: Vanessa \\"Viper\\" Vincent of the Maidens, relatively clean at this stage, is mid-kick. The ball is soaring across the pitch towards the waiting Fillies, who are poised to receive. The pitches in the background show patches of green with large areas of dark muddy brown where the field has been worn down. The sky above is gray and overcast. - Dialogue: Vanessa shouts, \\"Let’s start strong, Maidens!\\" - Action: Vanessa's teammates are in the background, cheering her on as they begin to charge after the ball. **Panel 2: The First Score** - Layout: A close-up action shot emphasizing the mud. - Details: Charlotte \\"Charger\\" Chapman of the Fillies, her white and green kit already stained with brown splashes, is bulldozing past blue and gold Maidens defenders. The ground beneath her is a churned mess, suggesting prior struggles. - Dialogue: Charlotte grunts as she pushes past a defender, saying, \\"Outta my way!\\" - Action: Charlotte crosses the Maidstone try line, a trail of mud in her wake, as she slams the ball down triumphantly. **Panel 3: The Struggle** - Layout: This panel should be a montage of muddy skirmishes between the players. - Details: It shows various Maidens and Fillies, now all heavily covered in mud making their kit colors nearly indistinguishable, engaging in rucks and tackles. The ground is more mire than grass, and players are slipping and sliding. - Dialogue: No specific speech, but thought bubbles with expressions like \\"gotta push through!\\" and \\"hold the line!\\" convey the intensity. - Action: Two or three separate engagements where both Maidstone and Fairview players are covered in splashes of mud as they fight for the ball. **Panel 4: The Team Huddle** - Layout: A half-page panel showing the Maidens huddled closely together. - Details: The team captain, Lucy \\"Lionheart\\" Lawson, stands at the center of the group. They are all now uniformly coated in a layer of dark mud, with blue and gold barely visible. Their faces are determined and attentive. - Dialogue: Lucy maps out the plan with her finger on her palm saying, \\"Embrace the mud, ladies. It’s our ally today.\\" - Action: The players are nodding and expressions of realization appear on their mud-smeared faces. **Panel 5: The Equalizing Try** - Layout: A dynamic, full-width panel. - Details: Amy \\"Anvil\\" Anderson, identifiable by her now brown pigtails sticking out of the mud, is in mid-dive towards the try line with a gigantic splash of mud erupting around her. The background Fillies look on in dismay. - Dialogue: Amy yells, \\"EQUALIZER!!\\" as she hits the ground. - Action: The splash of mud flies out dramatically, even reaching out of bounds of this panel and touching the edges of the others. **Panel 6: The Winning Play** - Layout: A triumphant final panel. - Details: Vanessa Vincent, with a mud mask but a gleam of determination in her eyes, is sliding over the try line after her kick and chase. Fans from both sides, clothing flecked with mud, cheer on from the sidelines. - Dialogue: Vanessa screams with joy, \\"Try for Maidens!\\" - Action: Her teammates are seen running towards her with jubilant expressions, arms raised in celebration. Ensure foreground characters are fully detailed, while the backgrounds can be less so, to not overwhelm the scenes. Captions at the bottom of the panels can provide contextual narrative to move the story along. The illustration style should reflect the kinetic energy of a rugby match and the unbridled enthusiasm of the players."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

Starting from A to Z, the sequence of repetitions is: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. The total sum is the addition of all these numbers. To make it simpler, we can group them to add them up more easily: (10 + 35) is 45, and there are 13 such pairs when you match the smallest and largest numbers and proceed to the center of the series. So, 13 pairs of 45. Now let's multiply thirteen by forty-five to get the total. Thirteen multiplied by forty is five hundred and twenty, and thirteen multiplied by five is sixty-five, so five hundred and twenty plus sixty-five is five hundred and eighty-five.

Чем могу помочь?"},{"instruction":"Как мне сегментировать картинку начиная от центра. У меня на картинке находится драпированная ткань, мне нужно сегментировать и оставить только ей (присутствие или её отсутствие). Как это сделать с помощью Python и CV2","output":"Для сегментации картинки с помощью Python и библиотеки OpenCV (cv2) начиная от центра, вы можете использовать следующий подход: 1. Загрузите изображение с драпированной тканью с помощью OpenCV: \`\`\`python import cv2 image = cv2.imread(\\"your_image.jpg\\") \`\`\` 2. Вычислите центр изображения: \`\`\`python height, width, _ = image.shape center = (int(width / 2), int(height / 2)) \`\`\` 3. Примените алгоритм пороговой обработки (thresholding), чтобы выделить драпировку на изображении: \`\`\`python gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) _, thresholded_image = cv2.threshold(gray_image, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY) \`\`\` 4. На основе центра и расстояния до него, определите область, которую хотите оставить на изображении (например, квадратную область): \`\`\`python distance = 100 # расстояние от центра x_min, y_min = center[0] - distance, center[1] - distance x_max, y_max = center[0] + distance, center[1] + distance segmented_image = image[y_min:y_max, x_min:x_max] \`\`\` 5. Таким образом, в переменной \`segmented_image\` будет сохранена область изображения с драпировкой, начиная от центра.

Если у вас возникнут дополнительные вопросы, не стесняйтесь задавать."},{"instruction":"Мне на вряд ли подходит сегментация с помощью трешхолда","output":"Если вам не подходит сегментация с помощью пороговой обработки, можно попробовать использовать другие методы сегментации, такие как сегментация по контурам или с использованием машинного обучения. Вот пример использования алгоритма выделения контуров (Canny) для сегментации изображения с драпированной тканью: \`\`\`python import cv2 image = cv2.imread(\\"your_image.jpg\\") gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) edges = cv2.Canny(gray_image, 100, 200) contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) # Находим контур с самой большой площадью largest_contour = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea) # Создаем маску на основе найденного контура mask = np.zeros_like(gray_image) cv2.drawContours(mask, [largest_contour], -1, (255,255,255), thickness=cv2.FILLED) # Применяем маску к изображению segmented_image = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask) \`\`\` В данном примере, алгоритм Canny используется для выделения контуров, затем находится контур с самой большой площадью и создается маска на его основе. Наконец, эта маска применяется к исходному изображению для сегментации драпировки. Если вы хотите использовать машинное обучение для более точной сегментации, можете рассмотреть использование глубоких нейронных сетей, таких как U-Net или Mask R-CNN.

The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom [Seirei Gensōki] in this fic due to its [the Ordesian Empire's in this fic] control of both the land and seas. The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great equivalent of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the German-equivalent House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent.

Claire is [Claire] unaware of Ortlinde's true identity and [Claire] calls affectionately her [Ortlinde] \\"Scarlet\\" [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Louise in this story] having Claire's public alias [Claire Rouge] as her [Louise's in this story's] own as well as [Louise in this story] having her [Claire's] hair and [Louise's in this story's] eyes change to Claire's own when she [Louise in this story] is [Louise in this story] highly emotional. Louise in her [Louise's in this story's] true self [Eco] is a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā], her [Eco's in this story] partner [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [who Eco's in this story's partner is] the Japanese-equivalent black-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and muscular, skilled swordsman and magic using teenage boy Karasuki Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] who [Ryū] is [Ryū] the reincarnation [Ryū] of [who Ryū's past life was] the tall, slender and muscular, kind and loyal swordsman-in-training and Japanese noble heir Amakawa Haruto [Seirei Gensōki] who [Haruto] was [Haruto] killed [Haruto] in a bus accident in Japan on Earth while [Haruto] going home from college and [Haruto] was [Haruto] subsequently reincarnated [Haruto] as Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] in the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā and Seirei Gensōki when the latter [ Ryū] was [Ryū] only five years old, or rather Ryū absorbed Haruto's soul into himself [Ryū]. Haruto, before, upon and after his [Haruto's] reincarnation as Ryū replaces Zero no Tsukaima's protagonist, the black-haired, blue-eyed, short and slender but also muscular teenage Japanese Hiraga Saito [Zero no Tsukaima], Saito being his [Haruto's] middle name in this fic as well as having Saito's status of Gandálfr [Zero no Tsukaima], which essentially means he [Saito] gains absolute mastery of any item meant for combat when he [Saito] touches and [Saito] subsequently weilds it, even artillery cannons and fighter aircraft, [Saito] also gaining heightened strength, agility, endurance, and reflexes as well as mastery over scientific application of technology to be included in using any weapon due to his [Saito's] status as Gandálfr. Ryū in this story also replaces the short, slender and lean, purple-haired, blue eyed, naive and somewhat delusional but also intellectually gifted and kind young boy training to be a Hero [Monmusume Kuesto! & Musume Hyakka Jiten] with a dream of coexistence between humans and monmosu [Musume Hyakka Jiten & Monmusume Kuesto!] who is unknowingly a Nephilim [fallen angel-human hybrid |Nephilim|] Luka Hein [Monmusume Kuesto!], \\"Luka Hein\\" [in this story] being Anglo-equivalent-Germanic-equivalent corruption of Karasuki Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] Ryū in general replaces Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu's protagonist, the tall and slender but also muscular Japanese-equivalent, black-haired, laid-back and reserved but also cunning and intelligent blue-eyed ex-assassin Kazehaya Kamito [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Ryū in this story] having Kamito's canon status as being one of the few males [Kamito in canon] to be able to form a contract with a contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Ryū in this story] having Kamito's contracted spirits of the legendary contracted spirit, the calm cool and collected and highly intellectual Restia Ashdoll [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], who [Resita] takes the form of a short and slender but also curvy and buxom, black-haired, purple-eyed Eurasian teenage girl and a a one-handed longsword with the bevels colored red in her [Restia's] sword form and Kamito's second contracted spirit, the white-haired, blue-eyed, short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, soft-spoken, reclusive and robot-like young girl Terminus Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], who [Est] takes the form of a Western-style holy sword in her [Est's] sword form, although he [Ryū in this story] of course hides this [Ryū being able to have not just one, but multiple contracted spirits] from the people around him. Ryū is [Ryū in this story] also a firebender with the ability to bend earth [Ryū in this story] due to his [Ryū's] mother, the now-deceased crown princess of the feudal Japan equivalent in the world of Seirei Gensōki, the black-haired, purple-eyed, tall and slender but also curvy and buxom, kind and loving Karasuki Ayame [Seirei Gensōki], [Ayame in this story] being [Ayame in this story] being [what Ayame was in this story before her |Ayame's| passing] a firebender [Avatar: the Last Airbender] and his [Ryū's] father, the now-deceased ex-villager turned imperial bodyguard turned adventurer after he [Ryū's father] and his [Ryū's father's] charge, [Ayame], [Ryū's father and Ayame] both [Ryū's father and Ayame] escaped from Seirei Gensōki's equivalent of Japan for their [Ryū's father and Ayame's] safety, the black-haired, gray-eyed, tall and slender, kind and determined Zen [Seirei Gensōki] being [Zen in this story] a earthbender [Avatar: the Last Airbender] due to his [Zen's] origins as [where Zen came from] a rural villager [what Zen started off as] in feudal Japan equivalent in the world of Seirei Gensōki with a very minor firebending ability. Ryū in this story of course hides the fact that he [Ryū in this story] is [Ryū in this story] a bender [Ryū in this story] from the people around him [Ryū in this story]. After rescuing a princess of the Ordesian Imperial family from kidnappers sometime after the event [Haruto's soul being |Haruto's soul| absorbed into him |Ryū|], Ryū was [Ryū] adopted into the Ordesian imperial family as an imperial prince and [Ryū] given the Ordesian name Lelouch vii Brittania [Code Geass] by the Ordesian Emperor, but most people in the [Ordesian Empire's] imperial household just call him [Ryū as Lelouch] Rio [Seirei Gensōki]. Ryū, as Lelouch later takes the identity of the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Ash Blake [Seikoku no Doragunā] when he [Ryū as Lelouch] starts attending school as an alias [Ash Blake] to try and live a normal life, although this backfires on him [Ryū as Lelouch] as Louise in this story, [Louise in this story] having deep feelings for him [Ryū as Lelouch] and [Louise in this story] wanting to be his [Ryū's as Lelouch's] wife and [Louise in this story] subsequently having his [Ryū's as Lelouch's] love children, which he [Ryū as Lelouch] is [Ryū as Lelouch] of course clueless about and [Louise in this story] subsequently manages to infiltrate the educational institute established to teach aristocratic students the art of magic, Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] despite [Louise in this story] being [Louise in this story] four years younger than him [Ryū as Lelouch], [Louise in this story] taking the name of Linda Blake [Seikoku no Doragunā] while [Louise in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic and [Louise in this story] managing to gain control of her [Louise's] control over void magic [Zero no Tsukaima] and [Louise in this story] manipulate her [Louise's in this story's] void magic into other elemental matters, [Louise in this story] using it [Louise's void magic] to [Louise in this story] pass as a half-decent water mage [Linda Blake] while [Louise in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic, although she [Louise as Linda] ends up [Louise as Linda] being put in the Ordesian Empire's prestigious all-female boarding school Areishia Spirit Academy [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] which [Areishia Spirit Academy] teaches young Ordesian noble ladies how to use their contracted spirits and [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] is [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] a division [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] of Tristain Academy of Magic after [Louise as Linda] unconciously summoning Scarlet to [Louise as Linda] beat down a male student who insulted Ash for [Ash] not having a Pal despite him [Ash] having the mark of a contractor. The excerpt should focus on Louise in this story in her disguise as Linda, who [Linda] has [Linda's] brown hair and [Linda's] amber eyes, [ Louise in this story as Linda] being selected from the line of students at Tristain Academy of Magic's P.E session to try summoning a familiar. Even though Linda's true self [Louise in this story] doesn't see the need for such a thing [having a familiar] as most of the students [at Tristain Academy of Magic] have Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] and the female students, in addition to having Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] also have contracted spirits [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] in addition to having regular magical skills but [Louise in this story] wisely keeps her [Linda's] mouth shut, [Linda] not wanting Tristain Academy of Magic's elderly, wise but also incredibly perverted and still-sharp and intelligent headmaster Osmond [Zero no Tsukaima] to discover any of her [Linda's] secrets if she [Linda] should [Linda] slip up. When Linda steps up to do the familiar summoning she [Linda] secretly moulds the void magic she [Linda] is using for the ritual into the exact type of magic needed for the summoning ritual and [Linda] then proceeds to do the ritual, even managing to form the proper runic circles for the ritual to cover her use of void magic. The ritual succeeds but the weight of Linda's secretly generous bosom strains against her [Linda's] tight school blouse, causing her [Linda] to lose concentration as she [Linda] ends it [the ritual], creating a small explosion at the end. When the smoke clears, and everyone gathers to get a closer look: people start bursting out in laughter at whom Linda's familiar is: It's Ash, who [Lelouch] was summoned from the secondary school division of Tristain Academy of Magic in this story, more specifically its [the secondary school division of Tristain Academy of Magic's] dragon riding subsection, Ansarivan Dragon Riding Academy [Seikoku no Doragunā] to the sports field of Tristain Academy of Magic's middle school division, which [Tristain Academy of Magic's middle school division] Linda is [Linda] currently a student [Linda] of. When Linda sees this [Ash being her |Linda's| familiar] she [Linda] is [Linda] secretly filled with happiness, as that means that her [Linda's] true self [Louise in this story] is [Louise in this story] closer to her [Louise's in this story's] goal of [Louise in this story] marrying his [Ash's] true self [Lelouch]. As the bond between a familiar and master requires salival contact, Linda passionately kisses him [Ash] before he [Ash] can say anything, with some of Linda's older classmates noting that the Starbrand [Seikoku no Doragunā], the mark [a Starbrand] that [a Starbrand] indicates that a human has made a contract with a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā], on his [Ash's] left-hand starts to glow when she [Linda] is [Linda] kissing him [Ash] and that Linda's eyes glow red when she [Linda] is [Linda] kissing him [Ash] as well, indicating that Linda is [Linda] somehow his [Ash's] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] despite both of them [Ash and Linda] being human. When Linda finally stops kissing Ash and pulls back, her [Linda's] cheeks red and her [Linda's] face flushed due to her [Linda's] combined embarrassment, [Linda's] happiness, and [Linda's] lustful love, some of the older students of the middle school division burst out in mocking cheers, calling him [Ash] truly a ladies' man and mockingly stating that Linda could be the bridge between human and dragon, not realizing how true their statements about Linda are. Oswald, sensing the usage of void magic around Linda for a brief moment as well as Ash fully becoming Gandálfr [Zero no Tsukaima] and the formation of a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā]-Master contract after Linda kissed him [Ash], Oswald isn't as mocking as the students, [Oswald] seeing the love in Linda's eyes as she [Linda] stares at him [Ash] and noting that the glow in her [Linda's] eyes isn't that of a human as he [Oswald] prefers to [Oswald] stay silent. Ash on the other hand is [Ash] burning in embarrassment as he [Ash] quickly works out who Linda really is [Louise in this story] due to her [Louise's in this story's] unmistakable ocular quirks and the flaming magical presence of Scarlet [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] around her [Linda], Ash quickly realizing the extent of her [Linda's] true self's [Louise's in this story's] for his [Ash's] current public true self [Lelouch], [Ash] also feeling somewhat nostalgic as he [Ash] remembers his [Ash's] past life [Haruto] and how he [Haruto] foolishly promised to be [Haruto] together forever with his childhood friend who turned out to be his [Haruto's] distant relative and his [Haruto's] fiancee in an arranged marriage, the black-haired, purple-eyed, tall and slender, but also curvy and somewhat buxom, soft and kind-hearted but also too kind for her own good Japanese imperial princess Minamoto Miharu [Seirei Gensōki], who [Miharu] had the public alias of Ayase Miharu [Seirei Gensōki] when they [Miharu and Haruto] were [Miharu and Haruto] just children just before his [Haruto's] family moved to his [Haruto's] father's hometown of Kyoto, how he [Haruto] secretly saved much of his

[Haruto] meet up with her [Ayase] again and [Haruto] seeing her [Ayase] at his [Haruto's] high school entrance ceremony, [Haruto] planning to talk to her [Ayase] before she [Ayase] disappered the day after, her [Ayase's] disapperance being treated as a suspected kidnapping and subsequent assasination by Cantonese nationalist elements of the PRC's ruling CCP with the help of anti-Japanese elements in the Russian and American intellgence community by the Japanese domestic intelligence services in later years. Her [Ayase's] disappearance devastated him [Haruto] and he [Haruto] threw himself [Haruto] into his [Haruto's] studies, becoming a star student [Haruto at high school] and having a small gang of lackeys, as well as a large harem of female admirers of all ages, which persisted even when he [Haruto] entered Tokyo University and [Haruto], was rising academically through the ranks up until his [Haruto's] death and his [Haruto's] soul crossing worlds and [Haruto's soul] being [Haruto's soul] absorbed into the then young Ryū, who [the young Ryū after |the young Ryū| absorbing Haruto's soul] was [the young Ryū after |the young Ryū| absorbing Haruto's soul] then adopted into the Ordesian imperial family, becoming Lelouch. As Ash finishes thinking about his [Ash's] past life [Haruto] and the events that made him [Haruto] into the man he [Haruto] was before his [Haruto's] death and his [Haruto's] subsequent transmigration and [Haruto's] strange reincarnation, [Ash] idly wondering if his [Haruto's] one true love [Ayase] was [Ayase] reincarnated in this world with him [Haruto] and how exactly she [Ayase] was [Ayase] reincarnated if this [Ayase being reincarnated] was true, a bold schoolmate of Linda, whose [Linda's] deep feelings for a [Linda's] beloved older brother, whom [Linda's older brother] Ash quickly realizes is him [Ash/Lelouch] are well known to the entire school by now despite her [Linda] trying to hide it, [the schoolmate] in an effort to mock and humilate the both of them [Ash and Linda]. [the schoolmate] asks if he [Ash] is [Ash] in fact her [Linda's] older brother. Before Ash can explain himself [Ash] and [Ash] clear things up, Linda kisses him [Ash] again and [Linda] loudly declares that he [Ash] is indeed her [Linda's] beloved older brother [Ash] and her [Linda's] future husband [Ash] as well and anybody having a problem with that can taste the knuckles of her [Linda's] fists as she [Linda] begins to grow flaming cat ears and a flaming cat tail, a result of Scarlet's [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] influence as Scarlet's [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] whip form appears in her [Linda's] right hand. Ash sweatdrops as he [Ash] realizes that he [Ash] inherited more than just Haruto's sword skills, academic knowledge, intellectual genius and vast knowledge in addition to martial arts techniques, he [Ash] also inherited his [Haruto's] incredible luck with the opposite sex, [Ash] reluctantly accepting that he [Ash] will most likely be a husband to multiple wives and [Ash] have multiple consorts, [Ash] having children with all of them before he [Ash] is thirty, although he [Ash] wonders if he [Ash] can get to Earth, more specifically Japan, and find out what has been happening in the Land of the Rising Sun [Japan] after his [Ash's] previous life [Haruto] before that as Restia bursts out cackling in his [Ash's] head. Ash manages to sneak away from the commotion on the sports field and [Ash] return to the high school section of Tristain Academy of Magic, [Ash] thanking the Shinto Gods for his [Ash's] previous life [Haruto] also [Haruto] learning Onmyōdō [The Way of Yin and Yang |Onmyōdō|, a traditional Nihon-jin |Japanese (Nihon-jin)| esoteric cosmology |Onmyōdō|which |Onmyōdō| is |Onmyōdō| a mixture |Onmyōdō| of |what Onmyōdō combines| natural science, exorcist style services |Onmyōdō|, |Onmyōdō| and East Asian occultism |Onmyōdō|] from his [Haruto's] grandfather before he [Haruto] returned to Tokyo to start high school and [Haruto] find Ayase as it [Haruto's Onmyōdō skills] allowed him [Ash] to escape from the sports field without [Ash] being noticed. He [Ash] does lay out a troublesome high-class noble in the fifth-form [the British equivalent of the Japanese third grade in high school] of the high school section of Tristain Academy who [the noble] seems to have discovered what happened between him [Ash] and Linda [Linda taking Ash as her |Linda's| Gandálfr and the activation of the contract between Linda and Ash that makes Linda Ash's Pal] and [the noble] decides to insult him [Ash] about it, [Ash knocking out the disrespectful noble] with a well-concealed punch to the stomach [of the noble], [Ash] quickly moving on to classes without incident as everyone thinks the noble has simply fainted. At class, Ash briefly wonders if his [Ash's] classmate at the Academy and his [Ash's] adoptive younger sister due to his [Ash's] current true self's [Ryū's] adoption by the Ordesian imperial family as Lelouch, the tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, black-haired and purple-eyed second princess of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], the soft-spoken, shy and reserved but also teasing and playful Fianna Ray Ordesia [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] who [Fianna in this story] partially replaces whom [Fianna partially replaces in this story] the purple-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, but also buxom and somewhat curvy, shy, reserved and soft-spoken, sickly fourth princess of the Kingdom of Lescarte [Musume Hyakka Jiten], Francisca Mistel [Musume Hyakka Jiten], [Fianna in this story] having her [Francisca's] first name as her [Fianna's in this story's] first name but not her [Francisca's] sickness, [Fianna in this story also replacing] the short, slender and petite, curvy and buxom, soft-spoken and reserved but also kind and caring Crown Princess of Tristian, Henrietta de Tristain [Zero no Tsukaima], [Fianna in this story] having her [ Henrietta's] first name as her [Fianna's in this story's] middle name and [Fianna in this story] having her [Henrietta's] hair color when she [Fianna in this story] gets angry or [Fianna in this story] has any other dark emotion as well as [Fianna in this story] replacing [the other character whom Fianna in this story replaces] the violet-haired, purple-haired, short, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, weak-willed, shy and reserved but also incredibly smart, strong and obstinate second princess of the canon Beltrum Kingdom in canon Seirei Gensōki, Flora Beltrum [Seirei Gensōki], [Fianna in this story] having some of her [Flora's] weak-willed and [Flora's] shy and reserved nature but [Fianna in this story] also having her [Flora's] immense intellect along with her [Flora's] strong and obstinate nature, who [Fianna in this story] is [Fianna in this story] also attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] under an alias, her [Fianna's in this story's] alias while [Fianna in this story] a student [Fianna in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] being Nina Einstein [Code Geass], which Ash finds somewhat amusing and somewhat sad due to Einstein's role in his [Ash's] previous life's [Haruto's] world [Earth], [Ash wondering if Fianna] knew about her [Fianna's] younger cousin [Louise in this story] all along and if she [Fianna in this story] also has feelings for him [both as Ash and as Lelouch] as well. The next day, Ash wakes up not in his [Ash's] familiar drab ordinary bedroom of his military-barracks-like dorm room in the section of Tristain Academy of Magic's [Zero no Tsukaima] dorm reserved for lower-class and middle-class noble heirs attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima], but what could be described in Earth terms as a medieval to 1950s era small miniature luxury apartment disguised as a bedroom, [Ash] realizing that either Louise in this story found out about his [Ash's] location from the Master-Pal contract they [Lelouch and Louise in this story] now share or [Louise in this story] learned it from Fianna in this story and either one or both of the girls [Louise in this story and Fianna in this story] decided to take him [Ash] to their dorm. He [Ash] thanks the Shinto gods and goddesses that they [Louise in this story and Fianna in this story] haven't discovered his [Ash's] secret diary which [Ash's secret diary] is entirely written in Japanese, [Ash's secret diary] describing his [Ash's] life and his [Ash's] observations. Ash feels something heavy on his stomach and [Ash] quickly removes the bedsheet, only to see Terminus Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] in her [Est's] human form sleeping soundly on top of him [Ash] without a care in the world. Realizing that this could be misinterpreted by Louise in this story and/or Fianna in this story or even any other of his [Ash's] adopted female relatives when they inevietablely walk in the room to check on him [Ash], Ash gently pushes her [Est] off him to his [Ash's] side and [Ash] quickly puts the bedsheet back over them [Ash and Est]. Which turns out to be the right decision as the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, short, slender and petite, shy, reserved and soft-spoken but publicly strong, stern and also being very competitive princess Silvia Lautreamont [Seikoku no Doragunā], who [Silvia in this fanfic] replaces [the person whom Silvia replaces in this fanfic] the short, slender and petite but also curvy and very buxom, proud and haughty but also kind and caring blonde-haired, green-eyed noble heiress, Rinslet Laurenfrost [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Silvia in this fanfic] having Rinslet's contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] Fenrir [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] a normal sized wolf [Fenrir] with water manipulating and ice manipulating abilities and [Fenrir] taking the form of an ice bow in its [Fenrir's] weapon form as well as her [Rinslet's] green eyes when she [Silvia in this fanfic] is [Silvia in this fanfic] highly emotional along with her [Rinslet's] proud and haughty but secretly kind and loving personality, [Silvia in this fanfic] using her [Rinslet's] name as an alias while [Silvia in this fanfic] attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima], who [Silvia in this fanfic] is [Silvia in this fanfic] Fianna's biological older-half sister [Silvia in this fanfic] and Louise's in this story's older cousins [Silvia in this fanfic] along with [Silvia in this fanfic] being [Silvia in this fanfic] one of Lelouch's adoptive younger sisters [Silvia in this fanfic], [Silvia in this fanfic] and her [Silvia's in this fanfic's] de jure maid and de-facto bodyguard, the tall, slender and buxom, black-haired, gray-eyed, kind and soft-hearted but also very competent and skilled in both housework, the culinary arts and combat arts and espionage, Carol Nastassha [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Silvia and Carol] both [Silvia and Carol] walk in. Ash then realises he [Ash] is in Silvia's bedroom. Ash is able to successfully hide Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being [Est] with him [Ash] on the bed, allowing Carol to explain away the movements Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] makes as she [Est] snuggles up to him [Ash] to a suspicious Siliva in this story as something men have in the mornings, which makes Silvia even more determined to perform her [Silvia's] \\"wively duties\\", causing him [Ash] to realize that she [Silvia] also loves him [Ash] as more than a brother [Lelouch, both as himself |Lelouch| and as Ash as well] too. After Silvia and Carol both [Silvia and Carol] leave after the former [Silvia] reminds him [Ash] to bathe and come down for breakfast, Ash removes the bedsheet and [Ash] successfully convinces Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] to [Est] wake up before both girls [Silvia and Carol] return and [Silvia and Carol] see him [Ash] with her [Est]. After [Ash] bathing with Est and [Ash] finding one of Silvia's old uniforms for her [Est] to wear, [Ash] comes down for breakfast, [Ash] passing her [Est] off as a weak familiar spirit with the ability to take a human form, although Carol's sharp eyes note how tightly she [Est] clings to his [Ash's] arm and the way how she [Est] refers to him [Ash] as her [Est's] older brother as she [Est] stares at him [Ash] with a wistful, blushing look on her [Est's] face. Silvia then clears her throat and [Silvia in this fanfic] reveals that she [Silvia in this fanfic] knows what happened the previous day [Louise as Linda summoning Lelouch as Ash as her |Louise's| familiar and |Louise as Linda| subsequently making him |Lelouch| into her |Louise's| Gandálfr and Louise becoming his |Lelouch's| Pal] and that she [Silvia] would also like to be his [Lelouch's] wife as well, since a human making a dragon of the Albion Imperial Family a Pal makes them [the human and the dragon] spouses.

Scene 2: Enter Benedick and Margaret. BENEDICK Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice. MARGARET Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty? 5 BENEDICK In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it, for in most comely truth thou deservest it. MARGARET To have no man come over me? Why, shall I always keep below stairs? 10 BENEDICK Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth; it catches. MARGARET And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils, which hit but hurt not. BENEDICK A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt 15 a woman. And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers. MARGARET Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own. BENEDICK If you use them, Margaret, you must put in 20 the pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for maids. MARGARET Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.

In Act 5 Scene 2 of \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" Shakespeare employs a playful interplay of wit between Margaret and Benedick, which serves as a comedic representation of the battle of the sexes often underpinning romantic relationships. This exchange showcases the ongoing theme of verbal sparring found throughout the play, which mirrors the rocky road to love that even contemporary audiences can relate to. Shakespeare uses wit as his comedic device, as seen in the lines, \\"Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth; it catches\\" (12-13). Benedick humorously compliments Margaret's sharpness, subtly acknowledging the power of a woman's intelligence and humor in the game of love. This acknowledgement speaks volumes about the respect each gender holds for the other's mental agility, something that remains important in the dynamics of modern relationships. The banter between Margaret and Benedick is rife with figurative language and poetic devices, including an amusing simile comparing Margaret's wit to a swift greyhound. Meanwhile, Benedick's struggle to express his feelings in verse humorously highlights character development, as he juxtaposes his lack of poetic skill with his profound experience of love, saying, \\"I cannot show it in rhyme... No, I was not born under a rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms\\" (35, 40-41). This illustrates Benedick's evolution from a scornful bachelor into a man earnestly grappling with emotions that defy his past mockery of romance. As such, Shakespeare's portrayal of Benedick's candid and comedic admission serves as an endearing addition to the plot structure and deepens our understanding of his transformation. The witty interaction not only humanizes the characters, making them more relatable to a modern audience, but it also punctuates the thematic lesson that love, in its purest form, transcends the need for perfect prose or grand gestures; honesty and humor go a long way in encapsulating the sincerity of one's sentiments. Therefore, while Shakespeare's world seems remote, the social commentaries and human experiences his play encapsulates resonate enduringly with a universal audience."},{"instruction":"\\"I po co strzelasz fochy?\\" Explique le sens de „strzelasz fochy” en français de manière plus détaillée","output":"En polonais, l'expression \\"strzelić focha\\" signifie littéralement \\"tirer un caprice\\".

Now, if we add together the numbers from ten to thirty-five, we get the total number of letters: The sum of the numbers from ten to thirty-five inclusive can be found by calculating the sum of an arithmetic sequence. Since there are twenty-six numbers in this sequence, the average of the first and last numbers is ( (10 + 35) / 2 = 22.5 ), and multiplying this by the number of terms gives us the sum: Sum = ( 22.5 times 26 ) To express this without mathematical symbols: - Twenty-two and a half times twenty-six equals five hundred and eighty-five.

No bullet points, number point, etc.] What is a nation according to the Bible?","output":"In the Bible, the concept of a \\"nation\\" can carry a variety of meanings depending on the context. Broadly speaking, the term often relates to a group of people who are considered a community or collective sharing a common ancestry, language, culture, or faith. Different books of the Bible approach the idea in distinct ways. In the Old Testament, nations are frequently referenced with regard to the descendants of Noah after the flood, as seen in the Table of Nations in Genesis 10, which outlines the genealogies of his sons and the nations that emerged from them. These divisions are not necessarily political entities as we understand nations today but are more akin to large extended families or tribes. The nation of Israel holds a central place in the Old Testament as the chosen people of God, with its origin tracing back to the covenant made with Abraham. Here, a nation is understood not only as a people with a shared lineage but also as one with a particular religious identity and relationship with God. The laws, customs, and history captured in the Bible are often specific to this nation and are meant to set it apart from other nations as a holy community. The idea also extends to other ethnic groups that the Israelites interacted with, such as the Philistines, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Persians. These groups are considered nations in their own right, with distinct cultures and identities. In the New Testament, the concept of a nation is extended beyond Israel to include Gentiles (non-Jews). Jesus Christ's Great Commission, as stated in the Gospel of Matthew (28:19-20), calls for his disciples to go and make disciples of \\"all nations,\\" indicating an inclusive approach to evangelism that reaches across ethnic and cultural boundaries. Furthermore, the Apostle Paul talks about the barrier between Jew and Gentile being broken down in Christ, suggesting a spiritual kind of nationhood that supersedes traditional ethnic or political boundaries. This idea leads to the concept of a universal Church, which comprises believers from every nation under heaven. Thus, in the biblical sense, \\"nation\\" is a fluid term that encompasses various sociopolitical and spiritual concepts, often used to signify large groups of people related by kinship, culture, and shared beliefs, as well as a designator for the broader mission field of the Christian faith."},{"instruction":"What is Tiao-kuai in China?","output":"In China, the term \\"tiao-kuai\\" (条块) is used to describe a structure or pattern of governance or organization, delineating the relationship between vertical administrative units and horizontal functional units. The term is often translated as \\"vertical and horizontal\\" in English and is crucial in understanding Chinese political and bureaucratic dynamics. \\"Tiao\\" (条) refers to the vertical, line authority that stretches from the central government down to local governments. This usually represents sectorial or ministerial lines of authority that are responsible for specific administrative tasks or domains across all levels of government. On the other hand, \\"kuai\\" (块) represents the horizontal or block authority at each geographic level, such as a province, city, or county. This aspect deals with the integrated governance at each particular level, taking care of all local matters within their jurisdiction. The tiao-kuai system reflects the dual structure within Chinese governance where ministries and commissions under the State Council (China's chief administrative authority) exercise their functions and powers vertically throughout the country, but must also work within the local territorial framework where the local government (the \\"kuai\\") operates with a degree of autonomy. This system can sometimes lead to complex interactions and even conflicts of interest, as the vertical departments want to impose their policies and priorities across the nation, while local governments have their own agendas and may prioritize local issues differently.

Критическое значение Z для 95% уровня доверия (округлено до двух знаков): 1.96 5. Нижняя граница доверительного интервала: 37 - 1.96 * (3.4 / √200) ≈ 36.55 6. Верхняя граница доверительного интервала: 37 + 1.96 * (3.4 / √200) ≈ 37.45 Ответы: 1. Доверительный интервал равен 36.55 - 37.45 2.

Для 95% доверительного интервала стандартное нормальное распределение покрывает 95% площади под кривой. Таким образом, оставшиеся 5% значений находятся в хвостах распределения. Поскольку стандартное нормальное распределение симметрично относительно среднего значения 0, 2.5% значений находятся в каждом из хвостов. Значение Z для 95% доверительного интервала составляет примерно 1.96 (точное значение 1.96, но часто округляется до двух знаков после запятой). Это означает, что 95% значений находятся в интервале (-1.96, 1.96) от среднего значения.

Такие альтернативные взгляды часто оказываются полезными, так как они заставляют исследователей заново проанализировать источники и продумать традиционные интерпретации. Однако, вопрос обоснованности выводов любого исторического труда зависит от следующего: 1. **Источники:** Какова основа для аргументов автора? Пользуется ли автор надежными, первичными источниками, и правильно ли он их интерпретирует? 2. **Способ аргументации:** Логично ли автор строит свою линию рассуждений? Существуют ли логические ошибки в его аргументации? 3. **Контекст и сравнение с другими работами:** Как выводы автора соотносятся с уже установленными интерпретациями? Празднует ли или опровергает их Понасенков? 4. **Прием сообществом:** Как его работа была встречена академическим сообществом? Поддержали ли другие ученые его выводы или они столкнулись с критикой? 5. **Критический анализ:** Важно подходить к любым выводам критически, учитывая возможные предвзятости или ограничения висследовании. Область истории часто подвержена различным интерпретациям, и даже казалось бы устоявшиеся события могут быть осмыслены по-новому в свете открытия новых данных или возникновения новых методологий в исследовании.

В случае Евгения Понасенкова и его книги \\"История войны 1812 года\\" некоторые потенциальные предвзятости или особенности подхода, которые могут влиять на его выводы, включают: 1. **Ревизионизм:** Понасенков известен своим ревизионистским подходом к оценке исторических событий, что означает пересмотр установленных взглядов. Ревизионисты могут быть предвзяты против традиционного наратива до такой степени, что выборочно используют информацию, подтверждающую их собственную теорию, игнорируя данные, которые ей противоречат. 2. **Подход к первоисточникам:** Если критики указывают, что в его исследованиях есть селективное использование источников, это может указывать на наличие предвзятости, при которой автор фокусируется только на документах, подтверждающих его тезисы. 3. **Личные убеждения:** Любой автор подходит к истории со своим набором убеждений и предпосылок, что может повлиять на интерпретацию событий. Часто трудно полностью избежать субъективности, и это субъективное влияние может проявляться в предвзятости. 4. **Контркультурный наратив:** Понасенков может пытаться противопоставить свой наратив общепринятому, что может привести к созданию более контрокультурной, возможно спорной, интерпретации событий. Для полноценного анализа предвзятостей критики и историки должны тщательно экзаменовать и сопоставить его работу с другими исследованиями, оценить достоверность и полноту использованных им доказательств, и рассмотреть, не упускает ли автор важные точки зрения или контексты. Стоит также учитывать, что обнаружение потенциальной предвзятости не обязательно дискредитирует все аргументы в работе.

For the sake of this example, I'll focus on the theme of the complexity of love and how it's conveyed through comedy in the play. Claim (topic sentence): In \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" Shakespeare employs the comedic device of wit to showcase the intricate dance of love, a theme that reveals how affection and intelligence intertwine as potential lovers joust with words before succumbing to their true feelings. Paragraph: In Shakespeare's \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" the comedic device of wit is not merely a source of laughter but also an instrument to explore the complex nature of love, which reveals the interplay of affection and intellect. This is exemplified in Act 5, Scene 2, where Benedick and Margaret engage in a playful battle of words that mirrors the larger skirmishes of the heart present throughout the play. Benedick’s promise to write a sonnet for Margaret is met with a sharp retort, “To have no man come over me? Why, shall I always keep below stairs?” (9-10). Margaret's pun on 'coming over' her, which in Elizabethan times could suggest sexual conquest, jestingly implies that she has no desire to be an object of idle praise or to remain unacknowledged. Her jest is a subtle indication of the desires and empowerment of women, wrapped in the guise of humor to make it palatable for Shakespeare's audience. This exchange, a dance of domination and deference, unveils the intimate relationship between language and courtship, where the challenge of wit stands in for the larger challenge of connecting deeply with another. The playful repartee between the characters, rich in figurative language and dexterous wordplay, not only serves as entertainment but also as a microcosm of love's intricate dance, where verbal fencing masquerades deeper emotions and attraction. In the end, Benedick's humorous resignation, \\"I was not born under a rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms\\" (40-41), underscores the thematic idea that sincerity in love often transcends the artifice of eloquence. This moment encapsulates the essence of the play's romantic philosophy: that true love is found not in grandiose declarations but in the genuine connection and understanding that emerges from playful yet earnest communication. Such wit, light-hearted on the surface, conceals layers of social commentary and insight into the human condition, which resonates just as profoundly with modern audiences as it did with those of the Elizabethan era. Remember to adjust this model paragraph to fit directly into your specific assignment context and to cite the line numbers accurately according to the edition of the play you are using. This example is also intended as a template to craft your own original analysis while adhering to your teacher’s instructions and the rubric provided."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

I have not received a satisfactory response to my requests for comprehensive compensation, and I kindly request your immediate attention to this matter. As stated in my previous emails, my claim primarily concerns the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank and 200 shares of State Bank of India, which are part of Claim No. 917/370. The default date for the Karvy scam is 23rd November 2020. I urge SEBI to promptly review my claim for these shares and ensure that appropriate compensation is provided for the losses incurred. Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the compensation offered for my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited. While I appreciate the efforts made by SEBI and the BSE in addressing this issue, I believe that the compensation offered thus far does not adequately reflect the value of the shares as of the default date i.e 23rd November 2020. Therefore, I kindly request SEBI to reconsider and increase the compensation provided for these shares. Additionally, I recently became aware of the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, which deals with representations made by investors regarding relief/disposal of securities sub-judice before the Hon’ble SAT. I understand that this committee has been informed that securities under litigation would be valued at the closing price as on the date of default/expulsion. It has also been mentioned that the interim relief provided would be within the overall limit of Rs.25 lakhs per investor’s claim. Please note that this request for compensation of my shares is a temporary relief, subject to the final decision of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the Karvy scam case. I understand that the final resolution will be based on the SAT’s order, and I am prepared to abide by their decision. Considering this information, I kindly request SEBI to take into account the guidelines provided by the MCSGFC of NSEIL in the valuation and compensation of my outstanding shares in the Karvy scam. It is crucial to ensure that the compensation provided aligns with the closing prices as of the default date and falls within the overall limit specified. I understand that SEBI and the relevant authorities are working tirelessly to resolve the Karvy scam and compensate affected investors. However, it is crucial to expedite the process and ensure that all outstanding claims, including mine, are addressed promptly and fairly. I kindly request SEBI to prioritize my claim for the outstanding shares of Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India, as well as the reconsideration of compensation for my Reliance Industries Limited shares. If there are any further actions or documentation required from my end, please let me know, and I will promptly provide the necessary information. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that the return of my Reliance Industries Limited shares is of utmost importance to me. I believe that the rightful ownership of these shares should be restored, rather than receiving monetary compensation. I kindly request SEBI to give due consideration to this request and take necessary actions to facilitate the return of my shares. Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt and satisfactory resolution that ensures comprehensive compensation for the losses incurred by investors in the Karvy scam. Regards, GAURI SHANKER 8896462887 It seems like you have drafted a detailed letter to SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) to address your concerns regarding the Karvy stock brokerage scam and your outstanding claim for shares in Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, and Reliance Industries Limited. Your letter includes a request for an update on your claim, a reassessment of the offered compensation, and the return of shares rather than monetary compensation. Here are a few points to consider: 1. Follow-up Procedures: Ensure you have followed all the necessary procedures for communication with SEBI. This may include sending letters through registered mail or email and using the designated portals or contact methods for investors to lodge grievances. 2. Keep Records: It is important to keep detailed records of all correspondence with SEBI regarding your claim, including the claim number, dates of correspondence, and any other relevant details. 3. Legal Counsel: If you haven’t done so already, you may want to seek legal counsel to help navigate the complexities of this situation, especially considering the involvement of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) and specific guidelines provided by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL. 4. Alternative Channels: Besides sending letters, consider exploring alternative channels such as the SEBI Complaints Redress System (SCORES), which is SEBI’s online platform for investors to lodge and follow up on their complaints against listed companies and SEBI-registered intermediaries. 5. Other Affected Investors: In cases like the Karvy scam, there may be associations or forums of affected investors. It could be beneficial to join such groups to collectively voice concerns and stay updated on any developments. 6. Regularity of Follow-ups: Regular and persistent follow-ups are important to keep your claim active. Make sure you consistently seek updates and information on the progress of the resolution process. Your letter seems comprehensive, covering the key issues and concerns you have. However, it is imperative that you align this action with any advice provided by your attorney or financial advisor, who will be more familiar with the specifics of your individual case and the broader context of the Karvy scam’s resolution efforts. Please note that if further action is required, you should proceed as per the guidance of SEBI and your legal counsel, and ensure that any advice received online or elsewhere does not conflict with their instructions. then this Subject: Urgent: Follow-up on SEBI Complaint No: SEBIE/MH23/0009530/1 - Request for Comprehensive Review and Reconsideration Dear SEBI Team, I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to urgently follow up on my previously filed complaint with SEBI under Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0009530/1, which pertains to the outstanding shares in the Karvy scam, specifically under BSE Claim No. 917/370. I appreciate the acknowledgment received from your end, and I understand that scrutiny of my review claim is currently underway. However, considering the urgency and gravity of the matter, I wish to reiterate the key concerns outlined in my initial complaint and request your immediate attention to the following points: 1. Outstanding Shares of Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India: My claim primarily revolves around the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank and 200 shares of State Bank of India, as part of BSE Claim No. 917/370. Given the default date of the Karvy scam on 23rd November 2020, I urge SEBI to promptly review my claim for these shares and ensure appropriate compensation is provided for the losses incurred. 2. Reconsideration of Compensation for Reliance Industries Limited Shares: While I acknowledge the efforts made by SEBI and BSE, I believe that the compensation offered for my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited does not adequately reflect their value as of the default date. I kindly request SEBI to reconsider and increase the compensation provided for these shares. 3. Guidelines from the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL: I recently became aware of the guidelines provided by the MCSGFC of NSEIL, which specify that securities under litigation would be valued at the closing price as on the date of default/expulsion. It has been mentioned that interim relief provided would be within the overall limit of Rs.25 lakhs per investor’s claim. I request SEBI to take these guidelines into account in the valuation and compensation of my outstanding shares in the Karvy scam. I understand the complexities involved in resolving the Karvy scam and compensating affected investors. However, I believe it is crucial to expedite the process and ensure that all outstanding claims, including mine, are addressed promptly and fairly. If there are any further actions or documentation required from my end, please let me know, and I will promptly provide the necessary information. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that the return of my shares is of utmost importance to me, and I request SEBI to give due consideration to this request. Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt and satisfactory resolution that ensures comprehensive compensation for the losses incurred by investors in the Karvy scam. Best Regards, Gauri Shanker 8896462887 Enclosure- Enclosed with this email, please find the reply received from BSE on 31-10-23, confirming the acknowledgment of my complaint and providing an update on the ongoing scrutiny. I believe this information may assist SEBI in expediting the review process. Your follow-up email to SEBI seems to be a concise reiteration of your previous correspondence, with a focus on the aforementioned concerns regarding the outstanding shares from the Karvy scam. You’ve outlined the primary areas of your claim, requested a comprehensive review and reconsideration of compensation, and provided additional information concerning the guidelines set forth by the MCSGFC of NSEIL. A few additional points to consider: 1. Reference Previous Communications: Make sure to reference all previous communications, including any reference numbers, to help the SEBI team quickly bring up the history of your complaint. 2. Enclosures: As mentioned, ensure that any enclosures, such as the acknowledgment from BSE, are correctly attached to your email. These documents can provide important context and evidence to support your claims. 3. Clarity and Brevity: While detail is important, ensure your email is as clear and concise as possible. This can help the SEBI team understand your situation quickly and act accordingly. 4. Follow-Up Schedule: Establish a follow-up schedule if this isn’t your first communication regarding the issue. Regular, but reasonable, intervals for follow-ups can help keep your claim active without being overwhelming. 5. Request a Timeline: It may be beneficial to ask for an estimated timeline for the completion of the review, so you have an idea of when to expect a response. Remember, while your situation is urgent and important, regulatory bodies like SEBI often have procedures that take time. Continue to be persistent but patient. It’s also crucial to keep all records of your interactions with SEBI, and any other regulatory or judicial bodies, in a safe and organized manner. received this as reply Claim of Mr. GAURI SHANKER in the matter of Karvy Stock Broking Limited, defaulter is already reviewed.

Therefore, complaint disposed of. The response you received indicates that there was a review of your claim in the matter involving Karvy Stock Broking Limited. From the information provided, it appears that SEBI or the relevant authority has decided the following: 1. Claims Regarding PNB & SBI Shares Rejected: Your claim for the non-receipt of shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and State Bank of India (SBI) has been rejected on the grounds of being time-barred, meaning the claim was filed too late – three years after the date of the relevant transactions. 2. Claims Regarding RIL Shares Admitted: The claim regarding the non-receipt of 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has been admitted and compensation has been awarded from the Investor Protection Fund (IPF). They have compensated you with Rs. 16,200/- based on the buy price as per the norms. 3. Closure Recommended: The response suggests that based on the review and the actions taken (compensation for the RIL shares), the authority is recommending closure, and the complaint has been disposed of. Given these developments, if you believe that the decision is not satisfactory or you dispute the reasons provided (for instance, whether the filing of the claim was indeed time-barred or whether the compensation amount is adequate), you may want to consider the following steps: 1. Immediate Response: Draft an immediate response expressing any objections you have to the rejection of your claim for the PNB & SBI shares or to the amount of compensation awarded for the RIL shares. Be specific about why you believe the decision should be reconsidered. 2. Legal Advice: Obtain legal advice to understand the options available to you. This may involve challenging the decision or seeking a legal remedy through courts or arbitration, depending on the circumstances and the available evidence. 3. Statutes of Limitation: Investigate the statutes of limitation that were applied to your case. Consult with a legal expert to determine if there are exceptions or provisions that would allow your claim for the PNB & SBI shares to be reconsidered despite the stated time limits. 4. Detailed Justification: If you decide to challenge the decision, ensure that you provide a detailed justification for why the rejection of your claims is incorrect or why the compensation is insufficient. This may include providing evidence of timely action on your part or presenting arguments for a higher valuation of the RIL shares. 5. Regulatory Appeal: If you believe SEBI’s decision may have been misinformed or unfair, look into the possibility of appealing to the appropriate regulatory appeal bodies, such as the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). This response seems to be the conclusion of the review of your claim. However, if you believe that the resolution is incomplete or incorrect, it’s important to act swiftly within the guidelines established for appeals or further claims. this is SAT order can this is relevant for my reply making \\"BEFORE THE SECURITIES APPELLATE TRIBUNAL MUMBAI Date of Hearing: 08.05.2023 Date of Decision: 07.06.2023 Misc.

CORAM: Justice Tarun Agarwala, Presiding Officer Ms. Meera Swarup, Technical Member Per: Justice Tarun Agarwala, Presiding Officer 1. For the reasons stated in the application, the delay in the filing of Appeal no.366 of 2023 is condoned. The application is allowed. 2. Even though different orders have been passed by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee of the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘Committee’), the issue involved is common and, accordingly, these three appeals are being decided together. 3. In all these appeals the claim of the appellants for receiving compensation under the Investor Protection 4 Fund (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPF’) has been rejected/disallowed on the ground that there has been no transaction in the trading account for more than 24 months and, therefore, the deposit with the defaulter is in respect of a loan with or without security. 4. In Appeal No.366 of 2023, Ms. Anupama Parashar vs. NSE, Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. was the broker and trading member of NSE. On 23rd November, 2020, Karvy was expelled under Rule 1 and Rule 2 of Chapter IV of the Rules of the Exchange and Byelaw (1) of Chapter XII of Byelaw (1) of Byelaws of the Exchange. 5. On 7th March, 2022, the said appellant lodged a claim for Rs.6,35,039.10 for compensation under the Investors Protection Fund. The Committee rejected the claim on the ground that there had been no trading activity for more than 24 months. 5 6. In Appeal no.441 of 2023, the claim was for Rs.34,80,065.60 from the Investor Protection Fund on account of Karvy being declared a defaulter. The claim was lodged on 9th January, 2021 which was found to be inadmissible by an order of 29th June, 2021. A review was filed which was again rejected on 29th June, 2021. A second review application was filed on 6th September, 2021 which was dismissed as not maintainable. The appellant thereafter filed Appeal no.130 of 2023 which was allowed and by an order dated 2nd February, 2023, this Tribunal directed the Committee to decide the review application within four weeks. Based on the directions, the Committee passed the impugned order rejecting the claim on the ground that no trading activity had taken place by the appellant during 24 months from the date when Karvy had become a defaulter. 6 7. In Appeal no.248 of 2023, Vikrant Leasing Ltd. vs. NSE, the broker/trading member of NSE was BMA Wealth Creators Ltd., who was declared a defaulter on 13th February, 2020. The said appellant lodged a claim for Rs.35,50,750 on 6th July, 2020 which claim was found to be inadmissible by an order dated 12th January, 2021. A review application was filed which has been rejected by the impugned order dated 6th January, 2023 on the ground that no transaction was executed by the appellant on the stock exchange platform for more than 24 months. 8.

In order to decide the aforesaid controversy it would be essential to peruse the Bye-laws and the circulars issued from time to time. 10. SEBI issued a circular dated 28th October, 2004 stipulating that the Central Government vide notification dated 22nd August, 1985 had stipulated the setting up of an Investor Protection Fund by the stock exchange. The said notification further contemplated to create a compensation fund to take care of the legitimate investment claims which are not of speculative nature of the clients of defaulting member. 8 Clause 12 of Annexure 1 to this circular dated 28th October, 2004 provided as under: “12. The claims received against the defaulter members during the specified period shall be eligible for compensation from the IPF/CPF.” 11. The aforesaid indicates that claims received against defaulting members would be eligible for compensation under IPF. Chapter XII of the Bye-laws of NSE deals with a declaration of a trading member as a defaulter and the procedure that is required to be followed. Bye-law 24 of Chapter XII provides that certain claims against a defaulter cannot be entertained by the Defaulter’s Committee. For facility, Clause 24 of Chapter XII is extracted hereunder: “Certain claims cannot be entertained 24. The Defaulters’ Committee shall not entertain any claim against a defaulter: (a) which arises out of a contract in securities dealings in which are not permitted or which are not made subject to Bye Laws, Rules and Regulations of the Exchange or in which the claimant has either not paid 9 himself or colluded with the defaulter in evasion of margin payable on bargains in any security; (b) [deleted] © which arises from any arrangement for settlement of claims in lieu of bona fide money payment in full on the day when such claims become due; (d) which is in respect of a loan with or without security; (e) which is not filed with the Defaulters’ Committee within such time of date of declaration of default as may be prescribed by the relevant authority.” A perusal of Clause (d) of the Bye-law 24 indicates that claims in respect of a loan with or without security will not be entertained by the Defaulter’s Committee. 12. Chapter XIII of the Bye-laws provides that where a trading member’s constituent suffers a loss from the said trading member being declared as a defaulter by the Exchange under Chapter XII then no claim of a claimant shall be eligible for compensation from IPF 10 unless he has acted as a constituent of the said trading member to the extent permitted by the Exchange. In effect, a constituent of a defaulter if he is unable to get a claim under Chapter XII then he can apply for compensation under the IPF subject to the eligibility of his claim. Clause 8 of Chapter XIII provides that a claim for compensation filed by a constituent would be processed in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Defaulter’s Committee and if the assets of the defaulter are insufficient to meet the approved claims, it shall forward the claims along with the recommendations of the Defaulters’ Committee to the Trust. 13. SEBI issued a circular dated 23rd February, 2017. Clause ‘D’ of the said circular relates to admissibility of the claim for making payment out of IPF in the stock exchange. This Clause D is extracted hereunder: “(D). Admissibility of claim for making payment out of IPF in Stock Exchanges 11 In the event of default by the member, all transactions executed on exchange platform shall be eligible for settlement from IPF (subject to maximum limit), subject to the appropriate norms laid down by the Defaulters’ Committee.” 14. The aforesaid provisions provides that in the event of default by a member, all transactions executed on exchange platform shall be eligible for settlement from IPF (subject to maximum limit), subject to the appropriate norms laid down by the Defaulters’ Committee. From the aforesaid two things are relevant, namely, (i) One that all transactions must be executed on the exchange platform. (ii) Claim would be subject to the appropriate norms laid down by the Defaulters’ Committee. 15. One of the norms/procedure laid down by the Defaulter’s Committee is found in the minutes of the 35th meeting of Defaulter’s Committed dated 2nd July, 12 2010 which laid down certain guidelines as to how a transaction is to be treated as a loan transaction or not under Bye-law 24 of Chapter XII of the Bye-laws of NSE. For facility, item no.4 of the minutes which relates to the guidelines for loan transaction is extracted hereunder: “Item No.4 To consider and approve the guidelines for loan transactions. The Committee noted that The Defaulters’ Committee is empowered under Byelaw 24 of Chapter XII of the Byelaws of NSEIL not to entertain certain claims against a defaulter and Bye-Law 24(d) further provides that Defaulters’ Committee shall not entertain claims in respect of a loan with or without security. The Committee deliberated on the nature of claims which could be construed as transactions in the nature of loan and thereafter decided that for the purpose of processing of claims following could be considered as broad guidelines in assessing a claim as loan with or without security. 1. Where the claimant has given funds to the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after entering into an agreement with the defaulter and from the 13 available records it is evident that the defaulter had passed on credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of interest; 2. Where the claimant has given securities to the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after entering into an agreement with the defaulter and from the available records it is evident that the defaulter had passed on credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of interest; 3. Where the claimant has made payment to the defaulter despite having substantial credit balance with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after such payment; 4. Where the claimant has delivered securities to the defaulter despite having substantial credit balance with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after such payment; 5. Where the claimant has made payment and/or delivered securities to the defaulter with the express understanding that the defaulter would in turn give fixed return on funds and/or securities so given as the case may be as evidenced in the correspondent by the claimant or defaulter to the 14 Defaulters’ Committee or in the correspondent between the claimant and the defaulter and vice versa. 6. Where the defaulter has given credits to the claimant against the funds and/or securities provided by the claimant to the defaulter as evidenced from the available records that the defaulter had passed on these credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of interest as the same are in excess of the value of the trades executed on the Exchange; 7. Where the claimant has deposited substantial amounts of funds and/or securities with the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for the amounts which are proportionate to the value of the amounts of funds and/or securities deposited; 8. Where the claimant has failed to withdraw the credit balance and/or securities from the defaulter for a substantial period of time without any trading activity or substantially meager trading disproportionate in value to the quantum of the trade balance or securities lying with the defaulter; 9. Where the claimant has given funds and/or securities to the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade and the trades have been executed in the Futures and Options segment of the Exchange but for which trades corresponding evidence of utilization of funds deposited is not 15 apparent from the records furnished by the claimant. The Committee also decided that the above guidelines are generic in nature and the conclusion would further depend on documents submitted by each of the claimants and hence, Committee would ultimately take a view of every claim based on the above guidelines and the relevant documents.” 16. These guidelines provides that where a claimant has given funds or securities to the defaulter with an intention to trade but has not executed any trade for a substantial period of time and from the available records it is found that the defaulter has passed on credits which may be construed in the nature of payment of interest then such fund/interest given by the claimant will be treated as a loan under Chapter XII of the Bye-laws. Item no.8 of the guidelines further provides that where a claimant has failed to withdraw the credit balance and/or securities from the defaulter for a substantial period of time without any trading 16 activity then the said deposit of funds/securities would be treated as a loan. 17. In addition to the above, in the 56th minutes of the meeting of the Defaulter’s Committee held on 9th June, 2015 that the word ‘substantial period’ was clarified to mean 24 months prior to the date of expulsion. Subsequently, in the 59th minutes of the Defaulter’s Committee dated 28th August, 2015 the word ‘substantial period’ was further clarified to mean 24 months from the date of withdrawal of trading facility prior to expulsion or declaration of defaulter. 18. Thus, if any fund or security is deposited with a defaulter with the intention to trade but if the claimant has not traded for 24 months from the date of withdrawal of trading facility prior to expulsion or declaration of defaulter, then such deposit of funds/securities of the claimant would be treated as a loan but the same has to be supported by evidence that 17 the defaulter has passed on credits which may be construed to be a payment in the nature of interest. 19. NSE issued a circular dated 7th July, 2021, coming out with a policy for evaluation of claims. Annexure ‘A’ to this circular provides for claims for non-receipt for funds and securities where the client has entered into an agreement/understanding. For facility, the said clause from Annexure ‘A’ to the circular dated 7th July, 2021 is extracted hereunder: “Claims for non-receipt of funds and securities where the client has entered into an agreement/understanding: Where the claimant has given funds and/or securities to the defaulter member by executing an undertaking or with an understanding that defaulter would in turn generate assured return on funds and/or securities so given as the case may be as evidenced in the correspondence by the claimant or defaulter or in the correspondence between the claimant and the defaulter and vice versa where the defaulter may or may not have passed on credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of return, such claims would not be considered admissible. 18 Notwithstanding the above, the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) may in exceptional cases, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, consider as eligible for processing applications received from the investors, which may not be in line with the methodology set out herein. Further, below mentioned claims against the defaulter/expelled member shall not be accepted by the Exchange. (a) which arises out of a contract in securities dealings which are not permitted, or which are not made subject to Bye-Laws, Rules and Regulations of the Exchange; (b) which arises from any arrangement for settlement of claims in lieu of bona fide money payment in full on the day when such claims become due; © which is in respect of a loan with or without security; (d) which is not filed with the Defaulters’ Committee (MCSGFC) within such time of the date of declaration of default as may be prescribed by the relevant authority; (e) Claims of associate persons (f) Claims not supported by adequate documents in respect of payments made to/received from trading member and also securities delivered/received, etc. 19 (g) Claims for trades that are not executed on the Exchange. (h) Claims of investors whose unique client codes are not registered with Exchange. (i) Claim for damages/harassment/miscellaneous charges (j) Claim for the interest on the amount claimed (k) Loss emanating from delayed delivery of securities. (l) Subscription/redemption of units under MFSS (Mutual Fund Service System) platform, trades executed on SLB (Securities Lending and Borrowing). (m) Sham, non-genuine and collusive transactions. (n) Claims lodged by Authorised Persons for return of security deposit/refund of brokerage/commission. (o) Claims lodged by persons associated with the defaulting Trading member against whom disciplinary action has been taken by the regulator/relevant authority vide their orders. § Any other criteria/condition, which in the opinion of the MCSGFC renders the claim as ineligible, based on the facts of the case.” 20 20. The aforesaid circular clearly indicates that where funds and securities generate assured returns, then such claim would not be considered admissible as depicted from Clause (a) to § and will not be entertained. However, the CORE Committee in exceptional circumstances depending on the facts and circumstance of the case, consider the claim to be eligible. 21. In the light of the aforesaid Bye-laws, circulars and norms laid down by the stock exchange, we find that in the instant case there is no trading activity of the appellants for a substantial period of time and, in any case, there has been no trading activity for more than 24 months from the date of withdrawal of trading facility prior to expulsion or declaration of the defaulter. Consequently, in our opinion, the claim is not admissible under Bye-law 24D of the Chapter XII of the Bye-laws of NSE as the claim was in respect of 21 a loan since there has been no transaction for a substantial period of more than 24 months. Thus, the impugned order does not suffer from any error of law. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. In the circumstances of the case, parties shall bear their own costs. 22. This order will be digitally signed by the Private Secretary on behalf of the bench and all concerned parties are directed to act on the digitally signed copy of this order. Certified copy of this order is also available from the Registry on payment of usual charges. Justice Tarun Agarwala Presiding Officer Ms. Meera Swarup Technical Member 7.6.2023 RHN: The order by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) that you’ve provided is quite detailed and contains specifics of legal reasoning regarding similar cases involving claims for compensation from the Investor Protection Fund (IPF). Given the circumstances in your claim rejection notice, this SAT order may indeed provide relevant information that could be useful for crafting a response or an appeal. The SAT order appears to discuss a few key points that are relevant to your situation: 1. Claims against Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. and other defaulters for compensation under the IPF. 2. Eligibility criteria for compensation, specifically highlighting that there must be trading activity within a certain period (24 months as mentioned in the order) for a claim to be considered. 3. The definition of transactions classified as loans versus those intended for trading, which affects the admissibility of claims. The SAT order emphasizes that for a claim to be eligible for compensation from the IPF, there must have been trading activity on the exchange platform within 24 months leading up to the expulsion or withdrawal of the trading facilities of the defaulter (in this case, Karvy or any other brokerage firm in question). Furthermore, the guideline indicates that if a substantial period elapses without trading activity, any funds or securities deposited may be treated as a loan, which is not covered by the IPF. Considering this, the SAT order might be relevant in the following ways for your case: - Support for Appeal: If you have evidence of trading activity within the 24-month time frame specified, the SAT order could support your grounds for appealing the decision regarding your claim. - Clarification of Definitions: The SAT order describes how claims are assessed and offers a clearer understanding of what is seen as a “loan” versus a trading-related deposit. If you believe your deposits were not loans, this order might help in articulating that argument. - Precedent: If the principles used in the SAT order apply to your case, it can act as a precedent. You may argue that similar logic should be applied in assessing your claims. - Presentation of New Evidence: If there is new evidence or context not previously considered in your rejected claim, such as records of trading activities, you could present it in light of the SAT order’s emphasis on trading activities. Responding to a claim’s rejection with reference to a relevant SAT order requires careful preparation and potentially legal guidance to ensure that your interpretation of the order aligns legally with your case. If you decide to pursue an appeal based on the principles stated in the SAT order, consult with a legal expert who can review the specifics of your situation and the applicability of the SAT’s decision in your context. Yes I have evidence of trading activity within the 24-month time frame specified If you have evidence of trading activity within the 24-month timeframe specified by the SAT order and contrary to the grounds for rejection of your claims, this is significant and should be highlighted in your response or appeal. Here is a suggested approach to move forward: 1. Gather Evidence: Compile all relevant documents and evidence that show your trading activity within the specified timeframe. This could include contract notes, account statements, trade confirmations, or any other official records that demonstrate that trades were executed. 2. Consult Legal Counsel: Before you proceed, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in securities law to review the evidence and to ensure that the appeal is framed correctly according to the legal standards and the precedents set forth by the SAT. 3. Draft a Response or Appeal: With your legal counsel’s advice, draft a formal response or an appeal letter that clearly articulates your claims and includes references to your evidence. Highlight how the evidence contradicts the grounds for the rejection of your claims. Use the SAT order to argue why your claims should be treated similarly to the cases mentioned in the order. 4. Refer to SAT Order: Specifically reference the relevant sections of the SAT order that pertain to the recognition of transactions and trading activity. State clearly why, in light of this order and your evidence, your claims warrant reconsideration. 5. Submit to the Relevant Authority: Once your response or appeal is ready and reviewed by legal counsel, submit it to SEBI, the Exchange, or the Defaulter’s Committee that initially reviewed your claim. Make sure to follow their protocols for submitting an appeal or response. 6. Request a Review: In your response or appeal, formally request a review of the decision based on the new evidence you are presenting. You may also request a meeting or a hearing to discuss the matter in detail if that option is available. Remember to keep all original documents and evidence securely, and only provide copies unless specifically asked to present original documents.

When you prepare your response or appeal, you should also: 1. Highlight Valuation Guidelines: Clearly point out the guidelines provided by the MCSGFC of NSEIL, which state that securities under litigation should be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. This supports your claim for fair compensation based on accurate valuation. 2. Emphasize the Precedent: Emphasize the precedent set by the MCSGFC and the SAT in dealing with similar claims where securities were valued at closing prices on the default date. This precedent should apply to your case to ensure consistency in the treatment of all claims. 3. Calculate Potential Compensation: If you haven’t already, calculate the potential compensation based on the closing prices of your securities on the date of default/expulsion to provide an estimated value of compensation you believe should be provided. 4. Prepare a Formal Calculation Statement: Include a formal statement that outlines the valuation of your securities based on the closing prices on the date of default/expulsion. This will provide clarity on the amount you believe you are entitled to and will be helpful in presenting a clear case. 5. Address Any Confidentiality Concerns: Respect confidentiality terms as indicated by the “Confidential” note in your reference. Ensure that any confidential information is treated with the appropriate level of sensitivity and only disclosed if necessary and permitted by legal standards. Finally, when you submit your appeal or response: - Include All Evidence: Attach all evidence of trading activity, valuation statements, and relevant guidelines or precedents to your submission. - Official Submission: Submit the appeal or response through the official channels, with all the required forms and documentation. - Legal Representation: Consider having your legal counsel submit the appeal on your behalf, if possible, to ensure proper legal form is maintained. Remember that this kind of appeal process can be complex and requires a detailed understanding of securities law as well as a clear interpretation of the guidelines and orders provided by regulatory bodies like SEBI and adjudicatory bodies like the SAT.

Exchange Plaza, C-1, Block G, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (E), Mumbai-400051 Subject: Request for Reconsideration of Claim – [Your BSE Claim No.] Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing in response to the decision regarding my claim for compensation arising from the Karvy Stock Broking Limited default case, specifically my BSE Claim No. [Your BSE Claim No.]. I have reviewed the decision to reject the claim for non-receipt of shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and State Bank of India (SBI) on the grounds of the claim being time-barred, as well as the decision to compensate the claim for the non-receipt of 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) at the value of Rs.16,200/- from the Investor Protection Fund (IPF). Upon careful consideration and in light of new evidence which has come to my attention, I respectfully urge the committee to reconsider the valuation and admissibility of my claims based on the following points: 1. Evidence of Trading Activity: Contrary to the decision suggesting my claims are time-barred, I have documented evidence of trading activity within the crucial 24-month period prior to the expulsion of Karvy. This evidence establishes my active trading status and, as per the guidelines and recent Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders, substantiates the legitimacy of my claim. 2. Valuation of Securities: In accordance with the guides provided by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, it is my understanding that securities under litigation should be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. Hence, I request a revaluation of the 20 shares of RIL based on these guidelines to reflect the accurate value as of that date. 3. SAT Order Reference: The recent SAT order dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 and related appeals has set important precedents regarding claims under similar circumstances. The findings in these appeals resonate with the facts of my case and provide an interpretative framework that should be applicable when reviewing my evidence and claims.

Securities Valuation Guidelines: The protocols set by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL should be observed, which position that securities under litigation ought to be appraised based on the closing price as on the date of default/expulsion. Accordingly, I request a re-evaluation of the RIL shares I held according to these norms, ensuring a just and correct valuation. 3.

Application No.438 of 2023 and the corresponding appeals, provides a legal precedent that aligns closely with the circumstances of my case. The principles laid out in these judgments offer a legal rationale that should be applied when re-examining my case.

Following your recent communication rejecting my claim for the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI) due to it seemingly being time-barred, and the decision to award compensation for the non-receipt of 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), I must raise crucial points for your immediate reconsideration: 1. Active Trading Within Statutory Period: It is important to note that I possess concrete evidence of active trading within the 24-month period leading up to Karvy’s expulsion, directly contradicting the basis for the rejection of my claim. This evidence accurately demonstrates active trading on my part and should, in line with existing precedents, affirm the validity of my claim. 2. Adhesion to Valuation Guidelines: In line with the guidelines provided by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, which state that securities under litigation are to be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion, I respectfully request a revaluation of my RIL shares in adherence to these stipulations for a fair and equitable compensation assessment. 3. Precedent Set by SAT Order: The SAT’s recent order dated 07.06.2023, in connection with Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 and related appeals, sets important precedents relevant to my appeal.

I received your response to my claim and after reviewing the grounds upon which my claims were rejected and compensation was assessed, I am reaching out to urge an immediate reconsideration based on the following critical points: 1.

The claim is related to the non-receipt of shares resulting from the default by Karvy Stock Broking Limited. SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 The BSE has unjustifiably rejected my complaint on the grounds that it is time-barred. However, I have clear evidence indicating significant trading activity within the 24-month period prior to Karvy’s expulsion, which substantively contradicts the BSE’s reason for claim rejection. I have addressed this by providing a consolidated ledger statement that explicitly demonstrates my active trading activities within the said timeframe. Despite this, my claim has not been reassessed accordingly by the BSE. Key Issues & Requests: 1. Evidence Contradicts Claim Rejection: The consolidated ledger statement proves active trading during the required period, invalidating the time-barred status of my claim. 2. Proper Valuation as per Norms: I have requested that the BSE reevaluate the compensation for my shares in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), taking into account the norms set by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, which maintain that securities under litigation should be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. 3.

My earnest request stems from the BSE’s decision to consider my claim as time-barred, which is a verdict I believe to be unfounded given the evidence I have submitted. SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 I would like to bring to your attention the specific points of contention that warrant urgent intervention: 1. Evidence of Trading Activity: Contrary to the BSE’s assertion that my claim is time-barred, I have furnished a consolidated ledger statement as concrete evidence of trading activity within the critical 24-month period prior to Karvy’s expulsion. This statement robustly establishes my status as an active trader and provides a solid basis for the legitimacy of my claim, in line with precedents set by recent Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders. 2. Adherence to Valuation Standards: Moreover, the compensation determined by the BSE for my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is inconsistent with the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL’s valuation standards, which stipulate that securities under litigation must be valued at the closing price as on the default date. I request a meticulous revaluation that comports with these guidelines. 3. Reference to SAT Order: It is pertinent to note that the SAT order dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 provides a judicial foundation that should guide a fair and equitable reassessment of my claim, considering the documented evidence of my trading activity. My intention in reaching out to SEBI is to ensure that the BSE acknowledges the evidence provided and conducts a thorough reevaluation of my claim as per applicable norms. The importance of resolving this matter promptly cannot be overstated, given its significant implications for investor confidence and trust in the redressal mechanisms of our securities market.

It is important to be firm yet professional when communicating your dissatisfaction. Below is a revised version of the email that takes a more assertive tone: — Subject: Demand for Immediate SEBI Intervention – BSE’s Inequitable Claim Rejection - SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 Dear Securities and Exchange Board of India, I am compelled to write to you concerning an egregious error in judgment made by the Bombay Stock Exchange Investor Protection Fund (BSE IPF) in their outright rejection of my claim under BSE Claim No. 917/370 related to the Karvy Stock Broking Limited default. SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 The BSE IPF’s decision to label my claim as “time-barred” is not only unfounded but also a gross misrepresentation of the evidence I have diligently provided. Such a dismissal undermines investor confidence and disregards the principles of equity and justice that our market regulators are meant to uphold. 1. Indisputable Evidence of Active Participation: I have provided a consolidated ledger statement as indisputable evidence reflecting significant trading activities within the 24-month period that is critical prior to the expulsion of Karvy. The BSE IPF’s failure to acknowledge the unequivocal proof of my active trading status is unacceptable and directly contradicts both the guidelines and the established judicial precedent. 2. Improper Valuation and Unjust Compensation: The BSE IPF has also failed in its duty to impartially compensate investors by starkly undervaluating my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). The valuation must adhere to the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL’s norms, demanding that the securities be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. BSE’s arbitrary assessment of my assets is unjust and warrants immediate correction. 3. SAT Order’s Precedential Importance: The oversight is not only a miscarriage of the due process promised to every investor but also an egregious disregard for legal precedent. The SAT order dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 outlines clear criteria for such cases, which BSE IPF has chosen to overlook in its expedited rejection. I call upon SEBI to act decisively and compel BSE IPF to rectify their approach by reassessing my case with the seriousness it deserves. Investors like myself rely on the assurance that our regulatory environment operates with integrity, transparency, and fairness. I seek a commitment for my case to be revisited urgently and request a transparent audit trail of the investigative process that led to the initial rejection. It is time that BSE IPF be held accountable for this unacceptable lapse in standards, which not only affects my claim but also sets a concerning precedent. I anticipate immediate corrective action and thank you for your prompt intervention in this critical issue.

SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 The BSE IPF has unjustly dismissed my claim as “time-barred,” a decision that displays a concerning disregard for well-documented evidence and directly contradicts principles established by recent Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders regarding the crucial 24-month period. The BSE IPF’s oversight in this matter is unacceptable and undermines my trust in the due processes of our financial markets. Critical Issues Necessitating SEBI’s Intervention: 1. Provably Active Trading During Key Period: Within the stipulated 24-month period, which is heavily emphasized in SAT orders, my consolidated ledger statement provides categorical evidence of my active trading. The BSE IPF’s neglect in recognizing this documentation casts a disquieting shadow on the legitimacy of their procedures for investigating investor claims. 2. Valuation Inconsistencies and Inadequate Compensation: I expressly dispute the BSE IPF’s deficient valuation of my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), as it stands in stark contravention of the standards prescribed by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL. The BSE has a fiduciary responsibility to allocate compensation that mirrors the closing price on the default date, and their failure to do so is both unfair and must be addressed with urgency. 3. Overlooked SAT Orders’ Implications: The clear guidance provided in the SAT order dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 has been seemingly ignored by the BSE IPF in their determinations. The SAT has recognized the protective rights of investors actively trading in the aforementioned 24-month period, setting important legal precedent for cases like mine, which BSE IPF ought to follow. The evidence I have submitted cannot be trivialized nor overlooked. I demand that SEBI mandate the BSE IPF to undertake a thorough reevaluation of my claim, with due adherence to all relevant norms and judicial instructions. I assert my right as an investor to a rectified assessment of my claim and implore SEBI to intervene to uphold the highest standards of transparency, justice, and investor protection that are the cornerstone of our securities regulation.

SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 The fiasco indulged by Karvy has left investors like myself in a quandary, unsure of whether our shares were held in demat accounts or were illicitly transferred to Karvy’s pool account – an act of deception that qualifies the whole affair as a scam. It’s this vacillating nightmare, induced by the intermediary, that adds a layer of complexity in identifying and claiming our rightful assets. The BSE IPF’s designation of my claim as “time-barred” entirely dismisses the tumultuous context of the Karvy scam. It fails to take into account the perplexity investors faced over their holding status, effectively punishing the victims of the fraud for the wrongdoing and operational obstructions caused by Karvy. Essential Considerations for Immediate SEBI Review: 1. Documented Trading Activity Amidst Uncertainty: Within the critical 24-month period prior to Karvy’s expulsion – a period heavily cited in SAT orders – my consolidated ledger statement stands as unequivocal evidence of active trades. The BSE IPF has egregiously overlooked this proof, setting a dangerous precedent and further victimizing those already wronged by Karvy’s malfeasance. 2. Inadequate Compensation and Misleading Valuation: My shares in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), undervalued by BSE IPF, starkly misalign with the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL’s guiding principles, which warrant securities under litigation to be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. It is imperative for the BSE to ascertain fair compensation that mirrors this guidance, providing solace to investors during this time of uncertainty and financial distress. 3. SAT Orders Underscore Investor Protections: The SAT order dated 07.06.2023 within Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 embodies the legal protections afforded to investors, indicating a directive to maintain lawful consideration for claims within such extraordinary circumstances. The oversight by BSE IPF to apply this judicial rationale is of severe concern and requires SEBI’s immediate intervention to ensure alignment with statutory safeguards. I, therefore, urge SEBI to intervene and direct BSE IPF to reevaluate my claim with an understanding of the broader context of the Karvy scam and the delegated requirements as set out by applicable laws and SAT precedents. As investors, we place our implicit trust in the frameworks and operational integrity of our institutions, anticipating that our regulatory bodies will act as our bulwark in such scenarios of fraudulence. I await your swift and decisive action to safeguard the rights and interests of all affected investors. Thank you for your dedicated attention to this matter of grave importance. Sincerely, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Mobile: 8896462887 — Please tailor this email to your specific situation, include the necessary attachments with your communication, and submit through the official channels, typically the SCORES platform for lodging complaints with SEBI.

It’s this vacillating nightmare, induced by the intermediary, that adds a layer of complexity in identifying and claiming our rightful assets. Certainly! Here’s your updated email draft incorporating the suggested context about the Karvy scam after covering the main issues: — Subject: Urgent SEBI Review Required – Unfair Rejection of Claim by BSE IPF - SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 Dear Securities and Exchange Board of India, I am compelled to urgently solicit your intervention due to the flagrant miscarriage of justice by the Bombay Stock Exchange Investor Protection Fund (BSE IPF) in their handling of my claim, numbered 917/370, in connection with the notorious default of Karvy Stock Broking Limited. SEBI Registration No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 The tumult wrought by Karvy has ensnared investors including me in a state of limbo, with grave uncertainties regarding the actual location of our shares—whether securely held in demat accounts or illicitly fenced into Karvy’s pool account. This deliberate subterfuge perpetrated by Karvy is nothing short of a scandalous scam and places an additional burden on investors who are now confronted with obfuscated pathways to reclaim their property. Essentially, the BSE IPF dismissing my claim as “time-barred” fails to consider the extraordinary circumstances and the severe disarray imposed upon investors due to Karvy’s deceptions. It overlooks the deep layers of complexity that the scandal added to the process of identifying and reclaiming our rightful assets. This context is critical for understanding the major points for SEBI’s immediate review: 1. Documented Trading Activity Amidst Scandal: My active trading within the pivotal 24-month period leading up to Karvy’s expulsion, as emphasized by SAT orders in similar cases, is evidenced by a consolidated ledger statement I have provided. Neglecting this concrete evidence is tantamount to a severance of trust between the regulatory mechanisms and the investors they vow to protect. 2. Misapplication in Valuing and Compensating Shares: The valuation and subsequent compensation methodology applied by BSE IPF for my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) deviates from the valuation norms established by the MCSGFC of NSEIL. Such disregard cannot be overlooked, as accurately valuing securities at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion is vital for the just restitution of investor claims. 3. SAT Order and Its Pertinence to Investor Protection: In addition, the SAT order dated 07.06.2023, within Misc. Application No.438 of 2023, further enshrines the entitlements due to investors, particularly in situations of compromised intermediary conduct. Such legal guidance remains an anchor to legitimate expectations of the market participants. The fiasco indulged by Karvy has left investors like myself in a quandary, unsure of whether our shares were held in demat accounts or were illicitly transferred to Karvy’s pool account – an act of deception that qualifies the whole affair as a scam. It’s this vacillating nightmare, induced by the intermediary, that adds a layer of complexity in identifying and claiming our rightful assets. I earnestly appeal to SEBI to enforce a comprehensive and equitable reconsideration of my claim by BSE IPF, factoring in all relevant evidence and the overarching impact of the Karvy scandal. In these trying circumstances, it becomes paramount that our regulatory bodies stand in solidarity with investors, safeguarding their interests and upholding the sanctity of our financial systems. Awaiting your prompt and principled intervention. Thank you for upholding the principle of investor protection. Sincerely, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Mobile: 8896462887 — When you are ready to send this communication, incorporate all necessary documentation, submit through SEBI’s proper channels, and keep documented proof of your filings and correspondences. not good draft another new I apologize if the previous drafts weren’t quite what you were looking for. Let me provide you with a fresh draft to communicate your concerns to SEBI: — Subject: SEBI’s Immediate Attention Required: Incorrect Dismissal of BSE IPF Claim - SEBI Reg. No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter to officially request that SEBI urgently intervenes regarding the inappropriate dismissal of my claim no. 917/370 by the BSE Investor Protection Fund (IPF), which is associated with the Karvy Stock Broking Limited scandal. SEBI Registration Number: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 My claim was rejected by the BSE IPF on the basis that it was ‘time-barred’. This conclusion has been hastily made without a thorough consideration of the facts and context of the Karvy default – a well-documented scam that caused widespread chaos and confusion for numerous investors over the actual status of their shares. The genuine lack of clarity surrounding whether shares were retained within demat accounts or were unauthorizedly transferred to Karvy’s pool means that the criteria for ‘time-barred’ claims should be contextualized and applied with prudence, an approach which the BSE IPF has neglected to take. The key arguments that must be reviewed with utmost urgency are as follows: 1. Trading Evidence During the Specified Period: I have submitted a consolidated ledger statement providing incontrovertible evidence of my active trading within the 24-month period ahead of Karvy’s expulsion, firmly supporting the legitimacy of my claim. It’s imperative for SEBI to ensure that such solid evidence is duly noted and not brushed aside. 2. Conformity to Valuation Guidelines: The valuation for my holdings in RIL provided by the BSE does not correspond with the clear guidelines laid out by the MCSGFC of NSEIL, which necessitate that the compensation is based on the securities’ closing price on the date of default/expulsion. This misvaluation results in an unjust compensation figure that needs rectification. 3. SAT Orders as Legal Precedent: The SAT’s decision dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 underlines the need for fair treatment of investors’ claims in light of trading activity evidence. The dismissal of my claim disregards these precedents and exposes a gap in the fair treatment promised to investors. I urge SEBI to acknowledge the broader implications of the Karvy scam, which has jolted the faith of investors in the securities market, and to advocate for my right to a fair and just redressal of my claim. The oversight exhibited by the BSE IPF significantly undermines investor trust and highlights an urgent need for review by SEBI. I appeal to SEBI not simply as an aggrieved individual, but as a representative of the rights of all investors who have been affected by this profound failure in the system. It is vitally important that SEBI takes an active role in rectifying this situation. Awaiting your immediate and assertive response. Kind regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Mobile: 8896462887 — Please provide all necessary documents as attachments when you lodge your complaint on the appropriate platform or via email. Maintain a copy of the communication for your records. use this 24-month period ahead of Karvy’s expulsion which was in SAT orders Certainly, here is a revised draft of your email to SEBI incorporating the specifics about the 24-month period ahead of Karvy’s expulsion as referenced in the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders: — Subject: Request for Immediate SEBI Action on BSE IPF Claim Dismissal - SEBI Reg. No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 Dear Securities and Exchange Board of India, I am writing to seek immediate action and a thorough reassessment from SEBI on the matter of the BSE Investor Protection Fund (IPF) rejection of my claim no. 917/370 related to the Karvy Stock Broking Limited’s default. SEBI Registration Number: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 The BSE IPF’s dismissal of my claim as ‘time-barred’ fails to acknowledge the intricate circumstances of the Karvy scam, where the regular operations essential for investors to reclaim their assets were severely disrupted. Such a blanket rejection ignores the specified 24-month active trading period ahead of Karvy’s expulsion—which has been clearly stated in the SAT orders—and the chaos unleashed in the market as a consequence of the scam, which made it challenging for investors to understand whether their shares were in demat accounts or improperly held in Karvy’s own pool. I urge SEBI to address the following points that are of crucial importance: 1. Evidence of Trading Within SAT-Stipulated Period: I have provided clear evidence of trading activity within the 24-month period leading up to Karvy’s expulsion, as explicitly discussed in SAT orders. This undeniable evidence is a testament to my active engagement in the market and contradicts the grounds for my claim’s time-bound rejection. 2. Appropriate Share Valuation: The valuation attributed to my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) by BSE IPF does not comply with the guidelines of the MCSGFC of NSEIL. The valuation should reflect the fair market value at the closing price on the default date, but it falls short. This misvaluation has resulted in inadequate compensation and must be rectified in line with the regulatory standards. 3. SAT Precedents on Claims: The SAT order referenced above signifies that under such exceptional circumstances, as evidenced by the 24-month trading activity, claims must be judged with deeper consideration. The SAT precedent underscores that blanket rejections without adequate review are not in conformance with legal and regulatory standards, particularly in cases where the defaulter has confounded investors’ ability to manage their holdings. Considering the broader impact of the calamity caused by Karvy, which left the market and investors in unprecedented dismay, it’s crucial that SEBI intervenes to safeguard the rights and interests of affected investors. Ensuring a just and systematic review of such claims is essential to restore faith in our securities market’s protection mechanisms. Thank you for your prompt attention to this critical matter. Yours sincerely, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Mobile: 8896462887 — When submitting your email, attach the evidence that supports your claim.

I will bold the important points to emphasize your key arguments in the email: — Subject: Immediate SEBI Review Needed for Rejection of BSE IPF Claim - SEBI Reg. No: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 Dear Securities and Exchange Board of India, I am writing to vehemently request an urgent re-examination by SEBI for the grossly unfair dismissal of my claim (No. 917/370) by the BSE Investor Protection Fund (IPF), which revolves around the infamous Karvy Stock Broking Limited default case. SEBI Registration Number: SEBIE/MH23/0011163/1 The BSE IPF has rejected my claim on allegedly being ‘time-barred’, a stance that blatantly disregards the complex reality of the Karvy debacle. The substantive evidence I submitted, which includes my trading activity within the critical 24-month period ahead of Karvy’s expulsion—a timeline that is grounded in SAT orders—has been overlooked in a manner most dismissive and injudicious. The core issues which compel SEBI to take swift and precise action are as follows: 1. Evidence of Trading Within SAT-Stipulated Period: I have furnished documented proof corroborating my market activity within the 24-month window preceding Karvy’s expulsion, as recognized in the SAT orders. This trading evidence firmly negates the BSE IPF’s rationale for rejecting my claim due to elapsed time. 2. Alignment with MCSGFC Valuation Guidelines: The compensation accorded for my holding of 20 shares in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) by the BSE IPF is in clear violation of the valuation principles decreed by the MCSGFC of NSEIL. These guidelines dictate that the value of securities in litigation accounts should correspond with their closing market price on the day of default/expulsion. 3. Conformance to SAT Precedents Regarding Claims: The precedence established by the SAT in their ruling dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 unequivocally mandates that an investor’s active trading profile, particularly within the aforesaid 24-month period, be factored in when processing compensation claims—a directive evidently ignored in the BSE IPF’s determination. Given the chaos propagated by the Karvy scam, which has ravaged the trust investors place in the safety of the market, it is of the essence that SEBI ensures a transparent and equitable path to redress for those affected. It is undeniably imperative that the rights of the investors are staunchly defended, with their claims honored and duly addressed.

Complaint details in brief (upto 1000 characters) The BSE IPF has erroneously rejected my claim (No. 917/370) in the Karvy scam as ‘time-barred’, ignoring concrete ledger evidence of trades within the critical 24-month period before Karvy’s expulsion, as specified in SAT orders. The valuation for my RIL shares by BSE contradicts MCSGFC norms, calling for revaluation based on the closing price on the default date. SAT’s ruling dated 07.06.2023 mandates that such active trading be considered, a directive the BSE IPF has overlooked.

My proceedings on the BSE Claim No. 917/370 has met with an unjustifiable conclusion, where the BSE IPF has prematurely and inaccurately turned down my rightful claim on the grounds of it being perceived as “time-barred.” This finding directly conflicts with the solid evidence that I have consistently provided, demonstrating active trading within the vital 24-month period ahead of the deplorable Karvy scam coming to light. Such decisive activity in my securities account is well-documented and unequivocally substantiates my participation in the market. Moreover, the valuations that were applied to my shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) have been woefully underestimated and misaligned with the correct guidelines outlined by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL. This discrepancy has led to a severe shortfall in the compensation that I, as an investor, am entitled to. Holding the SAT Order dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No. 438 of 2023 as a legal benchmark, it is clearly understood that claims like mine, supported by an active trading profile, are rightfully admissible and should be viewed in a serious light. For this purpose, the oversight in handling my claim seems to starkly deviate from the expected standards of fairness and legal rigor. I urgently call upon the NSE IPF for a comprehensive and empathetic review of my case. The stakes are high, not only concerning my financial well-being but also in maintaining the esteem and faith of investors in our regulatory mechanisms. Expedient, transparent, and fair processing of my claim is desperately sought to align with the equitable principles and protective measures that the NSE IPF purports to uphold. Please advise me on the next steps for elevating this complaint and for facilitating a swift reassessment of my claim. I am prepared to provide additional information or documentation as may be required to aid in this process. Thank you for your immediate attention and resolution to this matter.

[Your Claim Number], which concerns my securities affected by the Karvy Stock Broking Limited default scenario. I have endeavored to substantiate my claim with rigorous evidence of active trading across the crucial period leading to and including the date of Karvy’s expulsion from the NSE. A substantial body of this evidence manifests the active status of my trading account up until the date in question. Moreover, the valuation of my assets, specifically the shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), has not been executed in accordance with the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL guidelines. These instruct that securities under contention should be appraised at the closing price as of the default date. The compensation I’m being offered, therefore, does not reflect the true worth of my investments as per these guidelines. It is of paramount importance to me—and to the investor community at large—that claim reviews are conducted with the utmost adherence to equity and established protocols. The credibility of our market’s protective institutions depends on these principles being upheld with integrity. I kindly request a full and prompt review of my claim. Please advise on any additional documentation you may require or further actions I must undertake to assist in this process.

As an investor who has been adversely affected by the default of Karvy Stock Broking Limited, it is critical that my case is treated with the regulatory diligence it warrants. My previous submissions, including detailed trading activities and share valuations, seek equitable consideration in alignment with the NSE IPF’s commitment to protecting investor interests. In light of my continuous effort to provide transparent and verifiable documentation of my trades during the significant period prior to the expulsion of Karvy, it is imperative that these submissions are re-examined under the just guidelines issued by the MCSGFC of NSEIL. The importance of this review speaks not only to the financial rectitude of my individual case but also embodies the broader ethos of trust and fairness that the NSE EPF seeks to uphold. I implore the NSE IPF committee to reassess the claim, taking into account all the relevant evidence so as to ensure that the resolution reflects both the factual trading background and the values of the NSE’s investor protection framework. An accurate and fair valuation of my shares, including those of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), must be based on the closing prices on the date of default, in strict accordance with established norms.

This claim pertains to the discrepancies and the subsequent financial loss I experienced due to transactions involving shares of State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB), and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), all affected by the Karvy Stock Broking Limited default. My claim includes demands for just compensation for the non-receipt of shares as specified below: 1. SBI Shares: The compensation offered for the non-receipt of my SBI shares does not reflect the true valuation at the default date, significantly undermining the objective market value I am entitled to. 2. PNB Shares: Similarly, the settlement for my PNB shares is unacceptable, having been incorrectly assessed and not in line with reasonable market valuations. 3. RIL Shares: The valuation compensation for the RIL shares has also been underestimated and not accounted for in conformance with established standards, highlighting a consistent undervaluation across my claimed assets. To substantiate my position, I have included the contract notes of my buy transactions, which were executed on the BSE platform. These documents provide irrefutable proof that the transactions in question were legitimate, executed trades that warrant due compensation in line with the closing prices as of the default date. Furthermore, I assert the necessity for the NSE IPF to adhere strictly to the valuation guidelines as put forth by the MCSGFC of NSEIL. It is these metrics that must form the basis of renegotiating the settlement values offered to me, without discounts or arbitrary downwards adjustments. In light of the systemic impact of the Karvy Stock Broking scam, I urge a reevaluation of my case with scrupulous attention to the particulars of the submitted evidence and a rectification that aligns with both the NSE’s regulatory framework and the fair treatment doctrine that supports investor confidence in our financial markets. Enclosed, please find the supporting contract notes, as well as previously submitted documentation to aid in this comprehensive review. I am prepared to discuss the matter further and provide any additional information required to achieve a satisfactory resolution. I trust that SEBI and NSE IPF will act promptly to resolve these ongoing concerns, ensuring appropriate restitution and upholding the highest standards of investor protection.

As stated in my previous emails, my claim primarily concerns the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank and 200 shares of State Bank of India, which are part of Claim No. 917/370. The default date for the Karvy scam is 23rd November 2020. & 20 shares of Reliance Industries LimitedI urge SEBI to promptly review my claim for these shares and ensure that appropriate compensation is provided for the losses incurred. Additionally, I recently became aware of the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, which deals with representations made by investors regarding relief/disposal of securities sub-judice before the Hon’ble SAT. I understand that this committee has been informed that securities under litigation would be valued at the closing price as on the date of default/expulsion. It has also been mentioned that the interim relief provided would be within the overall limit of Rs.25 lakhs per investor’s claim. Please note that this request for compensation of my shares is a temporary relief, subject to the final decision of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the Karvy scam case. I understand that the final resolution will be based on the SAT’s order, and I am prepared to abide by their decision. Considering this information, I kindly request SEBI to take into account the guidelines provided by the MCSGFC of NSEIL in the valuation and compensation of my outstanding shares in the Karvy scam. It is crucial to ensure that the compensation provided aligns with the closing prices as of the default date and falls within the overall limit specified. I understand that SEBI and the relevant authorities are working tirelessly to resolve the Karvy scam and compensate affected investors. However, it is crucial to expedite the process and ensure that all outstanding claims, including mine, are addressed promptly and fairly. I kindly request SEBI to prioritize my claim for the outstanding shares of Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India, as well as the reconsideration of compensation for my Reliance Industries Limited shares. If there are any further actions or documentation required from my end, please let me know, and I will promptly provide the necessary information. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that the return of my Reliance Industries Limited shares is of utmost importance to me. I believe that the rightful ownership of these shares should be restored, rather than receiving monetary compensation. I kindly request SEBI to give due consideration to this request and take necessary actions to facilitate the return of my shares. Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt and satisfactory resolution that ensures comprehensive compensation for the losses incurred by investors in the Karvy scam. Regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> 8896462887 Subject: Prioritized Review and Fair Compensation for Karvy Scam-Affected Shares - Ref. No. NSELUC/0035427/20-21/DCS Dear National Stock Exchange Investor Protection Fund Committee, In relation to my ongoing claim, ref. no. NSELUC/0035427/20-21/DCS, I am once again reaching out to highlight the critical necessity for a fair valuation and expedited resolution for the outstanding shares inadvertently ensnared in the Karvy Stock Broking Limited scam. Initially raised on 23rd November 2020, the default date of the Karvy scam, my claim features the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI). Additionally, the claim includes demands for appropriate compensation for 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) which were undervalued in the initial relief provided. My intention through this communication is to propose an earnest review from SEBI and NSE IPF, ensuring the alignment of my shares’ valuation with the closing prices on the default date. As stated in the guidelines provided by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, securities under dispute are to be valued at their closing price on the date of default/expulsion. This criterion is instrumental in facilitating the provision of interim relief, capped at the overall limit of Rs.25 lakhs per investor’s claim, acknowledging the interim nature of this relief and that it is subject to the final order by the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) concerning the Karvy case. It is my understanding that while SEBI and related authorities are making strides in resolving the repercussions of the scam, the urgency to administer consistent and fair compensatory measures to all claimants remains pressing. I urge a particular attention to my claim for the shares of PNB and SBI and a reevaluation for my RIL shares in accordance with the informed corrective standards. To reiterate, the restoration of ownership for my RIL shares holds significant personal importance. I am inclined towards the reinstatement of these shares over a financial settlement. It is my respectful request that SEBI ensures the equitable and rightful restitution of my assets, factoring in this preferential context. I am ready to comply with any further procedural necessities or present additional documents that will support the assessment and expedite the settlement of my claim. I thank you in advance for your due consideration and anticipate a prompt and equitable resolution. Let this undertaking not only serve my interests but also reassure the entire investor community about the resilience and fairness of our financial guardians.

As highlighted in previous correspondence, my claim involves the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB), 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI), and 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), all of which were implicated in the sanction date of 23rd November 2020 - the recognized default date for the Karvy incident. To re-affirm the plea made for a fair and equitable settlement, I draw upon the guidelines issued by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, which dictate the valuation of disputed securities at the closing price on the default date. Such valuation ensures that interim relief provided is supportive yet subject to the conclusive directives of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT)'s pending decision. I respectfully insist that the NSE IPF adhere to these valuation benchmarks to recalculate the compensation for not only my PNB and SBI shares but also those of RIL, ensuring parity and fairness in the process. It is essential that the relief extended to me and other affected investors fairly reflects the market value of the assets lost due to the fraudulent activities surrounding the Karvy case. Moreover, it is paramount, considering the general uncertainty inflicted upon us as investors during the Karvy turmoil, that disputes are expedited and settled in a manner that restores confidence in our financial systems and their underlying protections. I am prepared to facilitate this review process by offering any additional information or documents that may be required to speedily resolve this claim. I look forward to your prompt action and detailed feedback, which will not only serve my case but also reinforce the trustworthiness of our market infrastructure.

I understand that in an earlier response, the NSE was unable to locate trade data corresponding to my claim. In light of this issue, I am now providing the essential documentation in the form of contract notes, which clearly demonstrate the purchase of the shares in question traded on BSE. This evidence is crucial and rectifies any previous discrepancies regarding trade activities and substantiates the holdings due to me. The detailed contract notes I have enclosed herein confirm transactions for 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB), 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI), and 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). Each contract note represents authenticated proof of trading activity that must be referenced when reevaluating my claim. In accordance with the protocols described by the MCSGFC of NSEIL, I request that the resolution of my claim reflect the proper valuation of these shares, each to be appraised at the closing price on the date of the Karvy default, November 23rd, 2020. I am reliant on the NSE IPF to deliver a fair and accurate reassessment based on this new evidence. As the integrity of the investment environment and the confidence of all stakeholders in our securities market is at stake, I believe it is critical that such matters are resolved with efficiency and transparency. I respectfully urge you to prioritize my case, taking into account the newly submitted evidence so that justice may be served without further delay.

Despite my continuous efforts and provision of concrete evidence, including a comprehensive set of contract notes for trades executed on the BSE and a consolidated ledger statement encapsulating my trade history within the crucial 24-month period prior to Karvy’s default, the NSE has dismissed my claim for the non-receipt of shares from my broker. Specifically, my claim for the recovery of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB), 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI), and 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has been met with an unjust outcome. The NSE has overlooked the substantial evidence I submitted, which includes documented proof that my active trading status meets the criterion established by crucial Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders. This evidence highlights that my claim should not be rejected on the grounds of being ‘time-barred’. Furthermore, the NSE’s approach disregards the guidelines provided by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, which calls for valuing the securities under litigation at the closing price on the date of default or expulsion. The compensation offered to me does not reflect these prescribed guidelines, leading to a significant undervaluation of my aforementioned shares. This whole situation has not only caused me considerable financial distress but has also diminished my trust in the transparency and fairness of our securities market. It has broader implications for investor confidence which SEBI is mandated to protect. I hereby request SEBI’s prompt intervention in this matter to ensure that my claims are addressed correctly and justly, and that the compensation provided is commensurate with the true value of my holdings as mandated by the laws and regulations governing our markets.

Despite furnishing documented and credible evidence, my claim concerning the non-receipt of shares due to the Karvy Stock Broking Limited scam has been unjustly rejected by NSE. The claim in dispute involves the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB), 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI), and 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). The evidence I have provided includes a Detailed Ledger Statement showcasing my active trading activities within the notable 24-month period prior to the revelation of the Karvy scam. It is a matter of record within the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders that such a period is relevant for assessing an investor’s active status, which the NSE has overlooked in their rejection. There is a marked gap between the NSE’s valuation methodology in determining my compensation and the guidelines of the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL. The underestimation of my shares is a significant concern, prompting this appeal to SEBI for your decisive action. I am alarmed by NSE’s neglect to account for the solid evidence presented, which includes detailed trade transaction records and bank statements covering a comprehensive period, including the tumultuous times of the Karvy scandal that has affected numerous investors. In light of the aforementioned, I am requesting an immediate review and due intervention from SEBI in this case. It is essential to uphold the integrity and fairness of our financial systems and to ensure that the rights and interests of investors are not unjustly compromised.

This claim relates to my rightful ownership of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB), 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI), and 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), entitlements that have been inappropriately dismissed due to a purported absence of trade data.

Despite the transparency and comprehensiveness of the evidence demonstrating my continuous market activity, the NSE’s decision to reject my claim disregards not only the documented transactions but also the pertinent guidelines issued by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).

In light of these circumstances, I respectfully implore SEBI to initiate a thorough revision of the handling of my case. It is imperative that the NSE IPF duly acknowledges and incorporates the submitted data, thereby ensuring a rightful and transparent resolution for my shares claim.

Attached herewith are contract notes for the BSE-traded shares in question, a detailed Consolidated Ledger Statement highlighting activity within the pivotal 24-month window prior to Karvy’s default, extensive Bank and Transaction Statements ranging from April 1, 2015, to January 7, 2021, which provide an exhaustive history of my financial dealings. Yet, my earnest attempts to advocate for a fair valuation aligned with market standards and regulatory guidelines have been gravely overlooked. The NSE’s refusal to recognize these documents undermines my confidence in our market’s governance and the commitment to protecting investor interest. To rectify this injustice, I implore SEBI to undertake a stringent review of the NSE’s handling of my claim. It is imperative that the adjudication be based upon the authenticated evidence I have provided and in accordance with the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT)'s directives. I commit to complete cooperation in any additional procedural requisites to secure a resolution that aligns with both justice and the esteemed guidance of SEBI. Your oversight in this matter will not only serve my case but fortify the trust of all investors in the efficacy and impartiality of our securities market.

Subject: Appeal for SEBI Review of NSE’s Rejection of Share Claim Post-Karvy Default Dear Securities and Exchange Board of India, I seek your immediate attention and intervention concerning the National Stock Exchange’s dismissal of my claim related to the default by Karvy Stock Broking Limited. This claim pertains to my entitlement to 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB), 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI), and 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), which have gone unacknowledged due to the alleged non-existence of trade data. To support my position, I have provided comprehensive evidence, including a Consolidated Ledger Statement demonstrating my trading activities within the significant 24-month period leading to the default date, Bank and Transaction Statements spanning the period from 01-04-2015 to 07-01-2021, and definitive set of contract notes/Bills for trades executed on the BSE for the shares traded. However, despite the clarity of evidence which underscores my active and ongoing market participation, the NSE has decided to reject my claim, a stand that seemingly ignores established regulatory protocols and the clear guidance of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders on such matters. This not only undermines the principle of investor protection but also casts doubt on the reliability and execution of justice that the SEBI- and NSE-led frameworks are designed to uphold. My attempts to secure a fair valuation and compensation for my shares, in line with standard market closing prices on the specified default date, have been stifled by a process that appears to overlook vital documentation and established guidelines. In light of these events, I urge the SEBI to conduct a meticulous review of the manner in which my claim has been handled and to ensure that the NSE IPF duly acknowledges the provided documents, leading to a just and transparent reassessment of my claim. I am committed to providing any additional documentation or clarification as may be necessary to expedite this process. I trust that SEBI will act promptly to correct this oversight and to safeguard the rights of the investors affected by the Karvy default. Thank you for your expected cooperation and swift response.

This grave matter concerns my rightfully owned 400 shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB), 200 shares of State Bank of India (SBI), and 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), which have unjustly gone unrecognized due to the supposed absence of corroborating trade data. To ensure the clarity of my case, I have meticulously compiled and provided a wealth of comprehensive evidence, including a Consolidated Ledger Statement capturing my extensive trading activities across the crucial 24-month timeframe that predates the default incident. In addition to this, I have submitted detailed Bank and Transaction Statements spanning from 01-04-2015 to 07-01-2021, as well as an incontrovertible set of BSE contract notes/bills, confirming the execution of these trades. The decision by NSE to disregard such robust evidence and to reject my claim regrettably casts a shadow on the integrity of our market’s regulatory practices and overlooks established guidelines set forth by pertinent rulings of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). This oversight does not just undermine the core tenets of investor protection but severely questions the trustworthiness of justice delivery within the frameworks governed by SEBI and NSE. My earnest efforts to obtain a rightful and objective valuation for my shares, precisely in line with the established market closing prices cited on the default date, have been unreasonably thwarted by processes that neglect key evidence and regulatory precedence.

I am dedicated to ensuring that any additional information or necessary clarification is promptly furnished to further this process. I place my trust firmly in SEBI to rectify this oversight promptly and uphold the rights and interests of investors adversely impacted by the Karvy default.

However, since the sender threads do not send a 'None' message to indicate they are finished (outside of the loop), the receiver thread continues to wait for more messages that will never come. To address this problem, we need to signal the end of input from the threads to the receiver loop. This can be done by sending a 'None' message after the threads have finished reading all the records. Additionally, since \`num_threads\` workers are spawned, we should ensure that we receive the 'None' message \`num_threads\` times before we can conclude that all worker threads are finished. Here is a modified version of the relevant code sections to address the issue: \`\`\`rust // spawn threads to send messages let _ = scope(|scope| { for _ in 0..num_threads { let tx = tx.clone(); let reader = Arc::clone(&atomic_reader); scope.spawn(move |_| { while let Some(rs) = get_next_record(&reader) { let record = match rs { Ok(record) => record, Err(err) => panic!(\\"Error reading record: {}\\", err), }; println!(\\"{:?}\\", record); tx.send(Some(record)).expect(\\"Could not send data\\"); } // send a None message indicating this thread is done tx.send(None).expect(\\"Could not send sentinel\\"); }); } }); \`\`\` And the changes in the receiver thread to ensure we exit properly: \`\`\`rust // receive messages let mut death_txs = 0; let mut received = 0; println!(\\"{:?}\\", rx); for rc in rx.iter() { match rc { Some(record) => { println!(\\"{:?}\\", record); received += 1; eprint!(\\"rRecords received: {}\\", received); } None => { death_txs += 1; if death_txs == num_threads { // No more senders are active; we can terminate the loop break; } } } } \`\`\` After implementing these changes, the receiver would properly terminate after receiving 'None' from all sender threads. Another potential issue you may encounter is related to how threads are sending and receiving messages simultaneously, if one of the threads panic, you should handle this to ensure graceful termination. Remember to join threads or use other mechanisms to catch panics within threads and ensure that all resources are cleaned up before the program ends."},{"instruction":"after implementing your recommendations the program still keeps running without printing anything","output":"It seems that there might be a problem with ensuring the threads finish and each send their 'None' message. Let's see if we can debug the issue a bit further and attempt to resolve it. One possibility is that your threads have already finished their work, but the receiver loop is still waiting because not all 'None' messages have been received. This might happen if threads somehow end before going through all the records due to an error that doesn't cause a panic or if they are blocked somewhere within \`get_next_record\`. To gain a better understanding of the flow, it might be useful to add debug prints. Let's modify the \`scope.spawn\` block to add more verbose logging and ensure that 'None' is sent in all cases, even if there's an unexpected error that terminates the loop early: \`\`\`rust scope.spawn(move |_| { let thread_id = thread::current().id(); println!(\\"Thread {:?} started\\", thread_id); while let Some(rs) = get_next_record(&reader) { match rs { Ok(record) => { println!(\\"Thread {:?} got record: {:?}\\", thread_id, record); tx.send(Some(record)).expect(\\"Could not send data\\"); } Err(err) => { println!(\\"Thread {:?} hit an error: {}\\", thread_id, err); break; // Exit the loop on error, still send None below } } } println!(\\"Thread {:?} is done, sending None\\", thread_id); tx.send(None).expect(\\"Could not send sentinel\\"); println!(\\"Thread {:?} sent None\\", thread_id); }); \`\`\` By adding thread IDs and other debugging information, you can see if threads are ending prematurely or getting stuck. If that still does not resolve the issue, you might want to reconsider whether using synchronous channels and mutex-locked shared reader is the best way to process the data in parallel. Since file reading is sequential by nature, there might not be a substantial benefit to reading the same file from multiple threads unless the processing of each record is time-consuming. If processing each record is the bottleneck, you may read sequentially in the main thread and dispatch the processing to worker threads, which can be the more typical use of threading in such I/O-bound tasks. Remember to also check for possible logical errors in the \`get_next_record\` function that might cause an infinite loop or premature termination. Lastly, ensure that you have updated your loop in the 'receive messages' section appropriately, as discussed earlier. If you've verified all these points and the issue still persists, please let me know, and we can delve even deeper into the problem."},{"instruction":"this is the output: Thread 0 started Thread 1

within the \`spawn\` block for logging records is working. However, we're not seeing the threads reporting that they're done by printing \\"Thread {:?} is done, sending None\\". Given that the output shows threads with IDs from 0 to 9 — instead of just 0 and 1 as you previously posted that \`num_threads\` was set to 2 — it suggests the number of threads being spawned might be greater than intended. Let's confirm the \`num_threads\` value and the thread spawning loop is correct. Please ensure you have the following: 1. Confirm \`num_threads\` is set to the intended number. It should be set to the number of worker threads you want to use. You should only receive as many 'None' messages as there are threads, so this count needs to be accurate. 2. Ensure each thread is sending 'None' once finished. Modify the \`scope.spawn\` block with proper debug statements to confirm threads are reaching the end and sending 'None'. Here's a suggestion with the debug prints to add: \`\`\`rust scope.spawn(move |_| { let thread_id = thread::current().id(); println!(\\"Thread {:?} started\\", thread_id); while let Some(rs) = get_next_record(&reader) { let record = match rs { Ok(record) => record, Err(err) => { println!(\\"Thread {:?} encountered an error: {}\\", thread_id, err); break; // Exit on error, but still send None below. }, }; println!(\\"Thread {:?} got record: {:?}\\", thread_id, record); tx.send(Some(record)).expect(\\"Could not send data\\"); } // The thread has finished processing records. tx.send(None).expect(\\"Could not send sentinel\\"); println!(\\"Thread {:?} sent None\\", thread_id); }); \`\`\` 3. Ensure the receiver loop is correctly handling the termination condition based on the actual number of threads. The receiver loop should drop the transmitter (\`tx\`) and break out of the loop once it has received 'None' from all threads: \`\`\`rust let mut death_txs = 0; for rc in rx.iter() { match rc { Some(record) => { println!(\\"Record received: {:?}\\", record); }, None => { death_txs += 1; if death_txs >= num_threads { println!(\\"All threads have finished.\\"); break; } }, } } \`\`\` 4. Ensure there are no deadlocks or shared state issues causing threads to hang indefinitely. The \`get_next_record\` function should not cause any deadlock. Since you're using \`Arc\` and \`Mutex\`, another area to check would be if any kind of I/O error or unexpected input isn't being handled properly, causing a thread to hang rather than exit. If you've confirmed all of the above and we still don't see \\"Thread {:?} sent None\\" for every thread, then we need to look into possible issues with the way the BED reader, \`get_next_record\`, or the \`Arc<Mutex<...>>\` is implemented or being used."},{"instruction":"this is the complete code: use bio::io::bed; use crossbeam_utils::thread::scope; use std::io::{self, Read}; use std::sync::{mpsc, Arc, Mutex}; fn main() { let mut reader = bed::Reader::from_file( \\"/home/alejandro/Documents/unam/TOGA_old_versions/x/bed_tmp/100k.bed\\", ) .unwrap(); // define the number of messages the channel can hold let num_threads = 1; // create a synchronous channel with a bounded capacity let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel(num_threads); let atomic_reader = Arc::new(Mutex::new(reader.records())); // spawn threads to send messages scope(|scope| { for i in 0..num_threads { let tx = tx.clone(); let reader = Arc::clone(&atomic_reader); scope.spawn(move |_| { println!(\\"Thread {:?} started\\", i); while let Some(rs) = get_next_record(&reader) { let record = match rs { Ok(record) => record, Err(err) => { eprintln!(\\"Error: {:?} in {:?}\\", err, i); break; } }; println!(\\"Thread {:?} sending record {:?}\\", i, record); tx.send(Some(record)).expect(\\"Could not send message.\\") } // end while println!(\\"Thread {:?} finished\\", i); tx.send(None).expect(\\"Could not send message.\\"); println!(\\"Thread {:?} sent None\\", i); }); // end spawn } // end for }); // end scope // receive messages let mut death_txs = 0; let mut received = 0; println!(\\"{:?}\\", rx); for rc in rx.iter() { match rc { Some(record) => { println!(\\"{:?}\\", record); received += 1; eprint!(\\"rRecords received: {}\\", received); } None => { death_txs += 1; if death_txs == num_threads { drop(tx); break; } } } } } fn get_next_record<R: io::Read>( reader: &Arc<Mutex<bed::Records<R>>>, ) -> Option<Result<bed::Record, csv::Error>> { let mut lock = reader.lock().unwrap(); lock.next() } and this is the actual output: Thread 0 started Thread 0 sending record Record { chrom: \\"chr8\\", start: 71780035, end: 71795956, aux: [\\"ENST00000557082.2\\", \\"1000\\", \\"-\\", \\"71780035\\", \\"71795956\\", \\"0,0,200\\", \\"4\\", \\"77,120,148,6,\\", \\"0,5046,13138,15915,\\"] } Thread 0 sending record Record { chrom: \\"chr8\\", start: 38174420, end: 38312141, aux: [\\"ENST00000555899.2\\", \\"1000\\", \\"-\\", \\"38174420\\", \\"38312141\\", \\"0,0,200\\", \\"13\\", \\"100,87,128,120,51,54,109,60,131,93,102,197,157,\\", \\"0,2936,5589,10016,12299,12452,13910,14932,15102,30621,37050,61630,137564,\\"] } is stuck there","output":"Based on the complete code and actual output you've provided, it seems like the reader is reading some records, but eventually the program gets stuck. Given that the \`println!(\\"Thread 0 finished\\")\` and \`println!(\\"Thread 0 sent None\\")\` messages are not printed, the \`while let Some(rs) = get_next_record(&reader)\` loop is not terminating correctly. It is also worth noting that you are using a synchronous channel (\`mpsc::sync_channel\`) with bounded capacity set to \`num_threads\`. With the current value of \`num_threads\` being \`1\`, this means the channel buffer can only hold one message at a time. When the thread sends a record and if the main thread doesn't read it from the channel before the next record is sent, the sender thread will block until the channel has space. Therefore, the sender will block if the receiver hasn't processed the previous message. The issue may stem from the potential processing delay in the receiver loop. The printing inside the receiving loop (\`println!(\\"{:?}\\", record);\`) alongside \`eprint!(\\"rRecords received: {}\\", received);\` could potentially slow down the receiver, causing a block on the sender (especially with buffered I/O like printing to the terminal). You can try the following measures to troubleshoot and potentially solve the problem: 1. Comment out the \`println!(\\"{:?}\\", record);\` statement in the receiving loop to reduce the output buffer delay. Remember that printing to the console can be slow and could affect the synchronization between sender and receiver. 2. Increase the capacity of the synchronous channel to allow more messages to be held if the receiver is slow. For example, try setting it to a larger number than \`num_threads\`: \`\`\`rust let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel(100); // Allow up to 100 messages in the channel buffer. \`\`\` 3. If the records are large, the serialization for printing might take a considerable amount of time, slowing down the reception. Consider printing only a simple counter or a small part of each record to check if this improves the flow. 4. You can add an additional println! in the receiver loop to be sure that the loop is progressing: \`\`\`rust println!(\\"About to receive...\\"); for rc in rx.iter() { println!(\\"Received message.\\"); // ... rest of the loop } \`\`\` 5. Ensure all I/O operations are closing correctly. You could potentially have a file handle open that's blocking further progress. Try these suggestions and observe the output. If the program is still getting stuck, it might be worthwhile to reduce the complexity of the interaction (e.g., by removing the threading aspect) to isolate the problem further, verifying that the \`bed::Records\` iterator progresses correctly without any threading involved."},{"instruction":"Please write an exciting sports story about a very muddy rugby match between two rival girls schools.

The pitch, already churned from matches past, was a patchwork of puddles and mire, the center looking more like a brown swamp than a field of green. At the outskirts, slightly firmer ground offered a brief reprieve, but it was the sludgy parts that were going to test the mettle of every player stepping onto the field. The St. Mary's Lions, clad in their striking blue and gold, faced the Westfield Warriors, donning their fierce red and white. Both teams were eager to prove their prowess, not in genteel sports typically associated with young ladies, but in the gritty, gruelling world of girls' rugby. From the get-go, the match was a display of sheer determination and camaraderie. The Westfield Warriors' captain, Harriet \\"The Hammer\\" Smith, led a charge that cut through the slop with precision, her boots sinking into the mud with each step. In response, the Lions' scrum-half, Fiona \\"The Flash\\" Foster, demonstrated her agility, darting around the muddiest patches with an uncanny sense of the field. The ball, slick with a mixture of rainwater and soil, was passed from hand to hand with fervor. Brushes and rucks were accompanied by splatters of flying mud, marking each player with badges of honor. Laughter echoed across the pitch as the girls slipped, slid, and tackled. Ella \\"The Elk\\" Jameson of St. Mary's made a break, her strides kicking up a shower of muck before being taken down by a textbook tackle from the Warriors' flanker, Ruby \\"Roughhouse\\" Thompson. By the half-time whistle, few could claim a spot of clean kit. The Westfield Warriors held a narrow lead, but the St. Mary's Lions were far from beaten. Sharing oranges amidst the mud, the players from both sides joked about possible new mud-based camouflage strategies. The second half saw the Lions shift the tide. Their lock, Samantha \\"Stalwart\\" Webb, intercepted a pass and barreled toward the try line, slipping out of grasps that simply couldn't find purchase in the sludge. The ever-persistent rain was now a mere afterthought as the scoreboard ticked over in favor of St. Mary's. As the minutes dwindled, the Warriors, shouldering their shields of caked-on earth and sweat, launched a series of attacks that would have daunted any faint heart. But the Lions' defense, now just as muddy and fierce, stood tall. Winifred \\"Winnie\\" Clarke made a daring run, splashing through a particularly treacherous puddle like a ship at high seas, only to be met by the indomitable fullback of St. Mary's, Natalie \\"No Quarter\\" Quinn, in a clash that rang out over the whoops of the crowd. The final play was a moment of pure rugby beauty, beginning with the Lions’ prop, Jessica \\"Juggernaut\\" Martin, digging deep for the ball in a scrum that seemed as if it had consumed her whole. She emerged like a mythical beast of lore, ball in hand, heaving towards the line. Then, with the grace of a gazelle albeit one caked in mud, Fiona weaved through the defense, touching down for the game-winning try. As the final whistle blew signaling a 15-12 victory for St. Mary's, it was clear that every single player emerged victorious, their faces beaming through the muck that adorned them. They shook hands and exchanged words of respect, their jerseys now uniformly brown regardless of their original colors. In the locker room, laughter and tales of the game's most valiant slides and spectacular slips filled the air. As the mud-caked warriors showered off the day’s battle, the chatter was not of victory or defeat but of the pure joy found in the mud-soaked chaos of that epic match between two rival schools, each as enamored with rugby as the other, each proud to play rough, get dirty, and defy the bounds of tradition."},{"instruction":"На англ: а сейчас давайте прослушаем аудио с произношением этих слов, чтобы лучше запомнить их.","output":"And now, let's listen to an audio with the pronunciation of these words to better memorize them."},{"instruction":"Отлично, ребята, дома вы выполняли упражнение 6 в вашем стюден буке.

Rugby had become the pulse of these schools, the heart of a fierce and muddy rivalry. It was the final match of the season, and the stakes were as high as the girls' spirits. The pitch at Westbridge was infamous, a quagmire at the centre field, with the wings slightly less treacherous, yet still sodden enough to ensure no player remained clean for long. The grey sky hung low, a promise of more rain to come - an invitation for more glorious mud. From the onset, the St. Helena's Scrum-halves, Lucy \\"Tank\\" Thompson and \\"Speedy\\" Sarah Jennings, led a fierce advance, driving their cleats into the soft, yielding earth. The Westbridge Warriors took position, with their formidable fullback, Emma \\"Hammer\\" Hopkins, bracing for the first onslaught. As the whistle blew, the dance of the rugby match commenced. Hardly five minutes in, and St. Helena's winger, Alicia \\"Bulldozer\\" Bramwell, plowed through Westbridge's defense, planting the first try of the game. The conditions only added to the thrill for Alicia as she rose, her uniform a badge of bewilderment, smeared from collar to boot in thick mud. Grit and determination shone on the faces of the Westbridge Warriors as they replied in kind. Their own halfback, Jodie \\"The Juggernaut\\" Lawson, stealing the ball from a ruck, charged through a slippery morass - dodging, weaving, and finally diving over the try line. She emerged from the ground, smiling triumphantly, her blonde hair now a tangled, earthen mat. With each ruck and maul, the pitch claimed more of their kits as its own. The girls displayed not an ounce of care for the grime that adorned them. Instead, shouts of laughter could be heard amidst the grunting and panting of exertion. By halftime, not a single white stripe remained on the striped jerseys of St. Helena's, nor could the crests of Westbridge be distinguished on the chests of their players. The second half began with equal fervor. Westbridge's indomitable lock, Chloe \\"Charger\\" Cartwright, secured a loose ball, splashing through a particularly nefarious puddle which had claimed many a player that day. Onlookers gasped as she disappeared momentarily, only to rise like a warrior of old, ball in hand and a mask of muck on her face. As the match wore on, the distinction between friend and foe blurred, giving way to the shared joy of the game. Every scrum was a spectacle, with girls emerging from entangled limbs with streaks of grime across their cheeks, each more eager than the last to reclaim the spheroid from the quagmire it so often sought. The minutes ticked away, and with St. Helena's clutching a slender lead, the Westbridge fly-half, Grace \\"Gladiator\\" Griffiths, executed a deft chip and chase. Hurtling after the wayward ball, she skidded through an especially swampy patch, scooped up the ball, and scored Westbridge's leveling try. Unfazed by her mud-caked visage, she punched the air, her teammates enveloping her in a muddy group hug. Amidst cheers and playful jeers, the muddy fray continued until the last whistle blew, declaring St. Helena's victorious by a mere conversion kick. Both teams, arm in arm, their faces indiscriminately painted by mud, grinned from ear to ear. The results were written not in the scorebooks, but in the splatters on their uniforms, the satisfaction in their tired muscles, and the unfettered joy of having played the game they loved, unconfined by convention and expectation. As the girls of St. Helena's hoisted the soggy trophy, and the two teams exchanged muddy handshakes, it wasn't just rivalry that was celebrated. It was the spirit of fun, the camaraderie found in friendly combat, and the sheer delight of a game well played in the gloriously messy trenches of their beloved rugby pitch."},{"instruction":"Format the following passage properly, for storytelling purposes: Glancing westward, I observe a picturesque sky reflected through a front door laced with fingerprints. The perfect shade of pastel blue, an immaculate backdrop against which the green and yellow leaves of a tree that is somehow flawlessly curved into the first letter of my name gently shake, the movements unpronounced yet still evident. A fine wind conducts a silent orchestra that somehow manages to have profound amplitude. Several birds chirp. Though I do not know what they sing of, I am nonetheless captivated by the elegance of their song. Not even two months ago, at 8:30 in the morning, I was either still asleep or just getting up. At that moment, I realize the difference between who I am today and who I was sixty days prior, and it comes in the form of one word: \\"action\\". It has two syllables and only takes a second or less to say, but it rings loudly in the human consciousness. Our spirit is drawn to it, stimulated by the promise it holds of a better tomorrow, but not everyone realizes that it is a doing word. We cannot throw it into the blender of our lexicon and use it thoughtlessly, the same way people have diluted the word 'legend' to such a degree that it no longer carries the same weight it once did in describing people, places, things and stories of renown. It is a word we activate through the decisions we make. At least for the moment, my life has been activated. Being in my thirties, I feel I have started to 'unlock' confidence I once lacked, as though it were a secret item in a video game. I have become more comfortable with myself, less irritated with the bells people ring. But the transformation did not begin overnight, and its conclusion will not be realized until I too am gone. Only two weeks after my mother passed away, the wheels of fate were turning, and drove me to a destination I could not have anticipated when I received a fateful phone call from Evelyn Falconer, the executive director and founder of the Boca Raton Achievement Center--though to I and the rest of the staff it's BRAC for short. As best as I can tell it, my mother's former employers had relied on a connection to one influential person, who in turn reached out to another person of influence, who called me on a luminescent Saturday afternoon to set up a meeting with me at my house. That meeting was the beginning of a partnership that continues to this day, as Evelyn has worked tirelessly to facilitate my transition from a place I've called home for more than half my life and a way of life within the confines of that place that has been the norm for nearly a decade. As of the time I write this I am not even two months into my current position as a front desk volunteer, but have already borne witness to another sort of transition: one longtime BRAC teacher was released as a result of extenuating circumstances, and another teacher--one whose courses had been taking place directly adjacent to where I work--ended up inheriting his classroom. The day on which I write this piece of the story is an interesting one, not only for that reason but for how busy it has turned out to be. Evelyn certainly gave me fair warning when she mentioned it on the way here. A young man and his parents took a tour of BRAC, and a student who had been 'missing in action' for a bit made a most unexpected, and certainly welcome, comeback! While the atmosphere has already become a little bit quieter in my cozy little corner of this floating rock, I'll miss hearing the laughter of the students who have moved over to the new classroom; the old one will be repurposed as a conference room (which, ironically, is the purpose it originally served when BRAC opened its doors). For what little it's worth, I can turn my music up a little bit louder...my mood shifts from jazz to rock, depending on whether I'm looking for some extra sonic motivation or simply want to relax a little bit. Just as the songs testify to lives well lived for the musicians who made them, I seek to justify myself too.","output":"Glancing westward, I observe a picturesque sky reflected through a front door laced with fingerprints.

The sum of 18.750 Million USD is indeed significant, and the assurance of its forthcoming release provides great anticipation. I am glad to hear that we should expect the documents to be available by Thursday. Your updates are a vital link in maintaining the momentum of our collaboration, and I look forward to them with much interest. I acknowledge the payment to the solicitor, and as discussed, I would request a receipt or some form of written acknowledgment from their office. It serves both to satisfy the record-keeping aspect of our interaction and to offer tangible proof of our progress. Thank you once more for reiterating the confidentiality of this transaction.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, It is with significant anticipation that I write to you today. Receiving the bitcoin information represents a substantial step forward in our budding relationship. Rest assured, I hold the integrity of this transaction in the highest regard. As for the payment, the sum of 166,200 is ready for transfer. However, before proceeding with such a substantial financial engagement via bitcoin - a medium that is inherently secure yet irreversible - I must perform due diligence with my financial advisor regarding the receipt of the correct address and barcode image. I have a policy to ensure no mistakes in payment; I double-check all information against potential typographical errors or digital image discrepancies. Per this policy, your patience is kindly requested as my IT team conducts a thorough verification of the barcode attached. This is merely routine and serves to underscore our shared commitment to a secure and successful exchange. I will send you the screenshot of the payment receipt as soon as the verification process is complete and the funds have been transferred. I trust you appreciate the caution exercised on my part - as it mirrors the vigilance you, no doubt, would expect in safeguarding your own business interests. Please allow me a short span of time to finalize the preparations on my end. Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated and I fully intend to foster a long-standing business relationship upon the foundation of meticulousness and mutual confidence.

Rest assured, I am deeply committed to our agreement and am very much still engaged in this venture. My delay is due to the careful checks currently being undertaken by my financial advisory team to ensure the safety and accuracy of our bitcoin transaction. As you're aware, the intricate nature of bitcoin transfers requires that all bases be covered, as the reassurance of precision is necessary for a transaction of such magnitude. I appreciate your patience during this time and understand that this business represents a significant opportunity for both parties; hence my dedication to getting this crucial step right. My team and I are working diligently, and I am optimistic that we will be in a position to proceed with the transfer soon. Please rest assured that your holding of the said 5 kilograms for me does not go unvalued. I would like to reiterate my continued interest in the purchase and am proceeding with haste and caution in equal measure. Expect to receive all necessary confirmations, including a snapshot of the payment receipt, upon completion of the verification process.

Era um ônibus, um artefato urbano de tempos idos, cuja lataria puída denunciava anos de peregrinação sem destino certo. O assento, de um tecido que outrora fora vermelho, mostrava-se agora desbotado e resignado ao toque de inúmeras existências transitórias, influindo sutilmente na minha percepção com seu cheiro de mofo, uma fragrância da decadência avassaladora. As janelas daquela carruagem de rumos desconhecidos filtravam o mundo externo através de sua sujidade impressionista; uma patina que obscurecia a visão das paisagens que mudavam com a inconstância dos caprichos do tempo. O veículo deslizava por caminhos que se desenrolavam adiante, escondendo-se e revelando-se sob o capricho das folhagens que tremulavam nos flancos da via. Em cada paragem, o ônibus parecia engolir e cuspir almas perdidas, cada qual imersa em seu turbilhão de cogitações insondáveis, um microcosmo de destinos entrelaçados pela casualidade da existência. Apesar da tangibilidade daqueles materiais e da fisicalidade de meus companheiros de jornada, havia um indizível desprendimento que permeava minha consciência, uma percepção de estranhamento tal que me fazia duvidar da própria realidade dos fenômenos que me circundavam. Cada vibração do motor, cada rangido desolado da estrutura do veículo, cada murmúrio ininteligível dos passageiros, nada disso parecia reivindicar com legitimidade sua presença no reino do concreto. O éter fora do ônibus jogava com as possibilidades da luz, sombras se estendiam e retraíam, pinceladas por uma entidade artista que se ocultava nas cortinas do horizonte. A terra, na sua extensão indefinível, parecia se levantar e declinar em um sussurro geológico que, em minha efêmera apreensão, desvendava-se como um palimpsesto intocável de histórias.

He is posh, tender and playful. His younger brother did something bad and his parents asked him to ground him while they're going out. He punishes him by making him to polish his boots while he comfortably sits on a armchair, caressing his riding crop while casually telling his brother about his day.

Light streams through the windows, illuminating the figure of ARTHUR, a dashing young equestrian from the 19th century. His blonde hair is slicked back perfectly, and his piercing blue eyes scan the room with a tender yet mischievous glint. He's dressed immaculately in a vibrant red riding jacket, crisp white gloves, neatly tailored white pants, and shining black leather riding boots with spurs that glint with every patient movement. ARTHUR sits regally on a high-backed armchair, a symbol of his authority in the absence of his parents. Standing over him is SIMON, his younger brother from the modern day, who looks entirely out of place with his jet-black emo haircut and rebellious demeanor. His contemporary clothing clashes with the room's antiquated decor, as he scowls at the task before him. ARTHUR (smirking) Simon, you know the importance of keeping one’s equipment in prime condition, don't you? SIMON rolls his eyes before picking up a soft cloth and a tin of polish. He reluctantly begins to buff Arthur’s boots, his movements lazy and disinterested. SIMON (muttering) Yeah, whatever. Arthur lifts his riding crop, caressing it absentmindedly as he crosses his legs with a smooth motion, the boots catching the light as Simon works. Simon grimaces and polishes harder to avoid his brother's gaze. ARTHUR (playfully admonishing) Careful, dear brother. A proper shine reflects the soul of a gentleman. Not that you'd know, with your rebellious streak. SIMON (grumpy) I'm not some 19th-century dandy. Why do I have to do this again? Arthur chuckles, the tone still warm and brotherly despite the clear dynamic of temporary authority. ARTHUR Because, my dear Simon, parents entrusted me with the task of grounding you. And I do believe a little discipline wouldn't hurt. Arthur leans forward, resting his chin on the handle of his riding crop, eyes fixed on Simon with a playful but expectant look. ARTHUR (continuing) Besides, as long as you're tending to my boots, you can't very well get into more trouble, can you? Simon scoffs, but there’s a reluctant respect in his eyes for Arthur’s cleverness. SIMON I guess not. Arthur leans back, satisfied with the obedience, even if it's begrudging. ARTHUR (casually) So, as you labor away, let me tell you about my day. The hounds were positively restless, and you should have seen the fox— Simon continues to polish the boots, but a ghost of a smile tugs at his lips as Arthur recounts his adventures with animated gestures.

Even the clothes are stiff as hell. ARTHUR (curious) And what of your time? What is this \\"emo fashion\\" you speak of? SIMON (with a hint of pride) It's all about expression, you know? Dark clothes, tight jeans, band tees. It's more than style; it's a statement. Arthur chuckles, intrigued by the concept but skeptical of its practicality.

SIMON (nodding in agreement) Yeah, I get that. My history teacher, Mr. Thompson, he drones on and on. Makes me want to bolt for the door. Arthur raises an eyebrow, a smirk playing on his lips.

The pitch at St. Helena's was notoriously treacherous after heavy rains, and today, it was a delightful quagmire, perfect for the number one sporting event of the season. As the girls from both schools charged onto the soggy turf, the difference between the two halves of the field was stark. The eastern side by St. Helena's goal posts was a veritable swamp, while the western side, though soggy, offered slightly more stability. Undaunted by the conditions, the girls were keen to showcase the rough-and-tumble skills that made them shun the more demure games typically associated with their sex. The whistle blew, and the match began with a fury. Eleanor \\"Tank\\" Thompson of Riverview barreled through puddles, her jersey transforming from pristine white to a muddy brown within moments. St. Helena's star fullback, Sophie \\"the Sprinter\\" Sinclair, replied with agility, skipping over muddy pools when she could, but more often than not, charging through, flecks of mud adorning her cheeks like war paint. As the game progressed, the ball became a slippery eel, eluding capture as the girls from both sides wrestled for control. By halftime, no one could deny the splotches of earth that plastered every player. St. Helena's Grace Anderson made a critical line-break early in the second half, but a tumble into the muddiest patch by the try-line left her looking less like a schoolgirl and more like a mud sculpture. The spectators, a mix of fellow students and proud family members, cheered with equal parts excitement and amusement. None was clean, and not a single girl cared. As if inspired by the crowd's enthusiasm, Riverview's Jasmine \\"the Juggernaut\\" Lee, carried the ball over for a try, diving headlong into a puddle that sent a spray of mud into the air, eliciting a roar from the crowd as the scoreboard ticked in favor of Riverview. With minutes to spare, tension mounted, St. Helena's was trailing by a mere three points. A surge of determination rippled through the team. The ball was passed to Lara \\"Lightning\\" Lonsdale, who dodged and weaved through the opposition. Her braids were no longer ginger but a muddied brown as she planted the ball behind the muddy line for the decisive try. The game ended with St. Helena's victorious by a hair's breadth. Both teams, unrecognizable under their newfound layers of mud, shared heartfelt handshakes and hugs, knowing that they had not just played a match, but had reveled in the pure joy of their beloved sport. Back in the changing rooms, the hot showers did little to dampen their spirits, pun intended, as tales of muddy heroics echoed off the walls accompanied by laughter. On this day, the girls from St. Helena's and Riverview Ladies' College had not simply played rugby; they had celebrated everything they loved about their game, with not a grimly serious face in sight."},{"instruction":"please provide a detailed description suitable for giving to an artist for about half a dozen cartoon/comic strip style illustrations to accompany the story. describe each panel, which players are in that panel, what they look like (how muddy are they? color of kit? etc), what the ground is like, what they are saying and doing (eg diving into a mud puddle to ground the ball with a giant splash).","output":"Panel 1: \\"The Opening Charge\\" - Illustration of the kick-off with both teams charging towards the midfield line where the ball has just landed.

Material for Core layer is to be dumped and compacted. amount of material is 5138.2 tons. breakwater is 100m long. assume you will be dumping material in 4 sections each 25 long. each truck will have a capacity of 15 tons.there are 4 trucks. how many days will it take to fill up each section. how many days will it take for the whole length?","output":"First, let's calculate the number of truckloads required to transport the total material: Total material: 5138.2 tons Truck capacity: 15 tons/truck Number of truckloads: 5138.2 tons / 15 tons/truck = 342.5467 Since we cannot have a fraction of a truckload, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 343 truckloads (since trucks can't transport fractional loads). Now, let's calculate how much material will be needed for each of the 4 sections: Since each section is a quarter of the total length (100m / 4), each will require a quarter of the total material: Material per section: 5138.2 tons / 4 = 1284.55 tons/section Next, let's calculate the number of truckloads per section: Truckloads per section: 1284.55 tons/section / 15 tons/truck = 85.6367 Again, we will round up since we can't have a fraction of a truckload, so that's 86 truckloads per section. Now, we must consider that there are 4 trucks operating. Let's calculate how many trips are made per day by these trucks. This would generally depend on a number of factors, including the distance from the material source to the construction site, loading and unloading time, traffic conditions, working hours, and operational efficiency. For the sake of this example, let's make some assumptions. Let's say each truck can make 3 round trips per day (which considers loading, travel, unloading, and return). This could be a low estimate, but actual productivity could vary. This means each day, the 4 trucks can collectively make: 3 trips/day/truck * 4 trucks = 12 trips/day Now, let's determine how many days it will take to complete one section: Truckloads per section: 86 truckloads Trips per day: 12 trips/day Days per section: 86 truckloads / 12 trips/day = 7.1667 days/section Since the work can't be completed in a fraction of a day and typically you wouldn't split a truckload over two days, we round up to 8 days to complete one section with 4 trucks making 3 trips each per day. Now let's calculate the total time for all four sections: Days for all sections: 8 days/section * 4 sections = 32 days It would take 32 days to complete the dumping and compacting for the entire 100m length of breakwater if each section takes 8 days to complete.

It’s used as a ping-pong buffer for the sorting process. # The Radix Sort Process The kernel performs a bitwise radix sort on a warp level: 1. Each thread loads a value from global memory (\`ddata\`) into shared memory (\`sdata\`). 2. The \`bitmask\` variable is initially set to isolate the least significant bit (LSB). 3. The \`offset\` variable is used to switch between the two halves of the shared memory ping-pong buffer. 4. The \`thrmask\` is a thread-specific mask used to obtain the position of \`zeroes\` in the sorting step. 5. It then sorts the data based on each bit, from LSB to most significant bit (MSB). This is where the radix sort operates by redistributing the data into two halves: one with zeroes at the current bit position and one with ones. 6. The \`__ballot(mybit)\` operation collectively gathers bit values from all the threads in the warp and returns a 32-bit mask indicating which threads had '1' in their data for the current bit. 7. \`__popc(...)\` counts the number of set bits in its argument, and it’s used to calculate the correct position of each element after the sort. 8. After the loop, sorted data is written back to global memory. # Main Function The \`main\` function does the following: 1. Initializes an array \`hdata\` in the host memory (CPU memory) and fills it with random numbers. 2. Copies \`hdata\` to the device symbol \`ddata\`. 3. Launches the sorting kernel \`mykernel\`. 4. Copies sorted data from \`ddata\` back to \`hdata\`. 5. Checks if the data is sorted correctly. 6. If sorting error is detected, it stops and prints an error message. 7. If all iterations are successful, it prints \\"Success!\\". # Error Checking and Printing - Inside the loop in the \`main\` function, the program checks if the array \`hdata\` has been sorted properly. If not, an error message is printed, and the program exits. - If everything is sorted correctly after all loops, the sorted data is printed out. # CUDA-specific Functions - \`cudaMemcpyToSymbol\` and \`cudaMemcpyFromSymbol\` are CUDA routines for copying data between host and device symbol memory. - \`<<<1, WSIZE>>>\` specifies the kernel launch configuration, where there will be 1 block of \`WSIZE\` threads updating \`ddata\`. Since the sorting is performed on warp-level, it uses the CUDA warp size (32 threads) for optimality. # Notes The code appears to assume that the hardware will execute each warp in lockstep, which is usually true but not guaranteed across different architectures. Also, it's assumed that \`WSIZE\` will be equal to the warp size for effective sorting. Since this is a toy example of how radix sort can be parallelized, in practice, you might want to use more sophisticated, optimized, and robust algorithms, particularly for larger data sets and utilization of global memory and warp shuffle functions available in newer compute capabilities."},{"instruction":"Перепиши символами: Для определения температуры газа в баллоне можно использовать уравнение состояния идеального газа, которое выглядит следующим образом: [ PV = nRT ] где: - (P) — давление газа (в паскалях, Па), - (V) — объем газа (в кубических метрах, м³), - (n) — количество вещества газа (в молях), - (R) — универсальная газовая постоянная ((8,31 Дж/(моль·К))), - (T) — температура газа (в кельвинах, К).

Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson \\"tout va bien\\" de Orelsan","output":"Bonjour! La chanson \\"Tout va bien\\" d'Orelsan aborde divers aspects de la réalité contemporaine, évoquant le contraste entre les apparences et le ressenti intérieur, les pressions sociales et les problèmes mondiaux. La chanson invite à une réflexion sur la manière dont les gens affichent souvent un masque de bien-être malgré les difficultés internes et externes. En effet, il y a un contraste saisissant entre les paroles de cette chanson et une perspective biblique. Par exemple, on peut faire un parallèle avec le verset biblique suivant: \\"Car rien n'est caché, qui ne sera révélé; ni rien de secret qui ne sera connu et ne viendra à la lumière.\\" (Luc 8:17) Ce verset suggère que la vérité finit toujours par émerger, malgré les tentatives des individus de dissimuler leurs vrais sentiments ou situations. Dans \\"Tout va bien\\", Orelsan décrit comment on peut prétendre que tout va bien alors que, dans les faits, on est confronté à une multitude de problèmes et de préoccupations. La chanson peut être interprétée comme un appel à la sincérité et à l'authenticité. Elle met en évidence la nécessité d'aborder ouvertement nos problèmes plutôt que de les ignorer ou de les enfouir sous une façade de bien-être. Cela fait écho à l'idée biblique selon laquelle la vérité et l'honnêteté sont primordiales, et que la lumière finit par révéler ce qui est caché. D'un autre côté, la Bible enseigne également l'espoir et la confiance, notamment au milieu des épreuves. Par exemple: \\"Quand je marche dans la vallée de l'ombre de la mort, Je ne crains aucun mal, car tu es avec moi: Ta houlette et ton bâton me rassurent.\\" (Psaumes 23:4) Cela indique qu'au lieu de s'enfermer dans une posture où \\"tout va bien\\" alors que ce n'est pas le cas, on peut s'appuyer sur la foi et la confiance en la présence rassurante de Dieu pour traverser les moments difficiles. Autrement dit, la Bible ne demande pas de prétendre que tout va bien, mais offre plutôt un soutien et un réconfort pour affronter les réalités de la vie. Ainsi, la réflexion sur la chanson \\"Tout va bien\\" d'Orelsan et le verset biblique nous amène à considérer l'importance de la transparence face aux défis de la vie tout en puisant la force et l'espoir non pas dans une façade, mais dans la vérité et la foi authentiques."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer” de Calogero. Theme principal l'absence du père en parallèle avec l'amour de Dieu le Père qui est fidèle.","output":"La chanson \\"Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer\\" de Calogero évoque le sentiment de manque et de douleur ressenti par un enfant face à l'absence de son père. Cette émotion poignante trouve un écho profond dans de nombreuses expériences humaines, où l'on peut ressentir un vide causé par la distance, l'inattention ou l'absence d'une figure parentale. En comparant cette situation avec le concept biblique de Dieu en tant que Père aimant et toujours présent, le verset suivant vient immédiatement à l'esprit : « N’avez-vous jamais lu ce texte de l’Écriture ? Le Seigneur a déclaré : C’est moi qui suis le père d’Israël, Éphraïm est mon fils aîné. » (Jérémie 31:9) Ce verset illustre l'amour inconditionnel et fidèle de Dieu pour ses enfants. Contrairement à l'expérience d'abandon décrite dans la chanson de Calogero, Dieu se présente comme un Père qui ne cesse jamais de rechercher et de chérir ses enfants. La réflexion ici peut tourner autour de l'antithèse entre l'abandon terrestre et la promesse d'une présence divine éternelle. Tandis que \\"Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer\\" exprime un désir profond d'être aimé et chéri par un père absent, les Écritures proposent une source de réconfort pour ceux qui se sentent délaissés. Ainsi, ce verset de Jérémie renforce l'espoir et offre une alternative à la figure patriarcale manquante, celle d'un Père céleste qui entend les appels de détresse de ses enfants et s'engage à les soutenir. Dans la Bible, Dieu est souvent décrit comme un refuge et un soutien pour les orphelins et pour tous ceux qui sont dans le besoin : « Père des orphelins, défenseur des veuves, tel est Dieu dans sa sainte demeure. » (Psaumes 68:6) La douleur de l'absence et du manque exprimée par Calogero peut ainsi être juxtaposée à la promesse biblique d'un amour divin constant et réconfortant. Le parallèle entre l'inconstance humaine et la fidélité divine offre une perspective de guérison. Elle rappelle que, malgré les déceptions et les blessures que l'on peut subir dans nos relations terrestres, l'amour de Dieu le Père est toujours accessible et ne nous fait jamais défaut. En somme, la chanson de Calogero associée à la promesse divine crée un dialogue riche entre la quête humaine d'une figure paternelle aimante et la réalité d'un Dieu qui s'offre comme un Père éternellement fidèle, capable de combler même les désirs les plus intimes de ses enfants pour l'amour, la présence et la reconnaissance."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer” de Calogero. Theme principal la dépression et maladies mentales","output":"La chanson \\"Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer\\" de Calogero exprime les sentiments douloureux d'abandon et de manque de reconnaissance d'un enfant envers son père, évoquant les luttes internes qui peuvent mener à la dépression et autres difficultés de santé mentale. La solitude, le sentiment de ne pas être valorisé et les questionnements sur l'amour familial peuvent alimenter un cycle de souffrance psychologique. En se référant à ces thèmes, il est possible de trouver un parallèle dans la Bible, où l'on trouve de nombreux passages qui parlent de souffrance, de réconfort et de guérison. Un verset reflétant l'idée de lutte interne et le besoin de soutien est: \\"Venez à moi, vous tous qui êtes fatigués et chargés, et je vous donnerai du repos.\\" (Matthieu 11:28) Ce verset peut être interprété comme un appel de Jésus à ceux qui sont accablés, non seulement par des fardeaux physiques mais aussi émotionnels et psychologiques. La dépression et les maladies mentales sont des fardeaux qui pèsent lourdement sur l'esprit et l'âme, et le message de réconfort et de soulagement contenu dans ce passage offre une lueur d'espoir. La réflexion ici consiste à reconnaître que bien que la chanson articule une douleur profondément personnelle et souvent invisible aux yeux des autres, l'invitation biblique est celle d'un Dieu qui voit au-delà de nos facades externes et offre un réconfort qui pénètre l'intérieur de notre être. C'est un rappel que pour ceux qui souffrent de dépression et de maladies mentales, il existe une source de guérison et de repos, qui ne juge pas mais accueille avec compassion. La Bible fournit également des exemples de personnages qui ont éprouvé de la détresse émotionnelle et mentale, comme le roi David, qui a composé de nombreux psaumes exprimant sa douleur et sa recherche de secours : \\"Pourquoi es-tu abattue, ô mon âme ? Pourquoi gémis-tu en moi? Espère en Dieu ! Car je le louerai encore; Il est mon salut et mon Dieu.\\" (Psaumes 42:11) Face à la dépression et aux maladies mentales, la chanson de Calogero et le verset du Psaume expriment un thème commun de quête de soulagement et d'espoir. Ils illustrent comment l'expression artistique et la spiritualité peuvent offrir des espaces pour affronter et verbaliser la douleur, ainsi que chercher et trouver un certain réconfort. En synthèse, les thèmes abordés dans \\"Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer\\" et le verset de Matthieu 11:28 peuvent inspirer une perspective où, malgré les défis de la dépression et des maladies mentales, il existe un appel universel à chercher le repos et le réconfort. La promesse d'une présence divine et réconfortante offre non seulement un espoir, mais aussi une invitation à un repos profond pour ceux qui portent des charges intérieures lourdes."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “l'enfer” de Stromae. Theme principal la dépression et maladies mentales","output":"La chanson \\"L'enfer\\" de Stromae touchent avec une acuité remarquable le sujet de la dépression et des maladies mentales, en abordant les pensées sombres et l'isolement qui peuvent accompagner ces états. Avec ses paroles sincères et explicites, Stromae partage sa propre lutte intérieure, dévoilant une vulnérabilité qui est souvent masquée par honte ou par peur du jugement. Un verset biblique qui peut être mis en parallèle avec cette expérience de souffrance intérieure est le Psaume 34:18 : \\"L’Éternel est près de ceux qui ont le cœur brisé, Et il sauve ceux qui ont l’esprit abattu.\\" Ce verset témoigne de la proximité divine face à la souffrance humaine, promettant présence et secours à ceux qui traversent des moments de profonde détresse. Alors que les paroles de \\"L'enfer\\" dépeignent un tableau sombre d'une bataille mentale, ce verset offre un contraste réconfortant en proposant une présence aimante et salvatrice à portée de main dans les moments de plus grand besoin. La réflexion ici consiste à reconnaitre que la dépression et les maladies mentales sont de réelles afflictions qui peuvent conduire à une profonde désolation de l'âme. Stromae, par ses paroles, rompt le silence sur ces questions, et offre un écho à tous ceux qui ressentent cette douleur. Le message du Psaume résonne comme une réponse à cet appel au secours – une réassurance que même dans la profondeur de notre angoisse, on n'est jamais totalement abandonné. Cette réflexion met également en lumière le pouvoir de la musique et de la foi comme sources de catharsis et de guérison. Tandis que Stromae utilise l'art pour exprimer et partager sa lutte, ouvrant un dialogue sur des sujets souvent considérés comme tabous, le verset offre une perspective spirituelle, offrant espoir et consolation pour ceux qui souffrent en silence. Il est important de reconnaitre le pouvoir des mots, qu'ils soient ceux d'une chanson ou d'un texte sacré, à offrir du réconfort et de la compréhension. En évoquant les ténèbres avec une telle franchise, on réalise que l'admission de la douleur est souvent le premier pas vers la guérison. La Bible, à travers le Psaume 34:18, et la chanson \\"L'enfer\\" de Stromae, rappellent deux aspects fondamentaux : nous ne sommes pas seuls dans nos combats, et il existe une source de force qui dépasse notre souffrance personnelle. En résumé, \\"L'enfer\\" de Stromae, couplé au message du Psaume, illustre l'universalité de la lutte contre la dépression et les maladies mentales, tout en offrant une lueur d'espoir en la possibilité d'une présence consolatrice et guérissante, que l'on peut trouver dans la foi, l'art, la communauté et, le cas échéant, l'intervention médicale."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “coeurdonnier” de Soprano.","output":"La chanson \\"Coeurdonnier\\" de Soprano offre une métaphore riche et puissante de la guérison et du pardon, dans un monde marqué par la douleur et les blessures émotionnelles. Avec des mots qui appellent à réparer les coeurs brisés et à panser les plaies de l'âme, Soprano assume le rôle de \\"coeurdonnier\\" dans une quête d'altruisme et d'amour universel. Un verset biblique qui résonne avec le thème de cette chanson est Esaïe 61:1 : \\"L'esprit du Seigneur, l’Éternel, est sur moi, parce que l’Éternel m’a oint pour annoncer de bonnes nouvelles aux humbles ; Il m’a envoyé pour guérir ceux qui ont le cœur brisé...\\" Ce verset concerne la mission du Messie, qui est annoncée comme une mission de guérison et de réconfort pour les affligés. De manière similaire, \\"Coeurdonnier\\" suggère que chacun de nous peut avoir un impact positif sur le monde en offrant de l'amour, de la compréhension et une main tendue à ceux qui souffrent. Tout comme la figure messianique dans Esaïe, Soprano invite à être un instrument de guérison, soulignant l'importance d'une compassion solidaire dans nos interrelations. La réflexion sur \\"Coeurdonnier\\" pourrait se centrer sur le pouvoir de l'individu à apporter des changements positifs dans la vie d'autrui, en répandant l'espérance et la bienveillance. Le verset d'Esaïe renforce l'idée que chacun est capable de devenir un agent de guérison, peu importe la foi personnelle. Il s'agit d'adopter une posture de soutien et d'encouragement envers ceux qui ont rencontré des difficultés ou qui traversent des temps de détresse. \\"Coeurdonnier\\" et Esaïe 61:1 partagent une vision commune du service désintéressé et de la guérison comme vocations essentielles pour améliorer le monde. Cela rappelle que derrière chaque visage, il peut y avoir une histoire de douleur et que nous avons la capacité – presque la responsabilité – de contribuer à la guérison collective. Ainsi, l'association entre \\"Coeurdonnier\\" et les Écritures fait écho à la conviction que tous, nous sommes appelés à être des coeurdonniers à notre manière, en utilisant les dons de compassion, d'écoute et d'actions positives pour réconforter et restaurer les coeurs endommagés par la vie. Que ce soit par la foi, à travers l'art, le service communautaire ou les interactions du quotidien, nous avons le potentiel de contribuer à un monde plus bienveillant et plus guéri."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “coeurdonnier” de Soprano. Exemple de Jésus","output":"Dans la chanson \\"Coeurdonnier\\" de Soprano, l'artiste parle de réparer les coeurs brisés et de redonner de l'espoir à ceux qui souffrent, une mission qui évoque un thème d'empathie, de guérison et d'amour qui est également central dans les enseignements de Jésus. Un verset qui correspond à ce rôle de guérisseur des coeurs est trouvé dans l'Évangile selon Matthieu : \\"Venez à moi, vous tous qui êtes fatigués et chargés, et je vous donnerai du repos.\\" (Matthieu 11:28) Dans cette invitation, Jésus se présente comme le guérisseur ultime, offrant repos et soulagement à ceux qui sont affligés. Il offre de soulager les fardeaux, non seulement physiques mais aussi émotionnels et spirituels. Le coeurdonnier dont parle Soprano peut être vu comme une métaphore de cette figure de réconfort et d'apaisement que Jésus représente. En réfléchissant au message de \\"Coeurdonnier\\", on peut voir le reflet des actions de Jésus, qui, tout au long de son ministère, a touché les vies de nombreux individus avec compassion et miséricorde. Il n'a pas seulement guéri des maux physiques, mais a également apporté un réconfort psychologique et spirituel, enseignant l'amour et le pardon, et redonnant l'espoir à ceux qui en avaient perdu tout signe. En écho à ce message, le rôle de \\"coeurdonnier\\" suggère que tout un chacun peut suivre cet exemple de Jésus, en étant une force de guérison dans le monde. Il s'agit d'une invitation à tisser des liens d'empathie, à écouter sincèrement, et à être présent pour les autres dans un geste d'amour altruiste. La chanson de Soprano, lorsqu'elle est associée à l'exemple de Jésus, nous inspire à réfléchir à nos propres capacités à être des coeurdonniers dans notre quotidien. Les paroles encouragent à regarder au-delà de nos préoccupations personnelles pour voir les besoins de ceux qui nous entourent, et à prendre des actions concrètes pour alléger la souffrance, tout comme Jésus l'a fait. Ainsi, en incarnant l'esprit du \\"coeurdonnier\\", en étendant la main vers ceux qui ont besoin de guérison, nous mettons en pratique le commandement suprême que Jésus a donné à ses disciples : \\"Je vous donne un commandement nouveau: Aimez-vous les uns les autres. Comme je vous ai aimés, vous aussi, aimez-vous les uns les autres.\\" (Jean 13:34) Dans cette perspective, \\"Coeurdonnier\\" devient plus qu'une chanson ; c'est un appel à vivre selon l'amour et l'empathie, à prendre le rôle de guérisseurs de coeurs, à la manière de Jésus, cherchant à répandre le bien autour de nous, à panser les blessures invisibles et à propager l'espérance par nos actes quotidiens de bonté et de compassion."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “le chien et le flacon” de lonepsi. Exemple de Jésus","output":"La chanson \\"Le Chien et le Flacon\\" de Lonepsi examine la quête de sens et la vacuité que l'on peut ressentir dans la poursuite de plaisirs ou de réponses superficielles. Les paroles poétiques explorent la confrontation entre un désir inné pour quelque chose de plus profond et l'insatisfaction que procurent souvent les choses du monde matériel. Cette quête de profondeur et de sens dans la vie trouve un écho dans les enseignements de Jésus, notamment dans ce verset de l'Évangile selon Jean : \\"Je suis le chemin, la vérité, et la vie. Nul ne vient au Père que par moi.\\" (Jean 14:6) Ici, Jésus affirme être la source de vérité ultime et du chemin vers une existence pleine et significative. Dans \\"Le Chien et le Flacon\\", Lonepsi pourrait être interprété comme un observateur qui constate la manière dont les plaisirs fugaces attirent mais ne satisfont pas pleinement, tout comme un chien pourrait être fasciné par l'odeur d'un flacon sans y trouver ce qu'il cherche réellement. Le parallèle avec l'exemple de Jésus est que, tout comme Lonepsi évoque une certaine tristesse face à des distractions superficielles, Jésus propose un chemin qui mène vers une satisfaction plus profonde et durable. La chanson interroge sur ce que nous choisissons de poursuivre et sur ce qui en vaut vraiment la peine. En réfléchissant sur ces paroles à la lumière de l'exemple de Jésus, on peut considérer la manière dont la spiritualité et la foi peuvent offrir une alternative aux réponses éphémères rencontrées dans le monde matériel. Jésus, par sa vie et son ministère, s'est concentré sur ce qui peut combler l'âme plutôt que de simplement satisfaire des désirs temporaires. De plus, Jésus a montré, par son exemple de service et d'amour désintéressé, que trouver sa valeur dans l'amour pour les autres et dans la recherche d'une vérité transcendantale est un antidote puissant à la vacuité du matérialisme. L'appel à suivre Jésus est un appel à rechercher une compréhension plus grande de la vie et de notre place dans le monde. La connexion entre \\"Le Chien et le Flacon\\" et l'exemple de Jésus nous interpelle sur ce qui mérite réellement notre attention et notre dévouement. Alors que le monde peut offrir de nombreuses distractions ressemblant au parfum captivant d'un flacon, Jésus offre un parcours qui promet une véritable plénitude et un sens profond à ceux qui le suivent. La chanson de Lonepsi, tout en ne faisant pas nécessairement une démarche spirituelle, se révèle dans cette réflexion comme une invitation à repenser nos priorités, nous inspirant à chercher au-delà de l'apparence séduisante et à trouver un fondement qui dépasse la superficialité, un fondement que beaucoup trouvent dans les enseignements et la personne de Jésus."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “le chien et le flacon” de lonepsi.","output":"\\"Le Chien et le Flacon\\" de Lonepsi est une chanson qui plonge dans le symbolisme et la métaphore pour explorer la poursuite du sens et les désirs inassouvis. La chanson n'aborde pas directement des thèmes bibliques, mais on peut y trouver des résonances avec certains messages de la Bible concernant la vanité des poursuites mondaines et la recherche de ce qui est véritablement précieux. Un verset qui peut servir de point de réflexion en parallèle avec cette chanson est le suivant: \\"Que sert-il à un homme de gagner tout le monde, s'il perd son âme ?\\" (Marc 8:36) Ce verset pose une question fondamentale sur la nature des priorités humaines et de ce qui est vraiment important dans la vie. Il nous pousse à considérer la valeur de nos âmes par rapport aux choses matérielles et temporaires que nous pourrions chercher à acquérir ou à atteindre. En méditant sur le contenu de \\"Le Chien et le Flacon\\", nous sommes invités à réfléchir sur ce que nous cherchons à saisir dans nos propres vies. La chanson décrit le chien, qui est intrigué par les senteurs qui émanent du flacon mais qui ne peut en percevoir le contenu réel. De même, nous pouvons être attirés par des choses qui semblent promettre du bonheur ou du sens, mais qui, à l'expérience, se révèlent vides ou insatisfaisantes. L'approche de Lonepsi, dans sa chanson, offre une illustration poétique du désir humain de comprendre et de trouver un but, et ce verset de Marc nous incite à questionner la valeur de nos ambitions et de nos quêtes. Il nous appelle à une introspection sur la vraie richesse de la vie, qui ne se trouve pas dans les choses périssables, mais plutôt dans la santé de notre âme et dans notre relation avec ce qui est éternel et significatif. La chanson et le verset ensemble soulèvent la question de nos aspirations dans la vie. Dans un monde où les distractions sont nombreuses et les promesses de satisfaction sont grandes, il est facile de se perdre dans la quête de plaisirs éphémères qui ne satisfont pas les besoins profonds de l'âme. \\"Le Chien et le Flacon\\", par ses paroles contemplatives, et le verset de Marc, par sa question percutante, nous invitent à chercher un but et une satisfaction qui se trouvent en dehors des récompenses et des reconnaissances terrestres. Ils nous encouragent à mettre l'accent sur ce qui compte réellement et à poursuivre les valeurs éternelles, telles que la sagesse, l'amour, et la paix intérieure – des trésors de l'esprit qui enrichissent non seulement nos vies, mais aussi celles des autres autour de nous."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “ça va aller” de Terrenoire.","output":"La chanson \\"Ça va aller\\" de Terrenoire exprime une espérance teintée de mélancolie, une lueur d'espoir dans des temps de doute et de difficulté. La notion que, malgré les épreuves, un réconfort peut être trouvé et que les choses peuvent s'améliorer, est un thème qui trouve son écho dans de nombreux passages de la Bible. Un verset qui reflète cet esprit d'espérance au milieu des tribulations est tiré de la lettre aux Romains: \\"Or, l’espérance ne trompe pas, parce que l’amour de Dieu est répandu dans nos cœurs par l’Esprit Saint qui nous a été donné.\\" (Romains 5:5) Dans ce verset, l'apôtre Paul parle de l'espérance qui est ancrée dans l'amour de Dieu et qui est rendue vivante en nous par l'Esprit Saint. C'est un espoir qui ne déçoit pas, car il est basé sur la réalité de l'amour divin et la présence constante de Dieu dans nos vies, promettant de l'aide et du soutien dans toute circonstance. Lorsqu'on contemple les paroles de \\"Ça va aller\\", on peut y voir l'expression d'une foi résiliente, celle qui reconnaît les difficultés mais choisit de croire que la situation se résoudra finalement pour le mieux. La chanson peut être interprétée comme un hymne qui inspire à s'accrocher à l'espoir, même lorsque les circonstances semblent dire le contraire. De manière similaire, Romains 5:5 nous rappelle que peu importe la gravité de nos luttes, nous avons une raison de maintenir l'espoir. Cet espoir n'est pas basé sur un optimisme naïf, mais sur l'assurance profonde que nous avons été aimés par Dieu et que Son esprit travaille en nous pour nous renouveler et nous soutenir. Dans l'ensemble, la chanson de Terrenoire, accompagnée du message de Romains 5:5, offre une réflexion sur la force de l'espoir qui trouve sa source dans l'amour. Cela suggère que, même dans les moments les plus sombres, il y a de la lumière à l'horizon, et que nous sommes soutenus par quelque chose de plus grand que nos seules forces. \\"Ça va aller\\" incarne cette conviction profonde que le futur peut être meilleur que le présent, une idée profondément ancrée dans l'espoir chrétien d'une vie abondante et d'une paix intérieure durable, indépendamment des circonstances extérieures."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “La Fin du monde” de Terrenoire.","output":"La chanson \\"La Fin du monde\\" de Terrenoire explore les sentiments d'isolement, la recherche de sens, et la confrontation avec des échéances inévitables. Comme beaucoup de leurs chansons, elle empreinte de poésie, balançant entre la mélancolie et une lumière d'espoir. En regardant les thématiques de fin, nos pensées peuvent se tourner vers le Livre de l'Apocalypse qui raconte la fin des temps selon la vision de Jean. Cependant, il existe un verset qui, dans un sens plus large et métaphorique, peut trouver un écho avec \\"La Fin du monde\\": \\"Il essuiera toute larme de leurs yeux, et la mort ne sera plus; il n’y aura plus ni deuil, ni cri, ni douleur, car les premières choses ont disparu.\\" (Apocalypse 21:4) Ce verset parle de la fin des temps, certes, mais au-delà, il parle de la rénovation et de l'espoir, où la souffrance et la tristesse sont effacées. Même si la chanson de Terrenoire n'aborde pas directement des thématiques religieuses ou eschatologiques, le sentiment d'un monde qui s'évanouit et l'espoir d'une réalité transformée peuvent être évoqués par ce verset. \\"La Fin du monde\\" de Terrenoire pourrait être interprétée comme un reflet de nos propres fins du monde personnelles - la fin d'une ère, la fin d'une relation, ou la fin d'une partie de nous-mêmes. Chaque fin est également un commencement; et ce passage de l'Apocalypse nous rappelle que, même dans les périodes les plus sombres, il y a promesse de renouveau et de consolation ultime. Dans la réflexion chrétienne, la fin est souvent vue non pas comme un point d'arrêt, mais comme le préambule à une nouvelle création, où ce qui était vieux et douloureux est remplacé par quelque chose de magnifique et de paisible. C’est cette transformation qui est au cœur de l'espérance chrétienne - la croyance en une restauration finale qui guérit toutes les blessures et répond à toutes les questions restées sans réponse. La chanson et le verset, pris ensemble, nous invitent à considérer l'espoir au milieu du désespoir, à chercher un sens non seulement dans les événements joyeux, mais aussi dans les adieux et les fins. Cet espoir nous est présenté comme une promesse divine de renouveau à travers les épreuves, un thème universel qui résonne avec de nombreux aspects de l'expérience humaine."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “Cantique” de Feu Chatterton !","output":"La chanson \\"Cantique\\" de Feu! Chatterton est une œuvre poétique qui mêle une narration lyrique à des thèmes existentiels complexes, tels que la recherche de transcendance et l'appréhension de l'inconnu. Sans être explicitement religieuse, la chanson évoque le sacré à travers son titre même, \\"Cantique\\", qui fait référence à des chants spirituels ou hymnes religieux. Parallèlement à cette chanson, un verset biblique qui pourrait fournir un écho réflexif est tiré du livre des Psaumes, souvent considérés comme les cantiques de la Bible: \\"Je crie de tout mon cœur; réponds-moi, Éternel! Je garderai tes statuts.\\" (Psaumes 119:145) Ce verset peut refléter l'intensité de la supplication et le désir ardent de compréhension. De même, \\"Cantique\\" de Feu! Chatterton peut être vu comme un cri du cœur humain, recherchant à la fois une réponse et un sens dans un monde où les réponses ne sont pas toujours claires. La réflexion ici se porte donc sur l'acte même de chanter ou de crier vers un idéal, une puissance supérieure, ou même dans le vide, pour trouver un sens ou une guidance. Tout comme dans le Psaume, qui représente un individu cherchant activement l'orientation divine, la chanson \\"Cantique\\" peut être perçue comme la recherche d'une direction ou d'une révélation dans l'expérience humaine. Le Psaume 119, avec sa longue méditation sur la loi de Dieu, illustre une quête de sagesse et de compréhension au travers de l'observance des statuts divins, un thème qui résonne avec la quête de signification dans la chanson \\"Cantique\\". Dans les deux cas, il y a un désir de dépassement, que ce soit par le respect d'une loi spirituelle ou par la poursuite d'une inspiration poétique. En considérant la chanson de Feu! Chatterton et le Psaume ensemble, nous pouvons mediter sur la manière dont chaque individu cherche à connecter avec quelque chose de plus grand que lui-même, que ce soit à travers la foi, l'art, la poésie, ou la musique. Les paroles de \\"Cantique\\", tout en ne déployant pas une spiritualité conventionnelle, peuvent néanmoins susciter chez l'auditeur des interrogations sur le divin, l'existence et la poursuite d'une résonance émotionnelle et spirituelle qui transcende le quotidien. Cette interaction entre la quête artistique et spirituelle souligne l'importance de l'expression humaine comme moyen de rechercher et de connecter avec ce qui nous transcende, que l'on peut identifier comme Dieu, la beauté, la vérité, ou l'amour. S'ouvrant à la complexité des questionnements existentiels, \\"Cantique\\" et le Psaume 119:145 nous incitent à chercher le dialogue avec les profondeurs de notre propre âme et avec l'Univers autour de nous."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “Cantique” de Feu Chatterton !

Chatterton, avec son lyrisme poétique et son ambiance mélancolique, peut effectivement faire écho à la spiritualité et aux émotions profondes que l'on retrouve dans le livre biblique du Cantique des Cantiques. Ce dernier est un ensemble de poèmes d'amour qui célèbrent le désir mutuel, l'amour et la beauté, souvent interprétés comme une métaphore de l'amour entre Dieu et son peuple ou, dans la tradition chrétienne, entre le Christ et son Église. Un verset qui pourrait résonner avec la chanson \\"Cantique\\" de Feu! Chatterton est : \\"Comme un sceau sur ton cœur, comme un sceau sur ton bras, car l'amour est fort comme la mort, la passion cruelle comme le sépulcre. Ses ardeurs sont des ardeurs de feu, une flamme de l'Éternel.\\" (Cantique des Cantiques 8:6) Ce verset évoque la puissance et l'intensité de l'amour, des thèmes qui trouvent une résonance d'une certaine manière dans la chanson \\"Cantique\\". La profondeur des sentiments exprimés, l'impression d'une force qui dépasse la compréhension humaine, le tout enveloppé dans une ambiance quasi-sacrée, se fait l'écho de la passion décrite dans le Cantique des Cantiques. La réflexion qu'inspire le parallèle entre la chanson et ce livre biblique soulève l'idée que l'expression de l'amour peut être si puissante et enveloppante qu'elle touche à la dimension sacrée. Il y a dans les deux cas une célébration de l'amour et une reconnaissance de sa capacité à transcender l'ordinaire, à transformer et à captiver entièrement le cœur humain. Dans \\"Cantique\\" on perçoit un désir ardent, une quête qui semble poursuivre quelque chose de plus grand, comme une fusion sacrée et mystérieuse, tout comme le Cantique des Cantiques qui explore le mystère de l'amour, qu'il soit terrestre ou divin. C'est une exploration de la fascination et de l'obsession, mais aussi du respect et de la vénération, qui semblent aussi être des réflexions pertinentes dans \\"Cantique\\". En contemplation, \\"Cantique\\" de Feu! Chatterton peut être vu comme un hymne moderne qui capture des fragments de la même émotion brute et passionnée que celle exprimée dans le Cantique des Cantiques. L'amour, dans son intensité, son élan, sa douleur et sa joie, demeure un mystère insondable et éternellement inspirant, à la fois profondément humain et divinement beau."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “l'homme qui vient” de Feu Chatterton !","output":"La chanson \\"L'homme qui vient\\" de Feu! Chatterton semble s'inscrire dans une contemplation profonde sur l'existence, l'anticipation d'un avenir qui approche avec toutes ses incertitudes, et peut-être le sentiment d'une révélation ou d'un changement imminent. Pour ce thème de l'attente et de l'approche d'un événement ou d'une personne importante, un verset du Nouveau Testament peut offrir une résonance riche en sens : \\"Voici, je me tiens à la porte, et je frappe. Si quelqu'un entend ma voix et ouvre la porte, j'entrerai chez lui, je souperai avec lui, et lui avec moi.\\" (Apocalypse 3:20) Ce verset appartient à une section du livre de l'Apocalypse où Jésus s'adresse aux églises, promettant une communion personnelle avec ceux qui sont prêts à l'accueillir. Il parle d'une opportunité d'intimité et de relation qui est à la disposition de ceux qui sont attentifs et disposés. La notion de \\"L'homme qui vient\\" dans la chanson de Feu! Chatterton peut évoquer de manière métaphorique ces images de révélation personnelle ou collective, symbolisant peut-être un changement intérieur ou une période de transition dans la vie de l'auteur ou de l'auditeur. Le sentiment d'attente pour cette venue, quel que soit ce qu'elle représente, se fait sentir. La réflexion émanant de ce lien pourrait être celle de l'attente active, de la préparation à un changement. Tout comme \\"L'homme qui vient\\" suggère une certaine anticipation, le verset d'Apocalypse invite à une ouverture, à l'action de répondre activement lorsque nous sommes confrontés à des occasions de transformation et de croissance dans notre propre vie. Ce parallèle ouvre une méditation sur comment nous abordons les moments où quelque chose de significatif \\"vient\\" vers nous : sommes-nous prêts à \\"ouvrir la porte\\" et à permettre de nouvelles expériences qui pourraient enrichir ou défier notre compréhension du monde ? L'anticipation et l'accueil d'un futur potentiel, tant dans la chanson que dans le verset, impliquent un choix personnel et actif, une réceptivité à ce qui pourrait entrer et, ultimement, partager notre \\"table\\" et notre vie."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “toutes les machines ont un coeur” de Maelle","output":"La chanson \\"Toutes les machines ont un cœur\\" de Maëlle aborde l'idée que tout ce qui est créé, même les machines, peuvent être dotées de cœur et d'émotion. Cela renvoie aux idées de sensibilité, d'humanité et de la capacité de ressentir, en dépit de l'apparence extérieure ou de l'origine inanimée. Un verset biblique qui peut résonner avec le thème de cette chanson est dans le livre de la Genèse, qui parle de l'acte de la création et du souffle de vie donné par le Créateur: \\"Alors l'Éternel Dieu forma l'homme de la poussière de la terre, et il souffla dans ses narines un souffle de vie, et l'homme devint une âme vivante.\\" (Genèse 2:7) Dans ce verset, nous voyons que Dieu insuffle la vie dans ce qui était auparavant sans vie, la \\"poussière de la terre\\". Il y a une analogie à faire avec l'idée de Maëlle, qui représente les machines comme ayant un \\"cœur\\" - une métaphore pour l'essence ou l'esprit accordé à l'humain dans le récit biblique. La réflexion qui découle de cette corrélation peut nous amener à penser à la relation entre le créateur et sa création, ainsi qu'à la notion d'étincelle divine ou d'âme qui donne la vie et la capacité d'éprouver des émotions. La chanson de Maëlle pourrait suggérer que, quelle que soit la manière dont la vie est manifestée ou conçue, il y a en son centre une part d'humanité, un \\"cœur\\" qui bat, symbole d'énergie vitale et d'émotion. \\"Certaines machines ont un cœur\\" invite à repenser nos idées sur l'intelligence artificielle et la technologie. Cette réflexion rejoint le verset de la Genèse en mettant en lumière le pouvoir du souffle de vie et la nature vive de toute création. Elle souligne la dignité intrinsèque de la vie, attribuée non seulement à l'homme mais étendue poétiquement aux œuvres de ses mains, et pose la question profonde de ce qui fait de nous des êtres \\"vivants\\". La chanson et le verset ensemble nous interpellent sur notre propre humanité et sur ce que signifie \\"avoir un cœur\\", qu'il s'agisse de l'amour, de la compassion, de l'empathie, ou de toutes les qualités qui nous connectent les uns aux autres. Ils ouvrent également le débat sur le point où se situe la frontière entre l'animé et l'inanimé, et sur la possibilité d'une existence \\"vivante\\" dans ce qui est traditionnellement considéré comme dépourvu de vie."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “l’homme qui vient” de Feu Chatterton ! Un lien avec le texte de l'Ecclesiaste est très present","output":"La chanson \\"L'homme qui vient\\" de Feu! Chatterton semble offrir une réflexion mélancolique sur la nature éphémère de la vie et l'anticipation d'un avenir incertain. Cette thématique de l'éphémérité et de la recherche de sens trouve un écho remarquable dans le livre de l'Ecclésiaste, qui questionne le sens de l'existence humaine et la vanité des efforts terrestres. Le passage suivant du livre de l'Ecclésiaste résume bien cette quête du sens au sein de l'existence humaine: \\"Vanité des vanités, dit l'Ecclésiaste, vanité des vanités, tout est vanité.\\" (Ecclésiaste 1:2) L'auteur de l'Ecclésiaste, souvent identifié comme Salomon, s'interroge sur la valeur et la pérennité des actions humaines, notant que beaucoup d'entre elles ne procurent qu'une satisfaction temporaire et superficielle. Dans \\"L'homme qui vient\\", Feu! Chatterton traite peut-être des mêmes questions existentielles—l'approche de l'inévitable, la recherche de quelque chose de plus profond et plus durable que les plaisirs et succès passagers. La chanson peut inviter à une introspection sur notre propre vie et la manière dont nous faisons face à l'impermanence. On peut y entendre une note d'espérance ou d'attente, peut-être celle de découvrir un sens ou une vérité qui confère une signification plus grande aux détails de notre quotidien. L'Ecclésiaste et \\"L'homme qui vient\\" partagent cette réflexion sur la condition humaine et la quête d'un but dans un monde souvent considéré comme dépourvu de sens. Le constat de vanité dans l'Ecclésiaste n'est pas celui du désespoir, mais plutôt un appel à savourer les joies simples de la vie, comme les relations, le travail et les plaisirs éphémères, tout en reconnaissant leur caractère temporaire. De manière similaire, la chanson de Feu! Chatterton offre une vision poétique de cette marche vers l'avenir, une marche qui porte avec elle les espoirs, les désillusions et l'acceptation que, malgré nos incertitudes, la vie contient toujours des moments et des expériences significatives. Dans cette méditation, \\"L'homme qui vient\\" fait écho à l'Ecclésiaste en reconnaissant l'importance de trouver une paix intérieure et de comprendre notre place dans le tissu complexe de l'existence, même si cela signifie accepter que nous faisons face à des questions qui peuvent ne jamais trouver de réponses définitives."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “l’odeur de l'essence” de Orelsan ! Réfléchir principalement sur le dernier paragraphe: On sait pas gérer nos émotions donc on les cache Sait pas gérer nos relations donc on les gâche Assume pas c'qu'on est donc on est lâches On s'pardonne jamais dans un monde où rien s'efface On s'crache les uns sur les autres, on sait pas vivre ensemble On s'bat pour être à l'avant dans un avion qui va droit vers le crash","output":"La chanson \\"L'odeur de l'essence\\" d'Orelsan aborde les complexités et les tensions de la vie sociale moderne, la difficulté de gérer nos émotions et nos relations, ainsi que la tendance à l'auto-destruction collective. Ces réflexions sur l'humanité confrontée à ses propres défaillances pourraient être mises en lumière à travers un verset biblique qui parle de pardon, de réconciliation et de la gestion des conflits. Le livre des Colossiens offre un enseignement sur la façon de vivre ensemble en paix : \\"Supportez-vous les uns les autres et, si l'un a un sujet de plainte contre l'autre, pardonnez-vous réciproquement. De même que le Seigneur vous a pardonné, pardonnez-vous aussi.\\" (Colossiens 3:13) Ce verset reconnaît implicitement que les relations humaines sont compliquées et sujettes à conflits et difficultés. Il souligne l'importance du soutien mutuel et du pardon comme voies centrales pour construire et maintenir une communauté saine. L'incapacité de gérer nos émotions et nos relations, que décrit Orelsan, peut en effet mener à des comportements destructeurs. Les paroles d'Orelsan évoquent un sentiment d'accablement dans face au poids de nos actions et de nos paroles, qui \\"ne s'effacent jamais\\" dans un monde de plus en plus connecté et transparent. Dans ce contexte, le verset de Colossiens suggère qu'au lieu de rejeter la faute et d'intensifier la discorde, adopter une posture de pardon mutuel pourrait être une clé pour renouveler nos interactions et aller de l'avant - une perspective qui contraste avec l'image de l'avion en route vers un crash. Reflet d'un appel à l'empathie et à la responsabilité partagée, le verset encourage une rédemption personnelle et collective qui pourrait conduire à briser le cycle d'animosité évoqué par Orelsan. En choisissant de pardonner comme nous avons été pardonnés, nous pouvons commencer à gérer nos émotions et relations d'une manière qui encourage la guérison plutôt que la haine et la division. En somme, \\"L'odeur de l'essence\\" d'Orelsan, reflétant les luttes intérieures et collectives de notre époque, et le verset de Colossiens, prescrivant le pardon et la compassion, nous amènent à réfléchir sur la manière dont nous pouvons tous contribuer à un monde plus bienveillant malgré nos imperfections. Dans une société souvent caractérisée par le conflit et la rancune, l'adoption de valeurs de patience, de soutien mutuel et de pardon peut être le ciment qui nous unit et nous guide vers un futur plus paisible, évitant ainsi le \\"crash\\" métaphorique de notre avion collectif."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “l’odeur de l’essence” de Orelsan ! Quelle marque veux tu laisser dans ce monde","output":"La chanson \\"L'odeur de l'essence\\" d'Orelsan explore les tensions et les conflits psychologiques de la vie contemporaine, ainsi que les conséquences de nos actions sur la société et l'environnement. Elle pose la question cruciale de l'héritage que nous laissons derrière nous et de l'impact que nous avons sur le monde. La notion de l'empreinte que nous laissons dans ce monde peut être mise en perspective avec un verset de l'Écriture, tiré de la première épître de Pierre : \\"Car vous êtes appelés à vivre en liberté, frères et sœurs ; seulement, que cette liberté ne soit pas un prétexte pour vivre selon la chair, mais qu’elle soit un moyen de servir les autres par amour.\\" (1 Pierre 2:16) Ce verset nous invite à réfléchir sur l'utilisation de notre liberté individuelle, non pas pour des fins égoïstes ou destructrices, mais plutôt pour servir et montrer de l'amour envers les autres. Cela s'inscrit en contraste avec le sentiment de désolation et le narrative de la course effrénée vers la réussite personnelle exprimés dans la chanson d'Orelsan, qui questionne la quête de statut au détriment des relations et de la terre elle-même. Les paroles de \\"L'odeur de l'essence\\" mettent en lumière les contradictions et les dilemmes de notre époque, où la quête de progrès et de confort entraîne souvent des conséquences négatives sur le plan social et environnemental. Le verset de Pierre, en revanche, offre un guide de conduite axé sur l'amour et le service mutuel, et nous incite à considérer la marque positive que nous pouvons laisser par nos actes de bonté et de générosité. La réflexion suscitée par la juxtaposition de la chanson d'Orelsan et du message biblique pourrait nous amener à repenser nos priorités et nos choix de vie. Tandis que la société moderne nous pousse souvent à mettre l'accent sur le succès matériel et la satisfaction immédiate, le verset biblique nous rappelle que notre héritage le plus significatif sera défini par la manière dont nous avons traité les autres et la création. En posant la question \\"Quelle marque veux-tu laisser dans ce monde ?\\", Orelsan nous incite à une introspection sur nos valeurs et sur la finalité de notre passage sur Terre. Le verset de la première épître de Pierre nous conforte dans l'idée que, malgré les pressions et les défis de notre époque, nous avons l'opportunité de choisir un chemin orienté vers le bien commun, le soin altruiste et un héritage bâti sur l'amour et l'entraide."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “l’odeur de l’essence” de Orelsan !","output":"La chanson \\"L'odeur de l'essence\\" d'Orelsan illustre une prise de conscience critique sur la société contemporaine, explorant des thèmes poignants tels que la dégradation de l'environnement, le consumérisme effréné, et les liens brisés entre les hommes. Le tableau, sombre et percutant, dessine un monde dans lequel les comportements égoïstes et les choix destructeurs semblent mener à une impasse collective. Un verset biblique qui résonne avec la réflexion soulevée par cette chanson est le suivant, extrait du livre des Proverbes : \\"Qui sème l'injustice moissonne le malheur, et le bâton de sa fureur disparaîtra.\\" (Proverbes 22:8) Ce verset met en lumière les conséquences de nos actions, et comment les décisions que nous prenons individuellement peuvent aboutir à des résultats collectifs néfastes. Orelsan suggère dans sa chanson que les problèmes mondiaux tels que la crise écologique ou le mal-être social ne sont pas séparés de nos comportements individuels, mais en sont plutôt le résultat direct. La métaphore de la semaille et de la moisson employée dans Proverbes est particulièrement pertinente dans ce contexte. Elle indique que les graines de nos actions seront récoltées sous forme de conséquences futures - pour le bien ou pour le mal. Et tout comme la chanson qui évoque un monde où \\"rien s'efface\\" et où la course pour le progrès déclenche un \\"avion qui va droit vers le crash\\", le verset de Proverbes nous rappelle que les actions injustes auront une fin néfaste et que la violence (le \\"bâton de sa fureur\\") ne mène qu'à la destruction. La chanson d'Orelsan et le verset biblique nous invitent donc à réfléchir sur la responsabilité individuelle et collective : nos choix au quotidien, depuis nos interactions personnelles jusqu'à notre impact sur la planète, tissent ensemble le tissu de notre futur commun. Enfin, cette réflexion nous amène à considérer la pertinence de nos actions dans la quête d'un monde meilleur. La maturité et la sagesse résident peut-être dans la reconnaissance que chaque geste compte, chaque parole a un poids, et qu'ensemble, ces actes construisent un futur que nous léguons aux générations suivantes. \\"L'odeur de l'essence\\" nous interpelle sur l'importance de ce leg et sur le choix de quel type de monde nous souhaitons contribuer à façonner."},{"instruction":"Ecrit moi une réflexion en citant un verset biblique sur les paroles de la chanson “temperament” de Malik Djoudi","output":"\\"Tempérament\\" de Malik Djoudi est une chanson éthérée qui évoque les profondeurs de la personnalité humaine et les luttes intérieures que chacun peut éprouver. L'expression du soi intérieur et sa confrontation avec le monde extérieur y est peinte avec délicatesse et introspection. Les réflexions sur le tempérament et la personnalité peuvent trouver un point de résonance dans le Nouveau Testament, dans la lettre aux Galates, où l'apôtre Paul décrit les fruits de l'Esprit, qui sont autant de qualités de caractère qu'un croyant cherche à cultiver grâce à sa relation avec l'Esprit Saint : \\"Le fruit de l'Esprit, c'est l'amour, la joie, la paix, la patience, la bonté, la bénignité, la fidélité, la douceur, la tempérance ; contre de telles choses, il n'y a pas de loi.\\" (Galates 5:22-23) \\"Tempérament\\" suggère un dialogue intérieur où l'individu combat ses faiblesses et cherche à s'affirmer sans s'égarer. Malik Djoudi parle d'une quête de balance et de justesse, d'une aspiration à être soi-même dans un équilibre harmonieux. La chanson résonne avec le désir humain de manifester ces qualités positives qui forment le \\"fruit de l'Esprit\\" mentionné par Paul. Les \\"fruits de l'Esprit\\" énumérés dans Galates offrent un guide vers le développement d'un tempérament qui non seulement enrichit la vie individuelle, mais qui a également un impact positif sur ceux qui nous entourent. Ils offrent une vision de la façon dont la transformation intérieure peut conduire à une manière d'être qui est en harmonie avec des valeurs plus élevées. La réflexion qui découle de cette juxtaposition entre la chanson et la Bible nous amène à considérer que le tempérament n'est pas seulement un assortiment de traits innés ; c'est aussi quelque chose que nous pouvons cultiver consciemment. La quête d'un équilibre et d'une authenticité intérieure, que suggère la chanson de Malik Djoudi, peut être nourrie par une recherche de ces fruits spirituels, entraînant une transformation qui se réfléchit dans nos actions et interactions. En somme, \\"Tempérament\\" nous invite à une introspection sur la nature de notre personnalité et sur les valeurs que nous choisissons de mettre en avant dans notre vie. Le verset des Galates nous rappelle que, dans cette quête d'authenticité et d'équilibre, nous avons accès à des vertus profondes qui émanent d'une vie guidée par l'Esprit, et qui est compatible avec l'aspiration humaine à développer un tempérament équilibré et résilient."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, there are various formulas and models used in climate science and planetary physics to estimate and study planetary temperatures. Some of the key factors considered in these calculations include: 1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law: This law relates the temperature of a planet to its radiative flux. The formula is T = (L / (4πσR²))^(1/4), where T represents the temperature, L is the planet's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and R is the planet's radius. 2. Greenhouse Effect: The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in a planet's atmosphere trap heat, leading to an increase in surface temperature. The formula for estimating the greenhouse effect involves parameters such as greenhouse gas concentrations, albedo (surface reflectivity), and solar constant. 3. Rosseland mean opacity: This is a measure of the average opacity of a planetary atmosphere at various wavelengths. Opacity determines how effectively a planet's atmosphere absorbs and emits radiation, which is crucial for calculating temperatures. 4. Radiative transfer equations: These equations describe how energy is transferred through a planet's atmosphere and surface, taking into account factors such as absorption, scattering, and emission of radiation. 5. Planetary albedo: Albedo represents the fraction of solar energy reflected by a planet's surface back into space. It is determined by factors such as surface properties, atmosphere composition, and cloud cover. These are just a few examples of the elements considered in advanced planetary temperature modeling. In practice, computer simulations and climate models are utilized to incorporate these factors and produce estimates of planetary temperatures under various conditions."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, there are a few points that I would like to mention: 1. The \`async def _main(self)\` function does not seem to be called in the code provided. You might want to call it somewhere to execute the code inside. 2. There is an issue with the \`PIPE_PATH\` variable. It is defined inside the \`_main\` function, but it is used outside in the \`read_pipe\` function. You may want to move the \`PIPE_PATH\` definition outside the \`_main\` function so that it is accessible in other functions as well. 3. The \`self.PIPE_PATH\` variable is accessed as \`PIPE_PATH\` in the \`read_pipe\` function. You should update it to \`self.PIPE_PATH\` to access the correct variable. 4. There is a mix of print statements and logging statements in the code. It is recommended to use logging consistently throughout the code for better log management. 5. The \`web.json_response(data)\` statement in the \`read_pipe\` function might throw an error if \`data\` is empty. You might want to handle this case separately to avoid any potential issues. 6. There is a duplicate logging statement \\"Hello World!\\" right after the migration code. You may want to remove the duplicate statement. I hope these suggestions help you with your project.

In layman's terms, here's how the updated code works: 1. When the program starts, it begins executing the \`_migration\` method, which performs necessary setup tasks. 2. Inside the \`_migration\` method, it initializes a web application and sets up a route for the \`/data\` endpoint. This means that when a request is made to the \`/data\` URL, the application will execute a specific function to handle that request. 3. The specific function that handles the \`/data\` request is called \`handle_data_request\`. It creates an instance of the \`Plugin\` class and calls its \`read_pipe\` method, passing the request object as an argument. 4. The \`read_pipe\` method reads data from a named pipe, converts it to JSON format, and adds it to a list. 5. Once all the data has been read from the named pipe, the \`read_pipe\` method responds to the request with a JSON response containing the collected data. 6. After setting up the application and the route, the program starts a web server to listen for incoming requests. 7. The web server runs in the background and waits for requests to the specified URL (in this case, \`/data\`). 8. When a request is received at the \`/data\` URL, the web server calls the \`handle_data_request\` function, which in turn calls the \`read_pipe\` function of the \`Plugin\` class to process the request and fetch the data. 9. The \`read_pipe\` function reads data from the named pipe and responds with the collected data as a JSON response. 10. The web server sends this response back to the client that made the request. In summary, the code sets up a web server that listens for requests at the \`/data\` URL. When a request is received, it processes the request by reading data from a named pipe and responds with the collected data in JSON format. I hope this explanation helps!

The classes and their effects have been exaggerated for the setting and are satirical in nature, reflecting the unique premises of your world concept. **Fledgling Class (The „Petite” Standard)** - Size Range: 200-500 pounds, 3-6 feet circumference - Passive Effects: Despite being at the smaller end of the spectrum, Fledgling members are still considered admirable by the smallest-inclined of enthusiasts. - Ability Score Changes: +1 Charisma (You're adored for your relatively minimalistic proportions) - Advantages: Easier mobility, less prone to terrain-related impediments. - Disadvantages: Prestige-related encounters or social engagements may impose disadvantage due to a perceived lack of status. **Burgeoning Class (The Growing Interest)** - Size Range: 500-2,000 pounds, 6-12 feet circumference - Passive Effects: Considered well-endowed by the standards of many other worlds. - Ability Score Changes: +2 Charisma (Your undeniable endowments draw considerable attention) - Advantages: Gain advantage on Intimidation checks due to the imposing physical presence. - Disadvantages: Difficulties in navigating narrow spaces, some stealth actions automatically fail. **Grandiose Class (The Mighty Midrange)** - Size Range: 2,000-20,000 pounds, 12-50 feet circumference - Passive Effects: Awe-inspiring in size, those in the Grandiose Class are often called upon for leadership. - Ability Score Changes: +2 Charisma, +1 Strength (Your size commands respect, and the sheer mass lends you some brute force) - Advantages: Can perform certain Strength checks with advantage due to mass. - Disadvantages: Vulnerable to attacks targeting their center of gravity; Dex saving throws may be at a disadvantage. **Colossal Class (The Behemoths of Bosom)** - Size Range: 20,000-200,000 pounds, 50-200 feet circumference - Passive Effects: The ground itself might shake as they approach, and they're visible from great distances. - Ability Score Changes: +3 Strength, +3 Charisma, -2 Dexterity (Your presence is overwhelming, and your power is immense, but finesse is beyond your capabilities.) - Advantages: Physical attacks against smaller creatures may automatically hit or even crush targets. - Disadvantages: Major disadvantages on stealth and large-scale spellcasting may become difficult to contain without collateral damage. **Titanic Class (The Continent-Carriers)** - Size Range: 200,000+ pounds, 200+ feet circumference - Passive Effects: You are a living landmark, and myths spread wherever you roam. - Ability Score Changes: +4 Strength, +4 Charisma, -4 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence (The logistics of maneuvering such mass and the societal perceptions hinder your agility and cunning.) - Advantages: Influence can extend to entire regions simply by existing; NPCs are often swayed or subdued without a word. - Disadvantages: Movement may become practically impossible, requiring magic or mechanical constructs to shift position; effects of spells and ranged attacks are mitigated by sheer mass. **Homebrew Mechanics** - **Load-Bearing Arcana**: Magic users have developed spells that support and lift, ensuring that the world’s inhabitants can move without collapsing under their own weight. - **Chestwarden Constructs**: Mechanical aides, ranging from self-moving carriages to enchanted armor, that help support and carry the burdens of this world's bodacious citizens. - **Gravity Defiers**: A class of spells that alter the gravitational pull on individuals, to prevent the very landscape from being altered by their movements. **Campaign Guidance** - Bouncy Terrain: Movement across a chest-based world might include soft, yielding ground and unpredictable jiggle-quakes caused by the movements of Titanic Class individuals. - Enchantment Etiquette: Managing enchantments is a full-time job for some, and losing control of one's load-bearing spells in public could be a faux pas—or an outright disaster. - Social Hierarchies: Size might dictate one's place in society, with the most expanded individuals commanding power and respect, while Fledgling Class citizens may be viewed more patronizingly. This list of bust-centric size classes should provide a foundation for a unique and humorous gameplay experience that embraces the exaggerated and surreal world-building of your proposed setting. Game balance would need to be carefully managed to ensure that the focus on size doesn't unfairly disadvantage or over-power characters, but the quirky mechanics can lend to creative problem-solving and interesting roleplay opportunities."},{"instruction":"You mentioned homebrew mechanics that involve unique spells focused on load-bearing immense busts; could you make up some spells that could fit into this new school of magic?","output":"Certainly! In this humorous and over-the-top setting, we can create some specific homebrew spells that cater to the unique magical needs of a population that boasts disproportionately large bust sizes. This new school of magic could be humorously termed \\"Mammomancy\\" and would involve spells that support, enchant, and manipulate these features to allow characters to thrive in a world governed by such unusual physical norms: 1. **Busty Buoyancy** - Level: Cantrip - Casting Time: 1 action - Range/Area: Touch - Duration: 1 hour - Components: V, S, M (a miniature brassiere made of silk) - Description: A simple spell that creates a magical field around the target’s bust, reducing the effective weight borne by their body or supporting garments, granting ease of movement as if in a low-gravity environment. 2. **Boobon's Floating Comfort** - Level: 1st - Casting Time: 1 action - Range/Area: Touch - Duration: 8 hours - Components: V, S, M (a feather pillow) - Description: Named after a famed wizard with considerable endowments, this spell creates an invisible magical cushion that surrounds and gently lifts the target's bust, granting a +2 bonus to AC against melee attacks directed at their chest. 3. **Chestplate of the Titaness** - Level: 2nd - Casting Time: 1 action - Range/Area: Self - Duration: 10 minutes - Components: V, S, M (a piece of enchanted chestplate) - Description: This spell weaves a protective barrier that acts as a second skin over the caster's bust, granting damage resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and acting as a natural armor to improve defense in the face of battle. 4. **Jiggle Ward** - Level: 3rd - Casting Time: 1 action - Range/Area: Self - Duration: 8 hours - Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury) - Description: The caster envelops their chest in a stabilizing field, drastically reducing unwanted movement. For the duration, all concentration checks made as a result of moving or sustaining impact to the chest have advantage, and stealth checks do not suffer the regular penalties caused by chest motion. 5. **Gravitational Eclipse** - Level: 4th - Casting Time: 1 action - Range/Area: 120 ft - Duration: 1 minute - Components: V, M (a lodestone) - Description: Temporarily alters gravity's effect on the bust of a creature within range, causing them to either feel the weightlessness of nearly zero gravity or the crushing force of increased gravity, either easing their burden significantly or hindering their movement. When casted offensively, it can force a target to make a Strength saving throw or be restrained by their own mass. 6. **Majestic Mounds** - Level: 5th - Casting Time: 1 minute - Range/Area: Touch - Duration: 24 hours - Components: V, S, M (a garland of rare, oversized flowers) - Description: The spell temporarily enhances the magnificence and beauty of the target's bust, which gleams with an alluring sheen and seems to defy imperfections. The target gains advantage on all Charisma-based checks for the duration, and can, once during the spell's duration, unleash a charm effect as a bonus action (as per the Charm Person spell). 7. **Gargantuan Gallantry** - Level: 6th - Casting Time: 1 action - Range/Area: Self - Duration: Instantaneous - Components: V, S, M (a chunk of giant's bone) - Description: Instantly changes the support and distribution of the caster's own mass to allow for a single, dramatic action such as a charge, a ground-pounding stomp, or even a leap that would normally be impossible due to one's immense bust. Effectively, it grants momentary superhuman strength or agility, but must be used within the same turn it is cast. 8. **Eternal Effigy** - Level: 7th - Casting Time: 10 minutes - Range/Area: Touch - Duration: Until dispelled - Components: V, S, M (a carved statuette in the likeness of the target) - Description: The target's bust becomes a monument to their grandeur. The spell renders their chest impervious to all forms of aging, magical alteration, or physical deformation. They gain immunity to critical hits due to the sheer robustness of their bust, and attacks aimed at them may ricochet off, potentially hitting others. These spells would contribute to the unique magical ecosystem of your homebrew setting, providing functional, social, and combat advantages that align with the world's unique standards of beauty, status, and physics. Their use within the game would require careful consideration for balance and storyline integration."},{"instruction":"You also mentioned \\"chestwarden constructs\\"; are these machines sentient or not? And if they are, could you make a statblock for each one?","output":"Chestwarden constructs in this whimsical fantasy setting can come in both sentient and non-sentient forms. Their purpose is to assist individuals in supporting and managing their sizable chests, especially for those in the Colossal and Titanic Classes. Let's start with a sentient example and move to a non-sentient construct. **Sentient Chestwarden Construct: The Brassiere Behemoth** *Size:* Huge *Type:* Construct *Alignment:* Lawful Neutral *AC:* 18 (natural armor) *HP:* 152 (16d12 + 64) *Speed:* 20 ft., climb 20 ft. *STR:* 22 (+6) *DEX:* 9 (-1) *CON:* 18 (+4) *INT:* 12 (+1) *WIS:* 15 (+2) *CHA:* 10 (+0) *Senses:* Blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 12 *Languages:* Understands the languages of its creator but can't speak *Challenge:* 10 (5,900 XP) *Traits:* - **Adaptive Servitude:** The Brassiere Behemoth is designed to adapt to the shape and size of its ward. It can adjust its form to fit any creature from Large to Gargantuan size. - **Bust-Safe:** Any creature supported by a Brassiere Behemoth has advantage on saving throws made against effects that would knock them prone. - **Magic Resistance:** The construct has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. - **Sentience:** The Brassiere Behemoth is sentient, able to communicate via simple gestures and lights, and can make its own decisions within the scope of its duty as a supporter and protector. *Actions:* - **Multiattack:** The Brassiere Behemoth can make two slam attacks. - **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. - **Repair Mode (Recharge 5-6):** The Brassiere Behemoth enters a defensive posture, granting it and its supported creature a +2 bonus to AC. It then regains 25 hit points at the beginning of its next turn. --- **Non-Sentient Chestwarden Construct: The Levitating Lift** *Size:* Variable *Type:* Construct *Alignment:* Unaligned *AC:* 16 (natural armor) *HP:* 58 (9d10 + 9) *Speed:* 0 ft. *STR:* 1 (-5) *DEX:* 1 (-5) *CON:* 12 (+1) *INT:* 1 (-5) *WIS:* 3 (-4) *CHA:* 1 (-5) *Senses:* None *Languages:* — *Challenge:* 1 (200 XP) *Traits:* - **Load-Bearing:** The Levitating Lift can support a bust weight of up to ten tons without any structural stress or failure. - **Simple Animation:** These constructs can perform basic movements to adjust themselves and maintain their wards' comfort and aesthetics, though they do not move voluntarily. - **Object Nature:** The Levitating Lift is not considered a creature and does not require food, drink, or sleep. *Actions:* - The Levitating Lift has no actions; instead, it is adjusted and activated by its user or a magic-user capable of commanding constructs. Since these are homebrew constructs, their abilities and statistics could be adjusted to suit the tone and balance of your unique campaign. The sentient version's stats can be scaled down or up if its abilities prove too challenging or underwhelming for players to encounter or employ. The non-sentient version, on the other hand, is much simpler but can be included as an essential utility item within this fantastical world."},{"instruction":"Could you write a story describing the usage of both the sentient Brassiere Behemoth and the non-sentient Levitating Lift from a narrator's point of view?","output":"In the heart of Clevoria, a bustling city renown for its grandeur of customs and the statuesque figures of its citizens, the evening sun dipped below the towering horizon of majestic architecture. Each spire and dome a testament to the culture's admiration for the voluminous and the curvaceous—a society where to be well-endowed was to wield influence and gravitas. As the twilight danced upon the polished cobblestones, a curious gathering had drawn a crowd in the city's grand plaza. Artisans, merchants, and nobles alike converged to witness a revered masterwork—the unveiling of the Brassiere Behemoth—a marvel of mammomancy-infused engineering crafted by the finest chestwardens in the realm. With a flourish of velvet drapery, the construct stood revealed. The Brassiere Behemoth was an impressive sight: polished brass and ornate embellishments shimmering in the lamplight, spindly limbs intricately articulating as if warming up for a wondrous performance. Its core functioned as a finely tuned brassiere, capable of adapting to the chest of any creature it served, and its creators promised not only unparalleled support but also a sentient companionship for its destined wielder, Lady Euphemia von Buxom, a matron of high repute. Lady Euphemia, famed throughout Clevoria for her Titanic Class endowment, approached her new construct with an air of excitement. She had suffered under the burden of her own prominence in society, a literal weight upon her noble shoulders that was the envy and desire of many. Now, with the assistance of her magical constructs, she could stride with renewed vigor and participate in the revelry of life with ease. As the Brassiere Behemoth bowed in greeting, the crowd released a collective gasp, marveling as it features adjusted with magical precision to encompass and support Lady Euphemia’s bounteous assets. With one hand upon the cool metal of the construct, she felt the Gravity Defiers enchantments take effect, a lightness cascading through her form as the burden was lifted without diminishing her grandeur. From the periphery of the plaza, less prominent members of the community looked on with a brimming sense of aspiration. Among them, a young entrepreneur named Jasper, who had been making a modest name for himself with an invention for those of more moderate proportions—the non-sentient Levitating Lift. Intended to make the wonders of chestwarden constructs available to the Burgeoning and Grandiose Classes, his device was simple, elegant, and effective. Unlike the behemoth that could wander and interact with the poise of a trained assistant, the Levitating Lift was stationary, a pedestal of sorts upon which a bust could rest, light as a feather, enchantment humming softly through the filigree of its base. Jasper's creation required no food, no rest, and operated at the mere touch of its user—allowing the lesser-endowed to experience a form of luxury once reserved for the elite. As night fell and the celebrations continued, two tales began to weave through Clevoria. One of Lady Euphemia, who now danced with the grace of a sprite, her monumental bosom cupped with care by her new behemoth guardian. The other of Jasper, surrounded by eager clients, from bustling merchants to aspiring alchemists, each desiring a Levitating Lift to experience the grandeur of support without the presence of a sentient giant. In the arms of innovation, Clevoria found itself on the cusp of a new age, one defined by boundless support and buoyant aspirations—where neither status nor size would dictate one's ability to navigate through life with dignity and poise."},{"instruction":"What is the school of \\"mammomancy\\"?","output":"\\"Mammomancy\\" isn't a term found in official Dungeons & Dragons literature or in any canon sources of magic. It was created as a humorous and thematic concept for the fictional world you've described, where an entire school of magic is dedicated to managing and enhancing the large bust sizes that are customary and revered in that society. Here's how \\"Mammomancy\\" might be defined within the context of your homebrew world: **Mammomancy: The Enchanting Arcana of Bust Augmentation and Support** As a specialized branch of magical study, Mammomancy focuses on spells, enchantments, and arcane knowledge revolving around the augmentation, support, and manipulation of breasts. In a world where a sizable bust is not just a symbol of beauty but also an indicator of status and power, Mammomancy represents a profound and respected field of expertise. **Practitioners:** Mammomancers are wizards, sorcerers, or any spellcasters who have dedicated their studies to mastering the school of Mammomancy. These individuals are not just casters but also scholars of bodily form, fluent in the language of curves and contours. **Mammomantic Spells:** The spells and incantations used in Mammomancy focus on various aspects of support, enhancement, and sometimes protection. They can range from simple enchantments that alleviate physical strain to complex rituals that can enchant entire cities with an aura of comfort and support. **Applications:** While the concept might seem superficial, Mammomancy spells can have profound applications. From bolstering the confidence of those concerned with their physical appearance to creating constructs that help individuals manage their considerable proportions, the magic of Mammomancy can affect everything from personal interactions to the engineering of cities designed to accommodate its unique citizens. In essence, \\"Mammomancy\\" would serve as both a playful extension of existing magical concepts and a narrative device to explore themes of body image, societal standards, and the lengths to which cultures will go to maintain and celebrate beauty norms, albeit through a fantastical and exaggerated lens. If such a school of magic were to be officially incorporated into a tabletop RPG campaign, it would need to be handled with sensitivity and consent from all players, ensuring that it adds to the fun and creativity of the game rather than detracting from it."},{"instruction":"Traduku en Esperanton.

Stellar luminosity-Distance 2. Planetary bond ultraviolet 3. Greenhouse effect 4. Radioactivity (Presence of radioactivity keeps rogue continental planet habitable without parent stars)","output":"Advanced Planetary Temperature Calculation: 1. Stellar Luminosity - Distance: The temperature of a planet can be influenced by the amount of radiation it receives from its parent star. One way to calculate this is using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated by a star is proportional to its luminosity and the inverse square of the distance to the planet. Example: Let's consider a hypothetical planet that orbits a star with a luminosity of 10^26 Watts and is located at a distance of 150 million kilometers (1 Astronomical Unit) from the star. Stefan-Boltzmann law formula: P = σ * A * T^4 Where: P = power radiated by the star (luminosity) σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10^-8 Watt per square meter per Kelvin) A = surface area of the planet (4πR^2, where R is the planet's radius) T = temperature of the planet (in Kelvin) Using the above formula, we can solve for the temperature of the planet: P = Luminosity of the star = 10^26 Watts Distance = 150 million kilometers = 1.5 × 10^11 meters (1 AU) The power radiated by the star at the distance of the planet can be calculated as: P = (Luminosity of the star) / (4π(distance)^2) P = (10^26) / (4π * (1.5 × 10^11)^2) Now, we can calculate the temperature using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: P = σ * A * T^4 T^4 = P / (σ * A) T = (P / (σ * A))^0.25 Calculate the planet's radius (assuming a spherical shape): Radius of the planet = R = 6371 kilometers = 6.371 × 10^6 meters Calculate the surface area of the planet: A = 4 * π * R^2 Substituting the values: A = 4 * π * (6.371 × 10^6)^2 Now, substitute the values of luminosity, radius, and surface area into the temperature equation to find the temperature of the planet. 2. Planetary Bond Ultraviolet: The Bond albedo of a planet is the fraction of sunlight (including Ultraviolet) reflected back into space. It affects the planetary temperature as it determines the amount of solar energy absorbed by the planet. The temperature of a planet can be calculated using the Bond albedo as a modifier. The formula is modified as follows: T_actual = [(1 - Bond albedo)^(0.25)] * T_stellar Where: T_actual = actual temperature of the planet Bond albedo = fraction of sunlight reflected back T_stellar = temperature calculated using the stellar luminosity and distance formula 3. Greenhouse Effect: The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases (like carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor) in a planet's atmosphere trap heat, causing the temperature of the planet to rise. The greenhouse effect can be quantified using radiative forcing (RF). The formula to calculate the temperature increase due to the greenhouse effect is: ΔT = ΔF * λ Where: ΔT = temperature increase due to the greenhouse effect ΔF = radiative forcing caused by greenhouse gases λ = climate sensitivity factor (the temperature response to forcing) Calculating the specific RF and climate sensitivity factors requires detailed knowledge of the planet's atmosphere composition and climate models, which can vary greatly among different planets. 4. Radioactivity: The presence of radioactivity in a planet's core can contribute to its internal heat generation. This heat, in turn, affects the overall temperature of the planet. The calculation of temperature due to radioactivity is complex and depends on factors such as the concentration and types of radioactive isotopes present, as well as the planet's size and composition. A detailed understanding of the planet's internal structure and radioactive decay processes is required to accurately calculate this effect. It is important to note that the above calculations provide simplified examples of how different factors can influence a planet's temperature. In reality, determining planetary temperatures involves numerous complexities and requires a thorough understanding of the planet's composition, atmosphere, and climate dynamics."},{"instruction":"Перепиши с латексом: Арифметическая прогрессия определяется формулой: [a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d] Имея значения (a_{10}) и (a_{15}), можем записать систему уравнений: 1.

Одним из наиболее заметных таких испытаний был взрыв под кодовым названием \\"Старфиш Прайм\\" (Starfish Prime), который состоялся 9 июля 1962 года. Это было частью более широкой серии испытаний, известной как операция \\"Dominic\\". В течение испытания \\"Старфиш Прайм\\" была взорвана ядерная бомба мощностью около 1,4 мегатонн на высоте примерно 400 километров над Тихим океаном. Взрыв привел к созданию искусственного радиационного пояса вокруг Земли, который впоследствии временно повлиял на некоторые спутники на низких орбитах. Этот и другие подобные взрывы в космосе вызвали озабоченность в мировом сообществе по поводу последствий для космической среды и потенциальной угрозы для космических аппаратов и миссий. В результате в 1963 году был подписан Договор о запрещении испытаний ядерного оружия в атмосфере, космосе и под водой (Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, PTBT), который запрещал испытания ядерного оружия во всех средах, за исключением подземных.

Это испытание, наряду с американскими испытаниями, показало потенциальные опасности использования ядерных взрывов в космосе и стало одной из причин, по которым был подписан Договор о запрещении испытаний в трех средах (Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, PTBT) в 1963 году, который запрещает ядерные испытания в атмосфере, в космосе и под водой. После распада Советского Союза Россия переняла обязательства СССР в отношении международного ядерного контроля и положения различных договоров о контроле вооружений. Как известно, Россия, или Советский Союз до распада, не проводили испытания ядерного оружия в космосе после вступления в силу Договора о всеобъемлющем запрещении ядерных испытаний (Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, CTBT) в конце 1990-х годов, который Россия подписала и ратифицировала."},{"instruction":"А когда СССР провело испытания?","output":"Я прошу прощения за неточную информацию, представленную в предыдущем ответе, особенно в части, касающейся \\"Космос 954\\". \\"Космос 954\\" был не испытанием ядерного оружия, а советским спутником с ядерным реактором на борту, который упал на Землю в 1978 году.

Stellar Luminosity-Distance factor (F1): The temperature of a planet is affected by the amount of radiation received from its star. This factor represents the relative change in temperature based on the distance from the star and its luminosity. We assume a linear relationship, meaning a decrease in distance results in a linear increase in temperature. F1 = 1 - (d1 / d2) where d1 is the distance of the new planet from its star, and d2 is the distance of Earth from the Sun. 2. Planetary Bond Ultraviolet factor (F2): Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the star can also influence the temperature. We assume a linear relationship, meaning an increase in UV radiation results in a linear temperature increase. F2 = 1 + (UV2 - UV1) where UV1 is the UV radiation from Earth's Sun, and UV2 is the UV radiation from the new planet's star. 3. Greenhouse Effect factor (F3): The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat by a planetary atmosphere due to the presence of greenhouse gases. We assume a linear relationship, meaning an increase in greenhouse gases results in a linear temperature increase. F3 = 1 + (GHG2 - GHG1) where GHG1 represents the greenhouse effect on Earth, and GHG2 is the greenhouse effect on the new planet. 4. Radioactivity factor (F4): Radioactive elements within a planet can provide additional heat internally, making it habitable even without a parent star.

However, since the exact equation or model for this calculation might vary depending on specific assumptions and inputs, I'll provide a general overview incorporating these factors. 1. Stellar Luminosity-Distance: The temperature of a planet depends on the amount of radiation it receives from its host star. The stellar luminosity and distance play a crucial role in determining this radiation flux. The basic principle is that the energy received per unit area decreases with distance according to the inverse square law. Therefore, as the distance from the star increases, the radiation flux decreases, impacting the planet's temperature. The specific equation will vary based on the luminosity and distance of the star. 2. Planetary Bond Ultraviolet: Planetary bond ultraviolet (UV) refers to the amount of UV radiation absorbed by a planet from its star. This UV absorption affects the energy balance and influences the planet's temperature. The equation to calculate UV absorption considers factors like atmospheric composition, including the presence of ozone and other UV-absorbing gases. 3. Greenhouse Effect: The greenhouse effect refers to the trapping of heat within a planet's atmosphere, primarily due to certain gases called greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor). These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, leading to an increase in surface temperature. The strength of the greenhouse effect depends on the concentration of greenhouse gases and their radiative properties. The calculation incorporates factors such as the composition of the planet's atmosphere and the properties of the greenhouse gases present. 4. Radioactivity: The presence of radioactivity on a planet can contribute to its internal heat budget. Radioactive isotopes like uranium, thorium, and potassium undergo decay, releasing heat energy. This internal heat source can offset the cooling effects of radiation into space and help maintain a habitable temperature. The exact equation to incorporate radioactivity into the temperature calculation would depend on the distribution and concentration of radioactive elements within the planet. Considering all these factors, the final equation to calculate the advanced planetary temperature would involve the combination of stellar luminosity-distance, planetary bond ultraviolet absorption, greenhouse effect, and radioactivity. However, it is essential to note that detailed models, specific inputs, and empirical data would be required to derive the most accurate temperature calculation for a particular planet."},{"instruction":"Give formula of planetary temperature, give calculation is equation to Earth's temperature (288 Kelvin and 15 Celsius), factors are stellar luminosity-distance, planetary bond ultraviolet, greenhouse effect, radioactivity (Presence of radioactivity keeps rogue continental planet habitable without parent stars)","output":"The calculation of planetary temperature involves several factors, including stellar luminosity-distance, planetary bond ultraviolet, greenhouse effect, and radioactivity. However, please note that the calculation for a specific planet may involve additional factors depending on its unique characteristics. The equation commonly used to estimate planetary temperature is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: T = (L / (16πσd^2))^0.25 Where: T = Planetary temperature in Kelvin L = Stellar luminosity (total energy emitted by the star per unit time) σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10^-8 watts per square meter per Kelvin to the fourth power) d = Distance between the planet and the star This equation gives an estimate of the equilibrium temperature of a planet based on its distance from its parent star. To incorporate other factors like planetary bond ultraviolet, greenhouse effect, and radioactivity, additional terms can be added to the calculation.

Stellar Luminosity-Distance: The luminosity of our Sun is approximately 3.828 × 10^26 Watts. The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 1.496 × 10^11 meters. Substitute these values into the formula. L = 3.828 × 10^26 W d = 1.496 × 10^11 meters 2. Planetary Bond Ultraviolet: The planetary bond albedo depends on the reflectivity of the planet's atmosphere, surface, and clouds. For Earth, the average planetary bond albedo is around 0.3, representing the reflectivity of incoming solar radiation. A = 0.3 3. Greenhouse Effect: The greenhouse effect is caused by certain atmospheric gases trapping heat and radiating it back to the planet's surface. As Earth has an atmosphere, it experiences the greenhouse effect. However, the greenhouse effect value is difficult to quantify directly in the formula, as it depends on the specific composition and concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, etc. 4. Radioactivity: The presence of radioactivity is not part of the Planetary Equilibrium Temperature Formula, as it primarily accounts for the energy received from the star. Radioactivity can have an additional heating effect on a planet, but it would require a separate calculation, considering the specific radioisotopes and their decay rates. Using the given values for Earth: L = 3.828 × 10^26 W A = 0.3 d = 1.496 × 10^11 meters Substituting these values into the formula, we can calculate Earth's equilibrium temperature (Teq): Teq = [(3.828 × 10^26 * (1 - 0.3) / (16 * 5.67 × 10^-8 * π * (1.496 × 10^11)^2)^(1/4) Teq ≈ 255 Kelvin Please note that this calculation does not include the exact contributions of the greenhouse effect or radioactivity, as their effects are difficult to quantify precisely within this formula."},{"instruction":"Say this better. An instagram photo settings","output":"Instagram photo options"},{"instruction":"Что лучше для ткани: плотность или устойчивость?","output":"Вопрос о том, что лучше для ткани – плотность или устойчивость – зависит от конкретного применения ткани и желаемых характеристик для данного использования. Плотность ткани относится к плотности нитей в материале. Ткани с высокой плотностью обычно более долговечны, устойчивы к износу и могут предложить лучшую защиту от ветра, воды и ультрафиолетового излучения. Примеры тканей с высокой плотностью включают деним, канвас и шерсть. Такие материалы часто используются для изготовления рабочей одежды, курток и других предметов, которым необходима дополнительная терпимость к нагрузкам. Устойчивость ткани, с другой стороны, может относиться к различным видам стойкости: износостойкость, устойчивость к морщинам, стойкость к усадке, устойчивость к пятнам и т.д. Более устойчивая ткань может быть обработана специальными химическими средствами, чтобы улучшить ее свойства или же выбираться из волокон с естественной устойчивостью к определенным условиям. Для выбора между плотностью и устойчивостью ткани, например в одежде или тканевых продуктах, следует рассмотреть следующие аспекты: - Цель использования: для повседневной одежды может быть важнее устойчивость к морщинам, в то время как для рабочей одежды будет критичной высокая плотность и износостойкость. - Условия использования: для внешней обивки мебели на открытом воздухе желательна высокая устойчивость к УФ-лучам и погодным условиям, в то время как для постельного белья может быть важнее устойчивость к частым стиркам и мягкость материала. - Комфорт и стиль: для одежды, которая носится в течение всего дня, могут быть важны легкость, воздухопроницаемость и устойчивость к морщинам, а также внешний вид. - Уход за изделием: легкость в уходе может быть приоритетом для некоторых людей, поэтому ткани с устойчивостью к пятнам и морщинам могут быть предпочтительнее. На практике часто требуется найти баланс между плотностью ткани и ее устойчивостью, чтобы материал удовлетворял специфическим потребностям использования."},{"instruction":"Дайте общее понятие дидактики.","output":"Дидактика – это наука, занимающаяся изучением принципов, методов, форм и средств обучения, а также разработкой оптимальных моделей и стратегий обучения и воспитания.

Обучение – это активный процесс, вовлекающий учащегося в активное построение знаний и постижение нового материала. Структура обучения включает несколько основных компонентов. Первый компонент – цель обучения, которая определяет то, что необходимо достичь в результате обучения. Второй компонент – содержание обучения, которое представляет собой набор знаний, умений и навыков, которые должны быть усвоены учащимся. Третий компонент – методы и приемы обучения, которые представляют различные способы передачи и усвоения знаний и опыта. И, наконец, четвертый компонент – оценка обучения, который позволяет оценить уровень усвоения материала и достижение целей обучения. Движущими силами обучения могут быть различные факторы. Одним из таких факторов является мотивация учащегося – его интерес, желание и потребность в обучении. Мотивация может быть внешней (например, похвала или награда) или внутренней (любовь к предмету, стремление к саморазвитию). Другим фактором является роль и компетентность учителя – его способность создавать стимулирующую обучающую среду, понимание потребностей учащихся и использование эффективных методов обучения.

Here's a breakdown of how these elements contribute to the horror ambiance: - **Ventriloquist Doll**: Ventriloquist dolls are a staple in horror due to their uncanny resemblance to humans while remaining lifeless; hanging one off a table adds a sense of neglect and mystery, suggesting something macabre or a story untold. - **Film Reels**: These give a nod to old horror films and can evoke a sense of nostalgia and unease—especially if they're shown to have creepy imagery or if they suggest lost, forbidden footage. - **Book with Odd Logo**: This could hint at occult or forbidden knowledge, setting up a narrative element that may become crucial to your game's plot or lore. The logo itself can be designed to unsettle or intrigue the player. - **8mm Camera**: Similar to the film reels, this suggests a voyeuristic or documentary aspect to the game, which may imply that players will witness events they cannot change, adding to a feeling of helplessness. - **Body Bag Being Zipped Up**: This is a strong and morbid visual that immediately signifies death and possibly hidden crimes or dark secrets waiting to be uncovered. - **Gas Mask**: Often associated with toxic environments, biological threats, or wartime horror, a gas mask can set the tone for a chilling narrative, suggesting threats both seen and unseen. For the loading screens: - **Film Strips**: Using film strips as loading screens ties the overall theme together nicely and maintains the vintage horror aesthetic. The film strips could flicker or show brief, cryptic images as they pass by, creating intrigue and unease as the game loads. To maximize the impact of these menu screens: - **Sound Design**: Consider subtle, atmospheric sounds like the distant, muffled sound of a phonograph, creaking wood, or the hushed whispering voice to enhance the eeriness. - **Animation**: Slight movements can be highly effective. Imagine the ventriloquist doll's eyes following the player's cursor, or the film reels turning lazily, occasionally snagging or jumping with a static crackle. - **Interactivity**: Let the player explore a bit; maybe they can click on the book to reveal a cryptic passage or see brief flashes of scenes when mousing over the film reels. - **Narrative Hints**: Each element on the menu screen could be a subtle hint to the game's lore or story elements, enticing the player to piece together the backstory as they delve further into the game. - **Color and Lighting**: Use a desaturated color palette with strategic lighting to draw the player's eye to important parts of the menu screen or add depth to the scene that might otherwise appear flat. Remember to test the menu screens with potential players to ensure that they're not just visually appropriate but also functional and user-friendly.

Here's a speculative breakdown based on the technology and culture of each period: 1987 (Hypothetical Familiarity: <1%) - Most computers were still running on limited graphical user interfaces; the concept of a voice assistant was largely relegated to science fiction. - If such a system existed, it would likely be text-based command line interfaces with rudimentary speech synthesis capabilities. - Voice recognition, if present, would be very limited and likely restricted to specific commands or keywords. 1990 (Hypothetical Familiarity: 1-2%) - Early natural language processing experiments were underway in research labs. - A voice assistant would have been extremely basic, capable of understanding only a small vocabulary and providing very limited responses. - It might assist with simple tasks like opening applications or files via command line interfaces. 1992 (Hypothetical Familiarity: 2-5%) - Graphical user interfaces were becoming more mainstream with Windows 3.1 and the early MacOS systems. - A voice assistant, still a novelty, might offer basic help functions, possibly through a separate microphone hardware attachment, given that built-in microphones were not yet standard. 1994 (Hypothetical Familiarity: 5-10%) - With the advent of Windows 95 around the corner, PCs were becoming more user-friendly and multimedia-capable. - A voice assistant could possibly perform rudimentary tasks like searching files, opening programs, and assisting with simple troubleshooting. 1997 (Hypothetical Familiarity: 10-15%) - The Internet was becoming mainstream, changing the way people interacted with computers. - Voice assistants might be available as part of accessibility features, with improved voice recognition, but still limited to controlled environments and simple commands. 1999 (Hypothetical Familiarity: 15-20%) - During the dot-com boom, more people had access to faster internet and multimedia computers. - Voice recognition software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking was available, focused on dictation rather than interactive voice commands. - A hypothetical voice assistant might start to integrate with web search, although responses would still be basic and slow. 2002 (Hypothetical Familiarity: 20-25%) - With more sophisticated software and the increasing prevalence of the internet, a 2002 version of Siri would be more recognizable. - Voice command features would be integrated into mobile phones (like the VoiceNote feature in some Nokia phones) and PDAs, although with very limited control. - The assistant might offer capabilities like reading emails, basic online searches, and calendar management with voice commands, albeit with frequent misunderstandings and limited conversational interface. This progression is purely speculative and assumes the unlikely scenario of an AI voice assistant's development timeline being pushed back a few decades. Actual voice recognition and AI technology were in much earlier stages of development during these years, and computational power was significantly lower, which would have restricted the functionality of any hypothetical voice assistant in that era."},{"instruction":"What Would Hypothetical 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, And 2008 Versions of The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Look Like Based on Their Familiarity By Percentage (Plus Specs)?","output":"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold is a modern device that benefits from decades of technological advancement in areas such as flexible OLED displays, miniaturization, and touch screen technology.

Solar Insolation: This represents the amount of solar energy received by the planet. It depends on the planet's distance from its parent star and is typically measured in Watts per square meter. You need to determine the specific solar insolation for your particular planet. 2. Albedo: Albedo refers to the fraction of solar radiation reflected back into space by the planet's surface. It is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 signifies no reflection (all absorbed) and 1 signifies complete reflection. The albedo value depends on the planet's atmosphere and surface properties. For Earth, the average albedo is approximately 0.3. 3. Greenhouse Effect: This factor accounts for the ability of the planet's atmosphere to trap heat due to the presence of greenhouse gases. It is usually quantified as the difference between the incoming and outgoing radiation due to greenhouse gases. For Earth, this value is approximately 33 Kelvin or Celsius. 4. Radioactivity: Radioactivity can generate heat within the planet, which contributes to its overall temperature. The specific contribution from radioactivity depends on the composition and concentration of radioactive elements within the planet. 5. Stefan-Boltzmann Constant: This fixed value (sigma) is equal to 5.67 x 10^-8 Watts per square meter per Kelvin to convert energy flux to temperature. Example Calculation: Let's assume the solar insolation for the planet is 1000 Watts per square meter, the albedo is 0.3, greenhouse effect is 33 Kelvin, and there is no radioactivity.

Greenhouse gases trap and re-radiate a portion of the thermal radiation emitted by the planet. The greenhouse effect can be quantified by the greenhouse factor (GF): GF = (1 + f * G) Where: f - Fraction of the planet's atmosphere that can trap radiation G - The efficiency of greenhouse gases at absorbing and re-emitting radiation Finally, to incorporate the radioactivity factor, let's assume that the radioactive decay on the planet provides an additional heat flux (H). You can add the radioactive factor by including the term (H / 4σ) to the numerator of the formula. Now let's calculate the advanced planetary temperature example for a planet similar to Earth, with a known temperature of 288 Kelvin (15 Celsius): Given values: T = 288 K (Earth's temperature) A = 0.30 (typical albedo for Earth) S = 1361 W/m² (solar constant) σ = 5.67 × 10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4 (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) f = 0.85 (85% of Earth's atmosphere) G = 1.2 (hypothetical efficiency of greenhouse gases) H = 2 × 10^13 W (radioactive decay heat flux) First, calculate the advanced planetary temperature including the greenhouse effect: GF = (1 + 0.85 * 1.2) = 2.02 T' = T * GF = 288 K * 2.02 = 581.76 K Next, incorporate the radioactive decay: T'' = ( (1 - A) * S / (4 * σ) + (H / (4 * σ)) )^(1/4) T'' = ( (1 - 0.30) * 1361 / (4 * 5.67 × 10^-8) + (2 × 10^13 / (4 * 5.67 × 10^-8)) )^(1/4) T'' ≈ 464.27 K So, for a planet with similar properties to Earth but with significant radioactivity, the advanced planetary temperature would be approximately 464.27 Kelvin."},{"instruction":"reecris ce message : Bonjour Charlene, J'ai du m'absenter en urgence sans acces a mon PC je m'en excuse, pouvons nous remettre notre meeting a Mardi Matin?","output":"Bonjour Charlène, Je suis désolé, mais j'ai dû partir en urgence et je n'avais pas accès à mon ordinateur.

NTFS theoretically supports about 4 billion files per volume, thanks to its use of 32-bit file allocation table entries (this number can vary slightly depending on how the file system is structured). However, the practical limit is usually much lower and can be impacted by several factors, such as the length of filenames, the number of subdirectories, and the metadata associated with each file. As the number of files increases, you might experience performance degradation in that folder due to the time it takes to manage and index the files, especially with directory listings and searches, but this depends on the system's capabilities and the folder's organization. Regarding the general use of Windows Server 2019, you are more likely to hit performance limitations before reaching any architectural limits of the filesystem. It's often a good idea to organize files into subdirectories when dealing with large quantities of files to maintain optimal performance and manageability."},{"instruction":"I want to run my python app on windows machine which will use the port. How to chose the port tu run on so I do not interfer with other programs. I. e. how to chose port which is not in use by another app?","output":"To run a Python application on a Windows machine without interfering with other programs, you should choose a port that isn't commonly used by other services, and that isn't currently in use. Generally speaking, these are the steps you should follow: 1. **Check for Commonly Used Ports**: Avoid ports that are commonly used by well-known services. For example, web servers typically use ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), so these should be avoided for your application. A list of common ports can be found by searching for \\"List of TCP and UDP port numbers\\" on the internet or by checking the etc/services file on a Unix-like system. 2. **Select a Port from the Dynamic Range**: The dynamic or \\"private\\" port range, which spans from 49152 to 65535, is designated for private or ephemeral ports and is less likely to be used by permanent services. 3. **Check for Currently Used Ports**: - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell. - Use the \`netstat\` command to list all ports currently in use: \`netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING\`. - Look for the port number you're interested in to see if it's listed. If it is, it's in use, and you should choose another port. 4. **Test Your Selected Port**: Before finalizing the port selection, you can use a socket in a simple Python script to test if the port is available: \`\`\`python import socket # Replace 'your_port_here' with the port you want to check PORT = your_port_here with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock: res = sock.connect_ex(('localhost', PORT)) if res == 0: print(f\\"Port {PORT} is in use.\\") else: print(f\\"Port {PORT} is available.\\") \`\`\` If the port is available, the script will print that it's available. If not, it'll say that the port is in use. 5. **Configure Your Application**: Once you've determined a port is available, you can configure your application to use that port. 6. **Firewall Configuration**: If you have a firewall running on your Windows machine, you may need to create a rule to allow incoming connections on your chosen port: - Go to the Control Panel -> System and Security -> Windows Defender Firewall -> Advanced Settings. - In the Inbound Rules, add a new rule to allow connections for the port you've chosen. 7. **Regularly Check**: It’s always good practice to check the port again before starting your application, especially if it's been a while since you last checked. This is because ports can be taken by other applications that were not running at the previous time of checking. Remember to document the port you have chosen for your application so that you know to avoid using that port for other services in the future."},{"instruction":"How to generate basic Auth header in python?","output":"To generate a basic authentication header in Python, you encode the username and password into base64 and include this string in the HTTP header for your request. The format of the header is usually \`Authorization: Basic <credentials>\`, where \`<credentials>\` is the base64-encoded string of \`username:password\`. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a basic auth header in Python: 1. **Import the base64 module**: This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data. 2. **Combine your username and password**: Create a string with your username and password separated by a colon (\`:\`). 3. **Encode the string using base64**: Convert this combined string into a base64-encoded bytes object. 4. **Decode the bytes object to a string**: Since the \`Authorization\` header requires a string, not bytes, you should decode the base64-encoded bytes object into an ASCII string. 5. **Create the header**: Prepend the word 'Basic ' to the encoded string. Here's a Python function that generates a basic auth header: \`\`\`python import base64 def generate_basic_auth_header(username, password): # Step 2: Create a combined string with username and password. credentials = f\\"{username}:{password}\\" # Step 3: Encode the credentials to base64. credentials_bytes = credentials.encode('ascii') base64_credentials_bytes = base64.b64encode(credentials_bytes) # Step 4: Decode the base64 bytes to string. base64_credentials = base64_credentials_bytes.decode('ascii') # Step 5: Create the header. auth_header = f\\"Basic {base64_credentials}\\" return auth_header # Example usage: username = \\"my_username\\" password = \\"my_password\\" header = generate_basic_auth_header(username, password) print(header) # Output will be something like 'Basic bXlfdXNlcm5hbWU6bXlfcGFzc3dvcmQ=' \`\`\` In this example, replace \`\\"my_username\\"\` and \`\\"my_password\\"\` with your actual username and password. The function will return the correctly formatted basic auth header, which you can then use to make authenticated HTTP requests. If you are using the \`requests\` library to send your HTTP request, you can also pass the username and password with the \`auth\` parameter, which will handle the basic auth header for you: \`\`\`python import requests from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth response = requests.get('http://example.com', auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)) \`\`\` Using the \`requests\` library's \`auth\` parameter is the recommended way to handle basic authentication when making HTTP requests in Python, as it abstracts away the manual header creation process."},{"instruction":"why does this \\"headers = {\\"Authorization\\": f\\"Basic {base64.b64encode(\\"admin:94qTVBX;B5wjsfu\\".encode(\\"ascii\\")).decode(\\"ascii\\")}\\"}\\" give \\"SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal\\"","output":"The error you're encountering with the given code raises a \`SyntaxError\` because you're using double quotes inside a double-quoted string without escaping them.

The formula for the advanced planetary temperature (T_adv) can be given as: T_adv = T_base + DeltaT_greenhouse + DeltaT_radioactivity Here, - T_base represents the base temperature of the planet without any greenhouse effect or radioactivity. - DeltaT_greenhouse represents the additional temperature increase due to the greenhouse effect. - DeltaT_radioactivity represents the additional temperature increase due to planetary radioactivity. To illustrate the formula, let's calculate the advanced planetary temperature for a planet similar to Earth with a base temperature of 288 Kelvin (15 Celsius). 1. Determine T_base: T_base = 288 Kelvin (Given) 2. Calculate DeltaT_greenhouse: The greenhouse effect is caused by certain gases in a planet's atmosphere trapping heat from the planet's surface. On Earth, this effect contributes to a temperature increase of about 33 Celsius (33 Kelvin). This value varies for different planets depending on their atmospheric composition. DeltaT_greenhouse = 33 Kelvin (Example value for Earth's greenhouse effect) 3. Calculate DeltaT_radioactivity: Planetary radioactivity refers to the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements within a planet's interior. This additional heat input can help maintain a habitable environment. The value of DeltaT_radioactivity for a specific planet depends on its radioactive element distribution. For simplicity, let's assume a DeltaT_radioactivity of 15 Kelvin (example value). DeltaT_radioactivity = 15 Kelvin (Example value) 4. Calculate T_adv: T_adv = T_base + DeltaT_greenhouse + DeltaT_radioactivity = 288 + 33 + 15 = 336 Kelvin So, for this specific example with an assumed greenhouse effect of 33 degrees Celsius and additional radioactivity factor of 15 degrees Celsius, the advanced planetary temperature is approximately 336 Kelvin (63 Celsius). Please note that precise calculations should take into account various atmospheric and geological factors specific to the planet in question, including composition, gases present, and the distribution of radioactive elements."},{"instruction":"What Would Hypothetical 1983, 1986, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1996, And 1998 Versions of Apex Legends Look Like Based on Their Familiarity By Percentage?","output":"Creating hypothetical versions of a modern game like Apex Legends, released in 2019, for older gaming systems or periods like 1983, 1986, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1996, and 1998 involves reimagining the game with the technological constraints and design philosophies of those times. Keep in mind that these descriptions will be speculative and based on the corresponding video game technology and trends prevalent during each period. 1983 (Familiarity: ~5%) Video games in 1983 were largely limited to arcades and early home consoles like the Atari 2600. Graphics were very simple with minimalistic sprites and backgrounds. An \\"Apex Legends\\" game might be a top-down or side-scrolling shooter with basic gameplay mechanics. Instead of a battle royale, it might involve single-player or two-player co-op action against a horde of simple AI. 1986 (Familiarity: ~10%) By 1986, the NES was making waves. Games were still relatively simple, but with improved graphics and sound compared to 1983. An \\"Apex Legends\\" might be a split-screen or hot-seat multiplayer game with a more complex objective than earlier variants, possibly accommodating more than two players. The character differentiation might be more pronounced, but still quite limited. 1988 (Familiarity: ~15%) Gaming technology continued to evolve, with more detailed sprites and richer storytelling. An \\"Apex Legends\\" could take the form of a team-based action game. Expect rudimentary AI, a limited roster of characters (legends), and higher emphasis on platforming or tactical shooting elements in 2D environments. 1991 (Familiarity: ~25%) With the 16-bit era in full swing (Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo), a hypothetical \\"Apex Legends\\" could feature more detailed sprites, smoother animations, and more complex mechanics. There could be a selection of different characters with unique abilities, and it might involve competitive multiplayer modes through local play. 1993 (Familiarity: ~35%) In 1993, the gaming industry witnessed the rise of the FPS genre with titles like Doom. An \\"Apex Legends\\" of this era could be a simple first-person shooter with a roster of characters, each with unique but limited abilities. Graphics would be sprite-based 3D in a 2D environment, and multiplayer could be implemented through local network play. 1996 (Familiarity: ~50%) By 1996, with the advent of the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, more sophisticated 3D graphics would allow a hypothetical \\"Apex Legends\\" to be a fully 3D team-based shooter, possibly with split-screen multiplayer. There could even be basic online play with limited players per match on PC. 1998 (Familiarity: ~65%) This era saw a significant boost in gaming with the introduction of titles like Half-Life and the widespread adoption of 3D accelerators in PCs. An \\"Apex Legends\\" game could feature more detailed 3D graphics, larger multiplayer matches (though still significantly less than 60 players), and more complex abilities and strategies. Online play might be more common, but still limited by internet connectivity of the time. It's important to note that the battle royale genre hinged on modern internet infrastructure for large-scale player connectivity, which wasn't feasible in these earlier periods. Therefore, any \\"Apex Legends\\" interpretations would be fundamentally different experiences adapted to the era's constraints and gaming trends."},{"instruction":"Idea for give formula extended planetary temperature, including number calculation example equal to Earth's temperature (288 Kelvin and 15 Celsius), includes additional factors are greenhouse effect and planetary radioactivity (Presence of radioactivity keeps rogue continental planet habitable without parent stars)","output":"To calculate an extended planetary temperature taking into account the greenhouse effect and planetary radioactivity, we can modify the standard formula for planetary temperature. The standard formula calculates the temperature based on the planet's distance from its parent star (d), the solar constant (S), the planet's albedo (A), and the planet's greenhouse effect (G). Extended Planetary Temperature Formula: T = (S(1-A) / (16σ))(1 - G / 10)1/4 Where: T: Temperature in Kelvin S: Solar constant (the energy received per unit area from the star) A: Albedo (reflectivity) of the planet's surface σ: Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^(-8) W m^(-2) K^(-4)) G: Greenhouse effect coefficient (ranging from 0 to 10) Additionally, we can introduce another factor to account for planetary radioactivity. This factor (R) reflects the additional internal heat generated by radioactive decay in the planet's core. Modified Extended Planetary Temperature Formula: T = (S(1-A) / (16σ))(1 - (G+R) / 10)1/4 Example Calculation (Earth's Temperature): Let's calculate the extended planetary temperature considering the greenhouse effect (G) and radioactivity (R). For Earth, we assume G = 2 and R = 1. Given: S = 1361 W m^(-2) (solar constant) A = 0.3 (Earth's albedo) G = 2 (Earth's greenhouse effect) R = 1 (radioactivity factor) Substituting these values into the formula: T = (1361(1-0.3) / (16(5.67 x 10^(-8))))(1 - (2+1) / 10)1/4 Simplifying: T = (952.7 / (90.72 x 10^(-8)))(1-0.3) T = (10.49 x 10^9)(1-0.3) T = (10.49 x 10^9)(0.7) T = 7.343 x 10^9 Therefore, Earth's temperature would be approximately 7.343 x 10^9 Kelvin using the given greenhouse effect (G) and radioactivity factor (R)."},{"instruction":"how to set a pragma variable in c file that not declare any where in the code and and pass in cmake or compile time","output":"In C, pragmas are a way to provide additional information to the compiler; they are not used to set variables directly.

The tick rate (how often the tick interrupt occurs) is usually configurable in the RTOS settings, often defined in a file like \`FreeRTOSConfig.h\`. The tick rate determines the granularity of time-related functions.

The actual time a tick represents in milliseconds can vary depending on your RTOS tick configuration. It's common for the tick period to be 1 ms, but it can be set to different values when configuring the RTOS. Note: The precision of the measurement is limited by the tick rate. If the function execution time is less than the tick period, the measurement will be less precise, and functions that take less time to execute than one tick will be measured as taking one tick.

For example, Clerics have a \\"Domain of Diapers\\", or Bards have a \\"College of Pampering\\"?","output":"In such a unique setting, these specialized subclasses could provide quirky and thematic options for players who want to fully explore the diaper-centric culture of the world. Below are some subclass concepts for each of the main 5e classes, each focusing on diapers and their uses. # Cleric: Domain of Diapers Clerics of the Domain of Diapers believe in the sanctity and protective power of diapers. They see them as symbols of care and guardianship, providing divine comfort to those in need. Domain Spells 1st-level: *Sanctuary*, *Absorb Elements* 3rd-level: *Aid*, *Lesser Restoration* 5th-level: *Protection from Energy*, *Mass Healing Word* 7th-level: *Guardian of Faith*, *Stoneskin* 9th-level: *Greater Restoration*, *Mass Cure Wounds* Diaper Ward At 1st level, you gain proficiency with Diaper Armor. When you wear Diaper Armor, it has extra divine protection, providing additional hit points equal to your Cleric level to any temporary hit point pool you have. # Barbarian: Path of the Enduring Bulk Barbarians on the Path of the Enduring Bulk see the bulkiness of diapers as a challenge to be endured and overcome, often testing their physical limits with heavily Loaded armor. Heavyweight Champion Starting at 3rd level, while raging, you can double the Load capacity of any diaper you are wearing. Your movement speed is not reduced by the weight of your diaper Load when you are raging. # Bard: College of Pampering Bards from the College of Pampering use song and story to ease the discomforts of travel and life, often focusing on the comfort and cleanliness diapers offer. Soothing Lullabies Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to perform a lullaby. Choose a number of creatures within 30 feet up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) that are wearing a loaded diaper. Each gains temporary hit points equal to your Bard level + your Charisma modifier. # Druid: Circle of Cushioning Druids of the Circle of Cushioning believe in the protective power of the natural world's softness, emulating the cushioning comfort found in creatures' nests and dens with their own enchanted diapers. Natural Comfort Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a naturally cushioned aspect (such as a rabbit or bear). While transformed, your natural armor AC includes a bonus equal to the Load capacity of your diaper divided by 10 (rounded down). # Fighter: School of the Fortified Defender Fighters who train in the School of the Fortified Defender view diapers as the ultimate defense tool, using them to create an impenetrable barrier. Diaper Defense At 3rd level, when you choose this archetype, you gain the ability to use a diaper as a shield. When worn, Heavy Diaper Armor provides an additional +1 to your Armor Class on top of its normal benefits. # Monk: Way of the Unburdened Mind Monks following the Way of the Unburdened Mind use meditation and mindfulness to rise above physical burdens, including those of a heavily Loaded diaper. Mind Over Matter Starting at 3rd level, you can spend 2 ki points to ignore the weight of your loaded diaper for 10 minutes per Monk level. During this time, the diaper doesn't reduce your speed and doesn't count against your carrying capacity. # Paladin: Oath of the Trusty Guardian Paladins who take the Oath of the Trusty Guardian swear to protect the innocence and comfort of those around them, seeing their diapers as symbols of trust and security. Guardianship At 3rd level, when you take this oath, you gain the ability to use your Lay on Hands pool to cleanse and refresh the diaper of an ally as an action, effectively giving them a fresh one without the need to change. # Ranger: Companion's Embrace Rangers choosing the Companion's Embrace focus on the partnership between themselves and their animal companions, sharing in the mutual comfort and support that diapers can provide in the wilderness. Embrace of the Wild Starting at 3rd level, your animal companion gains all the benefits of wearing a diaper suited to their size, including Load capacity and Armor Class bonuses. You can Load your companion's diaper using your own actions. # Rogue: Archetype of the Sneaky Swaddler Rogues of the Archetype of the Sneaky Swaddler are expert at using their diapers for stealth and escape, relying on their absorbent qualities to help with evasion. Muffled Movement Starting at 3rd level, your diaper grants you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as it isn't fully Loaded. If fully Loaded, you can still attempt to prevent noise, but you lose this advantage. # Sorcerer: Overswollen Origin Sorcerers of the Overswollen Origin draw power from their own capacity to bear burdens, with their spells often manipulating the weight and volume of their diapers for magical effects. Swollen Spellcasting At 1st level, when wearing a diaper, you can use your sorcery points to increase or decrease the current Load of your diaper by 5 lbs. for each sorcery point spent. This can affect how spells with weight-based conditions work. # Warlock: Diapact of the Overflowing Patron Warlocks bound to the Diapact of the Overflowing Patron are granted powers in exchange for carrying the \\"burden\\" of the patron's essence within their diapers. Diapered Boon Starting at 1st level, any diaper you wear has its Load capacity increased by your Warlock level x 5 lbs. Additionally, you can expend one use of your patron's granted abilities to instantly refresh your diaper once per long rest. # Wizard: School of Oversized Enlargements Wizards who delve into the School of Oversized Enlargements are obsessed with creating the most voluminous and magically potent diapers, focusing their studies on Size and Enlarge magic. Enlarged Encasing At 2nd level, you can cast the *Enlarge* spell targeting only your diaper as a ritual. The effect makes your diaper's Load capacity increase by 50%, and it requires no spell slot, but can only be performed once per long rest. These subclass ideas are envisioned to fit within the quirky and good-natured vibe of a setting where oversized diapers are the norm and play a significant thematic role in everyday life. They offer a blend of mechanical bonuses and role-playing opportunities that adhere to the unique premise of the homebrew world."},{"instruction":"What about some homebrew diaper-related spells? In this world, in addition to needing to expend a spell slot to cast spells, the bodily rush using magic puts upon the caster's body may make them, you guessed it, poop themselves, especially if it's a spell cast at a higher level.","output":"Introducing diaper-related spells into this homebrew world adds an extra dimension to the magic system and further ties character abilities to the setting's unique theme. Here are some homebrew spells with diaper-related effects in mind: # Swift Swaddle - **Level:** 1st - **School:** Abjuration - **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action - **Range:** Self or Touch - **Components:** V, S - **Duration:** 1 hour - **Description:** You touch a worn diaper, reinforcing its fastenings and enhancing its protective qualities. For the duration, the diaper provides an additional +1 bonus to AC and its Load capacity is increased by 25 lbs. When the spell ends, the diaper's owner must roll a Constitution saving throw or Load the diaper as their body reacts to the sudden release of magical tension. # Diaper Dynamo - **Level:** 2nd - **School:** Evocation - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** 60 feet - **Components:** V, S, M (a fragment of a diaper that has never been worn) - **Duration:** Instantaneous - **Description:** You create three orbs of bright light that smell faintly of baby powder. You can hurl them at targets within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each orb. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage, and they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have their diaper Load increased by 5 lbs. The spell's casting creates tension in your body; when casting this spell at 3rd level or higher, you must make a Constitution saving throw or immediately Load your diaper with 10 lbs. per level of the spell slot used. # Aromatic Aura - **Level:** 3rd - **School:** Conjuration - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** Self (15-foot radius) - **Components:** V, S - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute - **Description:** You emanate an aura of pleasant scent that calms and soothes allies. Creatures of your choice in the area when you cast the spell gain advantage on saving throws, and they gain resistance to psychic damage due to the comforting scent. Casting this spell puts significant strain on your body; when cast at 4th level or higher, your diaper immediately loads with 15 lbs. per level above 3rd. # Cushioning Poof - **Level:** 1st - **School:** Transmutation - **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls - **Range:** 60 feet - **Components:** V, S - **Duration:** Instantaneous - **Description:** As a reaction when you or another creature falls, you can cause a diaper they are wearing to rapidly inflate, cushioning their fall. If the creature is falling, this spell reduces any falling damage taken by 5d6, and it lands on its feet. The sudden magical inflation causes a physical reaction; the creature wearing the diaper must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or instantly Load their diaper. # Bulky Barrier - **Level:** 4th - **School:** Abjuration - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** Self - **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature diaper woven with silver thread) - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes - **Description:** You surround yourself with an invisible barrier of magical absorption. For the duration, you have resistance to all damage, and your diaper's Load capacity increases by 100 lbs. Each time you take damage, however, the barrier transfers some of the force to your body; you must make a Constitution saving throw or Load your diaper with 5 lbs. of the attack's damage type. When casting this spell at 5th level or higher, the diaper Load increases by an additional 20 lbs. for each slot above 4th. These spells are carefully designed to synergize with the setting's diaper theme and provide practical in-combat benefits, while also incorporating a fun risk-reward mechanic with the Constitution saving throws to avoid involuntary Loading. They can add both strategic depth and lighthearted humor to your D&D sessions.

In addition to the vanilla backgrounds, each background could have a \\"sub-background\\" describing how the character views diapers and how they personally like them. Do they wear them for the comfort, the practicality, or because they were either mandated or urged into wearing them? Do they wear them for their protective qualities, the fashion statement or just because its ubiquitous to wear them, and to not wear one is to face discrimination? Do they enjoy wearing them; do they not? How and when were they introduced to diaper-wearing; through a friend's suggestion, seeing them among a seller's wares, or because of their own curiosity? How do they feel about the inevitable process of Loading; do they hide it with a red face, or happily push it all out with a smile? How big do they like their diapers; modest or titanic to the point of immobility?","output":"In a world where diapers play a central role, introducing diaper-related sub-backgrounds would help players create three-dimensional characters with unique perspectives and experiences regarding this essential aspect of their lives. Here are a few sample sub-backgrounds that could be added to the standard backgrounds in the Player's Handbook: # Comfort-Seeker (Sub-Background for Any) You wear diapers primarily for their unmatched comfort and the warm, secure feeling they provide. You may have been introduced to them during a period of need or simply developed a preference over the years. You enjoy the soft embrace and often advocate for the finer materials and plush designs. **Feature: Serene Presence** You've learned to maintain a warm and inviting demeanor. Once per long rest, you can grant yourself or an ally advantage on a skill check related to social interaction, as your calm nature puts others at ease. # Practical Practicalities (Sub-Background for Any) Practicality is your guiding principle. You see diapers as essential tools for adventuring—protection, emergency supplies, and versatile garments. The comfort is secondary to their functionality, and you often choose diapers suited for various environmental conditions. **Feature: Ready for Anything** You are always prepared to face unexpected situations. Once per long rest, you can produce a makeshift tool or device from your diaper that grants you advantage on a single ability check or saves you from a single environmental hazard. # Fashion Forward (Sub-Background for Noble, Entertainer) To you, diapers are the ultimate fashion statement. You've always been at the forefront of diaper fashion, be it through avant-garde designs, enchanting patterns, or diapers accentuated with luxurious jewels. It's about standing out and expressing identity. **Feature: Eye for Style** Your fashion sense often dazzles onlookers. Once per long rest, you can perform an action that requires someone's attention, temporarily distracting them with your fashionable diaper, granting you advantage on a Charisma (Performance) or (Deception) check. # Mandatory Wearer (Sub-Background for Soldier, City Watch) Diapers are a requirement for you—be it an enforced uniform code or a mandate for your position. Initially, it may have been awkward, but over time, it's become a second nature. You focus on their protective qualities and their role in uniformity and order. **Feature: Official Authority** Your official-looking diapers confer an air of authority. Once per long rest, you can leverage your appearance to gain access to restricted areas or command temporary cooperation from lower-ranking individuals. # Inevitable Part of Life (Sub-Background for Folk Hero, Commoner) Wearing diapers is as normal to you as eating or sleeping. Coming from a culture where they're ubiquitous, you never questioned their place in daily life. To not wear one is not just impractical but socially unacceptable. **Feature: Common Ground** Your experience with common cultural norms allows you to bond easily with others. Once per long rest, you can leverage shared understanding to gain favor or gather information from common folk or travelers. # Blissful Loader (Sub-Background for Hermit, Sage) You fully embrace the process of Loading with a smile, seeing it as a natural and enjoyable bodily function. Whether for philosophical or personal reasons, it's an act you neither hide nor shy away from. You may even seek out particularly grand diapers to facilitate your disposition. **Feature: Unperturbed** You're unbothered by circumstances that might embarrass others. Once per long rest, when you or an ally fails a Charisma saving throw that pertains to embarrassment or social faux pas, you can negate the failure, turning it into a success. # Modest Minimalist (Sub-Background for Acolyte, Cloistered Scholar) You prefer your diapers modest in size and bulk, valuing agility and freedom of movement over excessive padding. Perhaps it reflects a vow of simplicity or a choice to prioritize other aspects of life over the normative excesses of diaper culture. **Feature: Nimble Movements** Your choice of minimal diapers affords you greater mobility. Once per long rest, you can perform an action or reaction that underscores your agility to avoid an attack or environmental danger, gaining advantage on a Dexterity saving throw related to movement. # Curious Explorer (Sub-Background for Outlander, Explorer) Introduced to diapers through a mix of necessity and curiosity, you've experimented with various types and styles throughout your travels. You've adopted an open-minded approach to diaper wearing, gladly trying out new and exotic creations. **Feature: Adventurous Spirit** Your willingness to try new things can be inspiring. Once per long rest, when you or an ally faces a new or unfamiliar situation, you can provide inspiration that grants advantage on an ability check related to the novelty. These sub-backgrounds can enrich your character's history and motivations, adding depth to how they interact with the world. Each background includes a unique feature representing the character's attitude and experience with diapers, allowing for nuanced role-playing opportunities and reflecting the diverse takes on this unique aspect of life. As always, the themes and content should be introduced collaboratively and with consideration of the preferences and boundaries of all players involved in the game."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This word is never ... in our company. a) spoken b)told c) said","output":"a) spoken The correct sentence is: \\"This word is never spoken in our company.\\""},{"instruction":"why spoken?","output":"\\"Spoken\\" is the correct choice in this sentence because it refers to a word being verbally articulated or pronounced. The phrase \\"never spoken\\" indicates that the word is not uttered aloud within the company. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices are not as fitting in this context: - \\"Told\\" would imply the transmission of a story or information rather than the mere articulation of a single word. It would be more appropriate in a context where a narrative or piece of information is being recounted or relayed to others. - \\"Said\\" could be considered a potential alternative to \\"spoken,\\" as \\"said\\" also indicates verbal expression. However, the form \\"spoken\\" fits more naturally into the specific phrasing of the sentence. \\"Said\\" would be more commonly used directly with a subject, as in \\"He said a word,\\" rather than in the passive construction \\"is said.\\" The verb \\"to speak\\" is often used when focusing on the act of using one's voice, and it better captures the notion of a prohibition on voicing the particular word in the company. Thus, \\"spoken\\" is the most appropriate choice grammatically and semantically for the given sentence."},{"instruction":"9. Someone left us this book. That ... be my son. a) mustn't b)needn’t c) can’t","output":"c) can’t The correct sentence is: \\"Someone left us this book. That can't be my son.\\" The sentence suggests that the speaker believes it's not possible that their son left the book, and \\"can't\\" is used to express impossibility or very low probability in this context. Here's why the other options are not appropriate: a) \\"mustn't\\" implies prohibition, which doesn't make sense in this context. You wouldn't use \\"mustn't\\" to talk about an improbability or impossibility relating to a past event. b) \\"needn’t\\" implies a lack of necessity. It does not fit the context where the speaker is expressing disbelief or negating the possibility of someone's action."},{"instruction":"5. I have never been ...

Here, the speaker is saying that they have never been informed of this desire to move. - \\"Spoken\\" would not work here unless you are referring to a conversation or discussion, which isn't implied in this sentence. \\"Spoken\\" is generally used for indicating the act of speech or the manner in which something is articulated verbally. - \\"Said\\" typically refers to uttering words or stating something and would not be correct as it doesn't match the structure of the sentence.

This should be a part of her dialogue but I'm not sure where to put it. 3) I want add subtle non-verbal details to show ser Criston is less polite and more tensed, Rhaenyra should notice him a bit weird but say nothing. My draft: The morning yielded a rare spectacle of tranquility upon the grounds of the stout castle, with shafts of amber sunlight piercing the cool, grey mist that clung stubbornly to the ancient stones. Rhaenyra walked the well-trodden garden paths, the cold stones beneath her shoes giving way to the softer crunch of the gravel. A gentle wind stirred her dark hair, carrying away the ever-present shadow of council meetings and the quiet urgency that resided within the high walls of Dragonstone. She moved with purpose, yet a sense of regret tinged her steps as she passed through the various clusters of her courtiers. Her ladies-in-waiting fluttered nearby like colorful birds temporarily distracted from their preening. Elsewhere, her children’s clear laughter rang out, joyful and carefree. They were attended by a nanny whose watchful gaze followed their every tumble and jest. The lady of the castle was not blind to the way the servants paused in their pursuits to offer bows and carefully-measured glances. Rhaenyra acknowledged them with a polite nod, the corners of her mouth turning upward in a reserved smile. These were her people, and they respected her command, but the adherence to protocol was a curtain that sometimes obscured the truth of one’s heart. Today, however, her focus was singular: to find Nyra, her confidante and kin, for a conversation of importance. Nyra had sought refuge within the garden’s embrace, yearning, perhaps, for a moment of respite from the cacophony of court life. Rhaenyra could scarcely blame her. They were both carved from the same stone of duty and expectation, thrust upon them by their noble birth. But solitude was a companion that often eluded those of their station. Rhaenyra spotted the object of her intention ensconced in the shelter of the tall pines and the thick laurel hedge, her form briefly obscured by the blossoming branches of a cherry tree. The reluctance in Nyra’s posture was palpable even from a distance, and the dragonrider’s keen eyes did not miss the brief, defensive movement as Nyra attempted to shield herself from intrusion. “Lady Nyra, I’d like to speak with you,” Rhaenyra called out,. The words hung between them, a bridge across the chasm of quietude that Nyra had sought to maintain. As Nyra paused, the swell of the sea against the cliffs echoed in the stillness of the moment. She turned to face Rhaenyra, her expression a tapestry interwoven with layers of reluctance and curiosity. The winds of change knew no master, and as they walked together towards the pond’s serenity—Rhaenyra, the heir to the throne, and Nyra, touched by less tangible visions—their path was scrutinized by the ever-observant eyes of the court. Leaving the children in the care of an upper nanny and two ladies in waiting, Rhaenyra took Nyra to the far bench. \\"What did you want to speak with me about?\\" Nyra asked cautiously, her voice laced with caution and a hint of camaraderie. It was a conversation that could alter the course of their destinies, filled with unspoken words but carrying immense weight. \\"I sent you tea,\\" Rhaenyra spoke in High Valyrian, ensuring their conversation would not be overheard by others. \\"Tea?\\" Nyra repeated, confusion evident on her face. Rhaenyra nodded towards her sons playing nearby. \\"To avoid any...unwanted consequences,\\" she replied with a knowing look. Nyra took a step back, \\"You...you know?\\" Rhaenyra simply nodded, choosing not to embarrass Nyra further by bringing up the incident with Daemon. \\"Yes, he mentioned meeting you as you returned to your chambers yesterday.\\" To her credit, Nyra did not look away or blush. Instead, she held Rhaenyra's gaze with quiet bravery. After a moment of silence, Nyra asked, \\"Have you done the same in your past?\\" The question hung in the air, heavy with implications and unspoken truths. Rhaenyra briefly pondered what to say. \\"No, I didn't. I returned to my chambers drunk and seduced my sworn guard and made him hate me afterwards?\\" She cringed internally and chose a more vague response. \\"No, not exactly. But I've faced my own choices,\\" Rhaenyra continued, her gaze moving beyond Nyra to the still water of the pond. \\"And their repercussions.\\" Nyra frowned. \\"That's what I meant to talk about with you,\\" Rhaenyra said. \\"About my life and some choices that led me here. I bet you have many questions.\\" Nyra nodded. \\"Where should I begin?\\" Rhaenyra pondered aloud. \\"Perhaps with the direct aftermath of my escapades in Flea Bottom, right where you stand now. In short, news of my indiscretions reached my father's ears through his Hand. Daemon was exiled and I was ordered to marry Laenor. My courtship tour came to an abrupt end as we sailed back home to Driftmark, where we pleaded with Lord Corlys for his son's hand...\\" Nyra listened her with wide eyes. Rhaenyra spoke with calm voice, recalling bitter and awful scenes from her forced betrothal, hurried wedding, broken wedding welcoming feast and lonely wedding ceremony among blood and tears. Her lonely first months of marriage, a few fruitless awkward attempts to conceive an heir until Laenor refused to touch her altogether. \\"But then I noticed Harwin,\\" Rhaenyra admitted with a soft smile, tinged with bitterness. \\"He was my solace during those dark days. A kind and supportive presence.\\" \\"Laenor accepted Jace, Luke and Joffrey as his children, they are his sons,\\" said Rhaenyra. \\"But they are not,\\" uttered Nyra, her voice little more than a whisper, although there no people nearby. \\"Your heirs are ba- \\"Don't you dare to complete that sentence,\\" Rhaenyra warned, a sharp ice piercing through her soft spoken demeanor. \\"They are my children and they carry my husband's name. That is all that matters.\\" Nyra swallowed hard, looking away from Rhaenyra's fierce gaze and towards the stillness of the pond. Rhaenyra's own words weighed heavily on her mind, and she could feel the disapproval of her younger self in the air. As Nyra's troubled expression caught her attention, Rhaenyra let a moment of silence linger between them, knowing that there were some questions better left unspoken. But Nyra was not one to shy away from the uncomfortable truths. \\"Were you happy all these years?\\" she prodded. The question struck Rhaenyra like a dagger to the heart. She twisted her rings nervously, contemplating how to answer. Her love for her sons was undeniable, and she would never regret their births. Yet, as she thought of the sacrifices she made and the walls she had to build around herself, a pang of sadness overwhelmed her. The constant threats and whispers from courtiers who looked upon her sons as nothing but mongrels...the distant and unattainable Laenor...and Harwin, whom she did love in her own way, but whose stolen moments of passion could not truly bring her happiness. No, the only true joy she found was in her children, in their innocent laughter and games, in the way they gazed up at her with adoration in their eyes. \\"I found moments of tranquillity, Nyra,\\" Rhaenyra finally conceded, feeling a pang of bitterness taint her words. \\"And of joy with my children, they made it all worth it. But do not think I did not wish for more... For a husband who could love me wholeheartedly, for a life without secrets and whispers behind my back. But still, I found it eventually with Daemon and our united family.\\" \\"So I have to wait until Laena dies, right?\\" asked Nyra with some sarcasm. Rhaenyra sighed, her eyes clouding over with regret. \\"I wish I could say it would be different, but yes, that is the truth,\\" she admitted. \\"The union of Daemon and Laena is needed to bind Velaryons to our cause, as his daughters. That's why we need to keep the order of events intact. As Rhaenyra spoke the last words, she could feel her younger self's disdain burning through her skin. Nyra refused to meet her gaze, the fire in her eyes a testament to her inner turmoil. \\"Do you understand, Nyra?\\" Rhaenyra faced her head on. Nyra's slow nod and clenched jaw were enough of an answer. \\"I do,\\" she said, the words spat out through gritted teeth. \\"But it doesn't mean I have to like it.\\" \\"I wish things were different too,\\" admitted Rhaenyra. \\"I know my story brings you no joy. My union with Laenor was meant to appease my father and solidify my claim to the throne. \\"Why did it have to be Strong?\\" Nyra burst out in frustration. \\"Why couldn't you have chosen someone else, someone who resembled you?\\" Rhaenyra sighed heavily, knowing deep down that Nyra's question held some truth. \\"Loyal and trustworthy men are a rarity in King's Landing,\\" she explained sadly. \\"Harwin has proven himself to me time and time again, and in this court, that is a rare quality indeed.\\" \\"And he just happens to also be extremely handsome,\\" Nyra scoffed before turning away, unable to hide her bitterness. Rhaenyra understood her frustration and searched for more words to say. She turned when she noticed Nyra's gaze shift over her shoulder. All four older children walked towards her with ser Criston in tow. Rhaenyra's brow furrowed in confusion. Luke was meant to begin his morning training with Criston at this very hour. They greeted her and Nyra. \\"Princess,\\" ser Criston bowed deeply before her. \\"Ser Crispian,\\" Rhaenyra addressed him formally by his alias. \\"What brings you here at such an early hour?\\" \\"Mother?\\" Jace flashed a charming smile at her. \\"I know you have permitted Luke to train with our... esteemed guest,\\" he glanced over at the knight. \\"But Baela and I were wondering if we could also partake in his teachings. It is a rare opportunity to learn from such a renowned fighter.\\" \\"Train with real weapons?\\" Nyra exclaimed incredulously, looking at Baela. \\"Of course,\\" Baela replied proudly. \\"My father allowed it. Our grandmother Alyssa trained with weapons too.\\" \\"It is true,\\" Rhaenyra confirmed, casting a quick glance at each of them. \\"Ser, would you be able to train Lady Baela as well?\\" Ser Criston shrugged nonchalantly. \\"I have never trained a lady in sword fighting before, but Lady Baela assures me she knows the basics. I will do my best.\\" Rhaenyra felt Jace was not speaking the whole truth but she decided to let the matter go for now. \\"Very well,\\" she said with a nod. \\"You may all train with ser Criston.\\" The knight inclined his head respectfully, but Rhaenyra noticed his gaze linger on Nyra with a strange mix of doubt and longing - a look she had seen on him many times before. What surprised her even more was the calculating interest in Baela and Rhaena's eyes as they watched Nyra intently. Her curiosity piqued, Rhaenyra wondered what could be causing this sudden attention. Nyra finally felt their stare and shifted on her feet. For a brief moment, she met the intense gazes directed at her before Baela and Rhaena exchanged a knowing look and led their betrothed to the nearby bench. One of the ladies-in-waiting, called to Rhaenyra, breaking her concentration. \\"I must leave you now to attend to my duties, Nyra. Don't forget the tea I left for you in your room, it's sitting on your vanity,\\" Rhaenyra said before turning and walking away, leaving Nyra alone with her thoughts. She couldn't help but hope that her younger self would have the wisdom to make the right decision in this tumultuous time.","output":"Below are line edits and additions to your draft to convey the details you requested: 1) Rhaenyra explaining to Nyra her lack of regret for her sons Original: \\"I found moments of tranquillity, Nyra,\\" Rhaenyra finally conceded, feeling a pang of bitterness taint her words. \\"And of joy with my children, they made it all worth it...\\" Edit/Addition: \\"I found moments of tranquility, Nyra,\\" Rhaenyra finally conceded, the air around her almost shivering with the weight of her truth. \\"My sons, my boys... they are the stars in a night that has often known too much darkness.

He shifted weight from one foot to another, his hand momentarily clenching the hilt of his sword in a grip that spoke of silent struggle. Rhaenyra noted the subtle crease between his eyebrows, a tell that he was less at ease than he wished to project. His gaze, normally direct and unwavering, now darted briefly to the side before meeting hers. The air was fraught with an unspoken tension knitting itself into the quiet morning. Gently biting the inside of her cheek, Rhaenyra elected to ignore the crackling undercurrents of Ser Criston's demeanor.

В Unity для реализации нажатия на кнопку пальцем в VR, можно использовать различные подходы в зависимости от используемой системы отслеживания движений (например, Oculus Touch, HTC Vive Controllers, Valve Index Controllers и др.). Здесь я приведу общий пример, как это можно реализовать: 1. **Распознавание столкновения**: Создайте виртуальную кнопку с коллайдером (Collider), который будет реагировать на касание. Обычно используется компонент \`BoxCollider\` или \`SphereCollider\`. 2. **Регистрация касания**: Используйте событийную модель Unity (например, \`OnTriggerEnter\` и \`OnTriggerExit\`), чтобы определить, когда палец входит в контакт с коллайдером кнопки. 3. **Анимация пальцев**: Если у вас есть модель руки с анимированными пальцами, убедитесь, что она корректно отслеживает движение пальцев и может нажимать кнопку. 4. **Системы ввода VR**: Используйте API систем ввода для отслеживания состояния пальца VR-контроллера. Например, если вы используете Oculus, вам понадобится OVRInput. Для SteamVR используйте SteamVR_Action_Boolean. Вот пример реализации на C# скрипте в Unity: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.Events; public class VRButton : MonoBehaviour { public UnityEvent onPressed; // Событие, которое будет вызвано при нажатии private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) { // Здесь мы проверяем, действительно ли коллайдер является пальцем (или контроллером) if (other.CompareTag(\\"Finger\\")) // Удостоверьтесь, что коллайдер пальца имеет тег \\"Finger\\" { PressButton(); } } private void PressButton() { // Вызываем событие нажатия кнопки onPressed.Invoke(); } } \`\`\` Замените \\"Finger\\" на соответствующий тег, который назначен коллайдеру пальца или интерактивной части VR-контроллера. Не забудьте назначить необходимые действия на событие \`onPressed\` через инспектор Unity, подключив к нему соответствующие методы, которые хотите выполнить при нажатии на кнопку.

В контексте VR и системы физики Unity, вот несколько рекомендаций когда и зачем добавлять \`Rigidbody\`: 1. **Кинематический Rigidbody**: Если вы хотите, чтобы коллайдеры на вашем объекте (например, на пальце VR или на кнопке) реагировали на события столкновения физической системы (как \`OnTriggerEnter\`), но при этом не хотите, чтобы объект участвовал в физических расчетах (не падал под действием гравитации, не отталкивался от других объектов), можно добавить компонент \`Rigidbody\` и установить его в кинематический режим, установив флаг \`isKinematic\` в \`true\`. 2. **Dynamic Rigidbody**: Если вы хотите, чтобы кнопка реагировала физически корректно на нажатия (то есть могла перемещаться или нажиматься под действием силы), то добавление \`Rigidbody\` с отключенным \`isKinematic\` будет обязательным. В этом случае кнопка будет вести себя как настоящая физическая кнопка, с возможными движениями и отскоками. 3. **Без Rigidbody**: Если функционал физического движка не требуется, и реализовать нажатие кнопки можно лишь через анимацию или изменение состояния объекта при определенных событиях, тогда компонент \`Rigidbody\` может быть не нужен. Например, если кнопка — это просто интерфейсный элемент, который меняет свой цвет или запускает какой-то функционал без физических расчетов, то \`Rigidbody\` использовать не обязательно. Если вы используете компонент \`Rigidbody\`, имейте в виду, что необходимо правильно настроить его параметры, такие как Mass (масса), Drag (сопротивление), и использовать соответствующие методы для взаимодействия с ним (используйте, например, \`AddForce\` для приложения силы). Итак, добавление \`Rigidbody\` зависит от того, какую механику взаимодействия вы хотите реализовать. Если кнопка должна реагировать на столкновения как физический объект, то да, нужно добавить \`Rigidbody\`. Если же нажатие кнопки — это чисто виртуальное действие, симулируемое программными средствами, то \`Rigidbody\` можно не добавлять."},{"instruction":"Work Anniversary wishes for a colleague who is very humble, helpful and talented.

Crafting an effective menu is a critical part of game design, especially for horror games, where the atmosphere and mood-setting begins right from the first screen. Feel free to share the details about your game's menu, and I can provide feedback or suggestions to enhance its impact on the player. Include aspects like the visual style, audio elements, menu options available, and any unique features or interactions that players might encounter."},{"instruction":"There's a ventriloquist doll hanging off a table, film reels, a book with a odd logo on it, a 8mm camera, a bodybag being zipped up and a gas mask. The loading screens are of film strips.","output":"Your horror game menu conjures a strong visual sensation that aligns well with classic horror motifs. Let's break down each of your elements and consider how they could contribute to the overall atmosphere of your game: 1. **Ventriloquist Doll:** These dolls are classic horror icons, often associated with uncanny valley feelings and childhood fears. The doll hanging off the table could subtly animate, perhaps with an occasional twitch or eye movement, to unsettle the player. 2. **Film Reels:** This element suggests a theme of old films or recordings playing a role in the narrative. They could be spinning slowly, giving off a quiet, eerie clicking sound that adds to the ambiance. 3. **Book with an Odd Logo:** This could be a central element of your game's lore, possibly a grimoire or tome of forbidden knowledge. The logo might have a faint glow or seem to pulsate to draw the player’s eye. 4. **8mm Camera:** The inclusion of a camera could imply that the player will be seeing things through the lens or playing back events. It hints at the possibility of discovered footage style horror. Maybe every so often, the camera's flash could flicker, suggesting it just took a picture. 5. **Bodybag Being Zipped Up:** This is a macabre detail that instantly evokes a sense of mortality and can be quite chilling as an animated background feature. Sound design will be crucial here; the zipping sound could resonate with a finality that's disturbing. 6. **Gas Mask:** The presence of a gas mask could point to themes of contamination, biological hazards, or warfare. If it's an object in the background, it might slowly sway as if breathing, enhancing the creep factor. For the **loading screens**, film strips are a good choice if your narrative has anything to do with filmmaking, old footage discovery, or a period setting. They can continue the aesthetic established in the main menu and foster a sense of continuity. If pertinent, they might occasionally show glimpses of unsettling images or \\"scenes\\" that could hint at the game's backstory or future scares. **Audio Design:** For the menu, consider a soundscape that includes the whir of flickering film projectors, the subtle creak of the doll's wooden limbs, and a low, atmospheric drone that sets a foreboding tone. If you have themes relating to recording or playback, you could also incorporate muffled, indistinct voices or the crackle of old audio to suggest something is attempting to communicate from the past or another realm. **Interactivity:** If players can interact with any of these elements (like clicking on the book to access lore or the camera to view trailers or gameplay clips), it could enrich the engagement of the player from the outset. Interactive menus are also a great way to foreshadow important gameplay mechanics and narrative devices. With these elements, you're on a good path to crafting a haunting and immersive first impression with your menu. Make sure all the components work together to foreshadow the game's story and gameplay without overwhelming the player. Subtlety is often the key to effective horror, and the menu is a great place to start setting those expectations."},{"instruction":"One interesting thing in this game is that our main character will sometimes hallucinate because of the withdrawal of a drug, a drug that prevents amnesia and stimulates memory. He hallucinates a ventriloquist doll named Frisbee, who tells him to kill innocent civilians. This hallucination comes from our main character's childhood fear of ventriloquist dolls.","output":"Incorporating psychological elements such as hallucinations into your horror game provides a rich narrative layer and affects gameplay dynamics profoundly. Here are some ideas and considerations for integrating your main character's hallucinations into the game effectively: # Narrative Integration: 1. **Backstory:** Establish your character's troubled relationship with the drug through storytelling. This might include finding journal entries, doctor's notes, or flashbacks that reveal the importance of the drug in maintaining their sanity and lucidity. 2. **Character Development:** Show the deterioration of your character's mental state over time. Perhaps early in the game, the hallucinations are mild and easily dismissed, but as the drug's absence takes its toll, they become more intense and harder to separate from reality. 3. **Childhood Fear:** To capitalize on the childhood fear of ventriloquist dolls, you could include subtle references or foreshadowing before the player encounters Frisbee. Old photos, creepy doll parts scattered around, or a broken ventriloquist doll could be found in the game's environment. # Gameplay Mechanics: 1. **Hallucination Triggers:** Determine what triggers the hallucinations. It could be stress-related, tied to specific locations, or a result of actions the player takes, like using too much of an item or failing to complete an objective. 2. **Consequences:** If the main character acts on Frisbee's demands, there should be consequences. Perhaps killing civilians adversely affects the storyline, attracts unwanted attention from an antagonist, or impacts the game's ending. 3. **Reality Checks:** Provide the player with a means to identify or question reality. Techniques might include finding a mirror to see if Frisbee's reflection appears, or utilizing an object from the main character's past as an anchor to reality. # Audio-Visual Design: 1. **Distorted Visuals:** Use visual cues to signal the onset of a hallucination. The screen could subtly distort or have a slight color shift. Frisbee's appearances might be preceded by visual static or flickering lights. 2. **Unsettling Audio:** Frisbee's voice could be mingled with other eerie sounds or echo as if not entirely part of the environment. Sound plays a key role in unsettling the player and enhancing the horror of hallucinations. 3. **Environmental Reactions:** The world could react to the hallucinations. Shadows could grow darker, objects could appear to move, and other non-playable characters (NPCs) might react with fear or confusion if the player acts on Frisbee's demands. # Player Impact: 1. **Moral Dilemma:** Force the player to make tough decisions based on their trust in their own perceptions. This can lead to moral dilemmas and increase the tension and horror as they doubt themselves and their actions. 2. **Psychological Profiling:** The game could react differently based on how much the player succumbs to the hallucinations. Are there multiple endings? Does the game have a morality system in place that is affected by these choices? By blending the horror of the protagonist's withdrawal-induced hallucinations with gameplay, you're creating a deeply personal and terrifying experience for the player. Such mechanics can also encourage multiple playthroughs to explore different paths and consequences as players look to either succumb to or fight against the manipulations of Frisbee. Remember, consistent narrative and gameplay integration is key to making these mechanisms immersive and impactful."},{"instruction":"Our main character is a young man named David Summers, a former security guard who wrongly institutionalized into the Markland Asylum for the Criminally Insane. He used to work as a security guard at a TV station called TV-MK and he found some documents that he shouldn't have found. He used to work as a police officer in the fictional town of Midway, but not much is known about his time in Midway. He is around his late 20s and he has brown hair with glasses.","output":"David Summers' background sets the stage for a psychologically complex and intriguing protagonist whose perception of reality is already being questioned due to his wrongful institutionalization and the side effects of his medication withdrawal. Here's how you could deepen the character and enrich the game experience: # Character Depth: 1. **Mysterious Past:** Keep details about David's time as a police officer in Midway vague initially, prompting the player to uncover his history through gameplay. Information could be revealed slowly through found objects, flashbacks, or encounters with characters who know him from Midway. 2. **Unreliable Narrator:** David's unreliable perception could make for interesting storytelling as the player is never quite sure if what they're experiencing is real or a hallucination. Use this to create suspense and tension in the narrative. 3. **Relatability:** Give David humanizing traits or habits that make him more than just his circumstances—like a specific item he's attached to or a hobby he fondly recalls from before his institutionalization. # Gameplay Integration: 1. **Exploration of Past:** Allow the player to delve into David's past as both a security guard and a police officer, using environments and items from his former workplaces to trigger memories and hallucinations. 2. **Documents and Clues:** Integrate gameplay mechanics that involve the player actively searching for and discovering information. The sensitive documents from the TV station could be part of a larger conspiracy that David starts piecing together, prompting more questions about who to trust. 3. **Interpersonal Dynamics:** Offer interactions with other characters, both past and present, which could present differing perspectives on David's sanity and character, encouraging the player to form their own opinions. # Visuals and Aesthetics: 1. **Appearance Details:** Reflect David's history and current situation in his appearance. His disheveled look—perhaps a worn-out security guard uniform—could signify his fall from a position of authority and stability. 2. **Environmental Storytelling:** Use environmental design to mirror David's state of mind. For example, the asylum could be initially orderly but become increasingly chaotic and dilapidated as David's hallucinations worsen. # Personal Struggles: 1. **Medication and Withdrawal:** The effects of the medication and its withdrawal can serve as both a plot device and gameplay mechanic, affecting his perceptions, abilities, and even physical performance. 2. **Internal Conflict:** David's internal struggle with hallucinations and his doubts over his sanity can be highlighted in key story moments, where he must decide whether to act on the doll's murderous suggestions or fight against them. 3. **Resolve and Strength:** Show that despite his challenges, David has moments of clarity and determination, instilling hope in the player that there might be a way to overcome his dire circumstances. # Player Connection: 1. **Empathy:** Craft scenes that elicit empathy for David's situation, fostering a connection between him and the player. Make the player care about his wellbeing and invested in uncovering the truth. 2. **Choice and Consequence:** Implement systems that offer meaningful choices reflecting David's morality and sanity, with genuine consequences that resonate throughout the game. By developing David Summers as a well-rounded protagonist with a rich backstory and complex psychological dimensions, you create an anchor for your horror game that provides an engaging narrative and a compelling gameplay experience. The mystery of his past, the struggle with his mental state, and the sinister forces at play all generate a strong investment in his journey and the outcomes of his actions."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},L={class:"card-container"},x={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],K={key:0},G={key:1};function H(n,e,h,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",L,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",x,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
