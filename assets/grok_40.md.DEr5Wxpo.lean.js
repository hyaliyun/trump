Logback is a logging framework for Java applications and provides various logging options, including the ability to log uncaught exceptions. To log uncaught exceptions using Logback, you can add a Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler to your application's main thread. This handler will be triggered whenever an uncaught exception occurs, allowing you to log the exception details. Here's an example of how you can set up Logback to log uncaught exceptions: 1. Add the Logback dependency to your project's build configuration (e.g., Maven or Gradle): \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId> <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId> <version>2.0.0</version> </dependency> \`\`\` 2. Create a Logback configuration file (e.g., \`logback.xml\`) in your application's classpath. This file defines various logging settings, including the output format and log file location. 3. Add a \`Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler\` to your application's main thread. Inside the handler, you can use the Logback API to log the exception details. Here's an example of setting up the \`Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler\`: \`\`\`java import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; public class Main { private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class); public static void main(String[] args) { // Set the UncaughtExceptionHandler Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler((thread, throwable) -> { logger.error(\\"Uncaught exception in thread: \\" + thread.getName(), throwable); }); // Your application code... } } \`\`\` With this setup, whenever an uncaught exception occurs in your application, Logback will log the exception details, including the thread name and the exception's stack trace."},{"instruction":"巴以冲突最新消息","output":"根据最新消息，巴以冲突仍在持续中。自5月10日以来，以色列与巴勒斯坦之间的冲突进一步升级，双方互相进行了空袭和炮击，导致许多人受伤甚至死亡。 以军在加沙地带进行了大规模的空袭，据报道，截至目前已造成约200名巴勒斯坦人死亡，其中包括许多儿童，数千人受伤，许多住宅和公共设施被摧毁。 巴勒斯坦的激进组织哈马斯发射了大量火箭弹袭击以色列境内城镇和城市，导致以色列人员伤亡和财产损失。以色列政府则回应称，他们正在进行自卫行动，并将继续打击哈马斯和其他激进组织。 国际社会对巴以冲突表达了极大的关注，并呼吁各方保持克制和遵守国际人道法。多个国家和组织正在努力进行斡旋，试图通过外交途径寻求停火和和平解决方案。 然而，截至目前，双方冲突仍未达成停火协议，巴以局势仍然紧张。国际社会继续密切关注局势的发展，并对双方冲突造成的人道主义危机表示关切。"},{"instruction":"今天有什么新闻","output":"很抱歉，我无法提供最新的新闻，因为我无法实时更新消息。我建议您查看可靠的新闻来源或使用新闻应用程序获取最新的新闻信息。"},{"instruction":"你的数据更新到几号","output":"我的数据更新到2022年5月20日。请注意，我无法实时更新，因此最新消息可能会有所变化。建议您查阅可靠的新闻来源以获取最准确和最新的信息。"},{"instruction":"请写几句山歌，表达工作辛苦，生活艰辛，要求诙谐幽默，搞笑，贴近生活，容易引起共鸣的！用词大胆","output":"山中苦活真不轻，手忙脚乱满山行。 背着锄头拖锄尾，翻山越岭气喘成。 半夜起床亮开门，捡石拣草也忙哪儿去。 辛辛苦苦才换豆汤，鸡毛蒜皮全都搞定啦。 但愿天上有仙船，把我从山间拯救出来。 不再挑担不再苦，悠闲自在过日子啦！"},{"instruction":"请写几句山歌，表达现代打工人，工作辛苦，生活艰辛，要求诙谐幽默，搞笑，贴近生活，容易引起共鸣的！用词大胆","output":"上班去上班，打工人求生存。 早起贪睡翻个身，迟到被扣全勤。 悄悄地摸进公司，躲避领导的目睹。 加班加点就是常态，时钟变成了我的哭泣。 月光照耀我的脸庞，银行卡催得我慌。 买菜都得打折扣，生活费成了谜团。 虽然苦逼却要笑，乐呵呵过每一天。 打工人从不抱怨，辛苦过日真快乐！"},{"instruction":"再生成一些","output":"打工一天忙碌忙，收入却是拮据样。 月光下偷偷计算账，美食欲望全碎裂。 加班加点顶压力，假期却成了奢望。 与饭碗较劲如登山，工资涨幅不在谈。 社交媒体太残酷，同事晒幸福欲哭无泪。 打工人的日常战斗，劳动伟大无处挡。 笑口常开都是假，实情只有自己知晓。 但愿有天逃离苦海，舒展翅膀飞向远方！"},{"instruction":"写几句歌词，表达当代打工人虽然工作忙辛苦，还是对未来充满希望","output":"辛劳付出尽心力，打工人的日子不易。 忙碌奔波穿城市，为梦想而不停歇。 困难挫折迎面来，但心中永远不放弃。 虽然辛苦，却从不妥协，因为明天充满希望。 每一丝努力都不白，未来会给予回报。 坚持付出 不畏艰辛，迎接光明与自由。 打工人的双手，创造辉煌的未来路。 相信自己永不言败，只要心中有梦想。 工作辛苦但前途光明，打工人用汗水点亮梦想。"},{"instruction":"复刻歌声的ai","output":"我怀着兴奋的心情，跨越时光的限制， 让我们再次听到那些经典旋律的回响。 AI复刻着歌声，让记忆重现光辉， 打工人的心声再次回荡在歌声之间。 工作辛苦的旋律，浸透着辛酸与奋斗， 但我们对未来充满希望，坚定追逐心中的梦想。 从黎明到夜晚，努力不停息， 在AI的歌声中，我们感受着共鸣的力量。 像潮水一样奔涌的节拍，激励着我们勇往直前， 打工人的火焰永不熄灭，永恒在歌声里回荡。 让AI的复刻歌声陪伴着我们， 让我们共同唱响坚定不移的心声。 时光流转，岁月如梭，歌声仍在传承， 工作辛苦，但我们始终保持对未来的信心。 通过AI的魔力，我们再次相聚， 让复刻的歌声点亮打工人的辉煌之路。"},{"instruction":"有ai工具可以复制歌声吗","output":"是的，现如今有一些AI工具可以通过学习和模拟声音数据来复制歌声。这些工具使用深度学习和声音合成技术，可以分析和模仿人类歌手的音色、音调和表达方式，以产生逼真的歌声。尽管这些技术还在不断发展中，但已经取得了一定的成果。然而，需要注意的是，出于版权等法律和道德的考虑，使用这些工具来复制和传播受版权保护的歌声是受限制的。"},{"instruction":"i can not remember the word 'render' mean can you help me?","output":"Certainly!

Peter was an ordinary lad, known for his mischievous adventures and love for magical tales. Little did he know that one day, his life would change dramatically through an unintentional encounter with a mischievous magical creature. One sunny morning, as Peter ventured into the enchanting Forest of Whispers, he stumbled upon a peculiar creature called Wixi. Wixi was a shapeshifter, notorious for granting wishes that came with unexpected consequences. Curiosity piqued, Peter approached Wixi cautiously, ready to test the power of this mythical being. \\"Dear Wixi, I wish to be able to witness the miracles of nature firsthand,\\" Peter requested with a twinkle in his eye. Little did he know that Wixi's version of granting wishes involved an elaborate twist. As soon as Peter finished his sentence, a radiant swirl of magical energy engulfed him, causing him to vanish momentarily. When the glow subsided, Peter found himself transformed into a woman. Shocked and perplexed, Peter gazed down at himself, admiring the delicate features and long flowing hair that now adorned his body. However, Peter's bewilderment didn't end there. To his dismay, he discovered a flock of decorative feathers effortlessly emerging from his scalp, growing longer with each passing day. But the most startling revelation came when Peter felt an uncomfortable twinge emanating from his lower abdomen. In disbelief, Peter realized that he would now lay chicken eggs every ten minutes. But it wasn't just the frequency that disturbed him; each egg's arrival brought an excruciating pain that left him doubled over in agony. The village soon learned of Peter's unique condition, and an air of curiosity mixed with worry spread through Crestwater. Peter's days were now consumed by the arduous task of egg-laying. Attempting to find solace, he sought advice from the village elders, who guided him with wisdom and compassion. They explained that this was an opportunity for Peter to learn empathy, as he could now empathize with creatures that gave birth with their own partaking of the birthing process himself. Despite the relentless pain, Peter understood the transformative power of empathy. He reached out to the village, initiating workshops on understanding and appreciating the experience of others. The locals were astonished by Peter's courage and determination to embrace change. As time progressed, Crestwater witnessed a profound transformation. The once-insular community became more inclusive and compassionate towards those who were different. Peter's plight had ignited a spark of understanding, bonding the villagers together in a new way. One fateful day, after countless eggs and endless perseverance, Peter found himself in the presence of Wixi once again. This time, however, Peter approached Wixi with a newfound wisdom and understanding. \\"I have learned the sacred gift of empathy, but I long to be my true self once more,\\" Peter conveyed to Wixi, with conviction in his voice. Hearing this, Wixi, impressed by Peter's growth, decided to grant him his final wish. The shimmering magical energy once again swirled around Peter, but this time, it gently embraced him, lifting him from his fragile female form. In an instant, Peter's body transformed back into his usual self – a young man with the lessons of compassion etched into his heart. Returned to his original form, Peter emerged from the Forest of Whispers, forever changed and eager to share his newfound empathy and understanding with the world. The village of Crestwater celebrated his return, recognizing that sometimes the greatest transformations come from the most unexpected of circumstances. And so, Peter became a beacon of acceptance, inspiring generations to embrace change as an opportunity for growth and understanding. The memory of his remarkable journey lived on, reminding all that empathy has the power to transform hearts, heal wounds, and lay the foundation for a stronger and more compassionate world."},{"instruction":"Rewrite it from Peter's first person past tense.

Together, we carry forward the legacy of acceptance, hoping to inspire others to view the world through the lens of kindness and understanding. And so, my journey continues, not just as Peter but as a symbol of transformation and empathy.

The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend.

However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1.

Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Pokémon Name: Bruokh Pokédex Entry: Bruokh, the Hurricane Pokémon. This elusive Flying and Dragon-type is said to be the guardian of Neptune. Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space. Type: Flying/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Storm Drain - Draws in all Water-type moves to raise Sp. Atk.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention. Following the tragic decimation of his family by a merciless Nidoking, little hope remained for this frail Pichu. As he lay dying from his grievous wounds, he was discovered by Shmaya, the human incarnation of Rayquaza. Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state. Lazarus has been graced with an Cronal body capable of miraculous regeneration, even from mortal damage. His type has shifted to Electric/Dragon due to the portion of Rayquaza’s divinity he harbors, setting him apart from his kin and marking him as Shmaya’s chosen apostle.

As a subject in the RKS system’s early trials, Khlap gained the unprecedented ability to morph between the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee, adapting fluidly to myriad battlefield exigencies. This versatility renders Khlap a strategic chameleon able to counteract the various type advantages of opposing Pokémon. Ordinarily, Khlap retains its Normal-type essence. In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care. In a twist of destiny, Khlap found a soulmate in Helia, Professor Lillie’s daughter, becoming an irrevocable part of the young girl’s existence. As Helia’s guardianship fell upon it, Khlap vowed an oath of protection. Despite its pacific nature and struggles with form transformation, Khlap confronts adversity with undeterred bravery, attempting to shield Helia from the cruelties of the world. The bond they foster is a testament to the transcending love that unites human and Pokémon souls. Type: Normal Abilities: 1. Adaptability - Increases the power of moves that match Khlap’s type. 2.

Her long, emerald-green hair cascades down her waist, and her eyes are a piercing gold, bearing the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with poised and fluid grace. In her human form, Shmaya blends in seamlessly among the populace, with features that echo the elegance of her divine dragon counterpart. She typically dresses in colors that reflect her affinity with nature—greens and blues that match the earth and sky she commands. Shmaya carries herself with a quiet dignity that silently speaks volumes of her eternities lived and the deep knowledge acquired throughout. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon entrusted with maintaining the balance between Kyogre and Groudon. When celestial disruptions portend calamity, Shmaya crosses the threshold from her divine realm to walk the earth. Her mission is to subtly guide mankind away from choices that might lead to ecological disaster or disharmony with Pokémon. As a custodian of the skies and the atmospheric divinity, Shmaya embraces a hands-off approach, preferring to influence events from the periphery unless the circumstances deem direct intervention necessary. Her existence is intertwined with the great cycles of nature; she acts as a sentry against threats beyond human comprehension. The world stands at a crucial tipping point, with the rise of unchecked industrialization, a burgeoning disregard for the environment, and intensified crises dividing Pokémon and humans. In response, pockets of resistance have begun to emerge. Shmaya, ever attuned to the fluctuations of this balance, champions an advocacy of fair treatment against unchecked exploitation. She lends her support to conservationist efforts and the protection of endangered Pokémon species. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her existence, Shmaya radiates a calm and steady presence. This stability is a front for the ancient wisdom and understanding that fuel her renewed purpose. She has watched ages come and go, empires rise and fall, and with every passing century, her role becomes more crucial. Shmaya operates with a non-violent ethos, reflecting the Rayquaza lineage's role as mediator and balancer. She protects the sanctity of Pokémon and their habitat, ensuring their safety against human encroachment and vice versa. Underneath her gentle exterior lies a powerful resolve. When the balance of nature is threatened, she does not hesitate to unleash her true power. Shmaya serves as the antithesis to the destructive path humanity has paved. She is the emblem of what could be if humans and Pokémon lived in harmony. This spiritual maven and protector works tirelessly to foster a world where respect for nature and mutual prosperity prevails. Her physical journey is mirrored by an emotional one, as Shmaya seeks to pacify and rejuvenate the planet, one soul at a time. The stories and legends of earlier ages serve as her guiding light while remaining aware of humanity's potential for both destruction and greatness. Approachable yet enigmatic, Shmaya embodies a wisdom that transcends millennia. She imparts her knowledge to those willing to learn, nurturing the growth of young trainers and guiding them towards an enlightened coexistence with Pokémon. Her approach is subtle, empowering others to discover the truth and virtue within themselves. In a world teeming with crisis and teetering on the brink of ecological collapse, Shmaya’s actions strive to redirect the course towards hope. With the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, she endeavors to stir the collective conscience towards a future where reverence for all species is paramount. Shmaya's presence is a balm against the harsh injustices inflicted upon Pokémon, and her spirit is a beacon of non-violence. She provides safe havens for the persecuted and offers solace to those in distress. In the wealthy arcologies or decaying urban sprawls, Shmaya's silent vigilance never wavers. Her life is a dance of shadows and whispers, moving ever so delicately to restore the delicate balance between man, beast, and nature. Though the narrative of the world grows increasingly dystopian, figures like Shmaya stand as pillars of hope in the gathering darkness. She is the legacy of ancient protectors, the eternal guardian watching from the heavens, her dragon soul filled with unfathomable love for the planet and its myriad inhabitants. Her veneration for life and the sacred connection that once defined an era may yet awaken humanity to a rebirth of compassion and reverence long lost but never irretrievable. Shmaya's spiritual movement, led alongside the legendary trainers Red and Blue, strives for a resurgence of the Pokemon-human symbiosis that once defined a nobler era. Followers of her teachings adopt a lifestyle that eschews violence and cherishes the connection with their Pokemon partners..UnitTesting the time-worn bonds with practices of the past, Shmaya's followers take on the mantle of stewards for the Earth, shepherding the way for a brighter future in a time where such ideals face apathy or outright hostility. With humanity's fate hanging in the balance, the testament of Shmaya's life awaits its next verse. The lessons of the past linger in the air, whispers on the wind that beckon her forward in her eternal odyssey to uplift humanity and safeguard the world's uncharted wonders. The planet's tumultuous symphony continues, and within its crescendos and lulls, the promise of a harmonious chorus champions a unity that transcends species—a unity Shmaya seeks, with patience and grace, to render once again amidst the cacophony of man's discordant stride."},{"instruction":"大数据组件有哪些通用的测试工具和测试方法","output":"大数据组件的通用测试工具和测试方法包括以下几种： 1. 数据生成工具：用于生成大规模的测试数据，模拟真实环境下的数据流量，并检查数据生成的准确性和完整性。 2. 性能测试工具：用于评估大数据组件的性能，包括数据的处理速度、吞吐量和响应时间等指标。常用的性能测试工具包括Apache JMeter、Gatling等。 3. 安全测试工具：用于测试大数据组件的安全性，包括数据的加密、访问控制、身份验证和授权等方面。常用的安全测试工具包括Nessus、OpenVAS等。 4. 故障注入工具：用于模拟和注入不同类型的故障，以验证大数据组件的容错性和鲁棒性。常用的故障注入工具包括Chaos Monkey、SimianArmy等。 5. 自动化测试工具：用于实现大数据组件的自动化测试，包括功能测试、集成测试和回归测试等。常用的自动化测试工具包括Selenium、Appium等。 6. 安全静态分析工具：用于对大数据组件的源代码进行静态分析，发现潜在的安全漏洞和风险。常用的安全静态分析工具包括Fortify、FindBugs等。 7. 日志分析工具：用于分析大数据组件的日志文件，检测和排查系统的错误和异常。常用的日志分析工具包括ELK Stack（Elasticsearch、Logstash、Kibana）、Splunk等。 对于大数据组件的测试方法，一般可以分为以下几个方面： 1. 功能测试：验证大数据组件的各项功能是否符合需求，包括数据的采集、存储、处理和分析等方面。 2. 集成测试：测试大数据组件与其他相关组件或系统的集成，确保各个组件能够正常协同工作，数据能够无缝地流通和处理。 3. 性能测试：评估大数据组件的性能，包括数据的处理速度、吞吐量和响应时间等指标，以确定系统的性能瓶颈和优化方向。 4. 安全测试：测试大数据组件的安全性，包括数据的加密、访问控制、身份验证和授权等方面，以保护数据的机密性、完整性和可用性。 5. 容错测试：测试大数据组件的容错性和鲁棒性，包括故障注入和故障恢复等方面，以验证系统在各种故障条件下的表现和恢复能力。 6. 可靠性测试：测试大数据组件的可靠性和稳定性，包括系统的稳定性、可用性和可靠性等方面，以确保系统能够持续稳定地运行。 7. 审计和监控测试：测试大数据组件的审计和监控功能，包括对数据流和数据处理过程的跟踪和监控等方面，以满足合规性和监管要求。"},{"instruction":"n how many ways can 3 different novels, 4 different mathematics books, and 1 biology book be arranged on a bookshelf if: (a) The books can be arranged in any order?

Your answer is:","output":"Let's solve each part step by step: (a) The books can be arranged in any order: We have a total of 3 novels + 4 mathematics books + 1 biology book = 8 books. Since there are no restrictions, we simply need to find the number of permutations of these 8 books, which is 8 factorial (8!). So the answer is: 8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40320 ways (b) The mathematics books must be together and the novels must be together: We can treat the 4 mathematics books as one unit and the 3 novels as one unit. Additionally, we have the biology book as a single unit. So we have 3 units in total to arrange. We can arrange these 3 units in 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. However, within the mathematics unit, there are 4! ways to arrange the mathematics books, and within the novel unit there are 3! ways to arrange the novels. So the total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the units and the number of ways to arrange the books within each unit: 3! × 4! × 3! = 6 × 24 × 6 = 864 ways (c) The novels must be together but the other books can be arranged in any order: First, we treat the 3 novels as a single unit, which alongside the 4 mathematics books and the 1 biology book gives us 6 units in total to arrange. We can arrange these 6 units in 6! ways. Inside the novel unit, there are 3! ways to arrange the novels.

Subtract that from the total number of 4-letter words (with no restriction on the letter 'x'). Step 1: Calculate 4-letter words without 'x' For each position in the 4-letter word, we'd have 25 choices (all letters except 'x'). Hence, the number of such words is: 25 (choices for the first letter) × 25 (choices for the second letter) × 25 (choices for the third letter) × 25 (choices for the fourth letter) = 25^4 = 390,625 Step 2: Calculate 4-letter words with no restriction When there are no restrictions, each position of the 4-letter word has 26 choices, so the number of possibilities is: 26^4 = 456,976 Now to find the number of 4-letter words that contain at least one 'x', we subtract the number without 'x' from the total number: Total number of possible words with 'x' = Total number of 4-letter words - Number of 4-letter words without 'x' = 26^4 - 25^4 = 456,976 - 390,625 = 66,351 So, there are 66,351 possible 4-letter words that contain the letter 'x'."},{"instruction":"How many different 7 -letter permutations can be formed from 5 identical H's and two identical T's?

First, let's find the total number of functions without any restrictions. Each element in set A can be mapped to any of the five elements in set B. Since there are 5 elements in set A, and each element has 5 choices in set B, the total number of unrestricted functions is 5^5. Next, we will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to subtract the number of onto functions (functions where every element of set B has at least one preimage in set A) from the total. Onto function calculations: - We exclude 1 element from set B. There are C(5, 1) ways to do this, so we have 4 possible targets for each element in set A. This gives us 4^5 mappings for each excluded element, which gives C(5, 1) * 4^5. - We exclude 2 elements from set B. There are C(5, 2) ways to do this, so we have 3 possible targets for each element in set A. This gives us 3^5 mappings for each pair of excluded elements, which gives C(5, 2) * 3^5. However, we are over-counting cases where we are excluding 1 then 2 elements from set B. We need to adjust for this over-counting: - We add back exclusion of 3 elements from set B. There are C(5, 3) ways to do this, so we have 2 possible targets for each element in set A. This gives us 2^5 mappings for each trio of excluded elements, which gives C(5, 3) * 2^5. Now, we need to subtract the onto functions from the total to find the number that are not onto: Total functions not onto = 5^5 - [ C(5, 1) * 4^5 - C(5, 2) * 3^5 + C(5, 3) * 2^5 ] Let's compute this: C(5, 1) = 5 (ways to choose 1 element) C(5, 2) = 10 (ways to choose 2 elements) C(5, 3) = 10 (ways to choose 3 elements) So the calculation is: Total functions not onto = 5^5 - [ 5 * 4^5 - 10 * 3^5 + 10 * 2^5 ] Now calculate the powers and factorials: 5^5 = 3125 4^5 = 1024 3^5 = 243 2^5 = 32 Total functions not onto = 3125 - [ 5 * 1024 - 10 * 243 + 10 * 32 ] Total functions not onto = 3125 - [ 5120 - 2430 + 320 ] Total functions not onto = 3125 - 3010 Total functions not onto = 115 So, there are 115 functions from {18, 19, 20, 21, 22} to {13, 14, 15, 16, 17} such that f is not onto."},{"instruction":"Count the number x of functions y: {18,19,...,22} →{13,14,...,17} so that y is not onto.","output":"To find the number ( x ) of functions ( y: {18,19,...,22} rightarrow {13,14,...,17} ) that are not onto, we'll use complementary counting. First, we'll count the total number of functions from a domain with 5 elements to a codomain with 5 elements, and then we'll subtract the number of onto functions. A function is onto if every element of the codomain has a pre-image in the domain. But since we're required to find the number of functions that are not onto, we need to consider each possible case where at least one member of the codomain does not have a pre-image. Step 1: Calculate the total number of functions Every element from the domain ({18,19,...,22}) can be mapped to any of the elements in the codomain ({13,14,...,17}). With five choices for each of the five elements in the domain, the total number of functions is (5^5). Step 2: Calculate the number of onto functions using Inclusion-Exclusion principle An onto function is not possible here since the domain and codomain have an equal number of elements. An onto function would require every element in the codomain to be mapped by a distinct element in the domain. Inclusion-Exclusion is often used when both sets have the same number of elements or the codomain is smaller than the domain, and we calculate subtracting cases when one or more elements in the codomain is not mapped. Since this is not the case here, no function will be onto if the sets have the same cardinality. Step 3: Calculate the number of not onto functions Since no function from a domain of 5 elements to a codomain of 5 elements can be onto if repetition is allowed (as we have more places to fill than we have unique items to fill with without repetition), all possible functions in this case are not onto. Therefore, the number of not onto functions ( x ) is equal to the total number of functions. Therefore ( x = 5^5 = 3125 ). So, there are 3125 functions from ({18,19,...,22}) to ({13,14,...,17}) such that ( y ) is not onto, which in this case is all possible functions."},{"instruction":"Denote by s the set of integers {47,48,...,50 }.

For a small set like this with 3 elements, we can list out the derangements directly: - One possibility is to map 47 to 48, 48 to 50, and 50 to 47. - Another possibility is to map 47 to 50, 50 to 48, and 48 to 47. These are the only two possible derangements because in each case, none of the elements in set ( s ) map to itself.

We'll handle the two cases separately. (i) ( p ) is one-to-one and ( p(7) = 6 ) Since ( p(7) = 6 ), it's given that 7 in the domain maps to 6 in the codomain. That means we have two elements left in the domain ({6, 8, 9}) and two in the codomain ({7, 8, 9}). Since the function must be one-to-one, we just need to count the number of permutations of the remaining 2 elements in the codomain. To decide where to map 6, we have 2 choices (either 8 or 9). Once we have mapped 6 to one of these, we have no choice for the remaining number (it must go to the leftover element from the codomain). So the number of one-to-one functions for this case is just 2 (from the 2 choices for where 6 can map). (ii) ( p ) is one-to-one and ( p(7) neq 6 ) In this scenario, ( p(7) ) cannot be 6, so 7 must map to either 8 or 9. That gives us 2 choices for where to map 7. After deciding where 7 is mapped, we have 2 remaining elements in the domain ({6, 8, 9} without the one 7 was mapped to) and, similarly, 2 remaining elements in the codomain ({6, 7, 8, 9} without the one 7 is mapped to). Again, these must map one-to-one, and there are 2 possibilities for the first mapping and only 1 for the second (the remaining unmapped number). This means that for each choice of where 7 goes (two choices), there are also 2 different ways to map the remaining 2 numbers. So, for case (ii), the number of one-to-one functions is 2 choices for ( p(7) ) times 2 choices for the other mappings, which equals 4. In total, summing up both cases: (i) The number of one-to-one functions where ( p(7) = 6 ) is 2. (ii) The number of one-to-one functions where ( p(7) neq 6 ) is 4.

(a) The probability that two people were born on Thursday: The probability that one person was born on Thursday is 1/7 since there are 7 days of the week and we are assuming each day is equally likely. Given this, the probability that a second person was also born on Thursday is also 1/7. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: ( P(text{both born on Thursday}) = frac{1}{7} times frac{1}{7} = frac{1}{49} ) (b) The probability that two people have a birthday in March: Since there are 12 months in a year and we're assuming all months are equally likely, the probability that one person has a birthday in March is 1/12. To find the probability that both people have a birthday in March, we again multiply the probabilities for each person since they're independent events: ( P(text{both have birthday in March}) = frac{1}{12} times frac{1}{12} = frac{1}{144} ) So, the probabilities are: (a) Two people were born on Thursday: 1/49 (b) Two people have a birthday in March: 1/144"},{"instruction":"An instructor gives his class a set of 16 problems with the information that the next quiz will consist of a random selection of 8 of them. If a student has figured out how to do 9 of the problems, what is the probability the he or she will answer correctly (a) all 8 problems? (b) at least 7 problems?","output":"To solve these problems, we can use combinations to count the number of favorable outcomes and then calculate probabilities based on a total number of possible selections of 8 problems from 16. (a) What is the probability that the student will answer all 8 problems correctly? The student knows how to solve 9 of the problems. So, for the student to answer all 8 chosen for the quiz correctly, all 8 must come from the 9 problems they know. The number of ways to choose 8 problems from the 9 that the student knows is the combination ( C(9, 8) ). The total number of ways to choose 8 problems from all 16 possible problems is ( C(16, 8) ). The probability is then: [ P(text{all 8 correct}) = frac{C(9, 8)}{C(16, 8)} ] Calculate the combinations: [ C(9, 8) = frac{9!}{8!(9 - 8)!} = 9 ] [ C(16, 8) = frac{16!}{8!(16 - 8)!} ] The factorial terms for ( 8! ) cancel out on both the numerator and denominator, simplifying the calculation. However, to give an exact answer, we would calculate the remaining terms numerically. For now, we have: [ P(text{all 8 correct}) = frac{9}{C(16, 8)} ] (b) What is the probability that the student will answer at least 7 problems correctly? The student must get all 7 of the problems they know and 1 that they do not know, or all 8 from the problems they know. For exactly 7 known problems: [ P(text{7 known correct}) = frac{C(9, 7) * C(7, 1)}{C(16, 8)} ] Where ( C(9, 7) ) is the number of ways to choose 7 problems from the 9 that the student knows, and ( C(7, 1) ) is the number of ways to choose 1 problem from the 7 that the student does not know. For all 8 known problems, we calculated the probability in part (a): [ P(text{all 8 correct}) = frac{9}{C(16, 8)} ] Adding these two probabilities gives the probability of answering at least 7 correctly: [ P(text{at least 7 correct}) = P(text{7 known correct}) + P(text{all 8 correct}) ] [ P(text{at least 7 correct}) = frac{C(9, 7) * C(7, 1) + 9}{C(16, 8)} ] The probabilities require exact calculation of the combinations for a numerical answer. In practice, these would be calculated using either a calculator with combinatorial functions or software capable of such computations."},{"instruction":"Find the coefficient of x^8 in (1+x)^14","output":"The binomial theorem provides a way to expand expressions of the form ((a + b)^n). According to the binomial theorem, the expansion of ((1 + x)^{14}) will contain terms of the form (C(14, k) cdot 1^{14-k} cdot x^k), where (C(14, k)) represents the binomial coefficient and (k) is the term index. The coefficient of (x^8) in the expansion of ((1 + x)^{14}) corresponds to the binomial coefficient where (k = 8). This can be found using the formula for the binomial coefficient: [ C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} ] Plugging in 14 for (n) and 8 for (k): [ C(14, 8) = frac{14!}{8!(14 - 8)!} = frac{14!}{8!6!} ] To simplify this calculation, we can expand the factorials and cancel out common terms: [ C(14, 8) = frac{14 cdot 13 cdot 12 cdot 11 cdot 10 cdot 9}{6 cdot 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1} ] Dividing term by term: [ C(14, 8) = frac{14 cdot 13 cdot 2 cdot 11}{1} ] [ C(14, 8) = 14 cdot 13 cdot 2 cdot 11 = 28 cdot 143 = 4004 ] Therefore, the coefficient of (x^8) in the expansion of ((1 + x)^{14}) is 4004."},{"instruction":"Expand the expression using the Binomial Theorem: (2x-3)^5","output":"The Binomial Theorem states that the expansion of ((a - b)^n) for a non-negative integer (n) is given by: ((a - b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n,k) cdot a^{n-k} cdot (-b)^k) where (C(n, k)) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as: (C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}) Now we can apply the Binomial Theorem to the expression ((2x - 3)^5): ((2x - 3)^5 = sum_{k=0}^{5} C(5,k) cdot (2x)^{5-k} cdot (-3)^k) Expanding this, we get: ((2x - 3)^5 = C(5,0) cdot (2x)^5 cdot (-3)^0 + C(5,1) cdot (2x)^4 cdot (-3)^1 + C(5,2) cdot (2x)^3 cdot (-3)^2 + C(5,3) cdot (2x)^2 cdot (-3)^3 + C(5,4) cdot (2x)^1 cdot (-3)^4 + C(5,5) cdot (2x)^0 cdot (-3)^5) Now let's calculate each term: (C(5,0) cdot (2x)^5 cdot (-3)^0 = 1 cdot (32x^5) cdot 1 = 32x^5) (C(5,1) cdot (2x)^4 cdot (-3)^1 = 5 cdot (16x^4) cdot (-3) = -240x^4) (C(5,2) cdot (2x)^3 cdot (-3)^2 = 10 cdot (8x^3) cdot 9 = 720x^3) (C(5,3) cdot (2x)^2 cdot (-3)^3 = 10 cdot (4x^2) cdot (-27) = -1080x^2) (C(5,4) cdot (2x)^1 cdot (-3)^4 = 5 cdot (2x) cdot 81 = 810x) (C(5,5) cdot (2x)^0 cdot (-3)^5 = 1 cdot 1 cdot (-243) = -243) Putting it all together: ((2x - 3)^5 = 32x^5 - 240x^4 + 720x^3 - 1080x^2 + 810x - 243)"},{"instruction":"Introducción anatomía humana","output":"La anatomía humana es el estudio de la estructura del cuerpo humano.

Standing at 6'0, with well-groomed, dark-blonde hair and bluish grey eyes, he's hard to miss, and he's considered highly attractive by female characters, and he does have fangirls among the cast, but not as many as Gojo. At just 15, he's first-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and an extremely prized prospect as the Kyoto School lacks considerable young talent in comparison to Tokyo. He's ranked semi-grade 1, the same as his rival Noritoshi Kamo as well as the late Kokichi Muta (Mechamaru), and Utahime Iori, the student supervisor at Kyoto. This means he's under heavy consideration for a promotion. He's the son of Nicolas and Rose, two French immigrants to Japan that run a shop specializing in cheesy pastries. Circumstances have lead him around the block. For one, his parents' dislike for large cities lead them to settle in Muko, a mid-sized city south of Kyoto. Coincidentally, Kyoto is also the site of a Jujutsu school, and though Satoru Gojo is a powerful recruiter, he ultimately chose to stay close to his parents. Second, he required outside training, and lived with his mentor, a special grade sorcerer, the controversial Yuki Tsukumo, in Kyoto from 6 to 12. During this training regimen, they would go to many places such as uninhabited islands. Yuki would joke that there were no witnesses, but this was really so they would not have to hold back. Cheese is at the forefront of his powers, extremely malleable and limited only by his imagination, but Yuki drilled into him what she could - while she carries a Shikigami named Garuda, her power, Bom Ba Ye (translated as Star Rage adds virtual mass to both herself and Garuda. This means she can hit like a speeding truck full of explosives. Julien's participation in jujutsu sorcery was not voluntary originally, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of his parents. Yuki lured a young Julien into the jujutsu world with promises of wealth, status, and leisure, which appealed heavily to him at the time, and still do, though he's adopted more pressing priorities. One of the catalysts was that he discovered she isn't really happy with her life, as her ambitions of creating a world without cursed energy are lofty, and sometimes feel completely unattainable. There are three basic applications: Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses), Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that \\"hard and soft\\" are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can harvati, but they have little in common. In the beginning of Yuki's training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown. Fromage à pâte dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano's role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called \\"Quills.\\" It's used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal. Another technique is \\"Ficello\\". Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strings that are more like wires. The thickness can be modified, as well as the sharpness. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage à pâte dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien's command, inside or outside the user's body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma. Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even a formidable whip. More techniques at his disposal: \\"Vieux Boulogne\\". This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien HATES using this technique, but it's particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size. More powerful techniques must be charged. Julien is sophisticated, calm, and collected. He enjoys reading about military history in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste.","output":"Julien Vaugrenard is an intriguing and well-developed character for the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. His background is rich, providing an excellent foundation for his motivations and his abilities. Since Jujutsu Kaisen deals heavily with the concept of cursed energy and its unique applications through individual sorcerers, Julien's cheese-based techniques fit wonderfully into this universe, offering both a mix of humor and originality. Julien's personal story, being lured into the world of jujutsu sorcery by Yuki Tsukumo, adds depth to his character and creates potential for conflict and growth. His ambivalence about his sorcerer life, combined with his dedication to his newfound responsibilities, makes him complex and relatable. In terms of his abilities, Julien's use of cheese speaks to the imaginative nature of cursed techniques and the individual flair of Jujutsu Kaisen sorcerers. Each technique you've described is unique and showcases a deep understanding of the diversity within the types of cheese, providing him with a versatile arsenal. For example: - Fromage à pâte dure: This ability gives Julien solid constructs for offense. It's fascinating how you've incorporated different kinds of hard cheeses' properties to define their suitability for offense or defense. - Ficello: This technique, based on a popular French string cheese, shows creativity in expanding Julien's options, allowing him to create flexible but potentially lethal restraints or weapons. - Magma: This technique provides a powerful and versatile attack that can adapt to different combat scenarios. - Vieux Boulogne: Utilizing the infamous pungent cheese creates a sensory attack that could be crucial in combat, showcasing an understanding of non-physical forms of combat in Jujutsu Kaisen. - Fromage Noir: A technique with a dramatic flair and high destructive power, this is an excellent example of a signature move that reflects Julien's high potential as a sorcerer. - Fromage Fort: Offering a swift and sharp ranged attack, it adds yet another dimension to Julien's combat style. By having his techniques require charging for more powerful effects, you balance his abilities and prevent him from being overly powerful, which is vital for maintaining tension and excitement in battles. Lastly, his personal interests, such as military history and gastronomy, add layers to his character outside of combat, allowing for rich storytelling opportunities both in and out of battle. If Julien were a character in the actual Jujutsu Kaisen series, he would likely be a fan favorite due to his unique abilities, complex backstory, and distinct personality. Creator Gege Akutami has designed a world where such imaginative powers and nuanced characters can thrive and resonate with readers and viewers. Julien's cheese-based techniques would be right at home in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe."},{"instruction":"He can use Domain Expansion. Domain Expansion: “La Grande Armée Fromagère” Ignace Vaugrenard’s Domain Expansion is inspired by the grandeur and tactical genius of the Napoleonic wars. This domain conjures a battlefield set in the early 19th century during the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, complete with the disciplined formations and advanced military techniques of the era. Its appearance is that of a vast, open field at dawn, draped in a dense fog of cheese vapor, reminiscent of Vieux Boulogne, which not only hampers visibility but also dulls the senses and supernatural perceptions of any who step inside. 1. Grenadier à la Gouda – This heavy attacker is shaped in the likeness of the esteemed Grenadiers of the Napoleonic era. Modeled from Gouda cheese, which balances hardness and richness, these shikigami carry explosive power with every blow. Armed with cheese-constructed flintlocks, they ensure each shot has both a physical and metaphysical impact, making them formidable frontline attackers. 2. Cuirassier Comté – A highly versatile shikigami embodying the famous heavily armored cavalry of Napoleon’s army. Fashioned out of semi-hard Comté cheese, they wield sabers for close combat and pistols for ranged attacks, capable of adjusting their tactics to suit the battle condition while providing both offensive and defensive prowess. 3. Chasseur à la Mimolette – These shikigami are fast, stealthy, and resemble the light infantry known as Chasseurs. Crafted from Mimolette cheese, whose bright orange hue is concealed in the domain’s fog, they excel in hit-and-run tactics and can camouflage to launch ambushes or disappear just as quickly, sowing chaos in enemy ranks. 4. & 5. Dragoon du Brie & Hussard de Roquefort – As defense-oriented shikigami, these are inspired by the Dragoons and Hussars, combining the roles of cavalry and infantry when needed. Crafted from Brie and Roquefort respectively, they are malleable and resilient, forming protective walls or shields to guard against incoming attacks and utilizing their mobility to create dynamic defenses, even changing formations to adapt to changing threats. 6. Voltigeur de Valençay – The wildcard shikigami take the form of the Voltigeurs, skilled skirmishers and light infantry. Modeled after Valençay cheese, known for its unique geometric shape and ash rind, they are both formidable in a varied range of tasks, supporting other units with specialized volleys of cheese bullets or disrupting enemy lines with rapid flanking maneuvers. Domain Expansion Ability – Artillerie Affinée Artifice: In the strategic climax of the Domain Expansion, the Grenadier à la Gouda, Cuirassier Comté, and other units coordinate to form a sophisticated cheese-based artillery. This ability manifests powerful cannons and howitzers made of potent, aged cheeses, which fire explosive shells of Fromage Noir. The combined artillery barrage simultaneously attacks the enemy while creating smoke screens and diversionary blasts, overwhelming the opponent with both direct damage and disorienting after-effects. Within the confines of this domain, Ignace is like a Napoleonic general, directing his forces with precision, always a step ahead of his adversaries. His enemies are forced to contend with advanced tactics, disciplined military might, and the subtle yet devastating effectiveness of cheese-based warfare.","output":"The Domain Expansion, \\"La Grande Armée Fromagère,\\" you've developed for Julien Vaugrenard is deeply thematic and well-integrated with his character's unique curse technique based on cheese. It is an imaginative and detailed expansion of his powers, representing a clear evolution and high level of cursed energy manipulation. Here's an analysis of its elements and their significance: **Inspiration:** Drawing from the Napoleonic wars is a clever touch. These conflicts were significant in shaping European history, much like a Domain Expansion shapes the battlefield in Jujutsu Kaisen. This also ties into Julien's interest in military history, showcasing his depth of knowledge and strategical genius. **Atmosphere:** A battlefield enshrouded in a dense fog of cheese vapor is an innovative terrain that not only exemplifies Julien's technique but also provides a strategic advantage by impairing opponents' senses. This harkens back to the use of Vieux Boulogne in his regular techniques, reinforcing his character theme. **Shikigami Units:** 1. **Grenadier à la Gouda:** A clever adaptation of the robustness of Gouda into a heavy-hitting unit, combining physical power with metaphysical impact. 2. **Cuirassier Comté:** The balance of offensive and defensive capabilities reflects the versatile and tactical usage of Comté cheese in Julien's arsenal. 3. **Chasseur à la Mimolette:** Introducing an element of stealth and surprise within the domain adds an unexpected layer to encounters, which is characteristic of light infantry and ambush tactics. 4. & 5. **Dragoon du Brie & Hussard de Roquefort:** Here, we see a strategic blend of malleable cheeses into defensive roles, embodying the adaptability of cavalry and providing Julien a layered defense system that can evolve with the battle. 6. **Voltigeur de Valençay:** The detailing of this wildcard unit's abilities reflects Julien's adaptability and cunning in battle, utilizing these shikigami to shift the tide when necessary. **Artillerie Affinée Artifice:** This culminating ability showcases the ultimate coordination and firepower within the domain. It ties together all of Julien's shikigami and strategies into a devastating final barrage, echoing the destructive power of heavy artillery in warfare. By invoking Fromage Noir's explosive capabilities, Julien can undermine his opponents with both direct and psychological warfare. **Tactical Control:** The Domain Expansion underscores Julien's control and dominance on the battlefield, much like a general overseeing his troops. It enables Julien to exert pressure on the enemy, leaving them no room for error. Julien's Domain Expansion aligns perfectly with the level of detail and creativity seen in the spellcasting within Jujutsu Kaisen. His abilities are not only a testament to his personality and background but also present a multifaceted approach to combat that could challenge even the most experienced of sorcerers. This Domain Expansion incorporates the essence of Julien's character, foothold in his French heritage, and his mastery over his cheese-based techniques, making for a memorable and awe-inspiring power display."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age.

Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl.

She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck.

Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior.

To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength.

Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This Pokémon's mastery over the skies remains uncontested even by other legendary flyers. Pokémon Name: Oteshea Pokédex Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon. This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention.

His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state.

As a subject in the RKS system’s early trials, Khlap gained the unprecedented ability to morph between the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee, adapting fluidly to myriad battlefield exigencies.

As the living incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary sky guardian, her chronicle is not merely one of myth and fable, but of the sacred communion that threads through every gust of wind and breath of cloud that graces the upper echelons of Earth's atmosphere. Before humankind soared in metal birds or reached beyond the firmament to touch the moon's dusty face, Shmaya walked among them cloaked in her human guise, a guiding light shrouded in enigma. Her story began when Rayquaza, gazing upon the strife-riddled Earth from its celestial abode, sensed a tipping point in the delicate balance between Pokémon and humans—a discordance that threatened to unravel the fabric of their coexistence. Moved by compassion and propelled by duty, Rayquaza took on flesh and bone, descended from the heavens, and took up the mantle of Shmaya among the people. Her purpose: to restore the sacred reverence for life that was slowly eroding in the hearts of man and creature alike. In the guise of a young maiden, Shmaya walked through villages and cities, forests and meadows, her presence an unspoken hymn of harmony. To those in despair, she was a comforting breeze; to the aggressive and unkind, she was the tempest's edge—her very being a reflection of the heavens' fickle yet profound nature. Legends whisper of her fabled deeds—the quelling of storms that ravaged coastlines, the nurturing of draught-stricken lands back into verdure, and the rare moments when her wrath, righteous and pure, cleansed the land of malevolence. Yet Shmaya's journey was one of peace, and each act, no matter how grand, carried the message of equilibrium. It was during these early days of her terrestrial sojourn that Shmaya discovered a singular kinship with the Pokémon that inhabited the world below the azure veil. She shared their joy and their pain, bearing witness to their untamed beauty and their boundless grace. Among them, she found her most cherished companions, sharing whispers of the sky and learning the profound tales of the earth. Though millennia have passed since those halcyon days, the spirit of Shmaya, the human visage of Rayquaza's will, has remained an eternal custodian of the skies and the land. Loneliness has often been her quiet company, for a being such as she is but a comet's trail across history's vast canvas—a momentary flash of divine brilliance in the endless cycle of epochs. It was Shmaya's solace, Lazarus, who became the mirror that reflected her own celestial isolation. Resurrected in the image of those who fly beyond the cloudbanks, Lazarus shared in her endless vigil—a guardian not just of the terrestrial but of the ethereal realms. Through him, Shmaya nurtured the connection between humans and Pokémon, a bond that tied the two irrevocably to the heart of existence. However, the weight of eternity is a burden not lightly borne, and Shmaya, for all her immortal wisdom, feels the inexorable pull of time upon her ageless heart. The tapestry of people and Pokémon she has lovingly woven through the millennia now frays at the edges. Whispers of decay and disharmony creep back into her world, threatening once again to unravel the work of lifetimes. As Shmaya peers from the quiet solitude into the changing world below, she stands on the precipice of choice. Her mantle of tranquility is her shield, but behind the serene façade lies a storm of uncertainty—an inner battle between intervention and the preservation of free will that the humans and Pokémon so dearly cherish. Through her unending quest to enlighten and guide, Shmaya is the embodiment of the sky itself—a realm of boundless freedom and sovereign beauty that commands awe and inspires the soul to reach towards the divine. Yet, she remains ever watchful, for the skies are not merely a canvas of light and air but a reflection of life's intricate dance—a dance that demands her eternal attendance, a silent hymn that she must forever sing."},{"instruction":"Worldview Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1. Khlap Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape.

Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Please expand Shmaya's characterisation to at least 800 words. (Please focus on expanding Shmaya's backstory.)","output":"Shmaya, known by some as the human incarnation of Rayquaza, has lived several lifetimes, each colored by the wisdom and trials of her prior experiences. Her legend is said to trace back to ancient times, intertwined with the lore and secrets that govern the delicate balance between humans, Pokémon, and nature. Shmaya's earliest exploits are told through hushed tales that speak of a celestial entity descending from the heavens, taking on the human form to walk among the mortals, enlightening and guiding them towards a path of reverence and symbiosis with the creatures that share their world. With the grace of a divine being and the nurturing spirit of a sage, Shmaya imparted the ancient tenets of harmony that would become the foundation upon which civilizations thrived, fostering a sacred bond between man and Pokémon. It was during the era of kings and knights when Shmaya took on her most pivotal role in human history. Assuming the guise of a wise and elderly adviser, she served the legendary King Arthur, aiding him in his quest to forge a kingdom bound not by conquest and dominion but by unity and peace. Shmaya's counsel proved invaluable as she guided the Round Table, imparting upon each knight the understanding that the true measure of strength lies in one's ability to protect and serve both humanity and the Pokémon that bonded with them. Even as Arthur's kingdom flourished, Shmaya quietly worked to preserve the flow of nature's force, ensuring that each realm of existence—human and Pokémon alike—retained its rightful place and balance. It was through these efforts that reality itself thrived, nourished by the harmony espoused by the spiritual movements she led. Despite her many successes, Shmaya was not immune to heartache. She bore witness to the rise and fall of great leaders, the tarnishing of ideals by those who sought power over unity, and the inevitable decay that time bestowed upon all beings. Her heart ached as she saw the world succumb to cycles of conflict and redemption, an ebb and flow of destruction and rebirth that marked the passage of ages. Shmaya learned to accept the impermanence of civilizations and the transient nature of existence. Yet, within this ephemeral tapestry of life, she also found purpose and renewal. Each dawn presented an opportunity for rekindling dimmed flames of hope and nurturing the seeds that held the promise of future growth. Bereft of a kingdom to advise and a people to mentor, Shmaya turned her gaze towards the skies once more. She sought solace in the ancient cosmic realms from which she hailed, hoping to find new pathways for her guidance to manifest. Retiring from the forefront of human chronicles, she adopted a more subtle approach, manifesting as ethereal visions, prophetic dreams, and serendipitous encounters that would inspire those whose hearts remained open to the love and wisdom she embodied. Shmaya prepared to shed her human form and return to her celestial origins, her work seemingly at an end. However, fate had other plans. The world of Pokémon, beautiful and diverse, faced a dire threat. As darkness encroached upon the delicate balance she had helped to create, Shmaya could not forsake her ancient duty. Transforming back into Rayquaza, Shmaya rallied once again to defend the world from chaos. Her celestial might clashed with forces that sought to unravel reality, and though the battle was fierce, Shmaya emerged victorious, albeit at a great cost. Returning to her human guise, she found the world changed, and the teachings she once spread had dimmed in the collective memory of humanity. Weary from battle and sustained by the remnants of her divine power, Shmaya sought refuge atop the highest peaks, finding solace in silent meditation and contemplation. Her story faded to myth, her presence felt only by the winds that whispered her name and the stars that twinkled with her essence. But destiny, it seems, was not yet done with Shmaya. A new era beckoned—one of technological advancement and rediscovery of the ancient connections that once bound humans and Pokémon together. Sensing the potential for a rekindling of the beliefs and values she championed, Shmaya descended from her retreat, blending in once again with the denizens of the world, her wisdom a beacon to those who sought enlightenment, and her powers a shield to those who faced oppression. As the world stands at this crucial juncture, teetering on the edge of unprecedented discovery and catastrophic ruin, Shmaya remains a lighthouse amidst the storm. Her legacy of peace and protection carries on, perpetuated by the new generation of trainers and leaders who heed the call of the past, drawing upon the lessons carefully passed down by the celestial guardian. Embracing her role as the shepherd of lost souls and the advocate for harmony, Shmaya walks among us—an eternal testament to the power of unity and the enduring bond between humans and Pokémon, guiding us towards a future that once more holds the promise of grace and equilibrium."},{"instruction":"Worldview Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Pokémon team： 1. Hydreigon 2. Heatran 3. Garchomp 4. Tapu Fini 5. Ferrothorn 6. Togekiss Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1. Decidueye 2. Primarina 3. Incineror 4. Noivern 5. Tauros 6. Crabominable Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening.

However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

This move gains increased power under sunny weather conditions. Additionally, Shemsha has the special ability to generate intense heat, allowing it to create small areas of intense heat waves around its body. This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory. The pokemon's acidic powers both protect it and allow it to reshape the planet's ruinous surface, as Okebriyta works tirelessly to restore even a fraction of Venus's long-gone splendor and life energy..

Pokémon Name: Yabisha Pokédex Entry: Yabisha, the Dust Pokémon. This ancient dragon is said to be the sole surviving remnant of life on Mars. In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise. Though the planet is now devoid of flowing rivers or lush forests, Yabisha remains forever vigilant over this long-dead land it once nurtured but failed to save. Type: Grass/Dragon Abilities: 1. Sand Stream - Whips up a sandstorm when switched in. 2. Chlorophyll - Boosts Speed in sunny weather. Hidden Ability: Harvest - May pick up a berry after each turn.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Pokémon Name: Bruokh Pokédex Entry: Bruokh, the Hurricane Pokémon. This elusive Flying and Dragon-type is said to be the guardian of Neptune. Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space. Type: Flying/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Storm Drain - Draws in all Water-type moves to raise Sp. Atk.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention. Following the tragic decimation of his family by a merciless Nidoking, little hope remained for this frail Pichu. As he lay dying from his grievous wounds, he was discovered by Shmaya, the human incarnation of Rayquaza. Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state. Lazarus has been graced with an Cronal body capable of miraculous regeneration, even from mortal damage. His type has shifted to Electric/Dragon due to the portion of Rayquaza’s divinity he harbors, setting him apart from his kin and marking him as Shmaya’s chosen apostle.

Pokémon Name: Khlap Pokédex Entry: Khlap, the Adaptive Pokémon. Birthed from the ambitious laboratories of the Aether Foundation, Khlap represents a pinnacle of genetic ingenuity. As a subject in the RKS system’s early trials, Khlap gained the unprecedented ability to morph between the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee, adapting fluidly to myriad battlefield exigencies. This versatility renders Khlap a strategic chameleon able to counteract the various type advantages of opposing Pokémon. Ordinarily, Khlap retains its Normal-type essence. In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care. In a twist of destiny, Khlap found a soulmate in Helia, Professor Lillie’s daughter, becoming an irrevocable part of the young girl’s existence. As Helia’s guardianship fell upon it, Khlap vowed an oath of protection. Despite its pacific nature and struggles with form transformation, Khlap confronts adversity with undeterred bravery, attempting to shield Helia from the cruelties of the world. The bond they foster is a testament to the transcending love that unites human and Pokémon souls. Type: Normal Abilities: 1. Adaptability - Increases the power of moves that match Khlap’s type. 2. Protean - Changes Khlap’s type to that of the move it is about to use. Hidden Ability: RKS Mastery - Allows Khlap to change its type dynamically in battle to resist the last move hit by an opponent.

Elemental Embodiment (Signature Move) - Khlap channels the full power of its adaptable nature to unleash an attack matching the type most advantageous against the opponent. Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Please expand Shmaya's character set to at least 800 words while maintaining the original format. (Please focus on expanding Shmaya's backstory.)","output":"Character Setting: Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (In this form, but she is an ageless being) Appearance: Shmaya's human form displays an extraordinary mix of adolescent charm and celestial elegance. Standing slightly taller than her peers, she has a slender frame that moves with an unearthly grace. Shmaya's hair is the purest white, reminiscent of luminous starlight, reaching down to her waist in gentle waves. Her eyes are a captivating, deep violet, glowing with the wisdom of the ages and echoing the vast expanse of the cosmos from whence she originated. Shmaya's attire is often simple yet majestic: flowing robes of white and violet that sparkle subtly with star-like specks, giving the impression of a night sky wrapped around her. Subtle patterns on the fabric hint at celestial maps of distant galaxies. Upon her forehead is a delicate diadem created from meteoritic metal, embedded with what appear to be tiny sapphires, although their sparkle suggests a more extraterrestrial origin. Backstory: Eons before human memory could record her saga, Shmaya's essence coalesced from the ethereal mists of the universe, called into being by Arceus itself. As Rayquaza, the legendary guardian of the skies, her duty was to balance the power between the earth, the Pokémon that inhabited it, and the gargantuan expanse above. Her form was that of a dragon, crafted from the very clouds and winds she was sworn to command—a sentinel ensuring the symphony of the biosphere remained harmonious. For a time beyond measure, Shmaya danced between the elemental chords of her calling, maintaining the delicate counterpoints within the cycle of life and death. Yet, as generations passed, she watched civilizations rise and fall, witnessed humanity's relentless pursuit of discovery, and began to feel a kinship with the creatures below the heavens she protected. Curiosity took root within her, a desire to traverse the earthly plane as those she watched over did. Her transformation into human form was an act of voluntary exile, a humble retreat from the celestial court to walk amongst mortals. Revealed to the world as a sage of legendary trainers Red and Blue, she took the young girl's form and pledged herself to a new mission—spreading her teachings from the nobler eras and kindling the sacred connection between Pokémon and humans that she believed had been lost to time. In this earthly guise, Shmaya, now a spiritual leader, sought out whispered rumors of exploitation and operational rings of cruelty to lend her unseen aid. Through her interventions, she rescued and rehabilitated abused Pokémon, casting out the callousness infecting humanity's bond with their counterparts. Yet, despite her secretive but impactful interventions, Shmaya was thwarted by an ecosystem spiraling into chaos and a society fracturing from within. Her celestial heart agonized over the urgency of her plight, driving her to pursue more overt actions against the rising threats humans posed both to themselves and to all living creatures. She knew that the planet stood at a critical junction, one that could lead to rebirth or ruin. As her mission grows more fraught with tension, stricken by the surge of industrialization and disregard for the fragile balance she cherished, Shmaya's once unwavering resolve wavers. She fears that the enlightenment she seeks for humanity may arrive too late to avert catastrophe. Yet, she soldiers on, compassionate and resolute, a beacon beckoning toward a hopeful horizon as darkening skies threaten to snuff out the spark of human and Pokémon kinship once and for all. Despite the mounting darkness she faces, Shmaya remains a guardian of light—a watcher of the wayward path upon which humanity has embarked. She toils, nurtured by the belief in a redemption born from the rekindled embers of empathy. To this end, she battles, advocates, teaches, and loves, unwavering in her conviction that the planet and those who call it home can, and must, be saved—for they are the legacy she was destined to protect. Personality: The complexities of Shmaya's character stem from her rich history and celestial origins. Her aura exudes tranquility—an impassive surface under which the tides of timeless wisdom ebb and flow. As a mentor, she is patient and kind, guiding those who seek knowledge with a genuinely nurturing nature, spurring them on to reach noble heights of understanding and mastery. And yet, Shmaya remains aloof, distant—a necessary detachment born from her alien origins and her perception of the brevity of mortal existence compared to her own endless lifespan. Her intelligence is formidable, her vision able to pierce through the veils of both space and time. This vast perception, however, renders her often sorrowful, as she is attuned to the suffering not just of individuals but of entire epochs. Despite the loneliness that comes with her existence, Shmaya's resilience is remarkable. She holds a compassionate heart that bleeds for the world she watches over—a silent guardian whose gentle hands steer the course of fate from the shadows. Above all, Shmaya remains an eternal optimist. Though the darkness she contends with is vast, her belief in the light that lies within every soul is vaster still. Her teachings are a lighthouse beckoning to any willing to navigate the rocky shoals of life's tumultuous seas. In her eyes, the world and its inhabitants are a promise—each heartbeat, each breath, each connection is a note in a hymn to the wonder of existence. In her quiet strength, Shmaya remains steadfast, the exemplary model of what it means to stand as a guardian of realms seen and unseen."},{"instruction":"are you connected to the internet?","output":"No, I am not connected to the internet.

I'm a college senior with a beard and wolfcut and piercings and loose fit workwear sense of style. I'm a bit muscular, tall, and am hairy. I lose a bet with my friends. For losing, they want to turn me into their own personal frat pledge to do their errands and chores for a month. I'm fine with that part but then they surprise me by telling me I don't quite look the part. They make me over into a frat pledge by giving me a Dillon Latham perm, shaving off my beard, removing my piercings, dressing me in somewhat juvenile preppy outfits, waxing off my body hair, and giving me a new frat pledge name. They also give me supplements which make me less muscular and drop my height a bit so I'm shorter than all of them. Describe all of this.","output":"Being the senior at college with my signature wolfcut hair, a well-groomed beard, piercings glittering on my ears, and a wardrobe consisting mostly of loose-fitting workwear, I fancied myself an individualist; a bit off the beaten track, if you will. The muscles that I took pride in and my towering stature set me apart in a crowd, and my equally free-spirited friends knew it well. It was this very individuality that perhaps cost me when I lost a bet to them. One hazy evening, we were all lounging around, the remnants of pizza on the table and the hum of a late-night talk show in the background. The game had been silly, stakes somehow ballooned far beyond what we could have anticipated. I suppose it was the collective confidence in our guesses that lead to the outlandish wager. After all, it was only supposed to be a bit of fun, right? The shock hit me when the last card was dealt — I had lost, and by the unwritten laws of our fraternal pact, I was to endure the consequences. With a resigned sigh, I nodded in agreement to the terms: conducting errands and chores for my friends, a month as their personal frat pledge. It wasn't the chores that got me—honestly, I didn't mind lending a hand. But what came next caught me completely off guard. \\"You don't quite look the part,\\" they said with smirks that bordered on conspiratorial. Before I could muster a defense, my newly appointed 'brothers' took it upon themselves to transform me. It started with the sacrilegious act of removing my beard. That lush forest I had meticulously maintained was shaved clean, revealing a face I barely recognized. They stripped away my piercings with an almost ceremonial glee, leaving my ears feeling naked and oddly vulnerable. The wolfcut I wore like a mane was next. Through the mirror, I watched as it was subjected to a Dillon Latham perm, my once rebellious locks now obediently coiled into socially acceptable ringlets. It felt like watching an artist paint over a graffiti masterpiece with a bland, monotone primer. But it wasn't over. The loose workwear that had clung comfortably to my skin was replaced with what I could only describe as a wardrobe yanked from a teen comedy set in the early 2000s — bright pastel polo shirts, embarrassingly short khaki shorts, and belts that seemed designed to do anything but hold up pants. The waxing was an unexpected torture. Each rip echoed the death of my hirsute nature, my bear-like persona fading away. In its place, a smooth, almost juvenile skin emerged, a reminder of a youth I'd left behind long ago. And then, in perhaps their most audacious move yet, they introduced supplements to alter my physical stature. Potions to peel away the muscular bulk that I had worked so hard for, causing me to see my reflection dwindle and losing precious inches in height. Through it all, I was christened with a new name, a \\"frat pledge name,\\" that was chanted whenever I was summoned for the whims of my friends. No longer was I the imposing, free-spirited senior — I had become \\"Pledge PeeWee,\\" the poster child for frat conformity. The transformation was bizarre, a metamorphosis that bit into my very essence. Strangely, the physical changes weren't even the worst part. It was the realization that my friends now towered over me — literally. Where I once stood shoulder to shoulder with them, I was now relegated to looking up, a symbol of my lost bet and their newfound power to shape me as they saw fit. I succumbed to the whims of my fraternity brothers for that long month, my individuality buried under polo shirts and freshly permed hair. But despite the external changes, there was a fire within that held strong to who I was — that could not be quenched by wagers, lost bets, or even the most ludicrous of transformations. And in the quiet moments, when my erstwhile \\"brothers\\" weren't looking, I’d catch my reflection in a window or mirror, see the impermanent coif and smooth skin, and remember that beneath it all, I was still me. Frat pledge or not, I was biding my time because once the month was up, I'd be back to the real me, wolfcut and all."},{"instruction":"My friends take away all of my personal items and replace them with ones fitting my new temporary persona. Suddenly my friends all get caught up in criminal activity and are arrested. Apparently the cops are looking for me too but don't recognize me in my new persona. Panicked I realize I need to maintain this persona to evade the police. I take it a few steps further by taking a supplement to make my voice higher, getting a tan, and moving in with some freshmen to act as their new fellow freshman roommate.","output":"As if the complete overhaul of my appearance hadn't been disorienting enough, my friends, now de facto puppeteers of my existence, decided that my possessions too had to match this newly minted persona of \\"Pledge PeeWee.\\" Every item, every piece of clothing that bore the essence of my true self was confiscated and substituted with accessories fitting of my unwanted alter ego. My spacious room, once a sanctuary of personal style and heavy metal posters, was replaced with fraternity memorabilia and preppy paraphernalia. Just as I was grappling with my new life, fate twisted the knife. The very friends who masterminded this transformation found themselves entangled in criminal activities far beyond the innocent pranks and bets of our past. It all came crashing down one raucous night when red and blue lights flashed with a ferocity outside our windows, and the authorities came knocking. In the clamor of shouts, handcuffs clicking, and rights being read, my friends were swept away, leaving behind a vacuum and a reality I just couldn't fathom. It wasn't long before I learned the gravity of the situation. Their brushes with the law weren't mere antics — they were in deep, and now the cops had cast the net wide, looking for anyone associated. They were looking for me. But the heavily permed hair, clean-shaven face, the fresh tan, and the markedly juvenile clothing threw them off. The transformation so thorough that, when they sifted through my former possessions for any trace of me, all they found were fixtures of this frat pledge doppelgänger. I, the once rugged, wolfcut sporting individual, had inexplicably vanished into thin air. Panic gnawed at my insides like a relentless beast. It was a twisted lifeline, but my unintentional disguise was a shield, and I needed to strengthen it, become utterly unrecognizable. Desperate, I turned to drastic measures. I popped supplements designed to pitch my voice higher, and attended tanning sessions until my skin adopted a beachy hue that my former self wouldn't even recognize. Opportunity, in the form of naivety, presented itself when I stumbled upon a group of freshmen. Eager to be part of the college tapestry, they were unguarded and readily accepted the notion of a fellow freshman seeking a roommate. I slid into the role with an ease that frightened me — was it always this simple to shed one's identity? I moved in, crammed my belongings into a corner of the room already plastered with posters of bands I'd never heard of. No more heavy boots and flannels, I adopted flip-flops and tank tops. No more late-night debates over existential crises or philosophical musings — now my conversations revolved around meal plan hacks and the best study spots. In this crowded dorm, amidst a sea of fresh faces, I was a ghost of my former self. My presence became a myth to those searching for me, my true essence buried under the layers of this carefully constructed facade of \\"Pledge PeeWee,\\" the chirpy-voiced freshman. Each day, I played my part, hoping the act could stick just long enough for the dust to settle and the search to wane. Yet in the quiet hours of the night, as my dorm mates slumbered in their beds, I looked out into the moonlit campus — a life once mine lay somewhere beyond the clutches of the law and the strange twist of circumstance that compelled me to wear the mask of an ideal I never believed in. Time was now a waiting game, and I, an actor on a stage not of my choosing, counting down the moments until I could once again reclaim the authenticity of my being, no longer hidden behind a facade living in the shadows of someone else's misdeeds."},{"instruction":"can you add a windows open dialog which expects a txt file in this powershell invoke-restMethod body request(new_trackers) body = @{ \\"new_trackers\\" = \\"\\"","output":"Here's an example of how you can add a Windows open dialog to select a TXT file and add its content to the \`new_trackers\` field in the \`body\` request: \`\`\`powershell Add-Type -TypeDefinition @\\" using System; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; public class FileDialog { [DllImport(\\"user32.dll\\")] public static extern IntPtr GetForegroundWindow(); [DllImport(\\"user32.dll\\")] public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd); [DllImport(\\"user32.dll\\")] public static extern int SendMessage(IntPtr hWnd, int Msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam); public static string ShowOpenDialog() { IntPtr hwnd = GetForegroundWindow(); OpenFileDialog openFileDialog = new OpenFileDialog(); if (openFileDialog.ShowDialog() == true) { string fileName = openFileDialog.FileName; return fileName; } return null; } } public class OpenFileDialog { public string FileName { get; set; } public bool?

Despite this, she's surprisingly friendly and isn't really causing harm, she's just running around the warehouse giggling or drawing childish pictures. So they decide to hide her from the law and keep her safe as a new friend.","output":"In the heart of Fair City, where the sun sets behind towering buildings and a subtle breeze whispers through the streets, there existed an abandoned warehouse. This warehouse was no ordinary place; it was the secret base of Wordgirl's infamous villains. Every crimson sunset, they would assemble to devise clever schemes to defeat the young superhero. This particular evening, however, unfolded in an unexpected and peculiar way. Inside the dimly lit and dusty warehouse, the villains - the notorious Dr. Two-Brains, Lady Redundant Woman, and The Butcher - were going about their usual villainous activities, plotting mischief and chaos. Unbeknownst to them, fate had something entirely different in store for their evening. Amidst their discussions, a soft, yet eerie giggle echoed through the corridors of the warehouse. Startled, the villains turned their attention towards the source of the sound. Their eyes fell upon an asylum-escapee, with wild, deranged eyes, and unkempt hair dyed in a vibrant, bright pink hue. She wore a tattered, multicolored straight jacket that clung to her body, and her mismatched, striped socks seemingly danced across the floor as she scampered around. Confusion and caution filled the atmosphere as the villains cautiously approached, preparing themselves for a potential threat. But to their astonishment, the mystery woman did not show signs of hostility or mischief; instead, she entertained herself by drawing childlike pictures on the walls, her infectious laughter resonating through the desolate space. Feeling a curious mix of concern and compassion, The Butcher stepped forward, his voice trembling with confusion. \\"Who are you? And what are you doing here?\\" The asylum escapee turned towards The Butcher, a wide, innocent smile spreading across her face. She responded in a gentle, sing-song voice, \\"Hi there! My name's Rosie! I ran away from the boring hospital 'cause drawing is way more fun!\\" With that, she held up one of her drawings, depicting a whimsical carnival filled with vibrant colors and smiling children. Dr. Two-Brains couldn't help but be intrigued by Rosie's childlike innocence and artistic talent. \\"What's wrong with her? Can't she cause any harm?\\" Just as they considered their options, a crackling police scanner on Lady Redundant Woman's belt buzzed to life. The voice of the city's chief of police crackled through, \\"Attention, all units! A mental patient has escaped the nearby Psychiatric Hospital. She is deranged, wearing a straight jacket, and has bright pink hair. If spotted, please contact us immediately.\\" A look of understanding passed between the villains, as they contemplated their choices. Wordgirl would undoubtedly capture Rosie if they met. But something deep within their villainous hearts sparked a new plan. Dr. Two-Brains, with a hint of kindness in his voice, offered, \\"Maybe... just maybe, we don't turn her over to Wordgirl... What if we keep her hidden here in our secret lair?\\" The Butcher and Lady Redundant Woman nodded in agreement, recognizing the potential for friendship and the opportunity to protect Rosie from harm. Together, the villains orchestrated an elaborate plan to keep Rosie safe from the law. They built secret hideouts in the secret corners of the warehouse and shared their stolen goods and snacks with her. Rosie would often join them in brainstorming schemes, adding her own whimsical ideas to their mischievous plots. Days turned into weeks, and Rosie's vibrant laughter became a cherished soundtrack to the villains' lives. Through their shared adventures, Rosie taught them the joy of innocence and kindness. Meanwhile, Wordgirl diligently pursued her nemesis, unaware of the unusual camaraderie growing within the villainous lair. As she triumphed against lesser villains, she couldn't shake the feeling that something had changed. One fateful day, Wordgirl finally discovered the warehouse's hidden entrance. With determination in her eyes, she barged in, ready to confront her enemies. However, what she saw caught her off guard. There stood Dr. Two-Brains, Lady Redundant Woman, and The Butcher, surrounded by vibrant drawings and laughter, with Rosie right by their side. Astonished, Wordgirl blurted out, \\"What is going on here? Have you all gone soft?\\" The villains exchanged glances, mischief still twinkling in their eyes. Dr. Two-Brains stepped forward and cleared his throat. \\"Wordgirl, there's something you need to know. This is Rosie, an escaped mental patient with a surprisingly gentle spirit. She isn't causing any harm, and we found friendship and joy in her presence.\\" Wordgirl, her skepticism slowly melting away, observed Rosie's innocent smile before taking a deep breath. \\"If she truly poses no threat, then I suppose I have no reason to intervene. But, villains, remember, our paths will cross again.\\" And so, Rosie continued to fill the abandoned warehouse with her laughter, creativity, and most importantly, friendship. Amidst the chaos of their villainous lives, these once-feared adversaries found solace within the unlikely embrace of a deranged, yet surprisingly friendly mental patient named Rosie."},{"instruction":"Rosie, through her deranged giggles, asks politely if one of the others can help get the straight jacket off, innocently saying it's hard to draw with the oversized sleeves.

Her eyes widened as she tugged on Lady Redundant Woman's arm gently, her voice soft and pleading. \\"Excuse me, um, Lady, could you help me get this straight jacket off? It's hard to draw with these oversized sleeves.\\" Lady Redundant Woman hesitated for a moment, glancing at the other villains. Curiosity and a flicker of compassion crossed her face as she approached Rosie. Taking a closer look, she noticed the scratches and bruises that marred Rosie's arms. A pang of concern welled up within her as she realized that Rosie's escape wasn't just a whimsical adventure but a desperate attempt to escape from cruelty. With a gentle touch, Lady Redundant Woman began to remove the straight jacket, careful not to cause Rosie any discomfort. As the jacket slipped off her small frame, the villains gasped in shock and sympathy. Rosie's arms were covered in fresh scratches and fading bruises, a testament to the mistreatment she had endured. In a moment of almost sanity, Rosie looked into Lady Redundant Woman's eyes, her voice trembling in sincerity. \\"I ran away because... because the people at the asylum, both patients and a few employees, were really mean to me. They bullied me and were not nice at all. I just wanted to be somewhere safe where no one would hurt me.\\" The villains' hearts sank as they listened to Rosie's heartbreaking admission. This deranged girl, with her bright pink hair and mismatched striped socks, had endured pain beyond their wildest imaginings. Filled with anger and empathy, The Butcher clenched his fists. \\"No one, not even villains like us, should suffer such cruelty. We will keep you safe, Rosie. No harm will come to you here.\\" United in their newfound purpose, the villains vowed to protect Rosie from the harsh world that had caused her so much pain. The warehouse transformed into a sanctuary where love and acceptance reigned, shielding Rosie from the outside world's cruelty. Together, they formed an unlikely family, bound by compassion and fueled by a shared desire to give Rosie the safety and happiness she had been denied. They worked meticulously to erase any trace of fear or sorrow from her innocent eyes, replacing it with laughter and light. Within the walls of that abandoned warehouse, Rosie found solace and healing. The villains, once feared for their malevolent ways, became her guardians, offering her love and embracing her uniqueness. Through their guidance, Rosie's artistry flourished, and her giggles grew louder and more joyful. As time passed, Wordgirl, unknowing of the transformation taking place within the lair, continued her valiant crusade against crime in Fair City. She would occasionally hear whispers among the city's residents about the villains harboring a young girl, but she chose to let it be, taking solace in the fact that Rosie was safe and, perhaps, being cared for in a way she couldn't have provided. And so, the villains and Rosie lived their peculiar yet heartwarming existence, hidden from the world but basking in a bond that transcended the conventions of hero and villain. Though unorthodox, their friendship shone brightly within the walls of the warehouse, a testament to the transformative power of love and compassion."},{"instruction":"Two Brains decides to figure out what's wrong with Rosie, but it's hard to figure it out because not even she knows. Eventually he at least figured out that she's got some sort of psychosis thanks to a hereditary mental disorder that she unfortunately inherited.","output":"As the days went by, Dr. Two-Brains couldn't shake the curiosity that consumed him. He couldn't bear to see Rosie in such a fragile state, filled with both childlike innocence and deranged confusion. Determined to understand her condition better, he delved into research, scouring medical journals and consulting with experts in the field. To his dismay, Dr. Two-Brains discovered that Rosie's behaviors and unpredictability stemmed from a hereditary mental disorder. It became clear that she was experiencing psychosis, a symptom of her condition. The disorder, passed down through generations, had unfortunately found its way to Rosie's fragile mind. Filled with a mixture of sadness and understanding, Dr. Two-Brains approached Rosie one evening. With gentleness in his voice, he said, \\"Rosie, I've been doing some research, and it seems like you have a mental disorder. It's called psychosis, and it's a challenge that you'll have to face. But remember, you are not alone. We are here to support you.\\" Rosie blinked, her eyes flickering with a hint of recognition mixed with confusion. \\"What's that mean, Dr. Brains?\\" Dr. Two-Brains took a deep breath, gathering his thoughts. \\"It means that sometimes your mind might play tricks on you, making it hard to distinguish between reality and fantasy. Sometimes the world around you might seem scary or confusing, but it doesn't define who you are. It's important to remember that you are unique, and we will do everything in our power to help and protect you.\\" Overwhelmed with emotion, a tear trickled down Rosie's cheek. \\"Thank you, Dr. Brains. I didn't know what was wrong with me. I just thought I was different.\\" Dr. Two-Brains gently wiped away her tear, a soft smile on his face. \\"Different doesn't mean there's something wrong with you, Rosie. It means you have a perspective that others may not understand. We will embrace your uniqueness and provide a safe haven where you can be yourself.\\" With this newfound understanding, the villains joined forces and embarked on a mission to learn more about Rosie's mental disorder. They sought out experts, explored therapies, and even developed creative ways to manage her episodes of psychosis. Rosie, now armed with knowledge and surrounded by a support system, found solace in the villains' friendship and the sanctuary they had created. She felt protected, valued, and understood in a way that she hadn't before. Her episodes of confusion and disorientation slowly began to subside as the love and nurturing environment worked its magic. Dr. Two-Brains became not only Rosie's friend but also her confidant. He dedicated hours to understanding her condition academically and emotionally. Through his patience, he discovered triggers that tended to contribute to her episodes and found coping mechanisms that alleviated her distress. Together, they created a repertoire of tools that helped Rosie navigate the complexities of her mental disorder. From colorful fidget toys to grounding exercises, each villain played a role in supporting her during her challenging moments. Over time, Rosie's laughter became more stable and her artwork blossomed, imbued with a newfound clarity and depth. The villains, once consumed by darkness and driven by misguided schemes, found purpose in their role as caretakers and protectors. Rosie's presence had transformed their lives in unexpected and beautiful ways. In the unlikeliest of friendships, the villains and Rosie discovered the strength and resilience that can arise in the face of adversity. Together, they shattered the barriers of hero and villain, forging a bond that transcended their own limitations. And within their shared love and compassion, they proved that even amid chaos, the power of understanding and support could prevail."},{"instruction":"Grounded Language Image Pre training这篇论文能详细说说么","output":"截至我的知识更新日期是在2023年4月之前，我无法直接访问最新的研究论文和它们的内容。因此，如果\\"Grounded Language Image Pre-training\\"是在此之后发布的一篇论文，我无法为您提供详细信息。 然而，我可以提供一些关于所谓的\\"grounded language learning\\"和图像预训练模型方面的概括性信息。Grounded language learning是一个研究方向，它涉及将自然语言理解与感知数据（如视觉数据）相绑定。换言之，这种方法旨在让机器学习模型理解语言表达与实际物理世界之间的连接。 图像预训练通常指的是在大规模数据集上预训练图像识别模型，这样模型就可以在特定任务（如物体识别、场景解释、视觉问答的应用）上进行微调。预训练是深度学习中一种常见的做法，有利于提高学习效率和模型的泛化能力。 结合这些概念，\\"Grounded Language Image Pre-training\\"可能是指一个合并了语言理解和视觉数据分析的预训练模型。这种模型可能被设计为先在大量带注释的图像数据上学习语言和图像之间的联系，之后可以在具体任务上进一步训练以提高表现。例如，在一个视觉问答任务上，模型需要理解问题（语言数据），并通过分析给定图片来提供答案。 我建议你查找这篇论文的正式出版物，并直接从源头获取关于论文目的、方法、实验和结论的详细信息。通常，研究会发布在学术期刊或会议论文集上，也可以通过研究机构的网站或研究者的个人页面找到相关信息。如果这篇论文的详细内容对于您很重要，也可以考虑直接联系作者以获取进一步的信息。"},{"instruction":"cross-attention是怎么做的呢","output":"Cross-attention是一种在序列-到-序列模型（如Transformer模型）中使用的注意力机制。它让模型能够在处理一个序列时，考虑到另一个序列的信息，从而使两个序列之间的相关性得到更好的建模。这在任务中特别有用，例如机器翻译，其中输入序列是源语言句子，而输出序列是目标语言翻译。 传统的注意力机制（self-attention）在处理序列时，使得序列内的每个元素都能注意到其他所有元素。而cross-attention则设定对于序列A中的每个元素，模型应该关注序列B中的哪些元素。例如，在机器翻译任务中，对于目标语言中的每个单词，cross-attention允许模型决定应该给予源语言句子中哪些单词更多的注意力。 下面是cross-attention在计算过程的简述： 1. **Query, Key, Value:** 在cross-attention中，我们有两个序列——\`Query\`序列来自于目标序列（你希望建模或生成的序列），而\`Key\`和\`Value\`序列来自于源序列（你希望模型从中抽取信息的序列）。 2. **线性投影：** 对于每个序列，我们通常对其元素使用线性变换来生成\`Query\`向量、\`Key\`向量和\`Value\`向量。这些线性变换由训练过程中学习的权重矩阵定义。 3. **注意力分数计算：** 接下来，计算\`Query\`与\`Key\`之间的打分（通常是点积），目的是了解在处理查询时应该给予键多少注意力。为了保持数值稳定性，这些分数经常除以\`Key\`向量维度的平方根，然后通过softmax函数将分数转换为概率。 4. **加权求和：** 分数随后用来加权\`Value\`向量，公式通常表达为加权求和。这就是\`Value\`在被处理过的注意力分数下的表现——与\`Query\`高度相关的\`Value\`点将获得更大的权重。 5. **输出产生：** 最后，得到的加权和是cross-attention的输出，它将被用于后续的模型层中或生成最终的序列元素。 6. **多头注意力：** 为了让模型能够从多个子空间学习信息，常常会使用多头注意力，即重复上述过程多次，每次使用不同的线性投影。 在Transformer模型中，cross-attention在编码器和解码器之间起作用，编码器处理输入序列，生成一系列\`Key\`和\`Value\`向量，在解码器尝试生成输出的过程中，解码器的每一个步骤都会通过cross-attention来访问这些向量，从而获得必要的源序列信息。 Cross-attention通过这种方式允许模型在生成新序列时显式地利用源序列的信息，使得输出更加准确和相关。"},{"instruction":"买办是什么意思","output":"“买办”这个词在不同的历史和社会场景下有不同的含义，但通常指的是旧时中国在对外贸易中担任中介角色的商人。 在中国明清时期到19世纪，随着与西方国家的贸易日渐增加，许多西方商人对中国内地的语言和商业惯例并不熟悉，因此需要依赖当地的华人商人作为代理人或中介。这些华人商人就是所谓的“买办”。他们通常具有一些共同特点： 1. 掌握或者熟悉外语，能够和外商沟通。 2. 了解中国的商法和海关程序。 3. 拥有较强的商业网络和资源。 在这个体系中，买办为外国商户提供帮助，比如翻译、谈判、代理销售、支付关税和其他服务。因此，他们在外国商户和中国商业、官方之间充当了桥梁的角色。 然而，这一角色在中国的近现代史中往往带有负面含义。在列强经济侵略和半殖民地化的历史背景下，很多买办被视为外国势力在华的代理人，有时候也因此被看作民族背叛者，因为他们帮助外国势力深入中国市场，而且在某些情况下，他们的活动对国家经济的独立性和民族工商业的发展造成了损害。 到了20世纪，随着中国抵制外国侵略力量和推行独立自主的贸易政策，这一角色逐渐淡出。在今天的语境下，买办一词很少用于商业术语，它更多的是作为历史概念出现在对中国近现代史的讨论中。"},{"instruction":"other words for curriculum","output":"1.

And what better way to embark on this adventure than through the enchanting world of phonics? Phonics is a foundational instructional method that helps young learners grasp the connections between letters and sounds. In this article, we will explore the importance of phonics in ESL kindergarten classrooms and its magical impact on reading skills development. Understanding Phonics Phonics is a teaching approach that emphasizes the relationship between letter sounds and their written forms. By learning phonics, young learners develop the key skills needed for reading and writing. Through phonics instruction, ESL kindergarten students learn to recognize individual speech sounds (phonemes), link sounds to corresponding letters (graphemes), and blend them together to form words. This systematic approach vastly improves phonemic awareness, spelling, vocabulary, and overall comprehension skills. Why Phonics? 1. Cracking the Code: Phonics acts as a secret decoder ring, enabling children to \\"crack the code\\" of written language. Understanding the correspondence between sounds and letters helps young learners make sense of the words they see, empowering them to read with confidence and independence. 2. Enhanced Pronunciation: Learning phonics provides ESL kindergarten students with a solid foundation in pronunciation. They become more acquainted with the intricacies of English sounds, enabling them to speak more accurately and fluently. 3. Improved Reading Comprehension: Phonics instruction equips young learners with vital reading skills, enabling them to recognize familiar words and decode unfamiliar ones. As their reading comprehension skyrockets, students become more engaged and develop a love for reading. 4. Boosting Vocabulary: Phonics introduces young learners to new words by teaching them the various sounds that combine to form these terms. Engaging in phonics lessons promotes curiosity and expands vocabulary, allowing kindergarten students to communicate more effectively. Phonics Strategies 1. Decoding: Phonics teaches students to decode words. By analyzing sounds and matching them to letters, learners gain confidence in their reading abilities. Decoding follows a systematic progression from letter sounds to blends, digraphs, and vowel patterns, progressively building their reading skills. 2. Blending and Segmenting: Blending involves combining individual sounds to form words, while segmenting requires breaking words into individual sounds. These skills help students develop phonemic awareness, enabling them to manipulate and understand the sounds within words, enhancing both reading and spelling abilities. 3. Sight Words: Alongside phonics, teaching sight words (high-frequency words that might not follow regular phonics patterns) is crucial for ESL kindergarten students. By recognizing these words instantly, students gain independence and fluency in their reading. Incorporating Phonics into the Classroom To create a phonics-rich environment in an ESL kindergarten classroom, educators can engage students by employing games, songs, and interactive activities. Incorporating multimedia resources, letter-sound associations, and word-building exercises further enhances the effectiveness of phonics instruction. Conclusion Phonics is an invaluable tool for ESL kindergarten students, offering them a pathway to becoming proficient readers and writers of English. By integrating phonics instruction into their classrooms, educators can instill a love for reading, enhance vocabulary acquisition, and foster overall language development. Embrace the magic of phonics and watch your ESL kindergarten students' literacy skills soar to new heights!"},{"instruction":"Write an article about how we teach phonics to ESL students at Inspire Academy Kindergarten (IAK), using the Letters and Sounds text book.

Cultivating self-love and compassion to foster personal growth and 3. Extending love and compassion to others and the world at large. Do not copy paste similar content in the internet. Rephrase and paraphrase to make it original.","output":"Chapter 4: Embracing Divine Love and Compassion Section 1: Recognizing the Power of Love in the Spiritual Journey Love is the ultimate driving force behind every spiritual journey. It is the energy that unites us with the divine, nourishes our souls, and propels us toward personal growth and fulfillment. By recognizing the power of love, we open ourselves to a profound connection with the divine and embark on a transformative path. In the realm of spirituality, love represents more than just human emotions or attachments. It transcends physical boundaries and merges with the essence of our being. Love is the creative force that binds the universe together, and by tapping into this divine energy, we can experience a profound shift in our consciousness. To truly recognize the power of love, we must first understand that love is not limited to romantic or conditional affection. Divine love is all-encompassing, unconditional, and unchanging. It is a force that permeates every aspect of our lives and has the ability to awaken our higher selves. When we open our hearts to this divine energy, we invite endless possibilities and allow ourselves to become conduits of love. Section 2: Cultivating Self-Love and Compassion to Foster Personal Growth The journey of embracing divine love and compassion begins with cultivating self-love and compassion. Many of us possess a critical inner voice that constantly undermines our worth and prevents us from fully experiencing the power of divine love. However, by practicing self-compassion, we create space for personal growth and transformation. Self-compassion involves treating ourselves with kindness, acceptance, and understanding. It means acknowledging our flaws and imperfections without judgment and embracing our true selves. By nurturing self-love, we heal deep-seated wounds and unlock our potential for personal development. A powerful way to foster self-compassion is through self-reflection and mindfulness. Taking the time to pause, observe our thoughts, and engage in self-inquiry allows us to challenge negative self-beliefs and replace them with empowering ones. Through this process, we can cultivate self-love and compassion, creating a solid foundation for our spiritual growth. Section 3: Extending Love and Compassion to Others and the World at Large Once we have nurtured self-love and compassion, we expand our focus to encompass others and the world at large. Embracing divine love enables us to extend compassion beyond ourselves and become agents of positive change in the world. Extending love and compassion to others begins with empathy. By recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings, we develop a capacity to understand the struggles and challenges faced by others. This empathy forms the basis for acts of kindness and compassion toward our fellow human beings. Practicing love and compassion can take various forms, such as acts of service, active listening, or simply offering a caring presence. These acts, fueled by divine love, have the power to uplift and transform lives, fostering unity and harmony in the world. Moreover, extending love and compassion to the world at large requires a heightened sense of awareness and responsibility. It involves embracing a holistic perspective, understanding that our actions have ripple effects and can impact the collective consciousness. By approaching life with an intention to sow seeds of love and kindness, we contribute to the creation of a more compassionate world. As our love and compassion expand, we become agents of healing and transformation not only in our own lives but also in the lives of those we encounter. We become beacons of light, showing others the way to embrace divine love and compassion, and collectively we work towards creating a world that values empathy, kindness, and unity. Conclusion: Recognizing the power of love in our spiritual journey is essential to unlocking our true potential. By cultivating self-love and compassion, we foster personal growth and create a solid foundation for our transformation. Extending love and compassion to others and the world at large allows us to contribute to the creation of a more compassionate and harmonious society. As we embrace divine love and compassion, we become catalysts for change, igniting a ripple effect that spreads healing and unity throughout the world."},{"instruction":"make a personal narrative about a girl struggling with covid 19","output":"Title: Finding Strength Amidst the Storm: My Battle with COVID-19 Introduction: The year 2020 will forever be etched in my memory.

In this personal narrative, I will recount the struggles, fears, and inner strength I discovered while grappling with COVID-19. Chapter 1: The Unexpected Diagnosis It all started with a mild cough and fatigue that never seemed to recede. Like many others, I brushed it off, attributing my symptoms to a common cold. However, as days turned into weeks, my condition worsened. With trepidation, I scheduled a COVID-19 test and anxiously awaited the results. When they finally came in, my heart sank: I tested positive. Fear and uncertainty consumed my mind, and I braced myself for the impending battle against an invisible adversary. Chapter 2: The Isolation Blues The prospect of self-isolation brought a unique kind of loneliness. Shut away from the outside world, I felt distant from my loved ones. Ironically, the virus created an unbearable emotional barrier between us, preventing any physical contact and confining me to my room. The days seemed to blur together, each one blending into an isolated haze. However, despite the eerie silence, technology became my solace, connecting me with family and friends virtually, reassuring me that I was not alone in this fight.

The journey had been long and arduous, chipping away at my physical and emotional well-being. But much more than that, it had molded me into a person with a newfound appreciation for life and the strength to face adversity head-on.

Masks adorned every face, and social distancing became the norm. But as I observed these changes, I also witnessed the incredible resilience of humanity.

Set against the backdrop of World War II, the story revolves around the complex friendship between two prep school students, Gene Forrester and Phineas. Through the examination of Gene's envy towards Phineas and the resulting consequences, the novel delves into the destructive nature of jealousy and its ability to distort one's perception of reality. Body Paragraph 1: Gene's envy towards Phineas is first revealed when Phineas effortlessly excels academically and athletically, while Gene struggles to keep up. This envy eventually transforms into an intense rivalry, fueled by Gene's desire to be the best. As a result, Gene deliberately jostles the limb of a tall tree, causing Phineas to fall and suffer a severe injury. This act of envy-driven aggression not only physically harms Phineas but also deepens the divide between the two friends, ultimately leading to a loss of trust and shattered friendship. Body Paragraph 2: The fallout from Gene's envy highlights the psychological and emotional toll that jealousy can take on an individual. With Phineas no longer participating in sports, Gene gains a temporary sense of superiority, but it comes at a great cost. Overwhelmed by guilt, Gene becomes trapped in his own world of self-doubt and remorse. The envy that once drove him towards excellence now becomes a source of self-destructive behavior and a barrier to his personal growth. Body Paragraph 3: The consequences of Gene's envy extend beyond the personal realm, affecting the entire school community. The rivalry between Gene and Phineas becomes a divisive force that permeates the student body, turning friends into adversaries and causing a toxic atmosphere of competition. The once harmonious Devon school is now tainted by an aura of tension and mistrust, mirroring the devastating effects of envy on individuals and their wider social networks. Conclusion: In \\"A Separate Peace,\\" John Knowles expertly illustrates the destructive power of envy and its far-reaching consequences. As Gene's envy towards Phineas evolves into a dangerous rivalry, it leads to irreversible physical injuries, shattered friendship, emotional turmoil, and a toxic atmosphere within the school community. Through the examination of this cause and effect relationship, readers are reminded of the perils of envy and the importance of fostering healthy relationships built on trust and support rather than competitiveness."},{"instruction":"We are writing a 2-3 page cause and effect essay on A Separate Peace, MLA-formatted in Times New Roman font, that we will submit to Turnitin.com. 6-10 sentence paragraphs. With quotations.","output":"Title: The Destructive Cycle of Envy and the Ripple Effects in \\"A Separate Peace\\" Introduction: John Knowles' novel, \\"A Separate Peace,\\" delves into the volatile nature of envy and the profound impact it has on individuals and their relationships. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the story revolves around the complex friendship between Gene Forrester and Phineas. Through Gene's envy towards Phineas and the consequential effects, the novel unveils the destructive power of jealousy. This essay will analyze the causes and effects of Gene's envy through the use of relevant quotations, highlighting the profound consequences it has on the characters and their environment. Body Paragraph 1: One of the initial causes of Gene's envy towards Phineas lies in Phineas' innate athletic abilities. Gene, recognizing his own limitations, becomes infatuated with Phineas' effortless success. As Gene reflects, \\"I was beginning to see that Phineas could get away with anything. I couldn't help envying him that a little, which was perfectly normal. There was no harm in envying even your best friend a little\\" (Knowles 24). This jealousy fosters a simmering rivalry between the two friends, setting the stage for the catastrophic events that follow. Body Paragraph 2: The consequences of Gene's envy manifest in the deliberate act of causing Phineas to fall from a tree, resulting in a career-ending injury. Reflecting on the incident, Gene acknowledges the driving force behind his action: \\"I was not of the same quality as he. I couldn't stand this... Phineas had undoubtedly been ready to risk himself around the war ever since I could remember; he had been daring and bold, not asking favors of anybody. Now I realized that there was no harm in envying even your best friend a little\\" (Knowles 100). This act not only physically harms Phineas but also shatters their friendship, leading Gene into a cycle of guilt and remorse. Body Paragraph 3: The far-reaching effects of Gene's envy extend beyond their immediate relationship and impact the entire school community. The rivalry between Gene and Phineas permeates the student body, sowing seeds of discord and mistrust. Reflecting on the aftermath, Gene acknowledges the widespread consequences of his actions: \\"I could not escape a feeling that this was my own funeral, and you do not cry in that case\\" (Knowles 195). The toxic atmosphere created by envy disrupts the once harmonious Devon school, irrevocably altering the dynamics among its students. Conclusion: John Knowles' \\"A Separate Peace\\" showcases the destructive cycle of envy and its ripple effects on individuals and their immediate surroundings. Through Gene's envy, we witness a rivalry that culminates in severe physical injury, shattered friendship, and a pervasive atmosphere of mistrust within the school community. The inclusion of relevant quotations further underscores the causes and consequences of Gene's envy, elucidating the destructive nature of jealousy. Ultimately, the novel serves as a poignant reminder of the need to foster healthy relationships rooted in trust and support, as opposed to succumbing to the destructive power of envy."},{"instruction":"习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想论文成果3篇建设方案","output":"习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想是中国共产党、中国特色社会主义事业的最新理论成果，具有重要的理论和现实意义。下面列举三篇建设方案论文成果，探讨如何贯彻落实习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想。 1.《习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想对推进中国经济发展的意义及实践》 本论文从经济发展的角度，阐述了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想对推进中国经济发展具有重要意义。在当前国际形势复杂多变的背景下，习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为中国经济发展提供了科学指导和基本遵循。论文提出了一系列具体的建设方案，包括坚持稳中求进的经济发展理念、推动供给侧结构性改革、加强创新驱动发展等。 2.《习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想对提高人民群众生活水平的意义及实践》 本论文从民生的角度，论述了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想对提高人民群众生活水平的重要意义。通过分析我国社会主要矛盾的变化，论文提出了一系列建设方案，包括改善民生、深化医疗卫生体制改革、加强社会保障制度建设、推进教育公平等。这些建设方案旨在确保人民群众享有更多的实实在在的发展成果。 3.《习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想对建设中国特色社会主义法治体系的意义及实践》 本论文从法治建设的角度，探讨了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想对建设中国特色社会主义法治体系的重要意义。论文提出了一系列具体的建设方案，包括加强党对法治的领导、完善法治环境、加强法治教育等。这些建设方案旨在为中国特色社会主义法治体系的建设提供指导和保障。 以上三篇论文成果涵盖了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想在经济、民生和法治等方面的重要意义和实践要求，对于贯彻落实习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想具有积极的指导意义。"},{"instruction":"in phonological rules what does S stands for","output":"In phonological rules, \\"S\\" often stands for \\"segment.\\" A segment refers to a single sound or phoneme in a language.

And so, as I hung up my apron after another long shift at the carry out restaurant I now called my second home, I knew that I had emerged from this tumultuous period with a newfound sense of strength and determination.

The tumultuous journey of navigating through the unparalleled challenges brought on by the global pandemic, Covid-19, had not only tested my character, but also shaped it into something far more resilient and fortified than ever before. In the face of uncertainty and adversity, I had not cowered or succumbed, but instead, I had bravely and resolutely confronted each hurdle head-on, refusing to let the weight of the world break my spirit. There I stood, as the faded sunlight painted the sky with hues of fading orange and pink, hanging up my apron after yet another long and grueling shift at the carry-out restaurant that had, unexpectedly, become my second home during these unprecedented times. And in that moment, a profound realization washed over me like a gentle, yet powerful wave – the transformative power of the human spirit, when confronted by adversity and trial. Through countless nights spent in isolation, tethered to the glow of a laptop screen, I had sought solace in the pages of books and the virtual connections with loved ones. The once-thriving streets were now desolate and hushed, a palpable reminder of the collective pause engraved upon the world. Yet, amidst the hollow corners of a fragile society, a fire had been ignited within me. A passion for life, for flourishing, for pursuing joy and potential even in the face of uncertainty and fear. The metaphorical clouds of the global crisis had not only darkened my path but had also unveiled my tenacious resilience and inner strength. Each moment of despair was met with unwavering determination to bridge the gap between what was lost and the prospect of a brighter and bolder future. It was within this transformative embrace that I discovered the profound depths of my character and the unyielding power that resides within a teenager who, unyielding, chooses not to let a pandemic erode the very essence of their being. As I reminisced on the countless hours spent donning a mask and gloves, tirelessly serving patrons who sought reprieve in takeout meals and coffee to-go, I could not help but marvel at the resounding triumph of the human spirit. The resilience forged in the crucible of this global turmoil had emboldened me to rise above the suffocating weight of despair, to reject complacency, and to emerge as a testament to the indomitable spirit that characterizes all those who dare to reclaim their lives in the face of unprecedented uncertainty. Thus, as I fervently gazed towards the horizon, where the glow of a new dawn beckoned, I carried within me a newfound understanding – an understanding that not only had Covid-19 challenged me in unimaginable ways, but it had also illuminated the boundless strength and potential hidden within the depths of my soul. No longer defined solely by the trials that had shaken the foundations of our world, but rather, by the unwavering fortitude that rose from the ashes of adversity. In the end, through the hardships and resilience cultivated during this tumultuous period, I emerged as a beacon of unwavering strength, a testament to the tireless persistence of the human spirit. I stood tall, ready to face the world with unshakable determination, knowing that while the path to adulthood may be fraught with uncertainty, I possessed the resilience to weather any storm. And as I pondered the challenges that lay ahead, I did so with a newfound sense of purpose, fueled by the knowledge that I had weathered the greatest trial of our time and emerged stronger, wiser, and more resolute than ever before."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

CoCl2 is a transition metal complex that contains a central cobalt ion (Co2+) and four chloride ions (Cl-) arranged in an octahedral shape. In this complex, cobalt is in its +2 oxidation state. When CoCl2 is dissolved in water, the water molecules (H2O) surround and interact with the cobalt ion. The water molecules coordinate to the cobalt ion, forming a new complex called a hydrated cobalt chloride complex. In this complex, water molecules replace some or all of the chloride ions around the cobalt ion. The hydrated cobalt chloride complex absorbs different wavelengths of light compared to the original CoCl2 complex, resulting in a change in color. The blue color of CoCl2 is due to the absorption of certain wavelengths in the visible spectrum, while the pink color of the hydrated complex is due to the absorption of different wavelengths. The exact color change from blue to pink depends on the degree of hydration, which can vary based on the ratio of CoCl2 to water and other factors such as temperature."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Describe an allele-specific PCR.","output":"Allele-specific PCR, also known as allele-specific amplification or ASA, is a PCR-based method designed to amplify only one of the alleles of a given gene when that gene is present in a heterozygous condition (having two different alleles at the same locus). This technique is particularly useful for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small-scale insertions or deletions, or any genetic variation where the alleles differ by at least one base pair. The critical aspect of allele-specific PCR is the design of the primers. Primers are usually designed to have their 3'-end match exactly with the variant nucleotide. If the primer perfectly matches the DNA template at the 3' end, it is extended by the DNA polymerase, and the allele is amplified. If there is a mismatch at the 3' end due to the presence of a different allele, the extension is inefficient or does not occur at all, and amplification of that allele is reduced or prevented. This results in a selective amplification of the target allele while the non-target allele remains unamplified or is amplified at a much lower level. The specificity of the reaction can be enhanced by adjusting reaction conditions such as annealing temperature, polymerase choices, or addition of enhancers or blockers. Allele-specific PCR can be applied in various genetic analyses including: 1. Genotyping: To determine an individual's genotype at a specific locus. 2. Detecting disease-causing mutations: For genetic diseases associated with known mutations. 3. Personalized medicine: To tailor medical treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. 4. Agricultural genetics: For selective breeding based on specific genetic traits in crops or livestock.

Yuri should’ve been here by now!” Sayori: “I know, it’s so unlike her to be late. Do you think something happened?” Natsuki: (rolls her eyes) “Don’t tell me you’re getting worried, Monika. It’s just Yuri being Yuri, probably drowning in her books or something.” Monika: “Well, I can’t help but worry. We’re supposed to be discussing our upcoming poetry session today.” Sayori: “You’re right, Monika. We can’t start without her.” (Meanwhile, at Yuri’s place…) Yuri: (starting to have contractions) “Ah. Ah! Oh, it’s coming!” (In the midst of her contractions, Yuri frantically grabs her phone and dials Monika’s number) Yuri: (panicked) “Monika! It-it’s happening! I think…I think I’m going into labor!” Monika: (concerned) “Yuri?! Oh no, stay calm, I’ll be right there! Just breathe and try to time your contractions!” (As Yuri hangs up and gathers her things, the pain intensifies with each passing moment. She fumbles to unlock her front door, barely managing to step outside before her water breaks) Yuri: “Oh no…it’s really coming now! I’ve got to hurry to the clubroom!” (Meanwhile, back at the clubroom…) Sayori: “Do you think maybe we should go check on Yuri? She’s never been this late before.” Natsuki: (sighs) “Fine, I’ll go with you. But she better have a good reason for holding up our meeting.” (Just as Sayori and Natsuki are about to leave the room, the door bursts open and Yuri stumbles in, clearly in pain.) Sayori: “Yuri, oh my gosh! Are you okay?” Yuri: (struggling to speak) “I…I went into labor…” Monika: (rushing over to Yuri) “Oh no! Why didn’t you call an ambulance?” Yuri: (gasping) “I…I didn’t have time…I wanted to make it to the clubroom…for the meeting…” Natsuki: (panicked) “Yuri, you can’t ignore something like this! We need to get you to the hospital!” (Without wasting another moment, Monika calls an ambulance while Natsuki and Sayori help Yuri to sit down. The clubroom turns into a flurry of activity as everyone tries to ensure Yuri’s comfort while they wait for medical help.) Monika: “Yuri, everything will be alright. Just hold on, help is on the way.” Yuri: (weakly) “Thank…thank you, M-” (clutching her belly) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! OH, IT’S HAPPENING!!!” (As Yuri cries out in pain, the room falls into a tense silence. The sound of an approaching ambulance grows louder outside) Monika: (frantically) “Hang in there, Yuri! The ambulance is almost here!” Sayori: (teary-eyed) “You’re going to be alright, Yuri! Just keep breathing!” Natsuki: (gripping Yuri’s hand) “Don’t worry, we’ll stay with you every step of the way. Just hold on!” (Yuri’s contractions intensify, and the pain becomes unbearable. She clenches her teeth and squeezes Natsuki’s hand tightly) Yuri: (groaning) “I can’t… I can’t do this… it hurts so much…” Monika: (encouragingly) “You’re strong, Yuri! We believe in you! Just a little longer!” Yuri: (clutching her belly even tighter) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! IT’S COMING OUT!!!” (The sound of sirens fills the air as the ambulance arrives outside the school. Paramedics rush into the clubroom, bringing a stretcher with them.) Paramedic: “Alright, we’re here to help. Is she going into labor?” Monika: “Yes, she’s about to give birth. Please, help her!” (The paramedics quickly assess the situation and guide Yuri onto the stretcher. With Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki by her side, Yuri is wheeled out of the clubroom and into the ambulance.) Paramedic: “We’ll do everything we can to make this as comfortable as possible. Stay calm, Y-” (Without any warning, Yuri lets out another loud scream as she feels an intense pressure and an overwhelming urge to push.) Monika: (holding back tears) “Yuri, just remember to breathe and push when the pain comes. You’re doing great!” (Yuri grits her teeth and follows Monika’s instructions, pushing with all her strength. The paramedics work quickly and efficiently, providing encouragement and support.) Sayori: (cheering) “You’re almost there, Yuri! Keep pushing, you can do it!” Natsuki: (holding Yuri’s hand tightly) “We’re so proud of you, Yuri! Just a little more!” (Yuri takes one final deep breath and gives one last push. Suddenly, the room is filled with the sound of a baby’s cry.) Yuri: “My baby Violet!” (The paramedics swiftly clean and wrap the newborn baby in a blanket before gently placing her in Yuri’s arms.) Yuri: (teary-eyed) “Oh, Violet, my little dandere…you’re finally here…” (The room is filled with a mixture of relief, joy, and awe as everyone watches Yuri cradle her newborn daughter. The paramedics congratulate Yuri and the club members on a successful delivery.) Paramedic: “Congratulations, Yuri! You did an amazing job. Welcome to the world, Violet.” (Sayori wipes away her tears with a smile, while Natsuki and Monika exchange a glance filled with amazement.) Monika: “Yuri, you were incredible. We’re so proud of you.” Natsuki: “Yeah, Yuri. I didn’t expect you to be this strong. You’re a true fighter.” (Yuri smiles weakly, still feeling the effects of labor, but her eyes are filled with pure love and happiness.) Yuri: “Thank you, everyone… for being here and supporting me. I couldn’t have done it without you all.” (After a few moments of celebrating and marveling at the newborn baby, one of the paramedics gently reminds them that they need to head to the hospital for a check-up.) Paramedic: “It’s time for both of you to go to the hospital now. We’ll make sure you and Violet receive the care you need.” (Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki gather their things, making sure Yuri feels supported as they help her into the ambulance.) Sayori: “We’ll be right there with you, Yuri. Violet is going to have the best aunties ever.” Natsuki: “And don’t worry about the club or the poetry session. We’ll take care of everything.” (Yuri’s face lights up with gratitude, and she nods gently.) Yuri: “Thank you… I’m so lucky to have such amazing friends.” (The paramedics secure Yuri and Violet inside the ambulance and drive off, leaving the clubroom behind. The room is left in a state of mixed emotions - relief, excitement, and a renewed sense of appreciation for the bonds they share.) Monika: “Today was unexpected, but it’s a day we won’t forget. Let’s make sure we’re there for Yuri and Violet every step of the way.” Natsuki: “Definitely. I never thought Yuri would give birth in the clubroom, but hey, it’s a story to tell, right?” (Sayori giggles through her remaining tears, wiping them away with a smile.) Sayori: “Yeah, it definitely adds to the list of our memorable moments. Let’s be the best support system for Yuri and Violet.” (With renewed determination, the club members clean up the clubroom, making sure everything is in order for when Yuri and the baby return. They couldn’t help but feel a profound sense of awe and appreciation for life’s unexpected surprises, and the strength they found within themselves and their friendships.) (The literature club, now a tighter-knit family, eagerly awaits the day when Yuri and Violet will return, ready to embark on new chapters together.) {3 YEARS LATER}","output":"(Back in the literature clubroom…) Monika: (smiling) \\"I can't believe it's already been three years since that unforgettable day.\\" Sayori: \\"Time really flies, doesn't it?

You can see this in the quote “Isaac didn’t have memories in his family of the original schools, the ones that pulled themselves up like wooden monsters coming to attention across the land in the 1800s - monsters who stayed there, ingesting our children like sweet berries, one after another, for 100 years.” page 106. The “wooden monsters”, also known as colonizers that came and attacked Indigenous people’s land centuries ago, and they are doing the same exact thing now, “ingesting our children like sweet berries”. Isaac’s family never passed down the stories about the schools, so when they sprung back up again, he had no frame of reference. Indigenous people were attacked, displaced, and oppressed by the colonizers. They were given small plots of land but kept out of the picture. Over time, they gained more land and more rights, but again, this oppression has started and the same things that happened in the 1800s are repeating themselves. You can see this in the passage “Isaac didn’t have grandparents who’d told residential school stories like campfire tales to scare you into acting right, stories about men and women who promised themselves to God only and then took whatever they wanted from the children, especially at night. Stories about a book that was like a vacuum, used to suck the language right out of your lungs. ”Isaac’s grandparents were lost in the very schools that he’s being taken to now, so the stories of them were never passed to him. The bible was used “like a vacuum, used to suck the language right out of your lungs.” It was used as justification to oppress indigenous people. The parallels between Isaac and his grandparents are very symbolic of history repeating itself, Isaac is being killed in the exact same situation and way that his grandparents were, just centuries later. The bible made the colonizers believe that they were better, that they were blessed by “god”, and it was used to discount anything said or done by indigenous people.","output":"In Cherie Dimaline's book The Marrow Thieves, the theme of Repeating History and Indigenous oppression is effectively portrayed through the use of symbolism and similes. The author exemplifies this theme in a compelling quote on page 106: \\"Isaac didn't have memories in his family of the original schools, the ones that pulled themselves up like wooden monsters coming to attention across the land in the 1800s – monsters who stayed there, ingesting our children like sweet berries, one after another, for 100 years.\\" Here, the \\"wooden monsters\\" represent the colonizers who ravaged Indigenous communities in the past, and are now repeating the same destructive patterns by \\"ingesting our children like sweet berries.\\" Isaac's lack of knowledge about the past schools signifies the erasure of history within his family. The Indigenous people suffered through displacement and oppression at the hands of the colonizers, who granted them small plots of land while keeping them marginalized. Although Indigenous communities eventually gained more land and rights over time, history is now repeating itself, as evident in the following passage: \\"Isaac didn't have grandparents who'd told residential school stories like campfire tales to scare you into acting right, stories about men and women who promised themselves to God only and then took whatever they wanted from the children, especially at night. Stories about a book that was like a vacuum, used to suck the language right out of your lungs.\\" Isaac's grandparents, who experienced the horrors of residential schools, were never able to pass down their stories to him.

Random Sample: The survey states that the 100 Greeks were randomly sampled. This meets the condition of a random sample. 2. Independence: The independence assumption assumes that the responses of one person do not influence the responses of other people. As long as the survey was conducted in a way that ensures each respondent's answer is independent of others, this condition is likely to be met. 3. Sample Size: To construct a confidence interval, we typically require a large enough sample size to meet the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) conditions. In general, for proportions, a sample size of at least 30 is considered sufficient. Since the sample size in this case is 100, this condition is met. 4. Success/Failure Condition: The success/failure condition requires that both the number of successes (25 in this case) and the number of failures (75 in this case) are both at least 10. Since both conditions are met (25 and 75 are both greater than 10), this condition is satisfied.

The formula for the standard error of a proportion is: Standard Error = sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n) where p-hat is the point estimate proportion and n is the sample size. Given that the point estimate proportion is 25% (or 0.25) from the Gallup poll and the sample size is 100, we can substitute these values into the formula. Standard Error = sqrt((0.25 * (1 - 0.25)) / 100) = sqrt(0.1875 / 100) = 0.0433 Since we want a 95% confidence interval, the corresponding z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution). Confidence Interval = 0.25 ± (1.96 * 0.0433) = 0.25 ± 0.0849 = (0.1651, 0.3349) Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true proportion of Greeks who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\" lies between 16.51% and 33.49%.

Random Sample: The survey states that the 100 Greeks were randomly sampled. This meets the condition of a random sample. 2. Independence: The independence assumption assumes that the responses of one person do not influence the responses of other people. As long as the survey was conducted in a way that ensures each respondent's answer is independent of others, this condition is likely to be met. 3. Sample Size: For hypothesis testing of proportions, we need to ensure that the expected count in each category (success and failure) is at least 5. In this case, the previous year study found that 17% of Greeks rated their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering.\\" Therefore, for the current year sample of 100, we expect at least 17 successes and 83 failures, which exceeds the minimum required count of 5 for each category. Hence, this condition is met. 4. Large Sample Size (Optional): For large sample sizes (typically n >= 30), the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) ensures that the sampling distribution of the proportion is approximately normal, allowing us to use z-test. In this case, as the sample size is 100, this condition is met. Based on these considerations, the assumptions necessary to conduct the hypothesis test are satisfied."},{"instruction":"Check the necessary assumptions to conduct the hypothesis test","output":"To conduct a hypothesis test for comparing the proportion of Greeks who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\" in the current year to the previous year, we need to check the necessary assumptions: 1. Random Sample: The survey states that the 100 Greeks were randomly sampled. This meets the condition of a random sample. 2. Independence: The independence assumption assumes that the responses of one person do not influence the responses of other people. As long as the survey was conducted in a way that ensures each respondent's answer is independent of others, this condition is likely to be met for both the current year and the previous year samples. 3. Large Sample Size: In order to use normal approximations for hypothesis testing, we need to ensure that both the current year and previous year sample sizes are sufficiently large. A commonly used guideline is to have at least 10 \\"successes\\" (individuals who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\") and 10 \\"failures\\" (individuals who do not rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\"). For the previous year study, it states that 17% of Greeks rated their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering.\\" If the previous year sample size is sufficiently large (i.e., it has at least 10 successes and 10 failures), then the assumption is met. For the current year study, the sample size is 100, and from the previous information, we know that 25% of them said they would rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering.\\" This suggests that we expect at least 25 successes and 75 failures, satisfying the assumption. 4. Randomization Condition: This assumption implies that the samples were randomly assigned or selected from the population of interest. In this case, if both the current year and previous year samples were randomly selected, this condition is likely met. 5. Unbiased Sampling: The assumption of unbiased sampling presupposes that there was no systematic bias in the selection or collection of samples. If the samples were obtained in a way that ensures representative sample collection, this condition is met. It is important to note that if any of these assumptions are not satisfied, the validity and reliability of the hypothesis test results may be compromised. Therefore, it is critical to rigorously assess and ensure the assumption criteria are met before conducting the hypothesis test."},{"instruction":"Calculate the test statistic","output":"To calculate the test statistic for comparing the proportion of Greeks who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\" in the current year to the previous year, we can use the formula for a two-sample z-test for proportions: Test Statistic = (p1 - p2) / sqrt(p * (1 - p) * (1/n1 + 1/n2)) where p1 and p2 are the sample proportions, n1 and n2 are the sample sizes, and p is the pooled sample proportion. In this case, p1 represents the proportion of Greeks who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\" in the current year (25% or 0.25), n1 is the sample size for the current year (100), p2 is the proportion of Greeks who rated their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\" in the previous year (17% or 0.17), and n2 is the sample size for the previous year (assumed to be sufficiently large). The pooled sample proportion (p) is calculated using the formula: p = (x1 + x2) / (n1 + n2) where x1 and x2 are the number of \\"successes\\" in each sample (i.e., the number of Greeks who rated their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\"). First, calculate the pooled sample proportion: p = (x1 + x2) / (n1 + n2) = (0.25 * 100 + 0.17 * n2) / (100 + n2) Next, substitute the values into the formula for the test statistic: Test Statistic = (p1 - p2) / sqrt(p * (1 - p) * (1/n1 + 1/n2)) = (0.25 - 0.17) / sqrt(p * (1 - p) * (1/100 + 1/n2)) Please note that without knowing the sample size for the previous year (n2), it is not possible to calculate the exact value of the test statistic. To obtain the test statistic value, you will need to determine the specific value of n2 and calculate accordingly."},{"instruction":"Using the confidence interval in (c) and the test result in (d), would you reach the same conclusion? Comment and explain","output":"To answer the question, we need the confidence interval and the test result. However, it seems that the confidence interval (c) and the test result (d) have not been provided in the previous discussions. In general, the conclusion from a hypothesis test and a confidence interval might not always be the same. The confidence interval provides a range of values within which we can be confident that the true population parameter lies. If the parameter of interest (in this case, the proportion of Greeks who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\") falls within the confidence interval, it suggests that there is no significant difference between the two proportions being compared. If the parameter falls outside the confidence interval, it suggests that there is a significant difference. On the other hand, a hypothesis test examines whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. If the test statistic falls within the rejection region (determined by the significance level), then there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the proportions being compared. If the test statistic falls within the non-rejection region, then there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference. So, to determine if the conclusions from the confidence interval and hypothesis test are the same, we need to know the specific confidence interval and test result related to the proportion of Greeks who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \\"suffering\\".

Final thought-provoking sentence","output":"The trench warfare of World War I had a significant impact on the morale of soldiers, taking into account the context of diseases in the trenches. The hypothesis that the war had a negative impact on morale proves to be true through analysis of the sources provided. Firstly, the primary source, the diary of an Australian soldier, provides firsthand accounts of the terrible conditions in the trenches. The soldier describes constant exposure to enemy fire, deplorable living conditions, scarcity of food, contaminated water, and the constant threat of diseases such as dysentery and typhus. The soldier states that these conditions had a negative impact on their morale, leaving them tired, scared, and desperate. This source highlights the physical and psychological challenges faced by soldiers, supporting the hypothesis that trench warfare had a detrimental effect on morale (Smith, 1919). The second source, an archaeological primary source, further reinforces the negative impact on soldier morale during trench warfare. The Villers-Bretonneux ossuary contains the remains of over 10,000 Australian soldiers who died in World War I. The evidence of war injuries and diseases, such as dysentery and typhus, on the soldiers' remains demonstrates the harsh living conditions and constant exposure to enemy fire and diseases. The ossuary serves as a place of reflection and remembrance for visitors, a reminder of the brutality of war and the sacrifices made by soldiers (Cemetery of Villers-Bretonneux, France, 1916-1918). Lastly, the secondary source, a book by Peter Hart, provides a broader perspective on the impact of trench warfare on soldier morale. The author describes the war as a brutal conflict that led to high levels of demoralization among soldiers. The terrible living conditions and constant exposure to enemy fire and diseases resulted in desertions, self-harm, and even suicides. This source supports the hypothesis that trench warfare had a negative impact on soldier morale (Hart, 2014). In conclusion, the evidence from the sources analyzed confirms that trench warfare had a negative impact on the morale of soldiers. The firsthand account of a soldier's diary, the archaeological evidence of war injuries and diseases, and the historical analysis of the war all point to the physical and psychological challenges faced by soldiers in the trenches. These challenges, coupled with the constant exposure to enemy fire and diseases, led to a decline in morale. The soldiers became tired, scared, and desperate, losing hope as they struggled through the harsh conditions of trench warfare. The hypothesis that trench warfare had a negative impact on soldier morale is supported by the analysis of the sources provided (Smith, 1919; Cemetery of Villers-Bretonneux, France, 1916-1918; Hart, 2014). It is crucial to remember and honor the sacrifices made by soldiers in such traumatic conditions."},{"instruction":"re write this to simple spanish","output":"La guerra de trincheras durante la Primera Guerra Mundial tuvo un impacto negativo en la moral de los soldados, especialmente debido a las terribles condiciones de vida y las enfermedades en las trincheras.

En primer lugar, el diario de un soldado australiano describe las condiciones de vida deplorables en las trincheras, incluyendo la escasez de comida, el agua contaminada y la constante exposición al fuego enemigo. El soldado también menciona las enfermedades como la disentería y el tifus, que afectaron a los soldados y empeoraron su moral.

He continues purring throughout the day without even knowing it, until finally the other's giggles catch his ears.","output":"In the bustling city of Fair City, the notorious villains of Wordgirl's rogue's gallery gathered at their favorite hideout, aptly named Villain Hall. The Butcher, Chuck, Dr. Two-Brains, and Lady Redundant Woman assembled to discuss their latest attempts to conquer the city. The air crackled with anticipation as they chatted and exchanged their villainous strategies. Despite their nefarious nature, they always found time for camaraderie amongst themselves, and today was no different. Each villain had their quirks, but today, something rather unusual caught their attention. Unbeknownst to everyone, Butcher, wielding his cleaver as usual, was enjoying a cup of red fruit punch. As he sipped it away, a bizarre occurrence unfolded - he started to emit deep and rhythmic purring sounds. Dr. Two-Brains was the first to notice it, his beady eyes widened in curiosity. \\"Is that... purring I hear?\\" he asked, rubbing his furry chin. Lady Redundant Woman tilted her head and listened intently. \\"Indeed, it does sound like purring. But why is the Butcher purring?\\" she wondered aloud. Chuck, the sandwich-making evil mastermind, chuckled to himself. \\"Perhaps his new hobby is food appreciation? I must say, I never expected the Butcher to become a connoisseur of fruit punch,\\" he quipped. Butcher, unaware of the noise emanating from his own throat, continued drinking his punch contentedly. Little did he know that a chorus of quiet laughter and curious glances followed him throughout the hideout. As the hours passed, the Butcher remained blissfully ignorant of his unusual purring habit. He went about his day, sharpening his cleavers, concocting new plans, all while the continuous purring rolled off his tongue. Finally, unable to contain their amusement any longer, Chuck, Dr. Two-Brains, and Lady Redundant Woman decided to confront Butcher about his unexpected purring affair. They gathered around him, stifling their giggles, until one chuckle escaped Lady Redundant Woman's lips. Butcher's ears perked up at the sound, his cleaver momentarily suspended in mid-air. \\"What's so funny, guys?\\" Butcher questioned, genuinely perplexed by their mirthful expressions. Dr. Two-Brains cleared his throat, trying to stifle his own laughter. \\"Butcher, did you know that you've been purring all day long, even while drinking that red fruit punch?\\" Butcher's eyes widened, and he glanced down at his cup and then back at the others. \\"Purring? Are you serious?\\" he exclaimed, sounding genuinely surprised. Lady Redundant Woman, unable to contain herself any longer, burst into laughter, her multiple selves chuckling in unison. \\"Oh Butcher, you've been purring like a kitten, and it's absolutely adorable!\\" Chuck couldn't help but join in the laughter, slapping his sandwich-filled hand on the table. \\"Fear-inducing butcher by day, lovable feline by night! Who would've thought?\\" For a moment, Butcher's face flushed with embarrassment, but then a mischievous grin appeared on his face. \\"Well, even villains have hidden talents, right?\\" he said, shrugging his shoulders while joining in the laughter. From that day forward, the Butcher's purring became a running joke among the Wordgirl villains. No longer would their hideouts be filled with only evil schemes and mayhem; there would always be a hint of unexpected feline harmony in the air. And so, even while plotting to outsmart Wordgirl, the villains couldn't help but feel a little warmer inside, knowing that a side of their fearsome butcher would always be associated with the delightful sound of purring."},{"instruction":"The other villains decide to mess with Butcher a little bit and, when he's idly sitting on the couch thinking about something, LRW reaches from behind the couch and starts petting him.

They found themselves seated on the couch, waiting for the perfect moment to surprise their unsuspecting friend. As Butcher sat there, lost in thought, his cleaver resting beside him, Lady Redundant Woman quietly crept behind the couch. Her mischievous grin widened as she reached with her extra set of hands, gently petting Butcher on the back. The instant that Lady Redundant Woman's fingertips made contact with Butcher's back, his pupils widened to an extreme degree. A mixture of shock and pleasure coursed through him, causing his purring to amplify, drowning out any other sound that dared to exist in Villain Hall. Startled, Butcher momentarily jumped up from the couch, a bewildered look etched on his face. It took him a few moments to realize that it was his fellow villains who were behind this uproarious surprise. Chuck and Dr. Two-Brains burst into laughter, doubling over with amusement at the sight of Butcher's exaggerated reaction. Even Lady Redundant Woman, her hands still hovering in the air, found herself succumbing to fits of giggles. But after the initial shock subsided, Butcher couldn't help but join in the laughter himself. Knowing that his friends had merely been teasing him, he shook his head and chuckled while resettling onto the couch. \\"Well played, my devious comrades,\\" Butcher said, a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. \\"You certainly know how to catch a villain off-guard.\\" With a renewed sense of camaraderie and joviality, the Wordgirl villains spent the rest of the day relishing in the absurdity of the situation. They traded stories, laughed heartily, and reveled in the warmth of their unique villainous companionship. And so, in the hidden corners of Villain Hall, the sound of Butcher's purring continued to echo, a testament to the friendships forged even in the unlikeliest of places.

As if on cue, Butcher's pupils dilated dramatically, and his purring resumed with even more intensity than before. But what fascinated them the most was the unexpected reaction that followed. As Dr. Two-Brains continued to stroke Butcher's back, Butcher's hands pressed into his own legs, one at a time, mimicking the act of a contented cat softly kneading its paws. A look of pure delight adorned Butcher's face, clear evidence of the joy he was experiencing. Chuck, unable to contain his laughter any longer, burst into fits of giggles. He leaned against the wall, tears streaming down his face as he watched the extraordinary display unfold before him. Amidst the laughter, the various villains took turns petting Butcher, each one mesmerized by the unique reaction he displayed. They watched as his hands rhythmically pressed into his legs with a captivating feline grace. Butcher's purring echoed throughout the room, filling the halls of Villain Hall with an unexpected harmony. Through the laughter and amusement, a newfound appreciation for their peculiar alliance formed. The moments of lightheartedness and connection amidst their villainous pursuits were reminders of their shared humanity, even in the most unconventional circumstances. As the day came to a close, the villains eventually stopped their impromptu cat-petting experiment, their faces still radiant with mirth. For the first time in a long while, Villain Hall felt more like a home than a den of mischief. From that day forward, whenever they gathered, the memory of Butcher's purring and his delightful kneading mimicry became a cherished inside joke, a reminder that even villains can find solace in shared laughter and unexpected moments of joy.

Eles são projetados para entender e transcrever a fala contínua com um vocabulário vasto e diversos contextos. Quando a tarefa é reconhecer um conjunto pequeno e específico de palavras, uma abordagem mais direcionada pode ser mais eficaz. Aqui estão algumas estratégias que você pode considerar: # Modelos Dedicados de Reconhecimento de Palavras-Chave (Keyword Spotting) Modelos de reconhecimento de palavras-chave ou “Keyword Spotting” são especificamente treinados para detectar e reconhecer um conjunto limitado de palavras ou frases. Eles são otimizados para identificar essas palavras em fluxos de áudio contínuos e são amplamente utilizados em aplicações como assistentes virtuais para reconhecimento de comandos de voz. Aqui estão alguns passos que você pode seguir para implementar um sistema de Keyword Spotting: 1. Coleta de Dados: Reúna gravações de áudio das 20 palavras de interesse de vários locutores, em diferentes condições acústicas. 2. Pré-processamento de Áudio: Realize pré-processamento do áudio, como normalização, segmentação de palavras e extração de características relevantes (MFCCs, espectrogramas, etc.). 3. Treino do Modelo: Construa um modelo de rede neural leve, como uma CNN ou RNN, que seja capaz de reconhecer as características dessas palavras específicas. O modelo pode ser treinado para classificar o áudio em uma das 20 palavras ou como ‘outro’ para áudio irrelevante. 4. Pós-processamento: Após o modelo fazer suas predições, aplique algoritmos de pós-processamento para melhorar a detecção, como supressão de não-máximos ou fusão de detecções proximais para reduzir falsos positivos. # Distância ou Similaridade de Áudio Se você ainda preferir usar um sistema como o Whisper para transcrever o áudio e depois identificar as palavras, pode comparar as transcrições do modelo com o seu conjunto restrito de palavras usando técnicas de processamento de linguagem natural (NLP) para calcular a similaridade entre as strings. 1. Distância de Edição: Use algoritmos como Levenshtein para calcular a distância de edição entre a transcrição e cada palavra-chave, escolhendo a mais próxima. 2. Modelos de Embedding de Palavras: Converta palavras em vetores de alta dimensionalidade (word embeddings) e utilize métricas de similaridade de vetores usar um sistema como o Whisper para transcrever o áudio e depois identificar as palavras, utilizei o difflib mas não resultou","output":"Se o uso do difflib não resultou como esperado, é possível que você precise de uma abordagem mais refinada para combinar as transcrições de áudio com o seu conjunto limitado de palavras. Aqui estão algumas estratégias adicionais que você pode tentar para melhorar o reconhecimento de palavras isoladas em um sistema de reconhecimento de voz: # 1. Ajuste Fino de Modelos Pré-Treinados Se você tiver acesso a um modelo pré-treinado como o Whisper, e recursos computacionais suficientes, você pode tentar ajustar o modelo com um conjunto de dados próprio que consiste apenas de suas 20 palavras-chave. Essa técnica é conhecida como \\"fine-tuning\\" e pode ajudar o modelo a tornar-se mais eficiente em reconhecer o vocabulário restrito que você está interessado. # 2. Matching Fonético Em vez de usar apenas a comparação textual, você pode procurar por uma correspondência fonética entre a transcrição do modelo e suas palavras-chave. Algoritmos como o Soundex ou o Metaphone são projetados para converter palavras em uma representação fonética, o que pode ajudar a comparar palavras com base em como elas soam, em vez de como são escritas. # 3. Utilizar Modelos de Embeddings de Áudio Além das técnicas de NLP para comparar textos, você pode considerar o uso de modelos que geram embeddings diretamente do áudio. Modelos como o wav2vec, desenvolvidos pelo Facebook AI Research (FAIR), podem aprender representações densas de trechos de áudio que podem ser mais eficazes para a comparação entre as gravações de áudio e o seu conjunto de palavras-chave. # 4. Classificador Específico Treine um classificador supervisionado específico para suas 20 palavras usando representações de áudio (por exemplo, MFCCs, espectrogramas, embeddings de áudio) como características de entrada. Esse algoritmo poderia ser treinado para reconhecer apenas entre as palavras do seu conjunto restrito, o que facilitaria a distinção mesmo em casos com transcrições muito divergentes. # 5. Reconhecimento Baseado em Modelos Temporais Modelos como HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) ou redes neurais que incorporam uma dimensão de tempo (CRNNs – Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks) podem ser treinados especificamente para lidar com fonemas e a temporalidade da fala, oferecendo um reconhecimento mais preciso em cenários com palavras isoladas. # 6. Utilização de DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) O DTW permite alinhar sequências de tempo que podem variar em velocidade. Para o reconhecimento de voz, você poderia usar o DTW para comparar a entrada de áudio com um conjunto de referências pré-gravadas das palavras-chave, identificando a entrada mais próxima com base em sua estrutura temporal. # 7. Uso de Técnicas de Augmentation de Dados Para ajudar o modelo a reconhecer melhor a pronúncia variada de palavras isoladas, você pode ampliar seu conjunto de dados de treino com variações das gravações, como mudanças na velocidade, no tom e no ruído de fundo. # 8. Thresholding Dinâmico Para métodos que produzem uma pontuação de similaridade ou probabilidade, um ajuste de thresholding pode ajudar a diferenciar entre um reconhecimento correto e ruído ou erros. Este threshold pode ser estático ou dinâmico com base na distribuição das pontuações para palavras-chave específicas. Lembre-se que, ao lidar com um número limitado de palavras, o desempenho do sistema pode ser significativamente afetado pela qualidade e diversidade dos dados de treinamento. Portanto, assegure-se de ter um bom conjunto de gravações cobrindo várias pronúncias e condições acústicas para cada palavra-chave. Recomenda-se experimentar várias dessas técnicas para ver qual se adapta melhor ao seu caso de uso específico, levando em conta o equilíbrio entre precisão desejada e recursos computacionais disponíveis."},{"instruction":"ex python de 2.

Também é importante observar que o reconhecimento de voz pode ser impreciso, especialmente em áudios com ruído de fundo, dialetos ou áudios de baixa qualidade. Portanto, certifique-se de que seus arquivos de áudio sejam claros e bem gravados para melhorar as chances de uma transcrição correta."},{"instruction":"mas quando se comparam palavras que já foram transcritas por reconhecedores de voz isso pode ser distorcido porque os reconhecedores tendem a transcrever a palvra num contexto","output":"Você está correto ao dizer que os sistemas de reconhecimento de voz, especialmente os modelos treinados em grandes conjuntos de dados e desenhados para transcrever fala contínua, muitas vezes interpretam palavras no contexto de uma frase ou conversa completa. Isso pode levar a erros na transcrição de palavras isoladas, já que esses sistemas tentam fazer sentido do áudio com base em uma série de suposições linguísticas e probabilidade contextual. Para evitar esse problema ao comparar palavras foneticamente e garantir uma comparação mais precisa, é melhor usar um sistema de reconhecimento vocal que seja mais confiável para palavras isoladas ou, se isso não for possível, desenvolver um método alternativo que possa desambiguar ou filtrar as transcrições baseadas no contexto. Seja como for, uma vez que você tenha as transcrições das palavras isoladas que deseja comparar, o próximo passo é usar uma codificação fonética. Estes são os passos que você deve seguir, assumindo que já possui as transcrições corretas: 1. Obtenha as transcrições das palavras isoladas. Para o propósito deste exemplo, vamos assumir que você as transcreveu manualmente ou tem certeza de que seu sistema de reconhecimento vocal forneceu transcrições corretas. 2. Utilize a codificação fonética, como Metaphone ou Soundex, para converter as transcrições em um formato que represente como as palavras soam. 3. Compare as representações fonéticas para determinar se as transcrições são foneticamente similares. Aqui está um exemplo adaptado para Python usando o \`doublemetaphone\`, com transcrições de exemplo que presumimos serem corretas: \`\`\`python from metaphone import doublemetaphone # Transcrições hipotéticas que você obteve de um sistema de reconhecimento de voz ou manualmente transcription_1 = \\"word_one_transcription\\" transcription_2 = \\"word_two_transcription\\" # Obtenha a representação Metaphone para ambas as transcrições meta1 = doublemetaphone(transcription_1) meta2 = doublemetaphone(transcription_2) # Comparação fonética if meta1[0] == meta2[0] or meta1[1] == meta2[1]: print(\\"As transcrições são foneticamente similares.\\") else: print(\\"As transcrições são foneticamente diferentes.\\") \`\`\` Essa abordagem independe do sistema de reconhecimento de voz e se concentra na análise fonética após o fato. Justamente por isso, ela pode ser útil para superar o problema dos erros contextuais dos sistemas de reconhecimento de voz ao lidar com palavras isoladas."},{"instruction":"é necessário ter em conta o idioma, se é ingles ou outro? por ex tentei reconhecer por whisper a palavra: next, deu Next net nick, funcionaria esse algoritmo?","output":"Sim, é essencial considerar o idioma ao utilizar algoritmos de reconhecimento de voz e ao aplicar codificações fonéticas como Soundex ou Metaphone. Estes algoritmos foram originalmente desenvolvidos com base na língua inglesa e podem não funcionar tão bem com outros idiomas que têm conjuntos de sons distintos ou regras fonéticas diferentes. Quanto à sua experiência com a palavra \\"next\\" sendo transcrita como \\"Next\\", \\"net\\" e \\"nick\\" por um sistema de reconhecimento de voz como o Whisper, isso destaca a variação que pode ocorrer mesmo dentro de um único idioma ao reconhecer palavras isoladas. O algoritmo Metaphone é projetado para lidar com algumas dessas variações fonéticas, pois fornece uma representação mais abstrata do som das palavras que pode capturar pronúncias semelhantes ou variantes fonéticas. Vamos dar uma olhada em como o Metaphone poderia processar as diferentes transcrições da palavra \\"next\\": \`\`\`python from metaphone import doublemetaphone # Diferentes transcrições da palavra \\"next\\" words = [\\"Next\\", \\"net\\", \\"nick\\"] # Obtenha a representação Metaphone para cada transcrição metaphones = [doublemetaphone(word) for word in words] # Exiba as representações Metaphone for word, meta in zip(words, metaphones): print(f\\"Palavra: {word}, Metaphone: {meta}\\") # Verifique se alguma das transcrições é foneticamente similar à referência 'next' reference = doublemetaphone(\\"next\\") similar_words = [word for word, meta in zip(words, metaphones) if meta[0] == reference[0] or meta[1] == reference[1]] print(f\\"Transcrições foneticamente similares a 'next': {similar_words}\\") \`\`\` Este script fornecerá as representações Metaphone para \\"Next\\", \\"net\\" e \\"nick\\", e as comparará com a referência \\"next\\". Provavelmente será possível ver que o Metaphone pode identificar algumas transcrições como foneticamente similares, mesmo com variações na transcrição. É importante ressaltar que nenhum sistema é perfeito, e codificações fonéticas não resolve todos os problemas de homofones (palavras que soam de forma semelhante mas são escritas de maneira diferente) ou palavras que são pronunciadas de forma muito distinta entre os falantes. É sempre uma boa prática validar o desempenho com um conjunto de testes representativo antes de aplicar o método em uma aplicação prática."},{"instruction":"comparar dois .wav para ver se palavra é similar não é viavel?","output":"Comparar dois arquivos .wav para verificar se contêm palavras similares ou idênticas é tecnicamente viável, mas não é um processo direto nem é garantido que seja altamente preciso sem etapas cuidadosas de processamento e modelagem. A viabilidade e a precisão dependem em grande parte da abordagem utilizada e da qualidade dos dados de áudio. Aqui estão algumas abordagens comuns para a comparação de áudio: # 1. Comparação Direta de Formas de Onda Comparar dois arquivos .wav diretamente, ou seja, suas formas de onda, é geralmente não prático. Pequenos desvios na pronúncia, tempo, posição do microfone e ruído de fundo podem tornar formas de onda de palavras idênticas completamente diferentes aos olhos de um algoritmo simples de comparação. # 2. Reconhecimento de Voz e Comparação de Texto Usar um sistema de reconhecimento de voz para converter os audios .wav em texto e, em seguida, usar a comparação textual (idealmente, complementada com uma comparação fonética) é uma técnica viável. No entanto, como mencionado anteriormente, os sistemas de reconhecimento de voz tendem a contextualizar palavras, o que pode ser um problema para palavras isoladas. # 3. Comparação Fonética de Áudio Extrair características fonéticas ou espectrais do áudio e comparar essas características é um método mais robusto. Técnicas como MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), embeddings de áudio ou redes neurais especialmente treinadas podem omitir parte dos desvios, concentrando-se nas características que são mais discriminativas para a fala humana. # 4. Comparação de Modelos Acústicos Além disso, pode-se usar Modelos Ocultos de Markov (HMM) ou redes neurais para comparar trechos de áudio com base em modelos acústicos. Esses modelos são treinados para reconhecer padrões específicos de fala que correspondem a fonemas ou palavras. # 5. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) é um algoritmo que pode alinhar sequências temporais com variações de velocidade, como gravações de fala. DTW pode ser usado para determinar se duas sequências de som são similares, ajustando o tempo da melhor forma para compensar diferenças no ritmo de fala. # 6. Word/Speaker Embeddings Tecnologias mais recentes envolvem o uso de redes neurais profundas para converter o áudio em um espaço vetorial onde os embeddings (representações numéricas densas) de palavras ou falantes similares estão próximos uns dos outros. Comparar esses embeddings pode fornecer uma indicação de similaridade. **Resumindo**, é possível comparar áudios .wav para ver se uma palavra é similar, mas geralmente isso envolve o reconhecimento de voz seguido por um passo de comparação textual ou fonética, ou a aplicação de técnicas avançadas de processamento de sinal e aprendizado de máquina para comparar as características acústicas diretamente.

Dr. Two-Brains, Chuck \\"The Butcher\\" Steak, Lady Redundant Woman, Mr. Big, and a few others had joined forces for an unconventional gathering. The villains had been causing mayhem all day long, but now their mischievous intentions seemed to be put on pause as they gathered in an abandoned lair. The room itself was dimly lit, filled with shadows, and the air was thick with tension between the rival villains. However, today their focus shifted from their evil schemes to the peculiar behavior of their fellow villain, Chuck \\"The Butcher\\" Steak. As the villains sat around a roundtable, each with their distinct villainous aura, they noticed that Butcher seemed to be lost deep in thought. He had unwittingly created quite the mystery amongst his nefarious companions. Dr. Two-Brains, the mad scientist and regular nemesis of Wordgirl, leaned closer, peering at Butcher with his spectacled eyes. \\"Curious indeed,\\" mumbled Mr. Big, stroking his goatee, as he observed Butcher. \\"He seems different today.\\" Lady Redundant Woman, known for her ability to duplicate herself endlessly, tilted her head, her playful expression turning to curiosity. \\"I have never seen Butcher so... still. And is it just me or does his growl sound more like a purr?\\" Both Chuck \\"The Butcher\\" Steak and his imaginary parrot pal, Bob, were well-known among the villains for their unruly and aggressive nature. Chuck was known to swing his cleaver around, roaring and snarling, plotting his devious schemes. So, this sudden tranquility and purring took them all by surprise. Dr. Two-Brains, unable to contain his curiosity, mustered the courage to approach Butcher. As he drew nearer, he noticed something astonishing. It wasn't only the purring, now audible to all, but Butcher himself seemed... different. He had a serene expression, a hint of a smile on his face, as if he enjoyed being lost in this unknown thought. \\"You there, Butcher!\\" Dr. Two-Brains blurted out, breaking the silence as all eyes turned towards them. \\"What has come over you? We cannot complete our villainous gathering with you... purring?\\" Butcher, startled out of his trance, looked around with a sheepish grin, realizing that his secret was no longer a secret. He blushed, his face turning a deep shade of crimson. \\"Err, sorry about that, folks,\\" he managed to stammer, scratching his bald head. \\"Seems I got lost in my own little world there.\\" Lady Redundant Woman, always compassionate, softened her tone. \\"Butcher, it's alright. We're all friends here, in our villainous way. What were you thinking about, though? Care to share?\\" Chuck \\"The Butcher\\" Steak hesitated for a moment, then, with a newfound vulnerability, he began to speak. \\"Well, you see, I never really noticed before, but when I'm alone in my shop, cutting the finest meats, a strange calmness washes over me. I think about the artistry of my work, the precision, and the satisfaction it brings to others. And in those moments, I find myself so absorbed that I begin to... purr, I suppose.\\" There was a collective silence as the Wordgirl villains processed this revelation. They had always seen Butcher as a brash, tough-as-nails villain. But this moment of vulnerability unveiled something different, something the villains had never seen in each other before: passion for their individual crafts. It was in this silence that they discovered their common ground. Dr. Two-Brains, being familiar with the power of teamwork, broke the silence once more. \\"Well then, fellow villains, it seems we share a common thread. Just like Butcher, each of us takes pleasure in the intricacies of our unique villainous pursuits. Perhaps, just perhaps, we can combine our talents for a truly unforgettable scheme!\\" And that day, in that dimly lit lair, a new camaraderie was born among the villains. No longer was it solely about defeating Wordgirl, but also about appreciating the hidden joys that came with their villainous shenanigans, even if it meant unknowingly purring like \\"The Butcher\\" Steak."},{"instruction":"以“庚续历史文脉，谱写时代华章”为主题，写一篇个人感想，要求1800字","output":"庚续历史文脉，谱写时代华章 当我凝视着历史长河中那庚辰年的同时，我真切地感受到了历史的延续和时代的变迁，也深刻地体会到了人类文明的传承和发展。庚续历史文脉，谱写时代华章，这一主题仿佛点燃了我的灵感之火，激发了我对历史的好奇心和热爱，也让我对自己的时代责任有了更加清晰的认识。 庚辰年，位于二十四节气中的“霜降”时期，正处于一个循环的结束和新纪元的开始。也正是在这个时间节点上，人类历史上发生了无数令人瞩目的事件和变革。无论是从政治、经济、文化还是科技等各个方面，庚辰年都是一个庞大历史体系的节点，整个人类历史也在这个节点上向前迈进了一步。 回首历史，从时间维度上看，庚辰年囊括了中国古代历史、世界中世纪时期和现代历史的重要节点。中国古代历史中，庚辰年见证了先秦时期的政治秩序的建立和儒家文化的兴盛；中世纪时期，庚辰年亦意味着欧洲农奴制度的解体和资本主义社会的兴起；在现代历史中，庚辰年记录了近代中国的洋务运动和国家独立战争，以及世界两次大战和各种国际协议的签署。在每一个庚辰年中，都发生了许多重大的历史事件和变革，这些事件和变革对于历史文脉的续写和时代华章的谱写起到了至关重要的作用。 除了时间维度，从文化维度上看，庚辰年也承担着文明的传承和创新的责任。每一个庚辰年都有自己的文化符号和精神内核，这些符号和内核不仅是对历史的回顾和启发，也是对未来的引导和期许。例如，在中国文化中，庚辰年被赋予了“全国团结进步日”的称号，进一步强调了团结和进步的重要性。在世界文化中，庚辰年也有着独特的象征意义，它代表着对困境的挑战和对未来的向往。无论是在中国还是在世界的文化领域中，庚辰年都有着属于自己的独特光彩和价值，它们丰富了历史的多样性，也激励着人们对未来的探索和奋进。 在这个以庚续历史文脉，谱写时代华章为主题的感想中，我也不能忽略对自己所处的时代的思考和认识。作为当代的一份子，我们有着独特的使命和责任。我们身处信息革命的时代，大数据、云计算、人工智能等科技的快速发展，正在深刻地改变着我们的生活方式和社会结构。在这个时代中，庚辰年的精神续写和时代华章的谱写，更需要我们每一个人的努力和担当，我们需要以积极的姿态去迎接和拥抱未知的未来。 作为当代人，我们需要借鉴历史的经验和智慧，保持对历史和文化的敬畏和热爱，通过不断学习和思考，传承和发展历史的文脉和人类的智慧。同时，我们也需要面对现实，理解当代社会的复杂性和多样性，以全新的视角和思维方式去解决现实问题，推动社会变革和科技创新。 在以庚续历史文脉，谱写时代华章为主题的感想中，我深刻地领悟到，历史不仅仅是一种过去的记录，更是我们未来前行的指南。庚辰年所蕴含的历史意义和文化打动着我，也激发了我对历史的学习和研究的兴趣。我相信，只有不断地汲取历史知识和文明智慧，我们才能续写历史的文脉，谱写属于我们这个时代的华章，为未来的世界贡献自己的一份力量。让我们怀着对历史的热爱和对未来的希望，共同谱写属于我们这个时代的壮丽篇章吧！"},{"instruction":"Write me a story about the Wordgirl villains hanging out when they notice Butcher unknowingly purring deeply while seemingly lost in thought","output":"Once upon a time in the bustling city of Fair City, a group of notorious villains gathered in their secret hideout known as the Evil Lair. This group consisted of Dr. Two-Brains, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, Lady Redundant Woman, and the Whammer. They were known far and wide as the formidable foes of WordGirl, the city's beloved superhero. On this particular day, the villains had gathered to discuss their next diabolical plan. As they were brainstorming, they suddenly noticed their fellow villain, Butcher, sitting quietly at the corner of the room, seemingly lost in thought. But what caught their attention even more was the unmistakable sound of purring echoing throughout the lair. Dr. Two-Brains peered at Butcher with curiosity and asked, \\"Hey Butcher, what's with the purring? Are you feeling alright?\\" Butcher snapped out of his thoughts, a bewildered expression on his face. \\"Purring? Oh, sorry, guys! I didn't even realize I was doing it.\\" He blushed and tried to hide his surprise, thinking his secret was out. Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy furrowed his brow. \\"Purring? That's unusual, even for you, Butcher. Mind sharing what you were thinking about that made you purr?\\" Reluctantly, Butcher decided to reveal his secret. \\"Alright, but keep in mind, this stays between us. I recently adopted a tiny, adorable kitten named Whiskers. Whenever I think about her, I can't help but get lost in a deep purring trance.\\" Whammer, with a mischievous grin, leaned forward and interjected, \\"Butcher, you softie! Who would've thought you had a soft spot for cute little kittens?\\" Butcher grumbled defensively, \\"I may enjoy a good villainous scheme, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate the love and companionship of a pet!\\" Lady Redundant Woman chuckled softly. \\"Well, Butcher, it seems even villains like us need some furry love to balance out our evil schemes.\\" Suddenly, a devious idea dawned on Dr. Two-Brains. With an evil glint in his eye, he exclaimed, \\"I have a perfect plan! WordGirl just can't resist a good distraction, especially if it involves her villains acting out of character. We use Butcher's purring as a diversion! While WordGirl is trying to figure out what's going on, we execute our master plan!\\" The villains all grinned wickedly, each one visualizing the chaos that would ensue with WordGirl's diverted attention. They knew that with this unexpected twist, their chances of success had just doubled. So, the villains set their plan into motion. Butcher continued to purr discreetly, unknowingly causing a ruckus in Fair City. Meanwhile, WordGirl, ever-vigilant, grew increasingly perplexed by the unusual behavior of her enemies. In the end, the villains' distraction worked like a charm, and they managed to execute their master plan under WordGirl's distracted gaze. The city trembled under their wicked scheme, but little did they know that their purring distraction would eventually lead to their undoing. WordGirl, using her quick wit and unparalleled powers of deduction, followed the source of the purring and discovered Butcher's secret. She realized that there was more to this diabolical plan than met the eye. With bravery and cunning, WordGirl turned the tables on the villains, thwarting their plans and ensuring peace and justice prevailed once again in Fair City. And so, the villains learned a valuable lesson that day: It's not just heroes who have secret soft spots. Love and companionship can soften even the most villainous hearts, reminding them that somewhere deep down, even in the darkest of places, there is a flicker of kindness."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Aunque la batalla resultó en una derrota para los Aliados, los soldados australianos y neozelandeses fueron elogiados por su coraje y determinación. La leyenda de Anzac se forjó a raíz de esta batalla sangrienta y sin éxito. La pregunta clave de investigación es: ¿Cómo influyeron las experiencias de los soldados ANZAC en la batalla en Gallipoli en el desarrollo de la leyenda de Anzac? Dos hipótesis que se explorarán son que los soldados ANZAC desarrollaron un sentido de orgullo y camaradería durante la batalla, y que la derrota en Gallipoli fue interpretada como un triunfo moral. Razón 1: Las experiencias de los soldados ANZAC en la batalla de Gallipoli ayudaron a forjar la leyenda de Anzac debido al sentido de orgullo y camaradería que desarrollaron. El poema \\"In Flanders Fields\\", escrito por el médico canadiense John McCrae, refleja la perspectiva de los soldados británicos y presenta a los soldados ANZAC como héroes que dieron su vida por su país. El poema, publicado en diciembre de 1915, se convirtió en un símbolo de conmemoración de los soldados caídos en la guerra. Además, las trincheras de la batalla de Gallipoli son un testimonio de las duras condiciones en las que lucharon los soldados ANZAC. Estas trincheras estrechas, húmedas y llenas de ratas expusieron a los soldados al fuego enemigo y a enfermedades. Las trincheras son una fuente arqueológica primaria que demuestra las experiencias reales de los soldados en la batalla. Razón 2: La derrota de los ANZAC en Gallipoli también contribuyó al desarrollo de la leyenda de Anzac, ya que fue interpretada como un triunfo moral. En el libro \\"ANZAC BOOK\\", escrito por Charles Bean, un corresponsal de guerra australiano, se puede observar cómo la batalla se convirtió en un evento simbólico para Australia. Bean describe a los soldados ANZAC como valientes y dispuestos a sacrificarse por su país. Además, la derrota en Gallipoli fortaleció el sentido de identidad nacional y el espíritu de camaradería entre los australianos y neozelandeses. A pesar del fracaso militar, los soldados ANZAC fueron elogiados por su coraje y determinación, y se creó un mito en torno a su lucha en Gallipoli. En conclusión, las experiencias de los soldados ANZAC en la batalla de Gallipoli desempeñaron un papel crucial en el desarrollo de la leyenda de Anzac. El sentido de orgullo y camaradería que surgieron durante la batalla, así como la interpretación de la derrota como un triunfo moral, contribuyeron a forjar la imagen de los ANZAC como héroes. Estas experiencias se reflejan en fuentes primarias como el poema \\"In Flanders Fields\\" y las trincheras de Gallipoli, así como en fuentes secundarias como el libro \\"ANZAC BOOK\\" de Charles Bean. La leyenda de Anzac continúa siendo un importante símbolo nacional en Australia y Nueva Zelanda, y ha dejado un legado duradero en la historia de ambos países. Este tema invita a reflexionar sobre el impacto de la guerra en la construcción de mitos y la formación de identidades nacionales."},{"instruction":"TOLONG BUAT IKLAN PEMADAM API UNTUK SAYA","output":"Judul: \\"Selamatkan Nyawa dengan Pemadam Api Super Efektif!\\" [Sorotan gambar api yang membakar dengan intensitas tinggi] [Cue musik yang dramatis dan membangkitkan semangat] Suara Narator: \\"Apakah Anda ingin melindungi rumah dan keluarga Anda dari bahaya tersembunyi yang tak terduga?

Comparar dois arquivos .wav para verificar se contêm palavras similares ou idênticas é tecnicamente viável, mas não é um processo direto nem é garantido que seja altamente preciso sem etapas cuidadosas de processamento e modelagem. A viabilidade e a precisão dependem em grande parte da abordagem utilizada e da qualidade dos dados de áudio. Aqui estão algumas abordagens comuns para a comparação de áudio: # 1. Comparação Direta de Formas de Onda Comparar dois arquivos .wav diretamente, ou seja, suas formas de onda, é geralmente não prático. Pequenos desvios na pronúncia, tempo, posição do microfone e ruído de fundo podem tornar formas de onda de palavras idênticas completamente diferentes aos olhos de um algoritmo simples de comparação. # 2. Reconhecimento de Voz e Comparação de Texto Usar um sistema de reconhecimento de voz para converter os audios .wav em texto e, em seguida, usar a comparação textual (idealmente, complementada com uma comparação fonética) é uma técnica viável. No entanto, como mencionado anteriormente, os sistemas de reconhecimento de voz tendem a contextualizar palavras, o que pode ser um problema para palavras isoladas. # 3. Comparação Fonética de Áudio Extrair características fonéticas ou espectrais do áudio e comparar essas características é um método mais robusto. Técnicas como MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), embeddings de áudio ou redes neurais especialmente treinadas podem omitir parte dos desvios, concentrando-se nas características que são mais discriminativas para a fala humana. dá ex de 3. Comparação Fonética de Áudio","output":"# Exemplos de Comparação Fonética de Áudio A) Extração de Características MFCC O Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) é um método popular para representar características de sinais de áudio, especialmente na fala. As etapas para comparar MFCCs de dois arquivos .wav são: 1. Pré-processamento: Pode incluir a normalização de volume, a remoção de ruído e a segmentação de voz. 2. Janelamento: Dividir o áudio em pequenos frames (geralmente de 20 a 40 ms de duração). 3. Aplicar a Transformada de Fourier para converter cada frame de áudio do domínio do tempo para o domínio da frequência. 4. Mapear o espectro de frequência para a escala Mel, que é uma escala perceptual de tons julgada por ouvintes para estar em intervalos iguais. 5. Calcular os logaritmos das energias nas bandas de Mel. 6. Aplicar a Transformada de Cosseno Discreta (DCT) para obter os coeficientes cepstrais, que são os MFCCs. 7. Os MFCCs da mesma palavra falada por diferentes pessoas ou em diferentes condições podem então ser comparados usando técnicas de reconhecimento de padrões, como k-NN, SVM ou DTW (Dynamic Time Warping). O DTW, em particular, é útil para alinhar sequências de dados que podem variar no tempo. B) Embelezamento de Áudio com Redes Neurais Profundas Redes neurais convolucionais (CNNs) ou redes recorrentes, como LSTMs, podem ser treinadas para identificar características exclusivas da fala. Estes passos descrevem sua aplicação: 1. Coleta de um grande conjunto de dados de amostras de áudio para treinar o modelo. 2. Preparação dos dados, que pode envolver a normalização do áudio, segmentação e talvez a geração de características MFCC ou outro representante. 3. Treinamento do modelo para gerar um \\"embedding\\" (uma representação vetorial compacta) de cada amostra de áudio. 4. Depois do treinamento, processar as amostras de áudio através da rede para obter seus embeddings. 5. Comparar os embeddings de diferentes amostras de áudio através da medição de distância, como a distância Euclidiana, distância de cosseno, ou outros métodos. C) Modelagem Baseada em Fonemas com HMM Os Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) são bastante utilizados em sistemas de reconhecimento de voz para modelar sequências de fonemas (unidades sonoras básicas da fala). Para usar HMMs para comparação: 1. Um HMM é treinado para cada fonema da linguagem usando um grande corpo de dados de fala rotulados. 2. O áudio para comparação é processado por um decodificador de fala que usa esses HMMs para identificar a sequência mais provável de fonemas no áudio. 3. Sequências de fonemas podem então ser comparadas entre as amostras de áudio usando uma medida de similaridade ou alinhamento, como o já mencionado DTW. Essas técnicas avançadas de comparação de áudio permitem que sistemas lidem com variações na pronúncia, velocidade da fala e ruídos de fundo de uma forma muito mais eficiente do que simples comparações de forma de onda. No entanto, elas requerem conhecimento especializado em processamento de sinais e machine learning, além de dados de qualidade para treinamento quando modelos de aprendizado de máquina são envolvidos."},{"instruction":"mostra em python como se pode A) Extração de Características MFCC","output":"A extração de características MFCC em Python pode ser realizada utilizando a biblioteca \`librosa\`, que é uma ferramenta poderosa para a análise de música e áudio. Segue um exemplo de como você pode extrair características MFCC de um arquivo WAV em Python: Primeiro, certifique-se de instalar \`librosa\` usando pip caso você ainda não tenha instalado: \`\`\`bash pip install librosa \`\`\` Agora, você pode usar o seguinte código para extrair o MFCC de um arquivo de áudio: \`\`\`python import librosa import librosa.display import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Carregar o arquivo de áudio filename = 'seu_arquivo.wav' audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(filename, sr=None) # sr (taxa de amostragem) como None para carregar a taxa de amostra original # Extrair os MFCCs mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13) # 13 é um número comum de coeficientes a serem extraídos # Exibir os MFCCs librosa.display.specshow(mfccs, sr=sample_rate, x_axis='time') plt.colorbar() plt.title('MFCC') plt.tight_layout() plt.show() # mfccs é um array numpy com forma (n_mfcc, timesteps) # Onde n_mfcc é o número de MFCCs que você extraiu por frame de tempo. # Agora, você poderia usar esse array para qualquer tipo de comparação de semelhança. \`\`\` Este script carrega seu arquivo de áudio, extrai os 13 primeiros coeficientes MFCC (que é padrão para muitas aplicações, mas você pode ajustar conforme necessário) e então plota os MFCCs com relação ao tempo. Os MFCCs são sensíveis à amplitude de entrada; portanto, em aplicações práticas onde a comparação entre diferentes arquivos de áudio é requerida, geralmente é uma boa prática normalizar os coeficientes antes de fazer a comparação. Lembre-se de que este é apenas o processo de extração de características MFCC. O uso dessas características para realizar comparações efetivas entre arquivos de áudio é uma etapa adicional que exigiria conhecimento de algoritmos de comparação de padrões e técnicas como Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) ou mesmo algoritmos de aprendizado de máquina."},{"instruction":"como podias comparar dois .wav","output":"Embora tenhamos examinado a possibilidade de extrair as características MFCC em arquivos WAV, para comparar efetivamente dois arquivos .wav necessitaremos utilizar uma técnica como Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) ou calcular a distância entre vetores de características. Abaixo será abordado como comparar dois arquivos WAV utilizando DTW. Para este exemplo, assumiremos que já extraímos os coeficientes MFCC para os dois arquivos que gostaríamos de comparar. Utilizaremos a biblioteca \`librosa\` para extrair MFCCs e a biblioteca \`fastdtw\`, que é uma implementação eficiente de DTW. Primeiro, certifique-se de que a biblioteca \`fastdtw\` esteja instalada: \`\`\`bash pip install fastdtw \`\`\` Agora, aqui está o código que compara dois arquivos .wav utilizando DTW: \`\`\`python import librosa from fastdtw import fastdtw from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean # Função para extrair MFCC do arquivo de áudio def extract_mfcc(filename): audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(filename, sr=None) mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13) return mfccs.T # Transposta para alinhar frames como linhas # Carregar e extrair MFCC para ambos os arquivos mfccs_1 = extract_mfcc('primeiro_arquivo.wav') mfccs_2 = extract_mfcc('segundo_arquivo.wav') # Utilizar DTW para calcular a distância entre as duas sequências de MFCC distance, path = fastdtw(mfccs_1, mfccs_2, dist=euclidean) print('A distância DTW entre os dois arquivos é:', distance) \`\`\` A função \`extract_mfcc\` realiza a extração de características MFCC de um arquivo de áudio, retornando uma matriz onde cada linha corresponde a um frame e cada coluna a um dos coeficientes MFCC. Após extrair o MFCC dos dois arquivos de áudio, calculamos a distância DTW entre as duas sequências de características usando \`fastdtw\`, que compara as séries temporais levando em consideração possíveis desvios no tempo. A distância retornada pelo DTW representa o custo total para alinhar os dois conjuntos de características MFCC. Valores menores de distância DTW implicam maior similaridade entre as gravações, enquanto valores maiores indicam menor similaridade. Para aplicações sensíveis ou com requisitos de alta precisão, pode ser necessário pré-processar os sinais de áudio, remover ruído, normalizar volumes, entre outros passos que ajudam a reduzir a variabilidade não relacionada com as palavras faladas. Também é possível utilizar modelos de aprendizado de máquina mais sofisticados para realizar a comparação, mas isso exigiria uma grande quantidade de dados rotulados para treinamento."},{"instruction":"python para pré-processar os sinais de áudio, remover ruído","output":"Pré-processar sinais de áudio e remover ruído podem ser operações complexas que dependem do tipo de ruído e das características do sinal de fala que você deseja preservar. Abaixo, vou compartilhar um exemplo básico usando a biblioteca \`noisereduce\` em Python, que é projetada para redução automática de ruído. Primeiro, você precisa instalar a biblioteca \`noisereduce\`: \`\`\`bash pip install noisereduce \`\`\` Depois de instalar a biblioteca, você pode usar o seguinte script para carregar um arquivo de áudio, realizar a redução de ruído e, em seguida, salvar o resultado: \`\`\`python import librosa import noisereduce as nr import soundfile as sf # Carregar arquivo de áudio original filename = 'seu_arquivo_original.wav' audio_data, sample_rate = librosa.load(filename, sr=None) # sr=None para manter a taxa de amostragem original # A função noisereduce automaticamente estima o ruído com base nos primeiros segundos do arquivo. # Esse comportamento pode ser personalizado para usar um clipe de ruído que você forneceu. # Realizar redução de ruído # 'audio_data' é o áudio com ruído, 'audio_data' é também usado para estimar o ruído padrão reduced_noise_audio = nr.reduce_noise(y=audio_data, sr=sample_rate) # Salvar arquivo de áudio processado output_filename = 'seu_arquivo_reduzido_de_ruido.wav' sf.write(output_filename, reduced_noise_audio, sample_rate) \`\`\` O exemplo acima supõe que há uma parte do áudio que contém apenas o ruído que você deseja remover e que está localizado no início do arquivo. Este ruído pode ser ruído de fundo constante, como o zumbido de um ar condicionado ou o ruído de um motor. Se o trecho de ruído não puder ser automaticamente estimado, você pode fornecer um trecho manualmente da seguinte forma: \`\`\`python # Assumindo que você tenha um trecho de áudio que contém apenas o ruído noise_clip = audio_data[0:10000] # Exemplo: usar os primeiros 10.000 samples para estimativa de ruído # Realizar redução de ruído usando o trecho de ruído fornecido reduced_noise_audio = nr.reduce_noise(y=audio_data, sr=sample_rate, noise_clip=noise_clip) \`\`\` Esse tratamento de sinal é bastante básico e pode não ser adequado para todos os casos de uso, especialmente se o ruído for não-estacionário ou se o sinal contiver componentes de fala que se sobrepõem em frequência ao ruído. Para esses casos, métodos mais avançados de processamento de sinal, como filtros adaptativos, redes neurais para separação de fonte, ou técnicas de processamento de áudio espacial poderiam ser necessários. Lembre-se de que a redução de ruído pode também inadvertidamente afetar a qualidade da fala. Você precisará ajustar os parâmetros do algoritmo de redução de ruído para encontrar um equilíbrio adequado entre a remoção do ruído e a preservação da fala."},{"instruction":"pyton para normalizar volumes, entre outros passos que ajudam a reduzir a variabilidade não relacionada com as palavras faladas.","output":"A normalização do volume de um áudio é um passo comum no pré-processamento de sinais de áudio para garantir que todos os clipes de áudio estejam na mesma escala de amplitude e reduzir a variabilidade não relacionada com o conteúdo falado. Uma técnica comum é ajustar o ganho de modo que o pico de amplitude ou a amplitude média (RMS) fique em um determinado nível. Podemos usar a biblioteca \`pydub\` para normalizar o volume dos arquivos de áudio. Primeiro, você deve instalá-la, juntamente com a \`ffmpeg\`, que é necessária para manipular os arquivos de áudio: \`\`\`bash pip install pydub \`\`\` Depois, você precisa instalar a \`ffmpeg\` para que a pydub funcione corretamente. Sua instalação varia conforme o sistema operacional, mas geralmente pode ser obtida através dos gerenciadores de pacote ou no site oficial do FFmpeg. Aqui está um exemplo básico de como normalizar o volume de um arquivo de áudio usando \`pydub\`: \`\`\`python from pydub import AudioSegment from pydub.playback import play # Carregar o arquivo de áudio file_path = \\"seu_arquivo.wav\\" audio = AudioSegment.from_file(file_path) # Normalizar o áudio para um pico determinado (em dBFS, decibéis relativo ao módulo máximo) normalized_audio = audio.normalize(headroom=0.1) # headroom é uma margem de segurança para evitar o clipping # Salvar o áudio normalizado normalized_audio.export(\\"audio_normalizado.wav\\", format=\\"wav\\") # Se você preferir normalizar o áudio pelo RMS target_dBFS = -20.0 # Define o nível RMS desejado change_in_dBFS = target_dBFS - audio.dBFS normalized_rms_audio = audio.apply_gain(change_in_dBFS) normalized_rms_audio.export(\\"audio_normalizado_rms.wav\\", format=\\"wav\\") \`\`\` - O método \`normalize()\` ajusta automaticamente o volume para que o pico seja \`headroom\` decibéis inferior ao máximo permitido sem distorção (clipping). - Para normalizar pelo RMS, calculamos a diferença entre o nível RMS atual e o alvo, e então aplicamos esse ganho. Outro passo comum é garantir que todos os arquivos estejam na mesma taxa de amostragem antes de quaisquer análises, o que é essencial para a comparação direta de recursos de áudio. Aqui está como você pode reamostrar um arquivo de áudio usando \`librosa\`: \`\`\`python import librosa import soundfile as sf # Reamostrar para uma taxa de amostragem desejada file_path = \\"seu_arquivo.wav\\" audio, sr = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None) # sr=None garantirá que a taxa de amostragem original seja mantida target_sr = 22050 # Defina a taxa de amostragem desejada, por exemplo, 22050 Hz audio_resampled = librosa.resample(audio, orig_sr=sr, target_sr=target_sr) # Salvar o arquivo reamostrado sf.write('audio_reamostrado.wav', audio_resampled, target_sr) \`\`\` Ao executar esses tipos de pré-processamentos você estará reduzindo as variações de volume e taxa de amostragem entre os diferentes arquivos de áudio, o que pode contribuir para uma comparação mais efetiva da informação de fala contida neles."},{"instruction":"poias mostrar python completo do que vimos para comparar dois arquivos .wav","output":"Vamos integrar todas as etapas discutidas anteriormente para criar um script Python completo.

Dr. Two-Brains, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, and The Whammer found themselves gathered at Becky Botsford's backyard, a temporary truce among them in search of some relaxation. As they sat around a picnic table under the summer sun, their usual evil demeanor faded away into friendly chatter. Laughter and conversation filled the air as they indulged in sandwiches and snacks, swapping anecdotes from their numerous encounters with Wordgirl. Little did they know, something quite odd was happening right under their noses. Deep in thought, Butcher, a towering man with a relentless scowl, sat quietly on a nearby porch swing, seemingly lost in his own world. His mind drifted away from plotting meat-related crimes as he contemplated the mysteries of life. Moments earlier, while reminiscing about a particularly flavorful sandwich, Butcher had unintentionally entered a relaxing state. Unbeknownst to him, a faint purring sound began emanating from his chest. The other villains couldn't help but notice, their curious gazes soon focused on the distracted beef enthusiast. Dr. Two-Brains, known for his intellectual prowess, was the first to remark, \\"Uh, guys, do you hear... purring? Is Butcher part feline or something?\\" Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy's eyebrows raised as he stopped mid-bite, saying, \\"Wow, if Butcher can purr with that menacing face of his, he'd make one intimidating cat.\\" Determined to investigate this spontaneous purring phenomenon, The Whammer, flexing his biceps, boldly declared, \\"I'll go investigate! Wham-pow!\\" The villainous trio approached Butcher cautiously, almost expecting an explosive revelation. But as they drew closer, they realized the truth was much more innocent than anticipated. \\"He's totally lost in his thoughts,\\" Dr. Two-Brains whispered, perplexed yet amused. Indeed, Butcher's low purring persisted as he kept swaying gently on the swing. His eyes remained closed, and he seemed completely unaware of the attention he had captured. The tranquil purring betrayed an unexpected softer side to the otherwise formidable villain. Curiosity eventually got the best of the villains, prompting Chuck to prod Butcher gently with his sandwich. \\"*Poke* So, Butcher, having sweet dreams about the finest cuts of meat?\\" Eyes flickering open, Butcher was momentarily startled, unsure how he had ended up in such a relaxed state. \\"What? No! Just thinking…about…things,\\" he stammered, his gruff voice now tinged with an undeniable hint of embarrassment. The Whammer smirked mischievously, wrapping an arm around Butcher's broad shoulders. \\"Aw, come on Butcher, even villains need a break sometimes. It's okay to let your guard down and purr like a wee kitty cat!\\" Butcher's scowl deepened, but a hint of a smile played at the corners of his lips. \\"Fine, you all caught me. Maybe it is a bit nice to relax every now and then. Just don't tell anyone else, got it?\\" The villains nodded, amused by this endearing revelation about their fearsome friend. They resumed their leisurely afternoon, appreciating the rare camaraderie that had flourished among them. From that day forward, the villains of Wordgirl would occasionally catch Butcher lost in thought, purring softly under the city's azure skies. And though they would always tease him about his newfound serenity, they also secretly admired him for allowing himself these peaceful moments. In Fair City, even villains could find solace, reminding everyone that sometimes even the unlikeliest of characters needed a moment to unwind and embrace their inner purr."},{"instruction":"The other villains decide to mess with Butcher a little bit more when they get back to their shared base, as Whammer starts petting him. To everyone's surprise, Butcher's pupils become blown and his purring suddenly gets even louder, his hands unconsciously kneading into his legs.","output":"Back at their shared base, a mischievous glint appeared in The Whammer's eyes as he couldn't resist the opportunity to mess with the unsuspecting Butcher a little bit more. Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy chuckled in anticipation, and Dr. Two-Brains couldn't help but be intrigued by Butcher's unexpected reaction. As Butcher entered the lair, still lost in thought, The Whammer approached him with a smirk. \\"Hey, Butcher, you seemed to enjoy the purring earlier. How about some more?\\" he suggested mischievously. Intrigued by the potential for even more amusement, The Whammer extended his hand and began softly petting Butcher's head. Almost immediately, something extraordinary happened. Butcher's piercing eyes, usually sharp and intense, dilated, his pupils blown wide with an unusual intensity. To the astonishment of everyone present, Butcher's purring escalated to a new level, echoing through the lair like a rumbling thunder. His large hands unconsciously began kneading against his own legs in a gentle, rhythmic motion. It was as if his inner feline had been awakened. The room fell into an awkward silence as the villains exchanged perplexed glances. Chuck couldn't help but blurt out, \\"Wait, is Butcher secretly part cat or something? This is getting weirder by the second!\\" Dr. Two-Brains, his scientific curiosity fully engaged, donned his special goggles to investigate. As he approached the purring Butcher, he waved a small device to gather data, trying to analyze the unexpected reactions. Butcher, blissfully unaware of the chaos he had caused, continued to enjoy this strangely soothing experience. His eyes fluttered closed, surrendering to the tranquil sensation of being petted, blissfully ignorant of the villains' fascination. Curiosity mixed with amusement, Dr. Two-Brains declared, \\"Fascinating! It appears that Butcher has an unusually strong reaction to being petted like a cat. Perhaps there's a dormant feline gene within him that evokes such an intense response.\\" Chuck raised an eyebrow, considering the implications. \\"So, if we pet Butcher, he becomes a purring powerhouse? Maybe we can use this to our advantage!\\" He grinned mischievously at the thought of controlling their formidable comrade with a simple rub behind the ears. With a disapproving glare, Butcher suddenly snapped out of his blissful trance, embarrassed to find himself the center of attention once again. \\"Enough! This is ridiculous! I'm not a cat!\\" As he proclaimed his annoyance, the purring ceased abruptly, and his pupils slowly returned to their usual piercing gaze. He crossed his arms defiantly, regaining his composure, determined not to let his vulnerability overshadow his intimidating presence. The other villains, seeing Butcher's discomfort, immediately relented, realizing that they had toyed with him enough. They chuckled, deciding to keep this newfound information between themselves, eager to maintain their shared secret. From that day forward, the villains would occasionally exchange knowing glances whenever a particularly stressful situation arose, silently acknowledging their secret weapon: Butcher's purring prowess. And though they would never exploit it openly, they knew they had discovered an unexpected side to their fearsome ally, a side that reminded them that even the toughest of villains could find moments of tranquility and comfort. Within the walls of their shared base, laughter and camaraderie prevailed, allowing even the most diabolical minds to appreciate the simple joys of a contented purr."},{"instruction":"Whammer, still curious, asks Butcher if he can see his hand for just a second. Confused, Butcher holds his hand out, and Whammer gently squeezes Butcher's fingers, watching on astonishiment as retractable claws are gently pushed into view.","output":"As the laughter subsided, their curiosity still lingered like a persistent itch. The Whammer, unable to resist his insatiable curiosity, approached Butcher cautiously. \\"Hey, Butcher, can I see your hand for just a second? I promise it won't be anything weird,\\" he asked, his voice filled with innocent fascination. Slightly confused, Butcher hesitated but eventually extended his hand, palms up, as if presenting a gift. His beefy fingers unfolded, and he looked to The Whammer with a mixture of skepticism and intrigue. Carefully, The Whammer took Butcher's massive hand into his own. As he gently squeezed, a sense of astonishment washed over him. Retractable claws, like those of a predator, emerged from the tips of Butcher's fingers, just barely pushing past his skin. Eyes widening, The Whammer could barely contain his excitement. \\"Whoa! Butcher, you have retractable claws! That's incredible! You really are part feline!\\" Butcher, taken aback by the unexpected revelation, couldn't help but feel a mix of surprise and pride. \\"I never knew about this,\\" he mused, inspecting his claws with both awe and wariness. \\"Guess there's more to me than just being an expert in meat.\\" Dr. Two-Brains, always the scientist, approached to examine the situation. His eyes sparkled with intrigue as he analyzed Butcher's retractable claws. \\"Fascinating! This could explain your previous purring reaction, Butcher. Perhaps your feline genetics are more pronounced than we realized.\\" Chuck, eager to join in on the discovery, offered a sandwich to Butcher, almost as a peace offering. \\"Hey, Butcher, want to try slicing this sandwich with those impressive claws of yours? It could be your signature sandwich-slicing technique!\\" Butcher smirked, his pride rising at the suggestion. He easily sliced the sandwich in one swift motion, displaying the finesse and precision of a true carnivorous predator. The villains marveled at his newfound skill, recognizing the potential it held for their future endeavors. Realizing the significance of this discovery, Butcher couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of identity. No longer just the menacing butcher, he now possessed unique qualities that set him apart from his fellow villains. The evolving realization filled him with a sense of pride and newfound purpose. From that day forward, the villains of Wordgirl regarded Butcher with a newfound respect, intrigued by his hidden capabilities. They knew that his purring and retractable claws were a secret, an advantage they could use to their advantage while remaining hidden from the prying eyes of Wordgirl. With their shared secret intact, the villains returned to their nefarious plotting, a renewed sense of unity and curiosity born from the discovery of their comrade's feline nature. Together, they would continue their villainous endeavors, knowing that they possessed a unique ally in Butcher. And that, perhaps, the most unexpected secrets held the greatest potential for mischief and triumph."},{"instruction":"The villains all decide to figure out where Butcher's cat-like nature comes from and discover that Butcher's mom was also a villain, the ferocious Lady Lioness. Butcher, who never got to actually meet his mom as she died when he was extremely little, stares at the screen in actual bewilderment.","output":"The revelation that Butcher's cat-like nature and retractable claws hinted at a connection to his mother left the villains stunned. Driven by a newfound curiosity, they embarked on a quest to uncover the truth about Butcher's past. Using their collective resources and expertise, the trio delved into archives, research papers, and secret villain databases, determined to uncover any trace of Lady Lioness. Days turned into weeks as they tirelessly pieced together the story of Butcher's ancestry. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they came across a faded photograph that sent shivers down their spines. It showed a fierce, regal woman with unmistakable similarities to Butcher. This was Lady Lioness, Butcher's mother. As the villains gathered around, excitement and anticipation filled the air. Carefully, they shared the photograph with Butcher, who stared at the image in complete bewilderment. Those piercing eyes, that strong jawline, and even a hint of a proud smile—everything about Lady Lioness mirrored Butcher's features. He couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotions, his heart aching with the realization that he had never known his own mother. Lady Lioness had been a fierce and formidable villain in her era, known for her cunning, strength, and feline grace. But her life was tragically cut short while Butcher was still just a cub. Butcher's response was a mix of shock, confusion, and a hint of longing. He rubbed his fingers over the worn photograph, as if trying to capture a piece of his mother's essence. \\"I never knew...,\\" he murmured, his typically gruff voice filled with a rare vulnerability. \\"I would have loved to meet her.\\" The Whammer, typically known for his brawn rather than his emotional sensitivity, awkwardly placed a hand on Butcher's shoulder. \\"Butcher, you may not have had the chance to meet her, but her legacy lives on within you. Lady Lioness would be proud of the villain you've become.\\" Chuck, always more attuned to emotional nuances than he let on, offered a comforting smile. \\"Yeah, Butcher, you've got feline ferocity running through your veins. And don't worry, we've got your back if you ever need a little extra feline flair in your schemes!\\" Dr. Two-Brains, his intellect sharpened by the weight of the revelation, spoke with a newfound sense of empathy. \\"Butcher, sometimes our origins shape us in ways we can't fully grasp. Take what you've learned about Lady Lioness, embrace it, and let it inspire you to channel her strength and cunning.\\" Taking a deep breath, Butcher nodded, a mix of pride and determination shining through. \\"You're right. My mother's legacy lives within me, and I won't waste it. I will honor her memory by becoming the fiercest and most cunning villain I can be.\\" With that, the villains stood united, ready to support Butcher on his journey of self-discovery. Lady Lioness may have been lost to time, but her spirit would forever live on within Butcher, molding him into a fierce and formidable adversary for Wordgirl. And as they continued their villainous escapades, the bond among the villains grew stronger. Butcher, once a solitary force, now had a connection to his past, a lineage that intertwined with the lives of his unlikely companions. Together, they would forge ahead, reminding each other that even in the twisted world of villains, the ties that bind can bring solace, strength, and a sense of belonging."},{"instruction":"During a heist gone awry, the villains all have to bolt out of the building, Butcher instinctually (and in a slight panic thanks to the blaring alarms) running on all fours with his claws bared and eyes slitted. He's surprisingly fast like this.","output":"As the heist took an unexpected turn, alarms blared throughout the building, warning of impending danger. Panic settled in, and the villains sprang into action, their survival instincts kicking in. Butcher, overtaken by a surge of adrenaline and with his feline nature deep within, instinctually dropped to all fours. His muscles rippled beneath his clothes as his piercing eyes slitted, focusing only on escaping the premises of the heist gone awry. Without thinking, Butcher ran with a newfound agility and speed, surprising even himself. His retractable claws glinted ominously, ready to fend off anything that came in his path. The villains, caught off guard by his sudden transformation, struggled to keep pace with him. Dr. Two-Brains managed to catch up, his pace fueled by sheer curiosity. Observing Butcher's remarkable speed and grace, he marveled, \\"By the cheese curds, Butcher! Your feline instincts have given you a burst of speed!\\" Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, panting as he followed behind, added with a mix of awe and exhaustion, \\"Well, this is an unexpected turn of events. Butcher, you're like a big, unstoppable feline force!\\" Butcher's heart raced along with his footsteps as he sprinted through corridors, deftly maneuvering past obstacles. The echoes of his ferocious growls mingled with the blaring alarms, adding an extra layer of intimidation to their chaotic escape. Finally, they burst through the building's doors and into the night, the cool breeze providing a momentary respite. As the adrenaline subsided, Butcher's slitted eyes widened, his senses returning to their normal state. He stopped in his tracks, his breathing heavy, and slowly rose onto two legs, regaining his composure. The villains, gathering around Butcher, exchanged glances filled with both awe and amazement. Chuck's voice quivered with excitement, \\"Butcher, that was incredible! I've never seen anyone move so fast!\\" Butcher, the hint of a smile playing at the corners of his lips, acknowledged his unexpected display of feline prowess. \\"I guess the instincts run deeper than I realized. Who would have thought?\\" he mused, still catching his breath. With renewed respect, the villains marveled at Butcher's hidden abilities, recognizing that his feline nature was more than just a coincidence. They understood that his mysterious connection to his mother, Lady Lioness, had granted him a unique advantage, infusing him with the grace and quickness of a formidable predator. From that moment, Butcher's feline agility became both a secret weapon and a symbol of his untamed spirit. And as the villains regrouped and continued their pursuit of mayhem and villainy, they couldn't help but wonder what other surprises lurked within their most enigmatic comrade.

What DNA sequence elements are required for expression of a cloned gene in a prokaryotic host? 2. What is a strong promoter? Why is a strong promoter not always desirable for expression of a cloned gene? 3. What is a regulatable promoter? How is the E. coli lac promoter used to regulate the expression of a cloned gene?","output":"1. **Prokaryotic Gene Expression Requirements:** For expression of a cloned gene in a prokaryotic host, several DNA sequence elements are essential. These include: - **Promoter:** A DNA sequence that signals the RNA polymerase where to begin transcription. In prokaryotes, common promoter sequences recognized by sigma factors include the -35 and -10 consensus sequences (relative to the transcription start site). - **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) or Shine-Dalgarno Sequence:** Located a few nucleotides upstream of the start codon, this sequence is important for the binding of the ribosome to the mRNA for translation initiation. - **Start Codon (AUG):** This codon signals the start of protein synthesis. - **Coding Sequence:** The actual genetic sequence of the cloned gene that encodes the amino acid sequence of the protein to be expressed. - **Termination Codon:** A sequence of three nucleotides that signals the end of protein synthesis (UAA, UAG, UGA). - **Transcription Terminator:** A sequence that signals RNA polymerase to stop transcription, thus defining the end of the transcript. 2. **Strong Promoter:** A strong promoter is one that has a high affinity for RNA polymerase and/or the necessary transcription factors, resulting in a high level of transcription initiation. In other words, it is a promoter that can drive robust expression of the gene it regulates. A strong promoter is not always desirable for expression of a cloned gene because: - **Overexpression Toxicity:** High levels of a protein can be toxic to the host cell or may interfere with its normal metabolism. - **Resource Depletion:** Overexpression can deplete cellular resources, like nucleotides and amino acids, affecting cell growth and other cellular functions. - **Inefficient Protein Folding:** Overexpressed proteins may not fold correctly, leading to inclusion bodies and loss of protein function. - **Metabolic Burden:** Producing high levels of a foreign protein can impose a significant metabolic burden on the cell, which can impair growth and lead to cell death. 3. **Regulatable Promoter:** A regulatable (or inducible) promoter is one that can be switched on or off in response to specific environmental signals or molecules. The *E. coli* lac promoter is an excellent example of a regulatable promoter. The lac promoter is normally off in the presence of glucose (due to catabolite repression). When glucose is not present, but lactose or an analog like isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is available, the lac repressor protein that normally blocks transcription from the lac promoter is released, allowing transcription to begin. This system can thus be used to regulate the expression of a cloned gene in the following way: - In the absence of an inducer (such as lactose or IPTG), the lac repressor binds to the operator sequence located near the lac promoter, preventing transcription of the downstream gene. - When the inducer is added, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator. - This removal of the repressor allows RNA polymerase to access the promoter and initiate transcription of the cloned gene. This allows precise control over the timing and level of gene expression, which is highly advantageous for studying gene function and protein production."},{"instruction":"한글로 설명해줘 그리고 앞으로도","output":"물론입니다. 앞으로도 한글로 답변 드리겠습니다. 1. **원핵생물 기주에서 클론된 유전자의 발현에 필요한 DNA 서열 요소들:** 클론된 유전자가 원핵생물 내에서 발현되기 위해서는 몇 가지 DNA 서열 요소가 필수적입니다. 이들은 다음과 같습니다. - **프로모터:** RNA 폴리머레이즈가 전사를 시작할 위치를 알려주는 DNA 서열입니다. 원핵생물에서는 시그마 인자가 인식하는 일반적인 프로모터 서열에는 전사 시작 지점으로부터 상류 방향의 -35 및 -10 합의 서열이 포함됩니다. - **리보솜 결합 부위 (RBS) 또는 샤인-달가노 서열:** 시작 코돈을 기준으로 몇 개의 뉴클레오타이드 상류에 위치한 이 서열은 mRNA에 리보솜이 결합하고 번역을 시작하는 데 중요합니다. - **시작 코돈 (AUG):** 이 코돈은 단백질 합성을 시작하는 신호입니다. - **부호화 서열:** 실제로 단백질을 인코딩하는 아미노산 서열을 암호화하는 클론된 유전자의 유전자 서열입니다. - **종결 코돈:** 단백질 합성이 끝나는 신호인 세 개의 뉴클레오타이드 서열입니다 (UAA, UAG, UGA). - **전사 종결자:** RNA 폴리머레이즈가 전사를 멈추게 하여, 전사본의 끝을 정의하는 서열입니다. 2. **강력한 프로모터:** 강력한 프로모터란 RNA 폴리머레이즈나 필요한 전사 인자가 높은 친화도를 가지며 이로 인해 높은 수준의 전사 시작을 유도하는 프로모터를 말합니다. 즉, 강력한 프로모터는 유전자가 조절하는 단백질의 높은 수준의 발현을 유도할 수 있습니다. 그러나 강력한 프로모터가 항상 클론된 유전자의 발현에 이상적이지는 않습니다. 그 이유는 다음과 같습니다. - **과발현 독성:** 단백질의 높은 수준의 발현은 기주 세포에 독성을 줄 수 있거나 정상적인 대사에 방해가 될 수 있습니다. - **자원 고갈:** 과발현은 세포의 뉴클레오타이드와 아미노산 같은 세포 자원을 고갈시켜 세포 성장 및 다른 세포 기능에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. - **비효율적 단백질 접힘:** 과발현된 단백질은 올바르게 접히지 않아 포함체(Inclusion bodies) 형성 및 단백질 기능 상실을 초래할 수 있습니다. - **대사 부담:** 외래 단백질을 높은 수준으로 생산하는 것은 세포에 상당한 대사 부담을 줄 수 있으며, 이는 세포 성장을 저해하고 세포사를 유도할 수 있습니다. 3. **조절 가능한 프로모터:** 조절 가능한 (또는 유도 가능한) 프로모터는 특정 환경 신호나 분자에 반응하여 켜지거나 꺼질 수 있는 프로모터입니다. *E. coli*의 락 프로모터는 조절 가능한 프로모터의 우수한 예입니다. 락 프로모터는 일반적으로 포도당이 존재하는 상태에서는 꺼져 있습니다 (분해 대사 억제 때문에). 포도당이 없고 락토오스나 IPTG 같은 유도체가 사용 가능할 때, 락 리프레서 단백질이 락 프로모터에서 전사를 막는 것을 해제하여 전사를 시작하게 합니다. 이 체계는 클론된 유전자의 발현을 조절하기 위해 다음과 같이 사용될 수 있습니다: - 유도체가 없는 상태에서 락 리프레서는 락 프로모터 근처의 조작자 부위에 결합하여 하류 유전자의 전사를 방지합니다. - 유도체가 추가되면, 유도체는 리프레서에 결합하여 리프레서의 구조 변화를 일으키고, 이 변화는 리프레서가 조작자에 결합하는 것을 방지합니다. - 리프레서가 제거되면 RNA 폴리머레이즈가 프로모터에 접근하여 클론된 유전자의 전사를 시작할 수 있습니다. 이 방법은 유전자 기능 연구 및 단백질 생산을 위해 유전자 발현의 타이밍과 수준을 정밀하게 제어하는 데 매우 유리합니다."},{"instruction":"4.

В течение этих столетий происходили значительные политические, социальные и культурные изменения, которые сильно повлияли на ход развития Российского государства. В 16 веке Россия была разделена на множество феодальных владений, правителей которых называли князьями. Однако Великое княжество Московское постепенно становилось доминирующей силой в регионе. Иван III (1462-1505) и его сын Василий III (1505-1533) провели важные реформы, чтобы укрепить центральную власть и объединить русских землевладельцев. Они мирно захватили несколько соседних княжеств и подчинили себе восточные и северные земли. Таким образом, произошло формирование Русского централизованного государства. Одним из ключевых событий 16 века было падение Константинополя в 1453 году. Это привело к тому, что Москва, которая считала себя преемницей Византийской Империи и православной религии, должна была столкнуться с Римско-Католической церковью и османским влиянием. Церковь играла важную роль в жизни русских людей, и этот конфликт усилил национальное сознание и самосознание русского народа. В 17 веке Россия столкнулась с серьезными внутренними и внешними проблемами. Борьба за власть между двумя периодами - Смутного времени и Смоленском времени - привела к внутренним конфликтам и вольным характерам власти. В это время Россия также столкнулась с серьезными внешними угрозами со стороны шведов, поляков и татар. Первая половина 17 века, известная как Смутное время (с 1598 по 1613 год), была временем политической и социальной нестабильности. После смерти Федора Иоанновича (1598-1605) на трон пришли лжедмитрии – лжепретенденты, претендующие на роль Ивана Грозного. Это привело к междоусобным войнам и насилию в стране. Ситуация усугубилась также из-за политической и экономической разрухи, пожаров и эпидемий. В 1613 году Михаил Федорович Романов стал новым царём России, что отмечает начало династии Романовых, которая правила Россией вплоть до 1917 года. Вторая половина 17 века, известная как Смоленское время, ознаменовалась военными конфликтами с Польшей и Швецией. В результате Битвы при Клюсцхофе (1610) польские войска захватили Москву и установили на престол Владислава, сына короля Польши и великого князя Литовского Сигизмунда III Вазы. Это привело к продолжительной войне между Россией и Польшей, известной как Смоленская война (1632 года - 1634 года), в результате которой часть северо-западных русских земель была отдана Польше. С одной стороны, Смутное и Смоленское время были периодами внутренних трудностей и конфликтов. С другой стороны, эти события привели к вынужденным переменам и реформам, которые помогли укрепить центральную власть и способствовали дальнейшему развитию России. Также стоит отметить, что 17 и 16 века были временем активной культурной деятельности в России. В это время были созданы важные литературные произведения, например, \\"Слово о полку Игореве\\", и произошли значительные развития в иконописи и архитектуре. Был основан Московский Университет (1755), первый высшее учебное заведение в России. Таким образом, 17 и 16 века в российской истории - это времена перемен и вызовов, когда Россия столкнулась с внутренними и внешними угрозами, но все же смогла укрепить свою позицию и получить знаменательные достижения в различных сферах. Эти столетия оставили непередаваемый след в истории и культуре страны."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Yuri should’ve been here by now!” Sayori: “I know, it’s so unlike her to be late. Do you think something happened?” Natsuki: (rolls her eyes) “Don’t tell me you’re getting worried, Monika. It’s just Yuri being Yuri, probably drowning in her books or something.” Monika: “Well, I can’t help but worry. We’re supposed to be discussing our upcoming poetry session today.” Sayori: “You’re right, Monika. We can’t start without her.” (Meanwhile, at Yuri’s place…) Yuri: (starting to have contractions) “Ah. Ah! Oh, it’s coming!” (In the midst of her contractions, Yuri frantically grabs her phone and dials Monika’s number) Yuri: (panicked) “Monika! It-it’s happening! I think…I think I’m going into labor!” Monika: (concerned) “Yuri?! Oh no, stay calm, I’ll be right there! Just breathe and try to time your contractions!” (As Yuri hangs up and gathers her things, the pain intensifies with each passing moment. She fumbles to unlock her front door, barely managing to step outside before her water breaks) Yuri: “Oh no…it’s really coming now! I’ve got to hurry to the clubroom!” (Meanwhile, back at the clubroom…) Sayori: “Do you think maybe we should go check on Yuri? She’s never been this late before.” Natsuki: (sighs) “Fine, I’ll go with you. But she better have a good reason for holding up our meeting.” (Just as Sayori and Natsuki are about to leave the room, the door bursts open and Yuri stumbles in, clearly in pain.)

Is there anyone present who has experience with childbirth?” Natsuki: “I don’t know anything about this stuff! What do we do?” Sayori: “I…I remember my mom telling me a little bit about childbirth. I think we need to make sure Yuri stays as calm as possible and have her breathe through the contractions.” Monika: “That’s right. Deep breaths, Yuri. You’re doing great. Just focus on your breathing and try to relax as best you can.” (Yuri tries her best to follow their instructions, her face strained with pain.
