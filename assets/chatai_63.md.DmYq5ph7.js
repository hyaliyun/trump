A domino consists of two adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically. The way to do this is to take every pair of adjacent cells and consider them as one domino, as indicated by the thick lines in the reference figure. Essentially, this division ensures that the entire board is covered without any overlaps and gaps. 2. **Second Player's Strategy**:     The key to understanding why the first player cannot always win lies in the second player's response strategy.     - Whenever the first player places a mark (either a × or an o) in any cell of a domino, the second player will immediately place his mark in the other cell of the same domino. 3. **Prohibition of Forming a 2 times 2 Square**:     Consider the consequence of this strategy:     - Each 2 times 2 square on the checkerboard contains exactly two dominoes (four cells).     - Since the second player always responds within the same domino, each domino will contain both player's marks. Hence, any 2 times 2 square will necessarily contain cells from at least two different dominoes. 4. **Impossibility of Winning for the First Player**:     - If the first player aims to fill a 2 times 2 square with their marks (all × or all o), they will be hindered by the second player who is always marking the other cell of each domino.      - Therefore, in any 2 times 2 square, at least one cell must belong to the second player by this strategy. This prevents the first player from filling a complete 2 times 2 square with their symbols, whether × or o. # Conclusion: By using the strategy of responding within the same domino, the second player ensures that it is impossible for the first player to achieve a 2 times 2 square filled with their symbols.

A smaller (k^{2}) actually corresponds to a lower degree of confidence in asserting a relationship between (X) and (Y). Hence, proposition 3 is incorrect. 4. Let's verify proposition 4. For a standard normal random variable (X sim N(0, 1)), we are interested in the probability that (|X| < 1). By symmetry of the standard normal distribution, we know that the probabilities are equal on both sides of the mean (zero). Let's denote (P(|X| < 1) = p). We have: [ P(X > 1) = P(X < -1) = frac{1 - p}{2} ] Therefore, the probability that (X < 1) is: [ P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X > 1) = 1 - frac{1 - p}{2} = frac{1 + p}{2} ] Hence, we obtain: [ 2P(X < 1) - 1 = 2left(frac{1 + p}{2}right) - 1 = p ] This means that (P(|X| < 1) = 2P(X < 1) - 1), which verifies that proposition 4 is correct.

(blacksquare) 2. **Claim:** ( k > leftlceil frac{3n}{2} rightrceil )    **Proof:** For even (n), consider taking     [    underbrace{AAdots A}_{frac{n}{2} text{ times}}underbrace{BB dots B}_{frac{n}{2} text{ times}}underbrace{AA dots A}_{frac{n}{2} text{ times}}underbrace{BB dots B}_{frac{n}{2} text{ times}}    ]    This clearly fails for (k geq frac{3n}{2} + 1).

(blacksquare) 3. Now it suffices to show that all (k in left[n, leftlceil frac{3n}{2} rightrceilright]) work, for arbitrary (n). Assume we have a string of (A) and (B) characters, and that there are no (n) consecutive (A) characters.     The key insights are:    - The maximal length of a string of (A) characters, and similarly of (B) characters, never decreases.    - The number of \\"breaks\\" in the string, namely places where we toggle between (A) and (B) characters such as (dots AB dots) will decrease each turn. 4. The first bullet follows trivially. If the second bullet always holds, we are done. Thus assume that we reach a state where they are always constant. However, note that whenever the chain containing the (k)-th element is removed, say a (B) chain, and appended to the front of the string, two separate (A) blocks combine, unless the (B) string is the last string in the sequence. Namely, to ensure that the number of \\"breaks\\" do not decrease in a turn, we must have a string of the form,    [    underbrace{AAdots A}_{c_1 text{ times}} underbrace{BB dots B}_{c_2 text{ times}} dots underbrace{AA dots A}_{c_{ell - 1} text{ times}} underbrace{BB dots B}_{c_ell text{ times}}    ] 5. However, then from our bounds on (k), we find that we must have at least (leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil + 1 leq c_ell). Now in the next \\"position\\" we find that we have,    [    underbrace{BB dots B}_{c_ell text{ times}} underbrace{AAdots A}_{c_1 text{ times}} underbrace{BB dots B}_{c_2 text{ times}} dots underbrace{AA dots A}_{c_{ell - 1} text{ times}}    ] 6. Now assuming that there are no reductions in the number of \\"breakpoints,\\" we find that (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 leq c_{ell-1}). Thus for any (c_i), we may show a similar bound. However, this then implies (ell < 4) or that we only have 3 main strings. Thus we have reduced the problem to,    [    underbrace{AA dots A}_{c_1 text{ times}} underbrace{BB dots B}_{c_2 text{ times}} underbrace{AA dots A}_{c_3 text{ times}}    ]    where each (c_i geq leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil + 1).

We know that there are 30 happy children in total, and since there are 4 sad girls, there must be 10 - 4 = 6 sad boys (SB). Now, since there are 18 boys in total and 6 of them are sad, there must be 18 - 6 = 12 boys who are not sad. These boys could either be happy or neither happy nor sad. We also know that there are 30 happy children in total, and since 4 of the sad children are girls, the rest of the happy children must be boys or girls who are neither sad nor happy. Since there are 42 girls in total and 4 of them are sad, there are 42 - 4 = 38 girls who are not sad. These girls could either be happy or neither happy nor sad. Now, we need to find out how many of the 38 girls who are not sad are happy. Since there are 30 happy children in total and we have already accounted for the 4 sad girls, we have 30 - 4 = 26 children who are happy and not sad. Out of these 26 happy children, we need to subtract the number of happy girls to find the number of happy boys. Since we don't have the exact number of happy girls, we can only say that the number of happy boys (HB) is equal to the total number of happy children (30) minus the number of happy girls. However, we do know that the number of boys who are not sad is 12, and since these boys could either be happy or neither happy nor sad, the maximum number of happy boys can be 12.

Label these lines as a, b, c, d, and k.    - Ensure that the pairs of lines a-c and b-d are symmetric with respect to k. 3. **Analyzing Symmetry:**    - Since a and c are symmetric to b and d, we consider two cases:      - Case 1: The lines overlap, resulting in an area that can become arbitrarily small.      - Case 2: The lines a and c enclose b and d. Without loss of generality, assume b is closer to a than d. 4. **Construct Initial Rectangle:**    - Define the lines such that a and c enclose b and d.    - Let any rectangle T=A_1B_1C_1D_1 be given, fulfilling all conditions set.     - Since b is between a and d, line A_1D_1 intersects b, labeled as B_2, and intersects c labeled as C_2. 5. **Preserve Area by Rearranging Segments:**    - By removing triangle A_1B_1B_2 from T and attaching the congruent triangle C_1C_2D_1, the area remains unchanged.    - This shifts the rectangle to a configuration involving B_1B_2. 6. **Minimize the Rectangle’s Area:**    - The area of T is given by      [      t = m cdot B_1B_2      ]      where m is the distance between the lines b and c.    - To minimize the area, minimize the length of B_1B_2. 7. **Symmetry and Minimization:**    - The mid-point of B_1B_2 is used to reflect point A_1, creating point A_2:      [      B_1B_2 = A_1A_2      ]    - Line a reflected about b gives line a_2.

We'll prove a more general statement:  Given a set S of points, where the set S includes the origin (0,0) and is invariant under a 90^{circ} rotation, the first player can always guarantee a win.  **Step-by-Step Proof:** 1. **Base Case**:     - If n = 1, i.e., only one point O(0,0), the first player wins immediately by taking the piece and erasing the only point. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**:     - Assume the proposition is true for any set of n points, i.e., the first player can always guarantee a win for any set S with n points satisfying the conditions. 3. **Inductive Step**:     - Consider that the set S has n+1 points and satisfies the given conditions. We need to show the first player can force a win. 4. **Analyzing the Distances**:     - Consider the lengths of all segments (defined as the straight line joining any two points in S).     - Let d be the maximum of such lengths, and let A_1B_1, A_2B_2, ..., A_kB_k be all the segments of length d. 5. **Rotational Invariance and Elimination**:     - Note that the origin O cannot be one end of these segments. If O was an end of a segment of length d, the segment would not be lengthed d due to rotation properties as OA < sqrt{2}RA where RA = other end of the segment.     - Eliminate the points involved in these maximal segments. Let the resulting set be S'. This S' satisfies the invariance under 90^{circ} rotation and contains fewer points. 6. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis**:     - By the inductive hypothesis, for the set S' (fewer points compared to S), the first player can guarantee a win. 7. **Winning Strategy for the Original Set S**:      - The first player plays according to the winning strategy in S' until the second player makes a move that transfers the game piece into one of the points removed to form S', say A_i.     - At that moment, the first player can move the game piece to B_i (the point originally connected to A_i by a segment of length d). This move is still legal as |A_i B_i|= d and previous moves were less than this length. 8. **Conclusion**:     - After moving to B_i, there's no larger segment left for the second player to move legally as the maximal length d has been eliminated by construction.     - Hence, the second player cannot make a longer move, ensuring the first player's win in the game. Thus, the first player can always ensure a win, no matter how the second player plays, when starting with a set of points with the properties described (containing the origin and invariant under rotation by 90 degrees).

We start by analyzing the given problem where we need to arrange the numbers (1, 2, 4, text{and} 8) in such a way that the sum of any two adjacent numbers is divisible by 3 but not by 9. 2. We note that:    - (1 + 2 = 3) (divisible by 3),    - (8 + 4 = 12) (divisible by 3),    - (2 + 4) is not necessarily applicable directly in this context (it equals 6, divisible by 3, but could impact other choices). 3. We need to prove that the solution should be of the form (6 + 2k) where (k) is a non-negative integer.  Analysis for Minimal Answer: 4. The minimal arrangement we can verify is 6:    - **Reasoning**: Around number 1, 2 can be placed. Similarly, around number 8, 4 can be placed. Hence, a possible configuration is:      [      1, 2, 1, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8      ]      However, this pattern observes minimal solution combinations that may not be universal without more samples.

Prove that the second player has a winning strategy.","output":":  1. **Introducing the Concept of a Trap:**    The key idea in this problem is the formation of a construct known as a trap. A trap is a configuration that looks like this:    [    S square square S    ]    Here, square represents a blank square. The idea is that any player who plays in one of the blank squares within the trap is at a disadvantage, since the opponent can then complete the sequence to form \\"SOS\\" and win the game. 2. **First Key Claim:**    The second player can force a trap to exist, thereby preventing the game from ending in a draw. 3. **Proof of the First Claim:**    - On the second player's first turn, they can place an S far enough from the edges of the board and sufficiently distanced from the first player's initial move. This initial S sets up the potential for traps across the board. 4. **Second Key Claim:**    The second player always has a move which prevents her from losing. 5. **Proof of the Second Claim:**    - Consider the second player's turn. At this point, there is an odd number of empty squares remaining on the board.    - Among these squares, there exists at least one square that has either two filled or two empty neighboring squares.    - The second player can always place an O in such a square, ensuring that no immediate threat is posed. 6. **Strategic Moves and Explanation:**    - If the second player consistently places Os strategically to avoid creating \\"SOS\\" for the first player while also setting up potential traps, they force the first player to eventually succumb to one of the traps or to be unable to form an \\"SOS\\". 7. **Conclusion of the Original Proof:**    By forcing the creation of traps and using strategic placements, the second player can secure a winning strategy. Essentially, the second player forces the first player into positions where their moves are inevitably futile or lead to their loss due to traps. 8. **Remark and Further Analysis:**    - The only way to lose is by being forced to play inside a trap.    - If a player plays in a cell c and loses, it implies that c must have been adjacent to exactly one S with another blank cell next to it.    - If the second player places an S and this doesn't form an immediate \\"SOS\\", the trap logic ensures that the move's consequence can be managed.    - Ultimately, since the second player only deals with an even number of blank cells and the nature of traps, this ensures their strategy leads to a win every time on a 1 times 2000 board. 9. **Generalization:**    For any 1 times n grid:    - If n is odd, the first player has a winning strategy.    - If n is even, the second player has a winning strategy. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The second player has a winning strategy for a 1 times 2000 board.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Define two operations for any real numbers a, b, and a positive integer k:  1. a oplus b = kcdotmax(a, b) 2. a ominus b = min(a^2, b^2) Determine if the following statements are true: textbf{(1)} a oplus b = b oplus a textbf{(2)} a oplus (b oplus c) = (a oplus b) oplus c textbf{(3)} a ominus (b oplus c) = (a ominus b) oplus (a ominus c) textbf{(A)} (1)text{ only} textbf{(B)} (2)text{ only} textbf{(C)} text{(1) and (2) only} textbf{(D)} text{(1) and (3) only} textbf{(E)} text{all three}","output":"Rule 1: a oplus b = b oplus a - Since a oplus b = kcdotmax(a, b) and max(a, b) = max(b, a) by the symmetric property of the max function, a oplus b = kcdotmax(a, b) = kcdotmax(b, a) = b oplus a.  - **Conclusion**: Rule 1 is correct.

Therefore, any line tangent to ((w)) from a point outside the circle will have equal segments from the point of tangency to the points where it intersects ( BP ) and ( BQ ). 3. **Constructing the Tangent Line:**    - We need to find a line through point ( L ) that is tangent to the circle ((w)) and intersects ( BP ) and ( BQ ) at points ( A ) and ( C ) respectively.    - The line through ( L ) that is tangent to ((w)) will touch the circle at a single point, say ( T ). 4. **Intersection Points:**    - Let the tangent line through ( L ) intersect ( BP ) at ( A ) and ( BQ ) at ( C ).    - Since ( AC ) is tangent to ((w)) at ( T ), the segments ( AT ) and ( CT ) are equal. 5. **Perimeter Condition:**    - The perimeter of ( triangle ABC ) is given to be ( 2p ).    - Since ( BE = BF = p ), the total length of ( BA + AC + CB ) must equal ( 2p ). 6. **Conclusion:**    - By constructing the tangent line through ( L ) that touches the circle ((w)) and intersects ( BP ) and ( BQ ) at ( A ) and ( C ), we ensure that the perimeter of ( triangle ABC ) is ( 2p ).

The foci are located at F_1(-1, 0) and F_2(1, 0). Let’s denote point E as (x, y) such that it satisfies the ellipse's equation frac{x^2}{9} + frac{y^2}{8} = 1. Solving for y^2, we have: y^2 = 8left(1 - frac{x^2}{9}right). Now, we can express the vectors as vec{EF}_1 = (-1-x, -y) and vec{EF}_2 = (1-x, -y). The dot product vec{EF}_1 cdot vec{EF}_2 is then computed as: begin{align*} vec{EF}_1 cdot vec{EF}_2 &= (-1-x)(1-x) + y^2  &= (x^2 + y^2) - 1  &= 7 + frac{x^2}{9}, end{align*} where we substituted y^2 with the expression from the ellipse's equation. Since x lies within the interval [-3, 3], x^2 is within the interval [0, 9]. Therefore, the value of vec{EF}_1 cdot vec{EF}_2 reaches its maximum within the interval [7, 8]. This shows that the maximum value is boxed{8} and the minimum value is boxed{7}. Hence, the correct option is B. By setting coordinates for point E, we can express vec{EF}_1 and vec{EF}_2 and then apply the dot product representation in terms of coordinates along with the range of x to determine the extremal values of vec{EF}_1 cdot vec{EF}_2. This problem primarily examines the application of ellipses. The key to solving it is to use the representation of the dot product in terms of vector coordinates.

Therefore, the exponents for the same variables are different, which means A does not match. - For term B: 3xy, the exponents of both x and y are 1, whereas in 3x^{2}y, the exponent of x is 2. This indicates that the exponents for the variables are different, so B does not match. - For term C: -yx^{2}, the variables x and y have the same exponents as in 3x^{2}y, with x having an exponent of 2 and y having an exponent of 1. Despite the difference in coefficients and the order of variables, the type, based on variables and their exponents, is the same. Therefore, C matches. - For term D: 3xyz, an additional variable z is introduced, which is not present in 3x^{2}y. This means the variables are different, so D does not match.

Initially, there were 6 roses in the vase, and after cutting, there are 16 roses in the vase. The number of roses added to the vase is the difference between these two numbers: C = 16 roses (after cutting) - 6 roses (initially) = 10 roses So, Mary cut C = 10 roses from her garden. Now, let's find the initial number of roses in the garden, R. We know that after cutting C roses, there are B roses left in the garden. Since Mary cut 10 roses, we can express the initial number of roses as: R = B roses (after cutting) + C roses (cut) Since we know C = 10, we can rewrite the equation as: R = B + 10 Now, we need to find the number of roses in the garden after cutting, which is (R - C).

One can rotate it  45^{circ}  round any of its endpoints. Is it possible that after several rotations the needle returns to initial position with the endpoints interchanged?","output":"1. **Initial Setup:**    We place the needle on the complex plane with one end at (0) and the other at (1). Let (z_0 = 0) and (z_1 = 1). After (n) moves, let (z_n) denote the new endpoint of the needle after a move.  2. **Rotation Representation:**    If (omega = e^{frac{pi i}{4}}), we can set up the following recurrence relation for (z_1, z_2, ldots):    [    z_{n} = omega^{e_{n}}(z_{n-2} - z_{n-1}) - z_{n-2} = (1 - omega^{e_{n}})z_{n-1} + omega^{e_{n}}z_{n-2}    ]    for an arbitrary sequence of integers (e_1, e_2, ldots). This recurrence works because we translate (z_n) to a new point (w) on the unit circle, rotate it by (e_{n} cdot frac{pi}{4}), and undo the translation, which is exactly the operation we desire. 3. **Claim:**    If (k) is odd and (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) are integers, then     [    omega^{a_1} + omega^{a_2} + cdots + omega^{a_k} neq 0    ]    This is equivalent to showing that if (t_1omega^1 + t_2omega^2 + cdots + t_8omega^8 = 0), then (t_1 + t_2 + cdots + t_8) is even. 4. **Real and Imaginary Parts:**    Note that:    [    Re(t_1omega^1 + t_2omega^2 + cdots + t_8omega^8) = t_1 cdot Re(omega^1) + t_2 cdot Re(omega^2) + cdots + t_8 cdot Re(omega^8) = 0    ]    Since (Re(omega^k) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) for (k = 1, 3, 5, 7) and (Re(omega^k) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) for (k = 2, 4, 6, 8), we have:    [    (t_1 + t_3 - t_5 - t_7) frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + t_2 + t_4 = 0 implies t_1 + t_3 - t_5 - t_7 = 0    ]    So, (t_1 + t_3 + t_5 + t_7) is even. 5. **Rotation by (omega):**    We also note that:    [    omega cdot (t_1omega^1 + t_2omega^2 + cdots + t_8omega^8) = 0 implies t_8omega^1 + t_1omega^2 + cdots + t_7omega^8 = 0    ]    So, (t_2 + t_4 + t_6 + t_8) is even by the same logic. Thus, (t_1 + t_3 + cdots + t_8) is even as desired. (blacksquare) 6. **Recurrence Relation for (A_n):**    If we let (A_n) denote the number of terms in the expansion of (z_n), we can set up the following recursion:    [    z_{n} = (1 - omega^{e_{n}})z_{n-1} + omega^{e_{n}}z_{n-2} = z_{n-1} + omega^{e_n+4} cdot z_{n-1} + omega^{e_n}z_{n-2}    ]    [    implies A_n = 2A_{n-1} + A_{n-2}    ]    Where (A_0 = 0) and (A_1 = 1). Note that this recursion implies that for all odd (k), we have (A_k equiv A_{k-2} equiv cdots equiv A_1 equiv 1 pmod{2}). Thus, (z_k) has an odd number of terms in its (omega) expansion. Thus, (z_k neq 0 = z_0) for all odd (k). So, the two ends of the needle cannot swap."},{"instruction":"Mark and Peter dug ponds in their backyards.

Consider the expression:  k = u + v - uv.  2. Since u and v are positive and less than 1, both u and v are in the interval (0, 1). Therefore:    - The expression u(1-v) and v(1-u) are both positive since 1-v and 1-u are positive.    - Therefore k must be positive:  k = u + v(1 - u) > 0.  3. To prove that k < 1, consider:  u + v - uv < 1.  This results from multiplying u and v:  u(1 - v) < 1.  Which sums to  u + v(1 - u) < 1.  Hence,  k = u + v - uv < 1.  Thus, both inequalities hold:  0 < u + v - uv < 1.  Hence the solution is confirmed. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Which of the following pairs are like terms?

This means:    [    a_{n+2} = g(g(a_n)).    ]    Since ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x geq 1 ), the sequence ( (a_n) ) will be increasing from this point onward. 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the sequence ( (a_n) ) is increasing starting from some term.

For ( 3y = 12x - 5 ), dividing both sides by 3 gives ( y = 4x - frac{5}{3} ), so the slope is ( 4 ). 4. For ( 2y = -3x + 4 ), dividing both sides by 2 gives ( y = -frac{3}{2}x + 2 ), so the slope is ( -frac{3}{2} ). 5.

Given the series sum_{n=1}^{infty} (-1)^{n-1} frac{1}{n^2}, we denote by S the sum of the series, S_n the partial sum up to the n-th term, and r_n the remainder (error) term after the n-th term.        Hence, we write:    [    S = S_n + r_n    ] 2. We calculate the partial sum S_3 by summing the first three terms:    [    S_3 = 1 - frac{1}{2^2} + frac{1}{3^2} = 1 - frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{9}    ]    Let's compute the explicit value:    [    S_3 = 1 - 0.25 + frac{1}{9} = 1 - 0.25 + 0.1111 = 0.8611    ]    In fraction form:    [    S_3 = frac{1 cdot 36}{36} - frac{9}{36} + frac{4}{36} = frac{36 - 9 + 4}{36} = frac{31}{36}    ] 3. Applying Leibniz's theorem for alternating series, which states that the absolute error |r_n| is less than the absolute value of the first omitted term |a_{n+1}|, we get:    [    |r_3| < |a_4|    ] 4. Since the fourth term of the series is a_4 = -frac{1}{4^2},    [    |a_4| = left| -frac{1}{16} right| = frac{1}{16} = 0.0625    ]    Therefore, the absolute error |r_3| < 0.0625. 5. The remainder term r_3 is negative since the sum after the third term decreases; thus:    [    -0.0625 < r_3 < 0    ] 6. Hence, the sum of the series S approx frac{31}{36} with an excess error, meaning S is slightly less than frac{31}{36}.  Part 2: Estimating the error using the sum of the first four terms 1. Following the same approach, we calculate the partial sum S_4 by summing the first four terms:    [    S_4 = 1 - frac{1}{2^2} + frac{1}{3^2} - frac{1}{4^2} = 1 - frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{9} - frac{1}{16}    ]    In fraction form:    [    S_4 = frac{144}{144} - frac{36}{144} + frac{16}{144} - frac{9}{144} = frac{144 - 36 + 16 - 9}{144} = frac{115}{144}    ] 2. Again, using Leibniz's theorem, the absolute error |r_4| is less than the absolute value of the first omitted term |a_5|:    [    |r_4| < |a_5|    ] 3. Since the fifth term of the series is a_5 = frac{1}{5^2},    [    |a_5| = frac{1}{25} = 0.04    ] 4. The remainder term r_4 is positive since the sum after the fourth term increases; thus:    [    0 < r_4 < 0.04    ] 5. Hence, the sum of the series S approx frac{115}{144} with a deficiency error, meaning S is slightly more than frac{115}{144}. # Conclusion: - For the first case:   [   S approx frac{31}{36} quad text{with an excess error} quad (-0.0625 < r_3 < 0)   ] - For the second case:   [   S approx frac{115}{144} quad text{with a deficiency error} quad (0 < r_4 < 0.04)   ]  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given a sector of a circle with a perimeter of 20 cm, what central angle would make the area of this sector maximum?

Let's analyze this step-by-step.    - After the first rotation, a white square will turn black if it lands on a black square. We need all of these squares to either become or remain black for the entire grid to be black after subsequent operations. 2. **Second Rotation and Painting**:    - The grid undergoes another 90^circ rotation. For the grid to become fully black now, any white square that is rotated into a previously black square must become black.    - This secondary rotation and painting focus on sectors of the grid that may have originally been white but now must become black due to the new positions of black squares after the first rotation. 3. **Calculate Probability**:    - The probability that the center square is black and remains so after two rotations is clearly frac{1}{2}.    - For the other squares, their final black status depends not only on their initial color but also on the result of the first and second rotations and the application of the painting rule.    - It's particularly complex as some squares not initially black have chances to turn black through two rotations and two applications of the painting rule.    However, let's consider the simplest scenario where each square not only starts black but also may be forced to black by a previous square:    - Probability that any given non-center square becomes black either initially or through painting by two rotations: frac{1}{2} + left(frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}right) (either starts black or is painted black in the first or second rotation).    - This arrives at frac{3}{4} for each square.    - Total Probability: frac{1}{2} times left(frac{3}{4}right)^8 = frac{1}{2} times frac{6561}{65536} = frac{6561}{131072}.

However, the correct definition of a certain event is one that is guaranteed to occur in any trial, not just after a large number of trials. Therefore, the statement is misleading in suggesting that the frequency over trials defines certainty.

Its absence in a finite number of trials does not make it impossible. An impossible event is one that has no chance of occurring under any circumstances. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. - **Statement D**: Rolling a die and getting a number greater than 6 is not a random event; it is an impossible event because a standard die only has faces numbered from 1 to 6.

We are told that the circle constructed on the leg ( AC ) as its diameter intersects the hypotenuse ( AB ) exactly at its midpoint ( M ). 1. **Understand the properties of the given configuration**:     - The circle is constructed on ( AC ) as its diameter. Therefore, the angle subtended by ( AC ) at any point on the circle is a right angle (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the angle subtended by a diameter of a circle at any point on the circle is ( 90^circ )).     - The given circle intersects the hypotenuse ( AB ) at its midpoint ( M ). 2. **Angle at the intersection point ( M )**:     [     angle AMC = 90^circ     ]     This is due to the property that the angle subtended by the diameter (here, leg ( AC )) at any point on the circle is a right angle. 3. **Classification of the median and altitude from vertex ( C )**:     Since ( CM ) not only acts as altitude making ( angle AMC = 90^circ ), but also it is given to be the median (dividing the hypotenuse ( AB ) into two equal parts), we can conclude:     - ( CM ) is both a median and an altitude of ( triangle ABC ). 4. **Determine the type of triangle**:     - When the median to the hypotenuse of a triangle is also an altitude, the triangle is isosceles.

Rewrite the terms with the common denominator:    [    a = frac{12}{12}a, quad frac{3}{4}a = frac{9}{12}a, quad frac{2}{3}a = frac{8}{12}a    ]        Now combine them:    [    frac{12}{12}a + frac{9}{12}a + frac{8}{12}a = 58    ]        Combine the fractions:    [    frac{29}{12}a = 58    ] 4. **Solve for (a):**    To isolate (a), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (frac{29}{12}):    [    a = 58 times frac{12}{29}    ]    [    a = 2 times 12 = 24    ]        So, (a = 24). 5. **Calculate (b) and (c):**    Using the given ratios, calculate (b) and (c):    [    b = frac{3}{4}a = frac{3}{4} times 24 = 18    ]    [    c = frac{2}{3}a = frac{2}{3} times 24 = 16    ] 6. **Determine (d) using the proportion condition:**    We use the condition that (frac{a}{b} = frac{c}{d}). Thus:    [    frac{a}{b} = frac{24}{18}    ]    Since (frac{a}{b}) must equal (frac{c}{d}), we can find (d) by:    [    frac{c}{d} = frac{16}{d} = frac{24}{18}    ]    Cross-multiply to solve for (d):    [    24d = 16 times 18    ]    [    24d = 288    ]    [    d = frac{288}{24} = 12    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The fourth term of the proportion is (d = 12). The complete proportion can be written as:    [    frac{24}{18} = frac{16}{12}    ]    Therefore, the final answer is:    (boxed{12})."},{"instruction":"For real numbers   x , let   f(x)  be the least integer that is greater than or equal to   x .

For large ( x ), we have:    [    ax - 7 le lceil ax - 7 rceil < ax - 6    ]    and    [    bx + 3 le lceil bx + 3 rceil < bx + 4    ] 3. **Bounding the expression**: We can bound the given expression as follows:    [    x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 6} - frac{1}{bx + 4} right) le x^c left( frac{1}{lceil ax - 7 rceil} - frac{1}{lceil bx + 3 rceil} right) le x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{bx + 3} right)    ] 4. **Simplifying the bounds**: For large ( x ), the differences between ( ax - 7 ) and ( ax - 6 ), and between ( bx + 3 ) and ( bx + 4 ), become negligible. Thus, we can approximate:    [    x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{bx + 4} right) approx x^c left( frac{1}{ax} - frac{1}{bx} right)    ]    [    = x^c left( frac{b - a}{abx} right)    ]    [    = frac{b - a}{ab} x^{c-1}    ] 5. **Finding the maximum ( c )**: For the limit to converge, the exponent of ( x ) must be non-positive. Therefore, we require:    [    c - 1 le 0 implies c le 1    ]    The maximum value of ( c ) is thus ( 1 ). 6. **Calculating the limit**: When ( c = 1 ), the expression simplifies to:    [    lim_{x to infty} x left( frac{1}{lceil ax - 7 rceil} - frac{1}{lceil bx + 3 rceil} right)    ]    Using the bounds again, we get:    [    lim_{x to infty} x left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{bx + 4} right) = lim_{x to infty} frac{b - a}{ab} = frac{b - a}{ab}    ] 7. **Special case when ( a = b )**: If ( a = b ), the expression inside the limit becomes:    [    x^c left( frac{1}{lceil ax - 7 rceil} - frac{1}{lceil ax + 3 rceil} right)    ]    For large ( x ), this can be approximated as:    [    x^c left( frac{1}{ax - 7} - frac{1}{ax + 3} right) = x^c left( frac{10}{(ax - 7)(ax + 3)} right) approx x^c left( frac{10}{a^2 x^2} right) = frac{10}{a^2} x^{c-2}    ]    For the limit to converge, we need ( c - 2 le 0 implies c le 2 ). The maximum value of ( c ) is ( 2 ), and the limit is:    [    frac{10}{a^2}    ] The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{b - a}{ab} } ) if ( b neq a ), and ( frac{10}{a^2} ) if ( b = a )."},{"instruction":"The sum of four positive integers that form an arithmetic sequence is 58.

The sum of these integers is: [ 4a + 6d = 58 implies 2a + 3d = 29. ] We need to express d in terms of a: [ d = frac{29 - 2a}{3}. ] The second term of the sequence is: [ a + d = a + frac{29 - 2a}{3} = frac{3a + 29 - 2a}{3} = frac{a + 29}{3}. ] To maximize the second term, a + 29 should be as large as possible while ensuring that d remains an integer. Minimizing a is a way to achieve this. The smallest integer value for a is 1, given that d must remain an integer: [ d = frac{29 - 2 times 1}{3} = frac{27}{3} = 9. ] This gives us the sequence 1, 10, 19, 28.

Since the length of the electric pole is negligible compared to the length of the train, the time it takes to pass the pole is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to go by. Length of the train = Speed * Time Length of the train = 10 m/s * 14 s Length of the train = 140 m Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the train to pass the platform completely. We know that it takes 51 seconds for the train to pass the platform. Time to pass the platform = 51 seconds When the train passes the platform, it has to cover its own length plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as L (in meters). Total distance covered when passing the platform = Length of the train + Length of the platform Total distance covered = 140 m + L We can use the speed of the train to find out the total distance covered in 51 seconds. Total distance covered = Speed * Time to pass the platform 140 m + L = 10 m/s * 51 s 140 m + L = 510 m Now, we can solve for L, the length of the platform.

Using the relation:    [    t^{n+1} + leftlfloor frac{1}{t^{n+1}} rightrfloor = t left(t^n + leftlfloor frac{1}{t^n} rightrfloor - frac{1}{t^n} right)    ]    And noting that:    [    t left(left(t^n + leftlfloor frac{1}{t^n} rightrfloor right) - leftlfloorfrac{1}{t^n}rightrfloor right) = t t^n = t^{n+1}    ]    Since ( t left(t^n + leftlfloor frac{1}{t^n} rightrfloor right) ) is also an integer after some rearranging, the formula for ( t^{n+1} ) remains an integer under this form. 5. **Proof completion:**    Let ( A = t^2 ). Then:    [    A^n + leftlfloor frac{1}{A^n} rightrfloor = (t^2)^n + leftlfloor frac{1}{(t^2)^n} rightrfloor    ]    Since ( t ) is irrational and under previous steps, ( t^2 ) will satisfy the conditions that keep ( A in mathbb{R} ). 6. **Conclusion:**    For ( A = t^2 ) we will have ( A^n + leftlfloor frac{1}{A^n} rightrfloor ) equating to the nearest integer form, hence proving the upper integer part always equal to the nearest square with distance 2:    [    boxed{A}    ]"},{"instruction":"{{cos }^{2}}15{}^circ dfrac{1}{2}=_________.","output":"**Analysis** This question tests the double angle formula and the trigonometric values of special angles. **Solution** We have: {{cos }^{2}}15{}^circ -dfrac{1}{2}=dfrac{2{{cos }^{2}}15{}^circ -1}{2}=dfrac{1}{2}cos 30{}^circ =dfrac{sqrt{3}}{4}.

What is the greatest number of regions that we can get?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We need to find the maximum number of regions created by a circle, a rectangle, and a triangle on a plane. Each shape can intersect with the others, and we aim to maximize these intersections. 2. **Intersections Between Shapes:**    - **Triangle and Rectangle:**      Each side of the triangle can intersect each side of the rectangle. Since a triangle has 3 sides and a rectangle has 4 sides, the maximum number of intersections between the triangle and the rectangle is (3 times 4 = 12).    - **Circle with Triangle and Rectangle:**      The circle can intersect each side of the triangle and the rectangle twice. The triangle has 3 sides, and the rectangle has 4 sides, so the total number of sides is (3 + 4 = 7). The circle can intersect each of these sides twice, giving (7 times 2 = 14) intersections. 3. **Counting Regions:**    - **Initial Regions:**      Without any intersections, each shape divides the plane into regions. A single shape divides the plane into 2 regions.      - Circle: 2 regions      - Rectangle: 2 regions      - Triangle: 2 regions    - **Adding Intersections:**      Each intersection adds new regions. We need to count the regions created by the intersections:      - **Triangle and Rectangle Intersections:**        Each of the 12 intersections between the triangle and the rectangle adds a new region.      - **Circle Intersections:**        Each of the 14 intersections of the circle with the sides of the triangle and rectangle adds a new region. 4. **Summing Up Regions:**    - Start with the initial regions: 2 (circle) + 2 (rectangle) + 2 (triangle) = 6 regions.    - Add the regions created by intersections:      - Triangle and Rectangle: 12 new regions.      - Circle with Triangle and Rectangle: 14 new regions.    Therefore, the total number of regions is:    [    6 + 12 + 14 = 32    ] However, this count seems to be overestimated. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the maximum number of regions created by each shape independently and then combining them. 5. **Re-evaluating the Problem:**    - **Circle Alone:**      A circle divides the plane into 2 regions.    - **Rectangle Alone:**      A rectangle divides the plane into 2 regions.    - **Triangle Alone:**      A triangle divides the plane into 2 regions.    When combined, the maximum number of regions created by intersections must be carefully counted. The correct approach is to consider the maximum number of regions created by each shape and their intersections. 6. **Correct Calculation:**    - **Circle and Rectangle:**      The circle can intersect the rectangle at most 8 times (4 sides, each intersected twice).    - **Circle and Triangle:**      The circle can intersect the triangle at most 6 times (3 sides, each intersected twice).    - **Rectangle and Triangle:**      The rectangle can intersect the triangle at most 6 times (each side of the triangle intersecting each side of the rectangle).

This indicates that f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}). Therefore, for any x > 0, we have f(x) > f(0) = 0, which simplifies to x > sin x. Applying this to b=sin 3, we note that sin 3 = sin(pi - 3), leading to the conclusion that sin 3 < pi - 3. Next, we define another function g(x)=tan x - x for x in (0, frac{pi}{2}). The derivative of g(x) is: [g'(x)=frac{1}{cos^2 x} - 1 = frac{sin^2 x}{cos^2 x}.] Since sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1, the derivative simplifies to g'(x) = frac{1 - cos^2 x}{cos^2 x} > 0. This shows that g(x) is also monotonically increasing on (0, frac{pi}{2}). Thus, for 0 < x < frac{pi}{2}, we have g(x) > g(0) = 0, which means tan x > x. Applying this to c = tan 4, and noting that 4 is equivalent to 4 - pi in the relevant interval, we find tan 4 > 4 - pi. Since 4 - pi > pi - 3, it follows that c > b. Finally, considering a = cos 2, we know that cos 2 < cos frac{pi}{2} = 0 since cos x decreases from 1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to frac{pi}{2}. Thus, we have established that a < 0.

Calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in the school year: - There are 36 weeks in the school year. - Each week has 1 Wednesday and 1 Friday, so there are 36 Wednesdays and 36 Fridays. 2. Subtract the public holidays: - There are 2 public holidays on Wednesdays and 3 on Fridays. - This leaves us with 36 - 2 = 34 Wednesdays and 36 - 3 = 33 Fridays. 3. Subtract the days Jackson is absent: - Jackson misses 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. - This leaves us with 34 - 1 = 33 Wednesdays and 33 - 2 = 31 Fridays. 4. Calculate the days Jackson asks for a ham and cheese sandwich: - Every 4 weeks, he asks for a ham and cheese sandwich on 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. - There are 36 weeks in the school year, so this happens 36 / 4 = 9 times. - This means he asks for a ham and cheese sandwich on 9 Wednesdays and 18 Fridays. 5. Subtract the days Jackson eats a ham and cheese sandwich from the total: - For Wednesdays: 33 (remaining Wednesdays after holidays and absences) - 9 (ham and cheese sandwich days) = 24 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on Wednesdays. - For Fridays: 31 (remaining Fridays after holidays and absences) - 18 (ham and cheese sandwich days) = 13 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on Fridays. 6.

We start with the condition that the product of two identical digits results in a two-digit number that does not end with the same digit. Let's enumerate these possibilities: [ 4 cdot 4 = 16, quad 7 cdot 7 = 49, quad 8 cdot 8 = 64, quad 9 cdot 9 = 81 ] 2. Next, we analyze that the digit representing the \\"mouse\\" when multiplied by itself results in the last digit being the same as that of the \\"elephant\\". This means that both these digits share the same parity (both even or both odd). 3. Considering our list from step 1, we see that the pairs ((8 cdot 8 = 64)) and ((4 cdot 4 = 16)) could fit this criterion since they maintain parity:     - (4) and (6) are even.     - (8) and (4) are also even. 4. Now, analyzing the provided example, (8cdot 8 = 64), fits perfectly. Therefore, if the \\"mouse\\" digit is (8) whose square ends in (4), this leaves us with (4) as the \\"elephant\\" digit. 5. Let's verify this with the second example: the square of the \\"mouse\\" digit ends in (6), fitting only one scenario:     [     4 cdot 4 = 16     ]    This means the \\"mouse\\" digit should indeed be (4) as confirmed. 6.

We have marking stakes, ample rope, and a clear terrain. We need to construct the bisector of an angle in such a way that it divides the angle into quarters. 1. Marking stakes can be used to set points on the ground and to extend a line through two mapped points. 2. By peeking from behind two placed stakes, we can set another stake in a precise line extended beyond the two defined points. 3. Using ropes, we can mark a line segment between two points, and we can also determine intersections. **Step 2**: Set up the Scenario Given points (A), (B), and (C) on the terrain and aiming to define a ray from (A) that halves the angle ( angle BAC): 1. Aim is to find a point which is in the direction that makes a fourth of the angle ( angle BAC ) from the line segment ( AB ). **Step 3**: Steps to Bisect Half the Angle Half the angle process, knowing that the median of an isosceles triangle also serves as its angle bisector: 1. Measure segment (AB) and extend it along ray (AC) to a point ( B_1 ) where ( AB = AB_1 ). 2. Determine the midpoint ( F_1 ) of segment ( BB_1 ). 3. Now, align segment ( A F_1 ) on segment ( AC ), and extend this to point ( B_2 ). 4. The midpoint ( F_2 ) of segment ( B B_2 ) gives us the desired direction for a fourth angle partition. This determines the exact point to set the stake. **Step 4**: Constructing the Ray Using Less Steps Rather than focusing on aligning points incrementally:   1. Extend segment ( AB ) along ray ( AC ) to create a point ( D ) equal in length to ( AB ). 2. In triangle ( ABD ), the external angle at ( D ) equals the half of ( angle BAC ) due to symmetry in an isosceles triangle. 3. Repeating this with ( B ) as the vertex, and extending the span ( BD ) beyond ( B ) mark another point ( E ). 4. The points now confirm that in triangle ( BAE ), the angle (BAE ) will be exactly a quarter of ( angle BAC ) because measure is compounded symmetrically. **Conclusion**: Using two stakes and minimal measurements: [ boxed{text{Point } E text{ is the required bisector direction}} ] Insights: 1. Each process is replicable and simplified upon modification without incorrectness for ( angle BAC > 180^circ ). 2.

Let O and r be the center and radius of the fourth circle, which is tangent to the three given circles externally.    2.

(A Shapovalov)","output":"To determine whether a convex polyhedron can have 90% of its volume below the water level while more than half of its surface area is above the water level, we can use a 2D analogy and then extend it to 3D. 1. **2D Construction**:    Consider a rectangle and a triangle in 2D, where the dividing line between them represents the water level. The rectangle represents the part of the polyhedron above the water, and the triangle represents the part below the water. 2. **Dimensions of the Rectangle and Triangle**:    - Let the rectangle have dimensions ( k ) and ( 0.5 - k ).    - Let the triangle have side lengths ( k ), ( 0.5 - 0.5k ), and ( 0.5 - 0.5k ). 3. **Area Calculation**:    - The area of the rectangle is ( k(0.5 - k) ).    - The area of the triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter ( s ) of the triangle is:      [      s = frac{k + (0.5 - 0.5k) + (0.5 - 0.5k)}{2} = frac{k + 1 - k}{2} = 0.5      ]      The area ( A ) of the triangle is:      [      A = sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} = sqrt{0.5 left(0.5 - kright) left(0.5 - 0.5kright) left(0.5 - 0.5kright)}      ] 4. **Limit Analysis**:    - We need to show that the ratio of the areas of the rectangle to the triangle approaches zero as ( k ) approaches ( 0.5 ):      [      lim_{k to 0.5} frac{k(0.5 - k)}{0.5k sqrt{(0.5 - 0.5k)^2 - (0.5k)^2}} = 0      ]      Simplifying the expression inside the square root:      [      sqrt{(0.5 - 0.5k)^2 - (0.5k)^2} = sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k + 0.25k^2 - 0.25k^2} = sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k}      ]      Therefore, the limit becomes:      [      lim_{k to 0.5} frac{k(0.5 - k)}{0.5k sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k}} = lim_{k to 0.5} frac{0.5 - k}{0.5 sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k}} = lim_{k to 0.5} frac{0.5 - k}{0.5 sqrt{0.25 - 0.5k}} = 0      ] 5. **Conclusion**:    - As ( k ) approaches ( 0.5 ), the area of the rectangle becomes negligible compared to the area of the triangle.    - This implies that it is possible to construct a convex polyhedron where 90% of its volume is below the water level while more than half of its surface area is above the water level.

(3) Prove that for any n in mathbb{N}^*, the inequality ln(1 + n) > sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} frac{i1}{i^2} holds.","output":"(1) According to the problem, g(x) = ln x + ax^2 + bx. Then, the derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = frac{1}{x} + 2ax + b. Since the tangent line to the graph of g(x) at the point (1, g(1)) is parallel to the x-axis, we have g'(1) = 0; thus: 1 + 2a + b = 0, which implies that b = -2a - 1.   (2) From part (1), g'(x) can be rewritten as: g'(x) = frac{2ax^2 - (2a + 1)x + 1}{x} = frac{(2ax - 1)(x - 1)}{x}. Since the domain of g(x) is (0, +infty), we have two cases: - When a leq 0, 2ax - 1 < 0 always holds on (0, +infty). Therefore, g'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1 and g'(x) < 0 for x > 1. Thus, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and decreasing on (1, +infty).    - When a > 0, setting g'(x) = 0 gives us x = 1 or x = frac{1}{2a}. Considering three sub-cases based on this:   - If frac{1}{2a} < 1 (which means a > frac{1}{2}), then g'(x) > 0 for x > 1 or 0 < x < frac{1}{2a}, and g'(x) < 0 for frac{1}{2a} < x < 1. Thus, g(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2a}) and (1, +infty), and decreasing on (frac{1}{2a}, 1).   - If frac{1}{2a} > 1 (which means 0 < a < frac{1}{2}), then g'(x) > 0 for x > frac{1}{2a} or 0 < x < 1, and g'(x) < 0 for 1 < x < frac{1}{2a}. Thus, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and (frac{1}{2a}, +infty), and decreasing on (1, frac{1}{2a}).   - If frac{1}{2a} = 1 (which means a = frac{1}{2}), then g'(x) geq 0 for (0, +infty), meaning that g(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). In summary, when a leq 0, the function g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and decreasing on (1, +infty). When 0 < a < frac{1}{2}, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and (frac{1}{2a}, +infty), and decreasing on (1, frac{1}{2a}). When a = frac{1}{2}, g(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), and when a > frac{1}{2}, g(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2a}) and (1, +infty), and decreasing on (frac{1}{2a}, 1). (3) We provide three methods of proof: - **Proof Method One**: When a = 1, we know that g(x) = ln x + x^2 - 3x is increasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, we have:   ln x + x^2 - 3x geq g(1) = -2,   which implies:   ln x geq -x^2 + 3x - 2 = -(x - 1)(x - 2).   Let x = 1 + frac{1}{n}, where n in mathbb{N}^*. Then:   ln(1 + frac{1}{n}) > frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2}.   Adding these inequalities from 1 to n, we obtain:   ln(1 + frac{1}{1}) + ln(1 + frac{1}{2}) + ln(1 + frac{1}{3}) + ldots + ln(1 + frac{1}{n}) > left(frac{1}{1} - frac{1}{1^2}right) + left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2^2}right) + ldots + left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2}right).   Therefore, by telescoping the series:   lnleft(frac{2}{1} times frac{3}{2} times frac{4}{3} times ldots times frac{n + 1}{n}right) > sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} left(frac{i^2 - 1}{i^2}right),   we get   boxed{ln(1 + n) > sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} frac{i-1}{i^2}}. - **Proof Method Two**: Construct a sequence {a_n} such that the sum of the first n terms, T_n = ln(1 + n).   When n geq 2, we have:   a_n = T_n - T_{n-1} = lnleft(frac{1 + n}{n}right) = lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n}right),   and this expression also holds for a_1 = ln 2.    We need to prove that:   lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n}right) > frac{n - 1}{n^2} = frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2}.    Let x = frac{1}{n}. We aim to show that ln(1 + x) - x + x^2 > 0. Denote by h(x) the function h(x) = ln(1 + x) - x + x^2, defined for x > 0.   Taking the derivative, we find:   h'(x) = frac{1}{1 + x} - 1 + 2x = frac{x(2x + 1)}{1 + x} > 0.   Therefore, h(x) is increasing on (0, +infty) and since h(0) = 0, we have that h(x) > 0 for all x > 0. Thus, we conclude that:   lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n}right) > frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n^2},   continuing as in Proof Method One. - **Proof Method Three**: Define varphi(n) = ln(1 + n) - sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} frac{i-1}{i^2}.   Then, we have:   varphi(n + 1) - varphi(n) = ln(n + 2) - frac{n}{(n + 1)^2} - ln(n + 1) = lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n + 1}right) - frac{1}{n + 1} + frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}.   Let x = 1 + frac{1}{n + 1} so that x in (1, 2] and frac{1}{n + 1} = x - 1, where n in mathbb{N}^*. Denote by h(x) the function h(x) = ln x - (x - 1) + (x - 1)^2 = ln x + x^2 - 3x + 2.   The derivative is: h'(x) = frac{1}{x} + 2x - 3 = frac{(2x - 1)(x - 1)}{x} > 0.   Since h(x) is increasing on (1, 2] and h(1) = 0, for x in (1, 2], we have h(x) > 0.

We need to prove that there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) such that the number of positive divisors of ( 2^n - 1 ) is greater than ( n ). 2. Let's consider numbers of the form ( n = 2^m ) for ( m in mathbb{N} ). We will show that these numbers satisfy the desired condition. 3. Observe that for any ( a in mathbb{N} ), the greatest common divisor of ( 2^a - 1 ) and ( 2^a + 1 ) is 1, i.e., ( (2^a - 1, 2^a + 1) = 1 ). 4. Now consider the number ( 2^{2^m} - 1 ). We can factorize it as follows:    [    2^{2^m} - 1 = (2^{2^{m-1}} - 1)(2^{2^{m-1}} + 1)    ]    Continuing this factorization, we get:    [    2^{2^m} - 1 = (2^{2^{m-1}} - 1)(2^{2^{m-1}} + 1) = (2^{2^{m-1}} - 1)(2^{2^{m-2}} + 1)(2^{2^{m-2}} - 1) cdots (2^2 + 1)(2^1 + 1)(2^1 - 1)    ] 5. From the observation in step 3, each of the first ( m ) factors ( 2^{2^k} + 1 ) (for ( k = 0, 1, ldots, m-1 )) has a prime divisor, and these prime divisors are pairwise distinct. 6. Therefore, the number ( 2^{2^m} - 1 ) has at least ( m ) distinct prime divisors.  7. The number of positive divisors of a number with ( m ) distinct prime factors is at least ( 2^m ). This is because the total number of divisors of a number ( n ) with prime factorization ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ) is given by ( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) ). If each ( e_i geq 1 ), then the number of divisors is at least ( 2^k ). 8. Since not all numbers of the form ( 2^a + 1 ) are prime, we must have at least one more distinct positive divisor, which means we must have more than ( 2^m ) positive divisors. 9. Since ( 2^m > m ) for all ( m geq 1 ), it follows that the number of positive divisors of ( 2^{2^m} - 1 ) is greater than ( 2^m ), and hence greater than ( m ). 10. Therefore, there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) (specifically, ( n = 2^m ) for ( m in mathbb{N} )) such that the number of positive divisors of ( 2^n - 1 ) is greater than ( n ).

Simplify and solve the equation for (x):    [    150n - 150 + x = 180n - 360    ]    [    x = 180n - 360 - 150n + 150    ]    [    x = 30n - 210    ] 5. The remaining angle (x) must be less than 150^circ. Therefore, we need:    [    x < 150    ]    Substitute (x = 30n - 210) into the inequality:    [    30n - 210 < 150    ]    Solve for (n):    [    30n < 360    ]    [    n < 12    ] 6. Additionally, the remaining angle (x) must also be a positive angle. Thus:    [    x > 0    ]    Substitute (x = 30n - 210) into the inequality:    [    30n - 210 > 0    ]    Solve for (n):    [    30n > 210    ]    [    n > 7    ] 7. Combining both inequalities, we get:    [    7 < n < 12    ]    Therefore, the possible integer values for (n) are:    [    n = 8, 9, 10, 11    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{8, 9, 10, 11} ]"},{"instruction":"Let g(x) = 5 for all real numbers x.

But this is impossible because it would contradict the initial assumption that no side of square S is smaller than the distance from F_1 to any point on the ellipse, as the shortest distance from F_1 to the ellipse is the length of the semi-minor axis b, and S's side must be larger than b. - This means the original assumption that another vertex of square S could be on the ellipse while one vertex already lies on it is not correct. Therefore, the maximum number of vertices of S that can lie on the ellipse Gamma is 1, as placing more than one would violate the property that the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant.

Let P(x,y) be a point on the ellipse, then S_{triangle F_{1}PF_{2}} = c|y|. Since |y| leq b, it follows that S_{triangle F_{1}PF_{2}} leq bc = sqrt{3}. Solving this, we get boxed{a = 2, b = 1}.

From these evaluations, we can infer:    [    -1 < alpha < -frac{1}{2}, quad frac{1}{2} < beta < 1, quad 2sqrt{2} < a < 3    ] 4. Next, estimate the range of (alpha^n + beta^n):    [    (-alpha)^3 - 3(-alpha)^2 + 1 = -alpha^3 - 3alpha^2 + 1 = alpha^3 - 3alpha^2 + 1 - 2alpha^3 = -2alpha^3 > 0    ]    Since (frac{1}{2} < -alpha < 1) and (fleft(frac{1}{2}right) > 0), it follows that:    [    -alpha < beta implies |alpha| < beta    ]    Thus, (alpha^n + beta^n > 0 , (n geq 1)). Also, since:    [    alpha^2 + beta^2 = (alpha + beta)^2 - 2alpha beta    ]    and given:    [    alpha + beta + a = 3, ; alphabeta a = -1,    ]    we find:    [    alpha^2 + beta^2 = (3 - a)^2 - 2 frac{alpha beta}{a}    ]    Using ( alpha beta = frac{-1}{a}), we have:    [    alpha^2 + beta^2 = (3 - a)^2 + frac{2}{a}    ]    Substituting and simplifying:    [    frac{2 left(-3a^2 + 1right)}{a} + 9 + a^2 = 9 - a^2    ]    Given (a > 2sqrt{2}), it is clear (8 - a^2 < 0). Hence:    [    alpha^2 + beta^2 < 1    ] 5. When (n geq 2):    [    alpha^n + beta^n - left(alpha^2 + beta^2right) = alpha^2 left(alpha^{n-2} - 1right) + beta^2 left(beta^{n-2} - 1right) leq 0    ]    Therefore:    [    0 < alpha^n + beta^n < 1    ] 6. Define:    [    nu_n = alpha^n + beta^n + a^n    ]        It's easy to calculate:    [    nu_0 = alpha^0 + beta^0 + a^0 = 3    ]    [    nu_1 = alpha + beta + a = 3    ]    [    nu_2 = alpha^2 + beta^2 + a^2 = 9 - a^2 + a^2 = 9    ] 7.

By mathematical induction, (nu_n) is an integer for all (n). Hence:    [    a^n = nu_n - (alpha^n + beta^n)    ]    Since (0 < alpha^n + beta^n < 1), we conclude:    [    left[a^nright] = nu_n - 1    ] 9. To solve the problem, we need to verify that (nu_{1788} - 1) and (nu_{1988} - 1) are divisible by 17. Using the recurrence (nu_{n+3} = 3nu_{n+2} - nu_n), we iteratively determine (nu_i mod 17):    [    begin{align*}    &nu_0 equiv 3, quad nu_1 equiv 3, quad nu_2 equiv 9, quad nu_3 equiv 7, quad nu_4 equiv 1,     &nu_5 equiv 11, quad nu_6 equiv 9, quad nu_7 equiv 9, quad nu_8 equiv 16, quad nu_9 equiv 5,     &nu_{10} equiv 6, quad nu_{11} equiv 2, quad nu_{12} equiv 1, quad nu_{13} equiv 14, quad nu_{14} equiv 6,     &nu_{15} equiv 0, quad nu_{16} equiv 3, quad nu_{17} equiv 3, quad nu_{18} equiv 9, quad nu_{19} equiv 7,     &nu_{20} equiv 1    end{align*}    ] 10. From these results, we notice the values are periodic with a modulus of 17:     [     nu_{n+16} equiv nu_n pmod{17}     ] 11. Since (1788 = 16 cdot 111 + 12) and (1988 = 16 cdot 124 + 4):     [     nu_{1788} equiv nu_{12} equiv 1 pmod{17}     ]     [     nu_{1988} equiv nu_4 equiv 1 pmod{17}     ] 12.

Therefore, angle AYX = angle YAX = t^circ. 2. **Angle AXY in triangle AXY**: The sum of angles in any triangle is 180^circ, so for triangle AXY, we have angle AXY + 2t^circ = 180^circ. This gives us angle AXY = 180^circ - 2t^circ. 3. **Angle BXY**: Angles angle AXY and angle BXY are supplementary as they form a straight line. Thus, angle BXY = 180^circ - (180^circ - 2t^circ) = 2t^circ. 4. **Angle XBY in triangle XYB**: Since XY = YB, triangle XYB is also isosceles, and thus angle XBY = angle BXY = 2t^circ. 5. **Angle XYB in triangle XYB**: Again, using the sum of angles in a triangle, for triangle XYB, we have angle XYB + 2(2t^circ) = 180^circ.

Given that x is in the interval left[-1,1right], we substitute c into the inequality 0leqslant 3b+cleqslant 3 to get 0leqslant 3b-x^{2}-bxleqslant 3. 4.

(ii) If Delta = 0, meaning a^2 = 4b, there is exactly one positive real root for the equation, which is x = frac{a}{2b}. We have: - When x = frac{a}{2b}, then w_乙 = w_甲. - When x > 0 and x neq frac{a}{2b}, then w_乙 > w_甲.

Thus, by reversing the representation, we ensure that:    [    n text{ is a sum of distinct } a_i    ] 6. **Bijection Argument**:    By constructing the above mappings, we can show a one-to-one correspondence between the two forms of partitioning (n).

Consider the expression (2n+1)^n. Using the binomial theorem, we can approximate this expression:          (2n+1)^n = left(2n + 1right)^n          For large n, we will expand this around 2n. 2. Make a binomial expansion for (2n + 1)^n. However, since the standard binomial theorem provides an exact form, the approximation might be more interpretable using simpler expansions. Hence, we will use the approximation:          (2n + 1)^n approx left(2nright)^n left(1 + frac{1}{2n}right)^n               Using the limit approximation for small values of frac{1}{2n} and the binomial expansion:          left(1 + frac{1}{2n}right)^n approx e^{frac{n}{2n}} = e^{frac{1}{2}}      3. Therefore:          (2n + 1)^n approx (2n)^n e^{frac{1}{2}}               Since ((2n)^n) is very large, even a small factor like (e^{frac{1}{2}}) will have a significant impact. 4. Consider the left-hand side  (2n - 1)^n + (2n)^n.  Notice that ((2n-1)^n) is significantly smaller in comparison to ((2n)^n). Still, we need to show:          (2n - 1)^n + (2n)^n < (2n + 1)^n approx (2n)^n e^{frac{1}{2}}      5. Instead, reformulate the comparison directly (for clarity, we will restate the transformed logarithmic behavior):          logleft((2n-1)^n + (2n)^nright) < logleft((2n)^n e^{frac{1}{2}}right)          Simplify:          logleft((2n)^nleft(1 + left(frac{2n-1}{2n}right)^nright)right)< n log(2n) + frac{1}{2}      6. We know that:          left(frac{2n-1}{2n}right)^n = left(1 - frac{1}{2n}right)^n approx e^{-frac{1}{2}}          for large n. Hence:          logleft((2n)^nright) + logleft(1 + e^{-frac{1}{2}}right) approx nlog(2n) + -frac{1}{2}               Since 1 + e^{-frac{1}{2}} is slightly larger than 1, but the frac{1}{2} factor in the exponential term argumentation ensures that the left side is strictly less than the approximation above. # Conclusion: Thus, we conclude that: (2n-1)^n + (2n)^n < (2n + 1)^n for any natural number n > 2.

This is because the vertex of a parabola is always located on its axis of symmetry. 2. **Direction of the Parabola**:    - If a > 0, the parabola opens upwards.

Depending on the value of a, either could be the smallest or largest, but not the one that cannot be the smallest.    - **f(1)**: This value is not on the vertex and is not symmetrically paired with any of the other given options.

Given the symmetry and the direction of the parabola, we can conclude that: - When a > 0, f(2) is guaranteed to be the smallest among the given options because it is the vertex and the parabola opens upwards. - When a < 0, either f(-1) or f(5) could be the smallest as they are on the \\"ends\\" of the parabola, which opens downwards. Therefore, the one value that cannot be the smallest among f(-1), f(1), f(2), and f(5), considering the symmetry and direction of the parabola, is f(1).

We have an inscribed quadrilateral ABCD, and the extensions of its opposite sides intersect at points P and Q. Let K and N be the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD, respectively. 1. Consider triangles ACP and BDP. Since angle CPA and angle CPB both subtend the same arc CB on the circumcircle of ABCD, it follows that angle CPA = angle CPB. Additionally, the triangles ACP and BDP share the common angle at P. 2. By the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion, triangles ACP and BDP are similar. Consequently, the corresponding medians from vertices A and B to points K and N in these triangles will also create similar sub-triangles ANP and BKP. 3. Since the triangles ANP and BKP are similar, we know that their corresponding angles are equal, which implies angle ANP = angle BKP. 4. Similarly, consider triangles ACQ and DBQ.

Notice that each 1x3 rectangle will always contain exactly one red, one blue, and one green square. This is because of the repeating pattern of the colors. 4. **Counting the Colors**: Initially, the board has:    - 6 red squares    - 6 blue squares    - 4 green squares 5. **Invariance**: Each move changes the color of one red, one blue, and one green square. Therefore, the number of red, blue, and green squares will always change by the same amount. This means that the difference in the number of red, blue, and green squares remains invariant. 6. **Impossibility of Equalizing Colors**: Since the initial number of red, blue, and green squares are not equal (6 red, 6 blue, and 4 green), and each move changes one of each color, it is impossible to make all squares black. This is because making all squares black would require an equal number of red, blue, and green squares to be flipped an equal number of times, which is not possible given the initial unequal distribution. Therefore, it is not possible to make all the 1x1 squares black after several moves. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the function ( f(x) = kx^2 + kx + 1 ) has a maximum value of 4 in the interval ([2, 2]), the value of the real number ( k ) is ( ) A.

If only whole square pieces are used, and the board is to be completely covered, what is the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper?","output":"To find the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper that can be used to cover the board completely without any overlap or gaps, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the length and width of the board. The GCD will give us the largest square size that can be used to tile the board perfectly. The board measures 77 cm by 93 cm. Let's find the GCD of 77 and 93. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD: 1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder. 2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from step 1. 3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The non-zero remainder just before this is the GCD. Let's apply this to 77 and 93: 93 ÷ 77 gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16 (since 93 = 77 * 1 + 16). Now we replace the larger number (93) with the smaller number (77), and the smaller number (77) with the remainder (16), and repeat the process: 77 ÷ 16 gives us a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 9 (since 77 = 16 * 4 + 9). Now we replace 77 with 16 and 16 with 9: 16 ÷ 9 gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 7 (since 16 = 9 * 1 + 7). Now we replace 16 with 9 and 9 with 7: 9 ÷ 7 gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2 (since 9 = 7 * 1 + 2). Now we replace 9 with 7 and 7 with 2: 7 ÷ 2 gives us a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 1 (since 7 = 2 * 3 + 1). Now we replace 7 with 2 and 2 with 1: 2 ÷ 1 gives us a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0 (since 2 = 1 * 2 + 0). Since we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1. Therefore, the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper is boxed{1}  cm. This means that Martin can use 1 cm x 1 cm squares to cover the entire board without any gaps or overlaps."},{"instruction":"A play has one male role, one female role, and four roles that can be either gender.

These 11 actors are available for the four either-gender roles. The number of ways to assign these roles is calculated by choosing 4 actors out of 11, then assigning specific roles:    - Choose 4 actors out of 11: (binom{11}{4}) ways.    - Assign roles to these 4 actors: (4!) (4 factorial) ways to assign the specific roles to the chosen 4 actors.    The total number of ways to assign the either-gender roles is (binom{11}{4} times 4!).     4. **Total number of ways**: Multiplying all the possibilities together gives:    [    6 times 7 times binom{11}{4} times 4! = 6 times 7 times 330 times 24 = 33120    ]    Therefore, the total number of ways to assign the six roles is (boxed{33120})."},{"instruction":"Given any angle alpha, the terminal side intersects the unit circle at point P_1(x, y).

Similarly for angle alpha + theta, since the terminal side intersects the unit circle at point P_2(y, -x), we get: sin(alpha+theta) = y,quad cos(alpha+theta) = -x. Comparing the values obtained with the given options: For sin(alpha+theta), we have y which is equal to sin(alpha), so option A is incorrect. On the other hand, since cos(alpha) = x, sin(alpha+theta) = y does not lead us to option B either. Now, looking at cos(alpha+theta), we see it equals -x, which is actually -cos(alpha), so options C and D are both incorrect with respect to the cosine. Upon revisiting the sine function, we recognize a mistake in the initial comparison: we should have acknowledged that x = cos(alpha) and therefore, sin(alpha+theta) = -x = -cos(alpha).

Together, Peter and Randy drew a total of 8 + 5 = 13 pictures. Since the three of them drew 41 pictures altogether, we can find out how many pictures Quincy drew by subtracting the number of pictures Peter and Randy drew from the total number of pictures. So, Quincy drew 41 - 13 = 28 pictures.

We know the sum is 78 and the last number is 12. We need to find the first number and the number of terms n. Let's call the first number x. The series would then be x, x+1, x+2, ..., 12. The number of terms n can be found by subtracting the first number from the last number and adding 1 (since we're including both the first and last numbers in the count): n = 12 - x + 1 n = 13 - x Now we can plug n and the last number into the sum formula and solve for x: 78 = (n/2) * (x + 12) 78 = ((13 - x)/2) * (x + 12) To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 156 = (13 - x) * (x + 12) Now we have a quadratic equation: 156 = 13x + 12x - x^2 - 12x 156 = 13x - x^2 Rearrange the terms to set the equation to 0: x^2 - 13x + 156 = 0 Now we can factor the quadratic equation: (x - 12)(x - 1) = 0 This gives us two possible solutions for x: x = 12 or x = 1 Since the starting number must be the smallest number in the sequence and less than 12, the starting number is x = boxed{1} ."},{"instruction":"For the past n days, the average daily production at a company was 50 units.

The average daily production for those n days was 50 units, so we can write: P = n * 50 Today, the company produced 60 units, so the new total production is: P + 60 The new average daily production after including today's production is 55 units, and the total number of days is now n + 1. So we can write: (P + 60) / (n + 1) = 55 Now we can substitute the expression for P from the first equation into the second equation: (n * 50 + 60) / (n + 1) = 55 Now we solve for n: 50n + 60 = 55n + 55 Subtract 50n from both sides: 60 = 5n + 55 Subtract 55 from both sides: 5 = 5n Divide both sides by 5: 1 = n So the value of n is boxed{1} .

Each vertex connects to four edges. 4. **Shortest Path Configuration**: A practical unfolding for the shortest path calculation involves considering the pyramid structure. The insect starting at the midpoint of an edge on one of the bottom triangles can move directly upward to the apex of the pyramid (a vertex of the octahedron). 5. **Calculating the Path Length**: To reach the closest vertex on the same pyramid, the insect would travel a straight line segment from the midpoint to the apex of the pyramid. This segment is perpendicular to the base edge, forming a right triangle with the half-edge and the line segment as legs.

If any ( x_i = 0 ), we can remove it from the system without loss of generality. 2. **Rewriting the System**:    Let ( k ) be the number of non-zero ( x_i ). We can rewrite the system as:    [    begin{cases}    a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + cdots + a_k x_k = 0     a_1 x_1^2 + a_2 x_2^2 + cdots + a_k x_k^2 = 0     vdots     a_1 x_1^n + a_2 x_2^n + cdots + a_k x_k^n = 0    end{cases}    ]    where ( a_i > 0 ) and ( x_i neq 0 ). 3. **Grouping Equal Numbers**:    Suppose we group equal numbers among ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k ).

First, let's calculate the area of each ring. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where r is the radius of the circle. Since we are given the diameters, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2. For ring x (diameter = 16 inches): Radius (r_x) = Diameter_x / 2 = 16 inches / 2 = 8 inches Area (A_x) = π * (r_x)² = π * (8 inches)² = π * 64 square inches For ring y (diameter = 18 inches): Radius (r_y) = Diameter_y / 2 = 18 inches / 2 = 9 inches Area (A_y) = π * (r_y)² = π * (9 inches)² = π * 81 square inches For ring z (diameter = 20 inches): Radius (r_z) = Diameter_z / 2 = 20 inches / 2 = 10 inches Area (A_z) = π * (r_z)² = π * (10 inches)² = π * 100 square inches Now, let's find the uncovered fractions: For ring x: Ring x is entirely covered by ring y, so there is no uncovered fraction for ring x. The uncovered fraction is 0. For ring z: Ring z is partially covered by ring y. To find the uncovered fraction of ring z, we need to subtract the area of ring y from the area of ring z and then divide by the total area of ring z.

Let us denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c according to their respective lengths of 5, 7, and 8. Since the sides are in proportion, we can directly assume these values as their lengths for computational convenience. The largest angle, which we will denote as theta_C, is opposite to the longest side c=8; likewise, the smallest angle, denoted theta_A, is opposite to the shortest side a=5. We wish to determine the sum of these two angles: theta_A+theta_C. First, we compute angle theta_B, which is opposite to side b=7 and is not the largest or smallest angle in the triangle. The law of cosines for angle theta_B states that cos theta_B = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}. Substituting the given side lengths into this formula, we have cos theta_B = frac{5^2 + 8^2 - 7^2}{2 times 5 times 8} = frac{25 + 64 - 49}{80} = frac{40}{80} = frac{1}{2}. Since cos theta_B = frac{1}{2} and theta_B is an angle of a triangle, it must be acute, which implies that theta_B = 60^{circ} given the basic trigonometric values for cosine. With the knowledge that the sum of angles in any triangle is 180^{circ}, we can now deduce the sum of the largest and smallest angles through the relationship: theta_A + theta_B + theta_C = 180^{circ}.

In the special case where AB = BC, it is obvious that point D must be directly opposite to point B.    - If AB < BC, the point D will be such that DA > DC. 3. **Measurement and Calculation**:    - Consider DA = DP + CD such that DP is a segment to be measured.        \`\`\`math    AP = AD - DP = AD - CD = AB - BC    \`\`\` 4. **Construction of the Isosceles Triangle**:    - The triangle CDP is isosceles with the exterior angle at D equal to angle ABC = beta, because ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Knowing AB, BC, and the angles, we can draw the tangents to intersect k from point A.    - Center O lies on the bisectors of angles angle ABC and angle DCB.

Comparing the values of k from both approaches: k = frac{3}{13} = -3lambda implies lambda = -frac{1}{13}. Substitute the value of lambda back into the first equation to check consistency: 1-2k = 7lambda implies 1-2left(frac{3}{13}right) = 7left(-frac{1}{13}right), 1-frac{6}{13} = -frac{7}{13} implies frac{13}{13} - frac{6}{13} = -frac{7}{13}, frac{7}{13} = -frac{7}{13}, which is a contradiction.

We use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s: Relative speed in m/s = 60 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 60 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 600 / 36 Relative speed in m/s = 16.6666666667 m/s (approximately) Now we have the relative speed in meters per second and the time it takes for the train to cross the man in seconds. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The distance the train travels while crossing the man is equal to the length of the train (L): L = Relative speed * Time L = 16.6666666667 m/s * 41.9966402687785 s Now we calculate the length of the train: L ≈ 16.6666666667 m/s * 41.9966402687785 s L ≈ 700 m (approximately) Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{700}  meters."},{"instruction":"a long river, there are fifteen stepping stones arranged in a straight line labeled from 0 to 14.

Clearly, the decimal representation of ( m_1^2 = 1 ) consists of 1 one, fulfilling the condition for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step**:    Assume the number ( m_n ) has been constructed such that its decimal representation ends with one and the representation of ( m_n^2 ) ends with a combination of ( n ) ones and twos. 3. **Construction of ( m_{n+1} )**:    Consider numbers of the form ( p_k = m_n + k cdot 10^n ), where ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 9 ). Each ( p_k ) ends with the digit 1 because ( m_n ) ends with 1. We need to explore the decimal representations of ( p_k^2 ). 4. **Expansion of ( p_k^2 )**:    [    p_k^2 = (m_n + k cdot 10^n)^2 = m_n^2 + 2k cdot m_n cdot 10^n + k^2 cdot 10^{2n}    ]    Analyze the last ( n+1 ) digits of the individual terms:    - The digits of ( m_n^2 ) end with a combination of ( n ) ones and twos.    - The term ( 2k cdot m_n cdot 10^n ) ends with ( n ) zeros preceded by the last digit of ( 2k ) since ( m_n ) ends in 1.    - The term ( k^2 cdot 10^{2n} ) ends with ( 2n ) zeros.    Therefore, the combination of digits in ( p_k^2 ) will affect only the last ( n+1 ) digits, which contains the digits from ( m_n^2 ) and possibly the influence of ( 2k ). 5. **Selection of ( k )**:    - Let ( a ) be the ((n+1))-th digit from the end of ( m_n^2 ). The digit ( a + 2k mod 10 ) can cover all possible digits when ( k in {0, 1, 2, dots, 9}).    - Select ( k ) such that the resulting digit is a part of the combination consisting of ( n+1 ) ones and twos. 6. **Inductive Conclusion**:    Thus, there exists a ( k ) such that the decimal representation of ( p_k^2 ) ends with the required pattern. We can then set ( m_{n+1} = p_k ), ensuring that ( m_{n+1} ) meets the criteria. 7. **Verification**:    To verify that ( q_n cdot 10^l + m_n ) also fits the requirement, where ( q_n ) is a number with the first ( n ) digits being 1s:    [    q_n^2 approx c_n + 10^{4n}, text{ where } c_n text{ is } n text{ ones} ldots    ]    Construct:    [    left( q_n cdot 10^l + m_n right)^2 = q_n^2 cdot 10^{2l} + 2q_n cdot m_n cdot 10^l + m_n^2    ]    The new number satisfies the ending condition and begins with the required number of ones. Thus, the inductive construction enables us to always find a number ( m_n ) for any natural ( n ) whose square's decimal representation starts with ( n ) ones and ends with a combination of ( n ) ones and twos.

Let's denote the sides of triangle (ABC) with the usual notation: (a=BC), (b=CA), (c=AB). The given condition states that (b = 2sqrt{ac}), thus (b^2 = 4ac). Assume (a < c), because if (a = c), then (b = 2a = a+c), which does not satisfy the triangle inequality. 2. Let (F) be the midpoint of (AC), (B') the foot of the perpendicular from (B) to (AC). Also, let (BF = s_b), (BB' = m), the acute angle we need to consider is (angle BFC = varphi), and (FB' = e). 3. In right triangles (BB'A), (BB'C), and (BB'F), we have the following Pythagorean relations:    [    begin{aligned}    & c^2 = m^2 + left(frac{b}{2} + eright)^2,     & a^2 = m^2 + left(frac{b}{2} - eright)^2,     & m^2 + e^2 = s_b^2.    end{aligned}    ] 4. Using the equation for (s_b^2), we can rewrite the previous two equations:    [    begin{aligned}    & c^2 = s_b^2 + frac{b^2}{4} + be,     & a^2 = s_b^2 + frac{b^2}{4} - be.    end{aligned}    ] 5.

Therefore, the angle (varphi), opposite to the leg (BB') in the right triangle (BB'F), should be less than (45^circ). So we have:    [    varphi < 45^circ    ]    Thus, we have proven that the acute angle formed by (AC) and the median is less than (45^circ). Next, for finding the bounds of the angle if the triangle is acute-angled: 7. Since all angles in (ABC) are acute, the point (B) is outside the circle with diameter (AC). Consequently, (s_b > frac{b}{2}) and the point (B') is inside (FC), meaning (e < frac{b}{2}). From subtracting twice equation (3) from two times equation (4) divided by (b^2), we get:    [    2m^2 = s_b^2 left[1 - 2left(frac{s_b}{b}right)^2right] < s_b^2 left[1 - 2left(frac{1}{2}right)^2right] = frac{s_b^2}{2}    ]    Thus,    [    m < frac{s_b}{2}, quad sin varphi = frac{m}{s_b} < frac{1}{2}, quad varphi < 30^circ    ] For the lower bound on (varphi), we substitute (e = s_b cos varphi) and (m = s_b sin varphi):    [    frac{b^2}{2}left(cos^2 varphi - sin^2 varphiright) = s_b^2 implies cos 2varphi = frac{s_b^2}{frac{b^2}{2}} = frac{1}{2}    ] Thus, from (e < frac{b}{2}):    [    frac{b^2}{2} cos 2varphi = s_b^2 implies cos 2varphi < frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} approx 0.6180    ] So, (2varphi > 51.8^circ) thus, ( varphi > 25.9^circ).

So the player with the winning strategy hits all of the even numbers while the other player hits all the odd ones, guaranteeing that the player with the winning strategy hits ( 4n ) or ( 4n+2 ), causing the other player to lose.         - **Case 2.2**: The other player makes the number ( 2n ). The player with the winning strategy doubles it to make it ( 4n ). In the ( 4n ) case, they win, while in the ( 4n+2 ) case, they force the other player to make the number ( 4n+1 ), in which case they make it ( 4n+2 ) and win as well. 4. **Base Cases**:     - For ( n = 2 ), Player 1 automatically loses, so Player 2 wins.     - For ( n = 4 ), Player 1 can double 2 to get 4, forcing Player 2 to lose.     - For ( n = 6 ), Player 1 can double 2 to get 4, forcing Player 2 to make the number 5, and then Player 1 makes the number 6 and wins. 5. **Induction**:     - By using induction, we can prove that Player 2 wins if and only if ( n ) is of the form ( 2^{2k+1} + 2c ), where ( k ) is any nonnegative integer and ( c ) is a corresponding nonnegative integer such that ( c < 2^k ).

We can rewrite it in the form of a Pell-like equation:    [    y^2 - 3x^2 = 3x + 1    ] 5. To solve this, we consider the transformation to a standard Pell's equation. Let ( u = 2y ) and ( v = 2x + 1 ). Then:    [    u^2 - 3v^2 = 1    ]    This is a standard Pell's equation. 6. The fundamental solution to the Pell's equation ( u^2 - 3v^2 = 1 ) is ( (u, v) = (2, 1) ). All solutions can be generated from this fundamental solution using the recurrence relations:    [    u_{n+1} = 7u_n + 12v_n    ]    [    v_{n+1} = 4u_n + 7v_n    ] 7.

We observe that ( u_n ) is always even, and we can write ( u_n = 2y_n ). Therefore, ( y_n = frac{u_n}{2} ). 9. We also observe that ( v_n ) is always odd. Let ( v_n = 2x_n + 1 ). Then:    [    y_n^2 = 3x_n^2 + 3x_n + 1    ] 10. Finally, we need to show that ( y_n ) is the sum of two consecutive squares. We can write:     [     y_n = left( frac{v_n - 1}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{v_n + 1}{2} right)^2     ]     This follows from the fact that ( v_n ) is odd, and thus ( frac{v_n - 1}{2} ) and ( frac{v_n + 1}{2} ) are consecutive integers.

The moves alternate, starting with the butterfly. If the butterfly reaches the branches, it escapes (it wins). If the spider reaches the butterfly, it eats it (and it wins).

The strategy for the butterfly involves moving along its ring in a direction opposite to the spider's. Given the provided web structure with either three or four rings and the constant seven radii (R=7), this movement ensures symmetry, making it impossible for the spider to catch the butterfly before it reaches a new ring or branch.

How many bags of rice and flour were there originally?","output":"Let's denote the original number of rice bags as x. According to the problem, the number of flour bags is then (351 - x). Based on the given conditions, we can establish the equation:   (x + 20) - 3 times (351 - x - 50) = 1,   Solving this equation, we get:   x = 221,   Subtracting this from 351 gives us 130 bags for the other item;   Therefore, originally there were 221 bags of rice and 130 bags of flour.   Thus, the answer is: boxed{221, 130}.   To solve this problem, we set the original number of rice bags as x, and based on the problem statement, the number of flour bags is (351 - x). Using the relationship: (number of rice bags + 20) - 3 times (number of flour bags - 50) = 1, we can establish an equation to solve the problem.

To understand this step-by-step, let's recall that: 1. An existential statement asserts the existence of at least one object in the domain that satisfies a certain property. In this case, the existential statement claims that there exists at least one real number x_0 such that its base-2 logarithm is less than or equal to zero. 2. The negation of an existential statement is a universal statement. This means we deny the existence of such an object by claiming that no object in the domain satisfies the property. 3. Therefore, we negate the original proposition by claiming that for all real numbers x, their base-2 logarithms are strictly greater than zero.

Denote the set of participants by ( P ). 2. **Building a Sequence**:    We start arranging the participants in a sequence such that every participant in the sequence is acquainted with their immediate neighbors in the sequence. This sequence-building process will eventually involve all participants. 3. **Completion of the Sequence**:    Assume that the process ends after constructing a segment where each participant except the last is placed in the sequence. Denote the last participant added to the sequence as ( A ), and let ( B ) and ( C ) be two of the participants in the sequence who are acquainted with ( A ) but are not adjacent to ( A ) in the current linear arrangement. 4. **Analysis of Positions**:    Consider the relative positions of ( A ) and its friends ( B ) and ( C ) in the sequence. There are a few cases to analyze:    - If ( A ) and ( B ) (or ( A ) and ( C )) are separated by an even number of participants, then these participants, together with ( A ) and ( B ) (or ( A ) and ( C )), form the desired even-sized group. This is because the connections ensure each participant knows their immediate neighbors in the round setup. 5. **Both Distances Even**:    Suppose that both distances of ( A ) to ( B ) and ( A ) to ( C ) are even. In this case, the number of participants between ( B ) and ( C ) must be odd. Consequently, together with ( A ) and ( C ), as well as all participants between ( B ) and ( C ), they form the desired group with even number relationships around the table ensuring acquaintance with immediate neighbors. 6. **Conclusion**:    We demonstrated that such an arrangement is always possible under the given conditions, guaranteeing that we can always form such a group, sitting around a table, satisfying the required conditions.

Выберите один или несколько ответов *.txt File.* *.* f*e.* *.tx. *.? *.???","output":"Чтобы найти файл \`file.txt\` с помощью команды \`find\`, можно использовать следующие маски: - \`*.*\` - это маска найдет все файлы, содержащие точку в имени, что соответствует файлу \`file.txt\`. - \`f*e.*\` - это маска соответствует файлам, начинающимся на \`f\`, за которым может следовать любое количество символов (включая ноль символов) перед буквой \`e\`, и оканчивающиеся на \`.\`, с любым расширением. - \`*.txt\` - это маска подходит точно под \`file.txt\`, так как она ищет файлы с расширением \`.txt\`. - \`*.???\` - эта маска найдет файлы с расширением из трех символов, что также подходит под \`file.txt\`. Остальные маски не столь подходящи или несоответствующи для поиска файла с точным именем \`file.txt\`: - \`File.*\` не подойдет, если учесть, что UNIX-подобные системы чувствительны к регистру. - \`*.tx.\` и \`*.?\` не соответствуют имени требуемого файла по формату или длине расширения."},{"instruction":"Что показывает метрика Load Average в Linux?

Среднее значение нагрузки на систему за определенный промежуток времени. Обычно, значения показываются за последние 1, 5 и 15 минут. 2. Количество процессов, находящихся в состоянии RUNNING и UNINTERRUPTIBLE. Это означает, что в расчет включаются как процессы, активно использующие CPU (RUNNING), так и процессы, ожидающие определенных событий или завершения ввода/вывода и не могущие быть прерванными (UNINTERRUPTIBLE). Таким образом, Load Average - это среднее количество работающих (выполняющихся и ожидающих выполнения) процессов за определенный промежуток времени, что может служить индикатором загруженности системы."},{"instruction":"Какие ресурсы \\"пожирают\\" зомби процессы? Выберите один или несколько ответов Пространство на диске Память ЦПУ Ничего из вышеперечисленных","output":"Зомби процессы в операционных системах на базе UNIX/Linux — это завершившиеся процессы, которые все еще занимают запись в таблице процессов, потому что их родительский процесс не вызвал еще системный вызов wait() для чтения статуса завершения. Обычно, зомби процессы не \\"пожирают\\" активные ресурсы системы, такие как ЦПУ и память, но они все еще занимают место в таблице процессов, что может быть ограниченным ресурсом в случае большого количества зомби процессов. Таким образом, правильный ответ: - Ничего из вышеперечисленных"},{"instruction":"Какая команда используется для вывода инструкции и описания команды в консоли? Выберите один или несколько ответов show info man help","output":"Для вывода инструкции и описания команды в консоли Linux/UNIX используются следующие команды: - \`info\` - команда, которая выводит подробную информацию о других командах и программах на системе, обычно в виде улучшенной справки с возможностью навигации. - \`man\` - команда, вызывающая руководство пользователя или \\"доводчик\\" для большинства команд и программ (от \\"manual\\"). Выводит подробную справку по командам и программам. - \`help\` - во многих оболочках (например, в Bash) команда выводит базовую справку по встроенным командам оболочки.

Выберите один или несколько ответов Для контроля за ресурсами системы, которые использует процесс Получить информацию о статусе процесса Для обеспечения возможности параллельного запуска программ Получить результаты работы программы / процесса Дать пользователю возможность что-то сообщить процессу Ответить","output":"Сигналы в Linux используются не только для завершения процессов, но и для других целей: - **Получить информацию о статусе процесса.** Например, сигнал SIGCHLD используется родительским процессом для оповещения о том, что дочерний процесс завершился или был остановлен. - **Дать пользователю возможность что-то сообщить процессу.** Примером может служить сигнал SIGHUP, который обычно сообщает о том, что пользовательский терминал был отключен, но также может быть использован для перезагрузки конфигурации приложения без его перезапуска. Остальные утверждения менее точно отражают использование сигналов в Linux: - **Для контроля за ресурсами системы, которые использует процесс.** Сигналы не предназначены специфически для мониторинга или контроля использования ресурсов процессом. - **Для обеспечения возможности параллельного запуска программ.** Параллельный запуск программ обычно достигается через механизмы управления задачами, например, путем форка и асинхронного выполнения, а не через сигналы. - **Получить результаты работы программы / процесса.** Получение результатов работы программы обычно осуществляется через механизмы ввода-вывода (stdout, stderr), а не сигналы. Сигналы могут использоваться для управления состоянием процесса (например, прекратить его выполнение), но не для получения результатов его работы напрямую."},{"instruction":"Выберете неверное утверждение о ядре операционной системы Linux: Выберите один или несколько ответов Ядро управляет пользовательскими задачами Драйверы физических устройств не могут быть частью ядра Код ядра всегда выполняется в привилегированном режиме Ядро управляет внешними устройствами Ядро является единственной программой, код которой выполняется в привилегированном режиме центрального процессора","output":"Неверное утверждение о ядре операционной системы Linux: - Драйверы физических устройств не могут быть частью ядра На самом деле, драйверы физических устройств могут быть и часто являются частью ядра в операционной системе Linux. Одна из особенностей Linux — возможность встраивания драйверов устройств непосредственно в ядро (как модули ядра, которые можно загрузить или выгрузить по требованию, так и в виде статически скомпилированных частей ядра). Это обеспечивает более эффективное взаимодействие с аппаратным обеспечением и может повысить производительность и стабильность системы."},{"instruction":"Выберите верные утверждения про идентификатор пользователя в системах семейства Unix: Выберите один или несколько ответов Идентификатор пользователя, равный 1 это идентификатор суперпользователя Каждый пользователь входит в минимум одну группу Идентификатор представляет собой неотрицательные целые числа Пользователь может быть идентифицирован не только по UID, но и по логину","output":"Из предложенных утверждений верными про идентификатор пользователя в системах семейства Unix являются: - Каждый пользователь входит в минимум одну группу. В Unix-подобных системах каждый пользователь обязательно принадлежит хотя бы к одной группе, а в большинстве случаев — к главной (первичной) группе. - Идентификатор представляет собой неотрицательные целые числа. Идентификаторы пользователей (UID) и групп (GID) в Unix и Unix-подобных системах представляют собой неотрицательные целые числа. - Пользователь может быть идентифицирован не только по UID, но и по логину. Действительно, в системах можно обращаться к пользователю как по его идентификатору (UID), так и по имени (логину) пользователя. Неверное утверждение: - Идентификатор пользователя, равный 1 это идентификатор суперпользователя. На самом деле, идентификатор суперпользователя (root) в системах Unix и Unix-подобных системах равен 0. UID, равный 1, обычно принадлежит специальным системным аккаунтам, но не суперпользователю."},{"instruction":"Каким из перечисленных способов можно посмотреть содержимое переменной окружения PATH? Выберите один или несколько ответов printenv PATH echo PATH cat /etc/environment export | grep PATH","output":"Содержимое переменной окружения \`PATH\` можно посмотреть следующими способами: 1. \`printenv PATH\` - команда \`printenv\` выводит значения указанных переменных окружения. Если указать \`PATH\`, будет выведено её текущее значение. 2. \`echo PATH\` - команда \`echo\` выводит текст или значение переменных. Использование \`PATH\` позволяет вывести текущее значение переменной окружения \`PATH\`. 3. \`export | grep PATH\` - команда \`export\` выводит список всех экспортированных переменных и их значений в текущем сеансе shell. Использование \`grep PATH\` позволяет отфильтровать этот список и показать строки, связанные с переменной \`PATH\`. Способ с использованием \`cat /etc/environment\` частично правильный, однако это файл конфигурации, в котором переменная окружения может быть определена для системы, но это не гарантирует, что именно эта настройка будет актуальна для текущего сеанса, поскольку переменная \`PATH\` может быть модифицирована в различных скриптах и файлах конфигураций или даже во время выполнения текущего сеанса. Таким образом, содержимое \`/etc/environment\` отражает начальные настройки и может не соответствовать текущему значению переменной окружения \`PATH\` в вашем терминале."},{"instruction":"вопрос 11 из 12 1 балл Предположим, ты находишься на собственном сервере и хочешь посмотреть историю неудачных попыток входа. Какие из перечисленных команд тебе точно не помогут? Выберите один или несколько ответов history last cat lastb ps","output":"Из перечисленных команд следующие не помогут вам посмотреть историю неудачных попыток входа: 1. \`history\` - команда \`history\` показывает историю команд, введенных текущим пользователем в консоли, а не историю входов или неудачных попыток входа. 2. \`ps\` - команда \`ps\` используется для отображения информации о текущих активных процессах, а не для просмотра истории входов или неудачных попыток входа. Команды \`last\` и \`lastb\`, а также использование \`cat\` для просмотра логов являются корректными способами для изучения истории успешных попыток входа (команда \`last\`) и неудачных попыток входа (команда \`lastb\`) или просмотра соответствующих лог-файлов (использование \`cat\`)."},{"instruction":"Что из перечисленного сделает то же самое, что \\"umask 0002 && touch file\\" ? Выберите один или несколько ответов touch file && chmod 644 file touch file && chmod 775 file touch file && chmod 664 file touch file && chmod 002 file touch file && chmod 755 file","output":"Команда \`umask\` задаёт маску создания файлов для текущего сеанса оболочки и влияет на разрешения новых файлов и директорий. \`umask 0002\` означает, что новые файлы будут создаваться с разрешениями, которые вычитаются из полного набора разрешений (обычно 666 для файлов и 777 для директорий, в зависимости от системы и настроек). То есть, при umask 0002 новые файлы будут создаваться с разрешениями 664 (666 - 002 = 664), что представляет собой права чтения и записи для владельца и группы, и только чтение для других. Учитывая это, команда, которая будет иметь аналогичный эффект по созданию файла с такими же разрешениями, это: - \`touch file && chmod 664 file\` Остальные команды задают другие права доступа, не соответствующие изменениям, производимым командой \`umask 0002 && touch file\`: - \`touch file && chmod 644 file\` - задаст права чтения и записи для владельца и только чтения для группы и других. - \`touch file && chmod 775 file\` - задаст права чтения, записи и выполнения для владельца и группы, и права чтения и выполнения для других. - \`touch file && chmod 002 file\` - не корректно для этого контекста, так как такая команда попытается задать права доступа, которые не соответствуют стандартным практикам создания файлов. - \`touch file && chmod 755 file\` - задаст права чтения, записи и выполнения для владельца и только чтения и выполнения для группы и других. Таким образом, только \`touch file && chmod 664 file\` будет делать то же самое, что \\"umask 0002 && touch file\\" по заданию разрешений для нового файла."},{"instruction":"Какие виды тестирования применимы для веб-приложений: Выберите один или несколько ответов Функциональное Все ответы верны Нефункциональное Регрессионное Приемочное","output":"Для веб-приложений применимы следующие виды тестирования: - **Функциональное** - тестирование, направленное на проверку специфических функций работы веб-приложения. Основной вопрос, который ставится перед тестировщиком: \\"Работает ли функция правильно?\\" - **Нефункциональное** - тестирование охватывает все аспекты приложения, которые не связаны напрямую с конкретными функциями или пользовательскими сценариями, например, производительность приложения, его безопасность, удобство использования, совместимость с различными браузерами и операционными системами. - **Регрессионное** - тестирование проводится после внесения изменений в код, чтобы убедиться, что новый код не нарушил или не изменил ожидаемое поведение существующей функциональности. - **Приемочное** - тестирование на последнем этапе разработки, предназначенное чтобы убедиться, что веб-приложение соответствует всем требованиям и готово к эксплуатации конечными пользователями.

Есть большая разница между общей статистикой использования и статистикой использования вашего конкретного приложения. Ваша аудитория может значительно отличаться от общей статистики. 2. **Самый популярный браузер по статистике использования из интернет.** Это также важный аспект тестирования, поскольку вам нужно убедиться, что ваше приложение функционирует корректно в браузере, который является самым распространенным среди пользователей интернета в целом. Это помогает максимизировать охват аудитории и гарантировать лучший пользовательский опыт для большинства ваших пользователей. Выбор \\"Любой привычный браузер\\" может быть актуален для предварительных проверок или ранних этапов разработки, но для всестороннего тестирования это подход недостаточен. Необходимо тестировать приложение в различных браузерах и версиях, которые популярны среди вашей целевой аудитории, а также рассматривать использование мобильных браузеров, если целевая аудитория активно использует мобильные устройства. Таким образом, самым полным ответом будет сочетание понимания потребностей вашей конкретной аудитории и общих тенденций использования браузеров."},{"instruction":"При тестировании веб-сайта возникла ошибка. Ваши действия: Выберите один или несколько ответов Заведу баг, приложу скриншот страницы с ошибкой Заведу баг, приложу скриншот с ошибкой и логи из консоли браузера Напишу разработчику шаги","output":"При обнаружении ошибки при тестировании веб-сайта, наилучшими практиками для эффективного устранения проблемы будут следующие действия: 1. **Заведу баг, приложу скриншот страницы с ошибкой.** Скриншот поможет разработчику или другим членам команды быстро оценить визуальный контекст ошибки. 2. **Заведу баг, приложу скриншот с ошибкой и логи из консоли браузера.** Логи консоли браузера могут содержать важные сообщения об ошибках, предупреждения и другую диагностическую информацию, которая помогает в идентификации и диагностике проблемы. Это особенно полезно, если проблема возникает из-за JavaScript ошибок или проблем с загрузкой ресурсов. 3. **Напишу разработчику шаги.** Описание шагов для воспроизведения ошибки критически важно. Чем подробнее и точнее будут описаны шаги, тем проще разработчику понять и исправить проблему. Включите в описание все условия, при которых возникает ошибка (например, определенный браузер или версия, используемая учетная запись, предшествующие действия).

Henkilöillä, joilla on sävelkorva, on tavallisesti hyvä musikaalinen kuulo, mikä mahdollistaa heidän oppivan musiikkikappaleita kuulemalla, tunnistamaan erilaisia sointuja, äänenkorkeuksia tai melodian muutoksia, ja säveltämään tai sovittamaan musiikkia luontevasti. Sävelkorva voi vaihdella vahvuudeltaan huomattavasti. Toiset voivat luonnostaan tunnistaa ja toistaa säveliä täsmällisesti, kun taas toiset saattavat tarvita paljon harjoitusta kehittääkseen tätä kykyä. Musiikin ammattilaiset ja harrastajat voivat harjoituksen ja kokemuksen kautta kehittää sävelkorvaansa entisestään. On myös tärkeä erottaa absoluuttinen sävelkorva, joka on harvinainen kyky tunnistaa tai tuottaa tietty sävel ilman minkäänlaista äänenkorkeuden vertailupistettä, ja suhteellinen sävelkorva, joka tarkoittaa kykyä tunnistaa sävelten välinen suhde ja äänenkorkeuden muutos suhteessa toiseen säveleeseen.

Sävelpuhtaudella tarkoitetaan kykyä tuottaa tai tunnistaa sävelet niiden oikeassa äänenkorkeudessa ilman värähtelyä tai epätarkkuutta. Tässä muutamia vinkkejä, joiden avulla voit harjoitella ja parantaa sävelpuhtauttasi: 1. **Kuuntele aktiivisesti:** Aloita kuuntelemalla tarkasti ammattilaisten esityksiä ja analysoi, miten he saavuttavat sävelpuhtauden. Kuuntele eri genrejä ja instrumentteja saadaksesi laajan kuvan. 2. **Laula tai soita viritetyn instrumentin kanssa:** Vertaa omaa soittoasi tai laulamistasi viritetyn pianon, kitaran tai jonkin muun soittimen kanssa. Tämä auttaa korjaamaan mahdollisia epäpuhtauksia. 3. **Käytä viritysmittaria:** Viritysmittarit näyttävät visuaalisesti, kuinka lähellä oikeaa äänenkorkeutta olet. Erityisesti laulajille tämä voi olla hyödyllistä oppimisen alkuvaiheessa. 4. **Harjoittele intervallien tunnistamista:** Harjoittele tunnistamaan ja laulamaan eri musiikilliset intervallit (esimerkiksi suuri kolmas, pieni kolmas, kvartti jne.) puhtaasti. Tämä auttaa kehittämään suhteellista sävelkorvaa. 5. **Käytä drone-äänitteitä:** Drone-äänitteet, eli tasaisesti soivat sävelet, voivat auttaa harjoittelemaan vitkää suhtautumista äänenkorkeuteen. Soita tai laula drone-äänitteen päälle, yrittäen pysyä mahdollisimman puhtaasti samassa äänenkorkeudessa. 6. **Hidasta harjoittelua:** Jos opettelet soitinsoittoa, soita kappaleita ja harjoituksia hitaammin kuin normaali esitystempo. Tämä auttaa keskittymään sävelpuhtauden yksityiskohtiin. 7. **Osallistu musiikkiopetukseen:** Ammattitaitoinen opettaja voi antaa arvokasta palautetta ja ohjausta, joka on räätälöity juuri sinun tarpeisiisi ja auttaa sinua kehittymään nopeammin ja tehokkaammin. 8. **Harjoittele säännöllisesti:** Kuten mikä tahansa taito, sävelpuhtauden parantaminen vaatii säännöllistä ja johdonmukaista harjoittelua. 9. **Luo musikaalinen ympäristö:** Kuuntele paljon musiikkia ja osallistu musiikillisiin aktiviteetteihin, kuten kuorolauluun tai yhtyesoittoon, missä voit harjoitella sävelpuhtautta yhdessä muiden kanssa. Muista, että sävelpuhtauden parantaminen on pitkä prosessi, joka vaatii kärsivällisyyttä ja sitoutumista. Pienillä askelilla ja jatkuvalla harjoittelulla voit kuitenkin kehittää kykyäsi tuottaa ja tunnistaa puhtaita säveliä."},{"instruction":"Millainen on oikeaoppinen lauluasento?","output":"Oikeaoppinen lauluasento on perusta hyvälle äänentuotolle ja tehokkaalle hengitystekniikalle laulaessa. Se auttaa myös ehkäisemään väsymystä ja vähentämään äänihuulten ja lihasten rasitusta. Tässä on joitakin keskeisiä seikkoja, jotka kuvaavat oikeaoppista lauluasentoa: 1. **Jalat:** Seiso tukevasti, jalat olkapään leveydellä toisistaan. Toinen jalka voi olla hieman edellä toista tarjoten tasapainoisemman asennon. Jalat pidetään kevyen joustavina, ei lukittuina. 2. **Ryhti:** Pidä selkä suorana, mutta ei jäykkänä. Kuvittele, että pääsi vedetään ylös kohti kattoa ohuella langalla. Tämä auttaa pitämään selkärangan luonnollisessa mutta ryhdikkäässä asennossa. Pidä hartiat alhaalla ja rentoina. 3. **Niska ja pään asento:** Niskan tulisi olla rento ja pään asennon neutraali. Vältä kallistamasta päätäsi ylös tai alas, sillä se voi vaikuttaa äänenkulkureittiin ja hengitykseen. 4. **Käsivarret ja kädet:** Pidä käsivarret rentoina sivuillasi, ellei laulutekniikka tai -esitys vaadi toisin. Kädet eivät saisi olla ristissä vartalon edessä tai lantioilla, sillä se voi rajoittaa diafragmaa. 5. **Hengitys:** Harjoittele diafragmaalista hengitystä, jossa hengität syvään ja tunnet, kuinka vatsasi ja kylkisi laajenevat, kun taas rintakehä liikkuu vähemmän. Tämä antaa vahvemman tukipisteen äänenkäytölle. 6. **Leuka ja kaularangan asento:** Pidä leuka hieman alaviistossa ja kaularanka pitkänä, välttäen leuan työntämistä eteenpäin tai vedettävän liikaa taakse. Älä purista leukaa kiinni vaan pidä se kevyesti suljettuna tai avoimena laulun vaatimusten mukaan. 7. **Suu ja kasvot:** Suun tulisi olla sopivasti avoinna laulettaessa, jotta ääni pääsee kulkemaan vapaasti. Kasvojen lihakset, erityisesti poskien, otsan ja silmien ympärillä, tulisi olla mahdollisiman rentoina. Hyvässä lauluasennossa yhdistyvät tasapaino, tuki ja rentous. Asennon tulisi tuntua mukavalta, ja sen pitäisi mahdollistaa vapaan ja esteettömän äänen tuotto. Oikeaoppisen lauluasennon oppiminen ja sisäistäminen vaatii aikaa ja harjoittelua, mutta se on elintärkeää kaikille laulajille äänen terveyden ja laadun kannalta."},{"instruction":"Mikä vaikuttaa siihen, kuinka matala tai korkea ihmisen puheääni on?","output":"Ihmisen puheäänen korkeuteen vaikuttavat useat anatomiset, fysiologiset ja hormonaaliset tekijät. Äänen taajuus, eli se, kuinka matala tai korkea ääni on, määräytyy lähinnä äänihuulten värähtelyn nopeuden perusteella. Tässä ovat päätekijät, jotka vaikuttavat äänen korkeuteen: 1. **Äänihuulten koko ja paksuus:** Fyysisesti suuremmat ja paksummat äänihuulet värähtelevät hitaammin, mikä tuottaa matalampia ääniä. Pienemmät ja ohuemmat äänihuulet värähtelevät nopeammin, mikä aiheuttaa korkeamman äänen. Miehillä on yleensä suuremmat äänihuulet kuin naisilla, mikä selittää miksi miesten äänet ovat keskimäärin matalampia. 2. **Äänihuulten jännitys:** Kun äänihuulet ovat enemmän jännittyneet, ne värähtelevät nopeammin, mikä tuottaa korkeampia ääniä. Rentoutuneet äänihuulet värähtelevät hitaammin, mikä tuottaa matalampia ääniä. 3. **Hormonaaliset tekijät:** Erityisesti murrosiässä kehon hormonaaliset muutokset vaikuttavat äänihuulten kokoon sekä kaulan ja kurkunpään rakenteeseen, mikä johtaa äänenmurrokseen. Miehillä testosteroni laajentaa äänihuulia ja syventää ääntä enemmän kuin naisilla. 4. **Resonanssi:** Puheäänen korkeuteen vaikuttaa myös, miten ääni resonoi kurkunpään, hengitysteiden, suun ja nenäontelon kautta. Suuremmat resonanssiavaruudet voivat tuottaa syvempiä sävyjä, kun taas pienemmät tilat korostavat korkeampia ääniä. 5. **Ikä:** Äänihuulet ja niiden ympäröivät lihakset voivat heikentyä iän myötä, mikä saattaa vaikuttaa äänen korkeuteen ja sen voimakkuuteen. 6. **Terveys ja elämäntavat:** Polttaminen, äänihuulten ylikuormitus ja tietyt terveysongelmat voivat vaikuttaa äänihuulten toimintaan ja siten äänen sävyyn. Hyvä terveys ja äänihuulten huolellinen käyttö voivat auttaa ylläpitämään äänen laatua. Jokaisella ihmisellä on luontainen äänenkorkeusalueensa, mutta äänenkäyttöä ja -tuottoa voi parantaa ja monipuolistaa ääniharjoituksilla ja teknisellä koulutuksella. Laulajat ja puhujat voivat kehittää kykyään käyttää äänialansa laajemmin ja tehokkaammin äänentuoton ammattilaisten ohjauksessa."},{"instruction":"Luettele äänityypit matalimmasta korkeimpaan.","output":"Äänityypit klassisessa laulussa ja kuoromusiikissa jaetaan usein matalimmasta korkeimpaan seuraavasti.

END IF; END ;\` 这样的结构来避免创建已存在的关系。 # 5. 检查版本控制 - **确保迁移顺序正确**：sqlx 使用版本控制来管理迁移。确保你的迁移版本控制是正确的，旧的迁移不会在新的迁移之后运行。 最后，每次进行数据库迁移时，都应确保你有完整的数据库备份，这样在遇到任何问题时都能够恢复到之前的状态。"},{"instruction":"rust Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080","output":"在 Rust 中，想要创建一个监听在 \`0.0.0.0:8080\` 端口的服务器通常意味着你想要搭建一个Web服务器，该服务器可以接受从任何 IP 地址发来的连接。下面是一个基本的例子，展示了如何使用两个流行的 Web 框架 - [Actix-web](https://actix.rs/) 和 [Tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide)，来实现这个目标。 # 使用 Actix-web 首先，确保你在 \`Cargo.toml\` 文件中添加了 \`actix-web\` 依赖： \`\`\`toml [dependencies] actix-web = \\"4.0\\" \`\`\` 然后，编写一个简单的服务： \`\`\`rust use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};

VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...); \`\`\` 确认你列出的列名和提供的值匹配表的结构，并且每个列的值都符合该列的数据类型和约束。 # 5. 使用数据库管理工具 考虑使用数据库管理工具（如 pgAdmin，DBeaver 或 DataGrip 等）来帮助可视化你的数据库结构。这些工具可以帮助你快速识别问题，例如列名不匹配或是你可能在错误的表中执行操作。 # 解决示例 假设你有以下错误提示： \`\`\`plaintext ERROR: column \\"somecolumn\\" of relation \\"tablename\\" does not exist \`\`\` 你应该首先在数据库中检查 \`\\"tablename\\"\` 表，确认 \`\\"somecolumn\\"\` 列是否真的存在。如果列名实际上是 \`\\"SomeColumn\\"\` 但是你尝试插入到 \`\\"somecolumn\\"\`，你需要更正你的 \`INSERT\` 语句来匹配实际的列名大小写，或者检查列名是否完全正确。"},{"instruction":"postman的Windows客户端怎么填JWT Bearer类型的authentication","output":"使用 Postman 的 Windows 客户端填写 JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Bearer 类型的认证是一种常见的操作，特别是当你在测试需要身份验证的 API 时。这里是如何在 Postman中设置Bearer Token认证的步骤： # 步骤 1: 打开 Postman 并创建/选择一个请求 1. 打开 Postman。 2. 创建一个新的请求或选择一个已经存在的请求。 # 步骤 2: 访问 \\"Authorization\\" 标签页 1. 在请求标签页中，点击 \\"Authorization\\" 选项卡。 # 步骤 3: 选择认证类型 1. 在 \\"Type\\" 下拉菜单中，选择 \\"Bearer Token\\"。 # 步骤 4: 输入你的 JWT 1. 在 \\"Token\\" 字段中，输入你的 JWT。 # 步骤 5: 发送请求 1. 配置好你的请求URL、HTTP方法及任何需要的请求body或参数。 2. 点击 \\"Send\\" 按钮来发送请求。 # 补充说明 - **获取 JWT**: 如果你还没有 JWT，通常你需要先向认证服务器发送登录请求。登录成功后，服务器会在响应中返回 JWT。这个 JWT 之后用于之后的请求，以表明客户端已通过认证。 - **使用环境变量**: 如果你频繁改变 JWT 或其他参数，可以考虑使用 Postman 的环境变量。这样，你可以简单地在请求中引用环境变量，而不是每次都手动复制和粘贴 token。 - **Bearer 认证说明**: 在 HTTP 请求中使用 Bearer Token 认证时，通常会在请求头（Headers）中添加一个字段 \`Authorization\`，其内容为 \\"Bearer \\" 后跟空格和 token 值。选择 \\"Bearer Token\\" 类型认证时，Postman 会自动为你的请求添加这个头。 通过这种方式，Postman使得测试需要 Bearer Token 认证的 API 变得简单和直接。确保你的 JWT 是最新的，因为 JWT 通常具有到期时间。如果收到身份验证相关的错误，首先检查你的 token 是否过期或无效。"},{"instruction":"怎么在request body中填对象","output":"在 Postman 中向请求体（Request Body）中填入对象，通常被用于发送 JSON 或 XML 等格式的数据至 API。以下是如何在 Postman 中发送一个包含对象的 JSON 请求的步骤： # 发送 JSON 对象 1. **选择请求类型：** 打开 Postman 并创建一个新的请求，或者选择一个已经存在的请求。设置正确的 HTTP 方法，如 \`POST\`，因为通常是用来发送数据到服务器。 2. **选择“Body”：** 在请求编辑界面上方，你会看到一排选项卡（如 Params、Authorization、Headers 等），点击“Body”选项卡。 3. **选择“raw”：** 在“Body”选项卡中，有几种数据输入方式，点击“raw”。 4. **选择格式：** 旁边有一个下拉菜单让你选择数据格式，选择 \`JSON\`。 5. **输入 JSON 对象：** 在文本框中，你可以输入 JSON 对象。确保遵循 JSON 格式的规范，比如使用双引号 (\`\\"\`) 来包围属性名和字符串值。例如： \`\`\`json { \\"name\\": \\"John Doe\\", \\"age\\": 30, \\"isMember\\": true, \\"address\\": { \\"street\\": \\"123 Main St\\", \\"city\\": \\"Anytown\\", \\"zipCode\\": \\"12345\\" } } \`\`\` 6. **设置\`Content-Type\`头部：** 为了确保服务器正确解析发送的 JSON 数据，需要设置请求的 \`Content-Type\` 为 \`application/json\`。这可以在“Headers”选项卡中设置。键入 \`Content-Type\` 在键（Key）栏位，值（Value）栏位填写 \`application/json\`。 7. **发送请求：** 确认 URL 指向正确的 API 端点，然后点击 “Send” 按钮发送请求。 通过上述步骤，你就能在 Postman 中发送含有对象的 JSON 请求体了。 # 发送其他格式的对象 - 对于 **XML** 和其他格式，步骤大致相似，但在“raw”数据格式下拉菜单中选择相应格式，并确保请求体以正确的格式编写。 - 对于发送 **表单数据** 或 **x-www-form-urlencoded** 格式的数据，你需要选择对应的选项，并以键值对的形式填入数据。这些格式主要用于简单的文本数据，并不适合复杂的对象或嵌套对象。 # 注意 确保你的 API 期望的请求体格式和结构。如果有疑问，查阅 API 文档以了解期望的数据格式、类型和结构等。这将帮助你正确构造请求并避免服务器解析错误。"},{"instruction":"在rust中使用sqlx::migrate宏对postgre数据库迁移的时候，修改了./migrations下的某个.sql文件，然后在执行rust修改数据库的时候报错说字段不存在，这时应该怎么办","output":"当你使用 \`sqlx::migrate!\` 宏在 Rust 项目中对 PostgreSQL 数据库进行迁移，并且在 \`./migrations\` 目录下修改了某个 \`.sql\` 文件后遇到“字段不存在”这样的错误，可能是因为迁移没有正确应用或者修改的迁移没有被执行。这种情况通常要求你重新确保迁移是按预期执行的。以下是一些解决步骤和建议： # 1. 回滚最近的迁移（如果可能） 如果你的数据库支持回滚，并且你有对应的回滚脚本，尝试回滚最近的几次迁移操作。这可以通过 \`sqlx migrate revert\` 命令（取决于你如何配置 SQLx 的迁移）。回滚到一个已知良好状态，然后再次应用修改后的迁移，可能能够解决问题。 # 2. 检查已应用的迁移状态 检查 \`_sqlx_migrations\` 表或类似的迁移状态表（取决于你的 SQLx 配置）来确定哪些迁移已被应用到数据库。你可以通过执行一个 SQL 查询来完成这个检查： \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM _sqlx_migrations; \`\`\` 确保你修改的迁移脚本对应的记录要么没有出现（表明它没有被应用），要么具备正确的版本号以便你可以重新应用。 # 3. 删除/修改已应用的迁移记录（谨慎操作） 如果迁移已经应用，并且你确信需要重新应用某个迁移，你可以直接修改 \`_sqlx_migrations\` 表来删除或修改那些已应用的迁移记录。**这是一种高风险操作，只有在完全明白你在做什么的情况下才推荐这么做**。在做任何修改前，请确保备份你的数据库。 # 4. 重新运行迁移 在确保修改后的迁移脚本未被应用或者已准备好重新应用的情况下（比如在删除了有问题的迁移记录之后），你可以重新运行迁移命令来应用修改。使用如下命令： \`\`\`bash cargo sqlx migrate run \`\`\` # 5. 检查 SQL 语句的正确性 确保你的 \`.sql\` 迁移文件中的 SQL 语句是正确的，特别是对于你遇到的字段不存在的错误。检查你是否有拼写错误、引用了不存在的字段，或者字段的修改操作是在错误的迁移文件中。 # 6. 观察错误消息和确认 SQLx 版本 - 错误消息可能会给出哪个字段不存在的线索，确保你修改的迁移实际上包含了相应字段的创建或修改操作。 - 确保你使用了最新稳定版的 SQLx。一些修复和改进可能只存在于新版本中。 # 7. 考虑清理并重新构建 在一些情况下，清理项目并重新构建可能有助于解决问题。你可以通过 Cargo 清理你的项目： \`\`\`bash cargo clean \`\`\` 然后再次构建并运行迁移。 通过上述步骤，你应该能够诊断并解决由于修改 \`.sql\` 文件导致的数据库迁移问题。在处理数据库迁移和模式变更时，总是谨慎行事，确保备份重要数据，并在能够安全地进行变更的情况下进行。"},{"instruction":"遇到error[E0277]: the trait bound \`std::string::String: std::convert::From<std::option::Option<std::string::String>>\` is not satisfied","output":"出现这个错误 \`error[E0277]: the trait bound std::string::String: std::convert::From<std::option::Option<std::string::String>> is not satisfied\` 指的是编译器期望得到一个类型为 \`String\` 的值，但是实际上得到的是一个 \`Option<String>\` 类型的值。在 Rust 中，\`Option<T>\` 类型用来表示一个值可能存在也可能不存在（即可能是某个值 \`Some(value)\` ，也可能是 \`None\`）。 **原因**： 这个错误的常见原因是你尝试将一个 \`Option<String>\` 类型的值直接赋值给一个期望得到 \`String\` 类型的变量，而没有先解包这个 \`Option\`。 **解决方案**： 要解决这个问题，你需要先检查这个 \`Option\` 是否有值（即是否是 \`Some\`），然后再据此采取相应的操作。以下是一些处理 \`Option<String>\` 以获取 \`String\` 的常用方法： # 使用 \`match\` 语句 \`\`\`rust let maybe_string: Option<String> = Some(\\"Hello\\".to_string()); let string = match maybe_string { Some(s) => s, None => panic!(\\"没有找到字符串！\\"), }; \`\`\` # 使用 \`unwrap()\` 或 \`expect()\` 如果你确定 \`Option\` 中一定有值，可以使用 \`unwrap()\` 或者 \`expect()\` 来获取值。\`unwrap()\` 直接解包，如果是 \`None\` 会引发 panic；\`expect()\` 在解包时也会引发 panic，但是允许你指定错误信息。 \`\`\`rust let maybe_string: Option<String> = Some(\\"Hello\\".to_string()); let string = maybe_string.unwrap(); // 如果是 None，则 panic // 或者 let string = maybe_string.expect(\\"没有找到字符串！\\"); \`\`\` 然而，使用 \`unwrap\` 或 \`expect\` 并不是最佳实践，尤其是在生产代码中，因为它们在遇到 \`None\` 值时会导致程序崩溃。 # 使用 \`unwrap_or\` 或 \`unwrap_or_else\` 如果 \`Option\` 是 \`None\` 的话，\`unwrap_or\` 允许你指定一个默认值。\`unwrap_or_else\` 允许你提供一个函数来延迟生成默认值。 \`\`\`rust let maybe_string: Option<String> = Some(\\"Hello\\".to_string()); let string = maybe_string.unwrap_or(\\"默认字符串\\".to_string()); // 或者 let string = maybe_string.unwrap_or_else(|| \\"默认字符串\\".to_string()); \`\`\` # 使用 \`if let\` 结构 如果你只关心 \`Option\` 是某个特定值的情况，\`if let\` 可以让代码更简洁： \`\`\`rust let maybe_string: Option<String> = Some(\\"Hello\\".to_string()); if let Some(string) = maybe_string { println!(\\"找到字符串: {}\\", string); } else { println!(\\"没有找到字符串\\"); } \`\`\` # 结论 调整代码以正确处理 \`Option\` 类型的值是解决这个编译器错误的关键。选择最适合你的具体情况和需要的方法。"},{"instruction":"postgresql查询怎么筛选某列是text的结果","output":"在 PostgreSQL 中，如果你想根据列的数据类型来进行过滤 —— 比如说，你只想选择那些数据类型为 \`text\` 的列 —— 你可以通过查询 PostgreSQL 的系统目录 \`information_schema.columns\` 或 \`pg_catalog.pg_attribute\` 结合 \`pg_catalog.pg_type\` 来实现。 下面是使用 \`information_schema.columns\` 来找出特定表中所有数据类型为 \`text\` 的列的示例： \`\`\`sql SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'your_schema' -- 替换为你的 schema，如果是默认的，就用 'public' AND table_name = 'your_table' -- 替换为你的表名 AND data_type = 'text'; \`\`\` 这里，\`table_schema\` 和 \`table_name\` 需要被替换为你实际的 schema 名和表名。这条查询会返回指定表中所有数据类型为 \`text\` 的列名列表。 如果你想从\`pg_catalog\`来做相同的事情，可能会有点儿复杂，但提供更底层的控制： \`\`\`sql SELECT attname FROM pg_attribute a JOIN pg_class c ON a.attrelid = c.oid JOIN pg_type t ON a.atttypid = t.oid JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid WHERE n.nspname = 'your_schema' -- 替换为你的 schema AND c.relname = 'your_table' -- 替换为你的表名 AND t.typname = 'text'; \`\`\` 这条查询实现了同样的目标，但使用了 PostgreSQL 的内部目录。这里，\`pg_attribute\` 存储着列信息，\`pg_class\` 用于识别表，\`pg_type\` 表明数据类型，而 \`pg_namespace\` 代表了 schema。 两种方式都能帮助你找出特定表中数据类型为 \`text\` 的所有列。选择哪种取决于你的偏好以及查询需求的复杂度。 请注意，直接查询系统表和目录可能会对系统的升级造成兼容性挑战，因为 PostgreSQL 的内部结构在主要版本升级时有可能会变化。因此，对于大多数常规用途，我们推荐使用 \`information_schema\` 的查询方式，因为它们设计为更稳定、标准化，且大多数 SQL 数据库都支持。"},{"instruction":"выбрать один вариант Какой режим характеризуется абсолютным контролем государства над всеми областями общественной жизни, полным подчинением человека политической власти и господствующей идеологии? диктатура демократический деспотический тоталитарный","output":"тоталитарный"},{"instruction":"Разновидность монархической формы правления, характеризующаяся юридическим и фактическим сосредоточением всей полноты государственной власти (законодательной, исполнительной, судебной), а также духовной (религиозной) власти в руках монарха парламентарная монархия абсолютная монархия конституционная монархия смешанная монархия","output":"абсолютная монархия"},{"instruction":"Выделите основные признаки государства один или несколько обладает территориальным верховенством принципиальность обладает личностным верховенством, т.е. объединяет своей властью и защитой особая властная структура, не имеющую аналогов в обществе имеет официальную символику и иные формальные атрибуты государственности","output":"Основные признаки государства включают в себя: -

бессерверное соединение","output":"Для оценки эффективности мобильных приложений, использующих бессерверное соединение (часто упоминаемое как serverless architecture или BaaS - Backend as a Service), можно применить различные математические критерии, которые отражают ключевые аспекты перфоманса, стоимости, масштабируемости и удобства использования. Вот некоторые из них: 1. **Latency (Задержка)**: - **Среднее время отклика** (Latency) = ( frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} (T_{response,i} - T_{request,i})}{n} ), где (T_{response,i}) - время получения ответа i-го запроса, (T_{request,i}) - время отправки i-го запроса, (n) - общее количество запросов. 2. **Throughput (Пропускная способность)**: - **Запросов в секунду** (QPS) = ( frac{n}{T} ), где (n) - общее количество выполненных за период запросов, (T) - этот период в секундах. 3. **Cost Efficiency (Стоимостная эффективность)**: - **Стоимость за миллион запросов** = ( С times frac{1000000}{N} ), где (С) - общие затраты на использование бессерверной инфраструктуры за определенный период, (N) - общее количество запросов за этот период. 4. **Error Rates (Показатель ошибок)**: - **Процент ошибочных ответов** = ( frac{E}{n} times 100% ), где (E) - количество запросов, получивших ошибку, (n) - общее количество запросов. 5. **Availability (Доступность)**: - **Процент времени доступности** = ( left(1 - frac{T_{downtime}}{T_{total}}right) times 100% ), где (T_{downtime}) - общее время недоступности, (T_{total}) - общее рассматриваемое время. 6. **Scalability (Масштабируемость)**: Оценка масштабируемости – это более сложный аспект, поскольку он зависит от способности системы адаптироваться к растущей нагрузке без снижения производительности. Это можно измерить через изменение latency и throughput при линейном увеличении числа запросов или пользователей. 7. **Cold Start Performance (Производительность \\"Холодного\\" Старта)**: - **Среднее время \\"холодного\\" старта** = ( frac{sum_{i=1}^{m} T_{coldstart,i}}{m} ), где (T_{coldstart,i}) - время \\"холодного\\" старта i-го инстанса, (m) - количество инстансов, запущенных с \\"холодного\\" старта. 8. **Resource Utilization (Использование ресурсов)**: - Может измеряться через объем занимаемой памяти, % использования CPU и другие показатели ресурсов за единицу времени или за запрос. Эти критерии могут быть дополнены или модифицированы в зависимости от специфики приложения и ожиданий к его работе. Важно помнить, что многие из этих метрик могут варьироваться в зависимости от провайдера бессерверных услуг, конфигурации и оптимизации кода, а также от внешних факторов, таких как интернет-соединение пользователей."},{"instruction":"1_ Translate the following legal text into colloquial Farsi 2_ Place the Persian and English text side by side in the table 3_ From the beginning to the end of the text, there should be an English sentence on the left side and a Persian sentence on the right side. 4- Using legal language for Persian translation .The first is that \\"consideration must be valuable but it need not be adequate\\". This means that provided something of value is given, in the absence of fraud or improper pressure, then it will be enough. In Thomas v. Thomas (1842) £1 each year towards the ground rent of a house was held to be enough to bind a promise to allow a woman to live in her late husband's house. It was not a market price, but it had value. His natural love and affection for her was not enough. It has no commercial value. But £1 would do. Consideration, however, cannot exist in doing what you are already bound to do in a contract with the same other party (called existing contractual duty) although if you do more you could expect extra payment. In Stilk v. Myrick (1809) a sailor could not recover extra pay he was promised (the promise was not binding) for working on a voyage to cover for two deserters out of a crew of eleven. On the other hand, in Hartley v. Ponsonby (1857), on similar facts, the sailor did get his extra pay because the desertion was nineteen of thirty-six, leaving only four or five able seamen. He had done more than his existing contractual duty. He had \\"bought\\" the promise of extra pay. Another aspect of this just rule concerns the part payment of debts. It is of no extra value to be paid less than you are owed. So it was that in D & C Builders v. Rees (1965) the builders' promise to accept £300 in full settlement of a debt of £482 was not binding on them, and they could successfully sue for the balance. It Iwould not be the same, of course, if part payment were to be made early or in a different form (e.g. £300's worth of bricks) or with a chattel (£300 and a bucket) or by a third party (A owes B but B accepts less from C) - all with the agreement of the creditor because none of these is \\"straight\\" part payment. They all contain a little extra. If a little extra is paid the promise is binding but straight part payment will not discharge a debt. It has no value. Consideration must be valuable. The second of these so-called rules is that \\"consideration must not be past\\". The rule sounds strange, but it is not difficult. Suppose I sell you a horse. After we have agreed the price and I have the cash and you have the horse you ask me about its temperament. I say that the horse is \\"sound and free from vice\\". This turns out to be less than accurate. You want to enforce my promise against me. You cannot. Al the time I made my promise about the horse the deal was over. You can only sue me for a broken binding promise (part of a contract). This promise was not binding. At the time I made it the only possible consideration from you (the money for the horse) was already in the past used up. The rule is sometimes stated as \\"past consideration is no consideration\\", and the facts of the story happened in Roscorla v. Thomas (1842). Similarly, in Re McArdle (1951) a man left his house to his widow in his will, for her life, and then to his children. There were improvements made to the house, for which the children subsequently promised to pay a contribution. Thisthey neglected to do. Nothing could be done. When the promise was made the improvements had already been done. It was a gratuitous promise. On the other hand, suppose I ask you to work for my company. You do so for a while. Later I promise to pay you. Since (a) I asked you to do it, and (b) it is the kind of thing that would normally be paid for, then despite the fact that I promised after you worked I have to pay. In a sense my request carried an implied promise of payment. These were the circumstances of Stewart v. Casey (1892) (which is sometimes called Re Casey's Patents (1892). It followed a very old case called Lampleigh v. Braithwait (1615) in which a man asked another to travel to the king and beg a reprieve from hanging for him. It was successful. The man promised to pay £100. He failed to do so, but he was held bound by his promise to pay for the act since it had been performed at his request. The final rule has an even stranger name: \\"consideration must move from the promisee\\". It is part of a doctrine of contract law called privity. Only the parties to a contract have rights under it, and only they have obligations. There are very few exceptions to this. In Tweddle v. Atkinson (1861), for example, a couple were engaged. Their parents promised each other that they would each pay some money to the couple when they married. One set of parents paid, the other did not; the father died before he had had a chance to. The couple sued his estate. The action failed, because the only appropriate plaintiffs were the other set of parents. The couple had provided no consideration. They were not parties to the contract. They could not, therefore, sue on it. A brief reference must be made here to equity. In essence, it is composed of a number of principles developed over the years in the interests of justice and fairness between the parties when a strict observance of the common law rules would lead to unfairness and injustice. In Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd (1947), commonly called High Trees, such a principle emerged when the argument concerned consideration. A landlord had gratuitously promised to halve the rent he could legally have demanded from a company renting the whole of a block of flats from him. It was wartime and it was proving difficult for the company to let the flats and pay the full rent. After the emergency the landlord wanted to restore the position and claim the full rent. He also questioned his ability to claim the back rent. Strictly, he had a right to the money, but the court said that they would not have allowed it if formally asked. This on the basis of the unfairness to the company who had relied on the promise, which had been made knowing it would be relied upon (they cut the rents to fill the block). This rare and very limited principle of equity is called estoppel. Where it is recognised, it can make a gratuitous promise binding provided, generally, that it was relied on and acted upon by the promisce.","output":"| English Text | Persian Text (Legal Language) | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | The first is that \\"consideration must be valuable but it need not be adequate\\". | نخست آنکه \\"عوض باید ارزشمند باشد اما لزوماً کافی نیست\\". | | This means that provided something of value is given, in the absence of fraud or improper pressure, then it will be enough. | این بدان معنی است که چنانچه چیزی ارزشمند داده شده باشد، در عدم وجود تقلب یا فشار نادرست، آن مقدار کافی خواهد بود. | | In Thomas v. Thomas (1842) £1 each year towards the ground rent of a house was held to be enough to bind a promise to allow a woman to live in her late husband's house. | در دعوای توماس علیه توماس (۱۸۴۲)، پرداخت یک پوند در هر سال برای اجاره زمین یک خانه کافی تشخیص داده شد تا قولی را برای اجازه زندگی یک زن در خانه شوهر مرحومش محکم سازد. | | It was not a market price, but it had value. | این مبلغ، قیمت بازار نبود، اما ارزش داشت. | | His natural love and affection for her was not enough. It has no commercial value. | عشق و علاقه طبیعی او به او کافی نبود. هیچ ارزش تجاری نداشت. | | But £1 would do. | اما یک پوند کافی بود. | | Consideration, however, cannot exist in doing what you are already bound to do in a contract with the same other party (called existing contractual duty). | با این حال، عوض نمی‌تواند در انجام دادن کاری که از پیش به موجب قرارداد با طرف مقابل تعهد یافته‌اید (که به آن وظیفه قراردادی موجود گفته می‌شود)، وجود داشته باشد. | | although if you do more you could expect extra payment. | هرچند اگر کار بیشتری انجام دهید، می‌توانید انتظار پرداخت اضافی داشته باشید. | | In Stilk v. Myrick (1809), a sailor could not recover extra pay he was promised for working on a voyage to cover for two deserters out of a crew of eleven. | در دعوای استیلک علیه مایریک (۱۸۰۹)، یک دریانورد نتوانست دستمزد اضافی که برای کار کردن در یک سفر دریایی به او وعده داده شده بود تا جایگزینی برای دو فراری از یک خدمه یازده نفری باشد، بازیابد. | | On the other hand, in Hartley v. Ponsonby (1857), on similar facts, the sailor did get his extra pay because the desertion was nineteen of thirty-six, leaving only four or five able seamen. | از سوی دیگر، در دعوای هارتلی علیه پانسونبی (۱۸۵۷)، بر اساس واقعیت‌های مشابه، دریانورد دستمزد اضافی خود را دریافت کرد زیرا تعداد فراری‌ها نوزده نفر از سی و شش نفر بود، که تنها چهار یا پنج دریانورد قادر به کار باقی مانده بودند. | | Another aspect of this just rule concerns the part payment of debts. It is of no extra value to be paid less than you are owed. | جنبه‌ دیگر این قاعده عادلانه، مربوط به پرداخت بخشی از بدهی‌ها است. پرداخت مبلغی کمتر از آنچه که بدهکار هستید، هیچ ارزش اضافی ندارد. | | So it was that in D & C Builders v. Rees (1965), the builders' promise to accept £300 in full settlement of a debt of £482 was not binding on them, and they could successfully sue for the balance. | بنابراین، در دعوای دی اند سی بیلدرز علیه ریس (۱۹۶۵)، وعده سازندگان برای پذیرش ۳۰۰ پوند به عنوان تسویه کامل بدهی ۴۸۲ پوند، بر آنها ملزم نبود و آنها می‌توانستند با موفقیت برای باقیمانده شکایت کنند. | | The second of these so-called rules is that \\"consideration must not be past\\". | دومین این قوانین به اصطلاح آن است که \\"عوض نباید گذشته باشد\\". | | The rule sounds strange, but it is not difficult. | این قاعده عجیب به نظر می‌رسد، اما دشوار نیست. | | Suppose I sell you a horse. After we have agreed the price and I have the cash and you have the horse, you ask me about its temperament. | فرض کنید من یک اسب به شما می‌فروشم. پس از آنکه بر سر قیمت توافق کردیم و من پول را دارم و شما اسب را دارید، در مورد خلق و خوی آن از من سوال می‌کنید. | | I say that the horse is \\"sound and free from vice\\". This turns out to be less than accurate. | من می‌گویم که اسب \\"سالم و بی‌عیب و نقص است\\". این امر کمتر از دقیق از آب درمی‌آید. | | You want to enforce my promise against me. You cannot. | شما می‌خواهید قول من را علیه من اجرایی کنید. نمی‌توانید. | | At the time I made my promise about the horse, the deal was over. | در زمانی که من قول خود را در مورد اسب دادم، معامله تمام شده بود. | | You can only sue me for a broken binding promise (part of a contract). | شما تنها می‌توانید برای یک وعده نقض شده‌ الزام‌آور (بخشی از قرارداد)، از من شکایت کنید. | | This promise was not binding. At the time I made it the only possible consideration from you (the money for the horse) was already in the past used up. | این وعده الزام‌آور نبود. در زمانی که من آن را دادم، تنها عوض ممکن از شما (پول برای اسب)، از پیش در گذشته مصرف شده بود. | | Similarly, in Re McArdle (1951), a man left his house to his widow in his will, for her life, and then to his children. | به طور مشابه، در امر مک‌آردل (۱۹۵۱)، مردی خانه‌اش را طبق وصیت‌نامه‌اش به همسرش برای زندگی‌اش و سپس به فرزندانش واگذار کرد. | | There were improvements made to the house, for which the children subsequently promised to pay a contribution. | بهبودهایی در خانه انجام شد، که فرزندان در پی آن وعده دادند کمک مالی پرداخت کنند. | | This they neglected to do. Nothing could be done. | آنها از انجام این کار خودداری کردند. کاری از پیش نمی‌رفت. | | When the promise was made the improvements had already been done. It was a gratuitous promise. | وقتی وعده داده شد، بهبودها از پیش انجام شده بود. این یک وعده بی‌مزد بود. | | On the other hand, suppose I ask you to work for my company. | از سوی دیگر، فرض کنید من از شما بخواهم برای شرکت من کار کنید. | | You do so for a while. Later I promise to pay you. | شما برای مدتی این کار را انجام می‌دهید. بعداً من وعده می‌دهم به شما پرداخت کنم. | | Since (a) I asked you to do it, and (b) it is the kind of thing that would normally be paid for, then despite the fact that I promised after you worked I have to pay. | چون (الف) من از شما خواستم آن کار را انجام دهید، و (ب) این نوع کاری است که معمولاً برای آن پرداخت می‌شود، پس با وجود اینکه من بعد از کار کردن شما وعده دادم، باید پرداخت کنم. | | My request carried an implied promise of payment. | درخواست من، وعده ضمنی پرداخت را به همراه داشت. | | These were the circumstances of Stewart v. Casey (1892). | این‌ها شرایط دعوای استوارت علیه کیسی (۱۸۹۲) بودند. | | The final rule has an even stranger name: \\"consideration must move from the promisee\\". | قانون نهایی نامی حتی عجیب‌تر دارد: \\"عوض باید از طرف وعده‌دهنده حرکت کند\\". | | It is part of a doctrine of contract law called privity. | این بخشی از یک عقیده در قانون قرارداد به نام اختصاصی است. | | Only the parties to a contract have rights under it, and only they have obligations. | تنها اشخاص طرف قرارداد حقوقی تحت آن دارند، و تنها آنها تعهداتی دارند. | | In Tweddle v. Atkinson (1861), a couple were engaged. | در دعوای تودل علیه اتکینسون (۱۸۶۱)، یک زوج نامزد کردند. | | Their parents promised each other that they would each pay some money to the couple when they married. | والدینشان به یکدیگر وعده دادند که هنگام ازدواج، هر کدام مقداری پول به زوج پرداخت کنند. | | One set of parents paid, the other did not; the father died before he had a chance to. | یکی از والدین پرداخت کردند، دیگری نکرد؛ پدر پیش از آنکه فرصتی داشته باشد درگذشت. | | The couple sued his estate. The action failed, because the only appropriate plaintiffs were the other set of parents. | زوج از اموال او شکایت کردند. این اقدام شکست خورد، زیرا تنها شاکیان مناسب، دیگر مجموعه از والدین بودند. | | They were not parties to the contract. They could not, therefore, sue on it. | آنها طرف قرارداد نبودند. بنابراین، نمی‌توانستند بر آن شکایت کنند. | | A brief reference must be made here to equity. | اینجا باید به انصاف اشاره مختصری شود. | | In essence, it is composed of a number of principles developed over the years in the interests of justice and fairness between the parties when a strict observance of the common law rules would lead to unfairness and injustice. | در حقیقت، این مجموعه‌ای از اصولی است که بر اساس منافع عدالت و انصاف بین اشخاص طی سال‌ها توسعه یافته‌اند، زمانی که رعایت دقیق قوانین حقوق عامه به ناعدالتی و بی‌عدالتی منجر شود. | | In Central London Property Trust Ltd v.

{coupon_id,time,days,platform,payway,bank,card_type,area,shops,bins,coupons,daily,monthly,total,scene,state} 一些预设： 三明，即三明市 沙县，即三明市沙县 仅仅提及“付款码”，则属于被扫 仅仅提及“扫码”或“扫一扫”，则属于主扫 提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。 情况2：如间隔连续的时间范围，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-4-5 每天10点~18点，2024-4-10 ~ 2024-4-15 每天10点~18点\\"； 情况2例子：2024年4月10日至2024年5月10日，2024年5月10日至2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。 情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求:

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/19 19:01:08

font-size using css","output":"To resize the font size of the content produced by CKEditor using CSS, you will need to target the classes or elements inside the CKEditor's output container. Typically, the content from CKEditor is rendered within an iframe or a container (for inline editing), making the styling a bit different compared to standard HTML elements. Assuming you have an output container where the CKEditor content is being displayed (not the editing area itself, but the area where the CKEditor's HTML output is being used on your site), you can apply CSS to adjust the font size. Here's how you can approach it: 1. **Direct Container Styling**: If the content is directly injected into a div or other HTML elements outside of CKEditor: \`\`\`css /* Target a specific container's class where CKEditor content is rendered */ .ckeditor-output { font-size: 16px; /* Adjust size as needed */ } \`\`\` 2. **Universal Styling for CKEditor Content**: If you want to apply styles universally to all CKEditor output content: \`\`\`css /* This targets paragraph elements, but you can target any element as needed */ .ckeditor-output p { font-size: 16px; /* Adjust size as needed */ } \`\`\` 3. **Using Custom Content Styles in CKEditor 5**: CKEditor 5 allows you to add custom content styles through its configuration using the \`editor.config\` object and the \`contentStyle\` setting: \`\`\`javascript ClassicEditor .create(document.querySelector('#editor'), { // Other configurations... contentStyle: 'body { font-size: 18px; } p { font-size: 16px; }' // Example styles }) .then(...) .catch(...); \`\`\` 4. **Styling Within the CKEditor (for content editing within the editor itself)**: This is useful if you want the editing area to reflect the font size changes, aiding users in seeing how content will appear. \`\`\`javascript CKEDITOR.addStylesSet('my_styles',[ // Define styles for the CKEditor content area. { name: 'Custom Font Size', element: 'p', styles: { 'font-size': '16px' } } ]); // Then, apply 'my_styles' to your editor instance. CKEDITOR.replace('yourEditorInstance', { stylesSet: 'my_styles' }); \`\`\` Remember, for CKEditor 4 and earlier, you might modify the \`contents.css\` file or use \`config.contentsCss\` to point to your custom CSS file that includes the font size definitions. Always ensure to clear cache or hard reload your browser to see the changes since CSS and JavaScript changes can sometimes be cached aggressively."},{"instruction":"how do i modify: <ul class=\\"list-inline contact-social-bx\\"> <li><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"btn outline radius-xl\\"><i class=\\"fa fa-facebook\\"></i></a></li> <li><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"btn outline radius-xl\\"><i class=\\"fa fa-twitter\\"></i></a></li> <li><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"btn outline radius-xl\\"><i class=\\"fa fa-linkedin\\"></i></a></li> <li><a href=\\"#\\" class=\\"btn outline radius-xl\\"><i class=\\"fa fa-google-plus\\"></i></a></li> </ul> to share the current blog post in: <?php include(\\"../conn.php\\");

Most social networks have dedicated URLs that you can use to initiate a share action, which require appending the URL of the content you wish to share. Firstly, ensure you have the full URL of the current blog post. Assuming you have a mechanism to get the full URL of the current blog post in PHP, let's say the full URL is stored in a PHP variable named \`currentURL\`. Here's how you might modify your \`<ul class=\\"list-inline contact-social-bx\\">\` to include dynamic sharing links for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and remove Google Plus as it's no longer available: \`\`\`php <?php // Example: getting the current URL (You might need to adjust it according to your actual URL structure) protocol = (isset(_SERVER['HTTPS']) && _SERVER['HTTPS'] !== 'off') ? \\"https://\\" : \\"http://\\"; currentURL = protocol . _SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . _SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; //URL encode for sharing purposes encodedURL = urlencode(currentURL); ?> <ul class=\\"list-inline contact-social-bx\\"> <li><a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=<?php echo encodedURL; ?>\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"btn outline radius-xl\\"><i class=\\"fa fa-facebook\\"></i></a></li> <li><a href=\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=<?php echo urlencode(\\"Check out this blog post: \\"); ?>&url=<?php echo encodedURL; ?>\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"btn outline radius-xl\\"><i class=\\"fa fa-twitter\\"></i></a></li> <li><a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=<?php echo encodedURL; ?>\\" target=\\"_blank\\" class=\\"btn outline radius-xl\\"><i class=\\"fa fa-linkedin\\"></i></a></li> </ul> \`\`\` Here's what the code does: - For Facebook sharing, it utilizes the \`sharer.php\` endpoint, where \`u\` parameter represents the URL of the content to share. - For Twitter, it not only includes the URL (\`url\` parameter) but also allows adding a pre-filled text (\`text\` parameter). - For LinkedIn, the \`shareArticle\` endpoint is used with \`mini=true\` (for a minimalistic share box) and the \`url\` parameter contains the link to share. Note: The above code snippet assumes that you can correctly calculate or obtain the full URL of your blog post (\`currentURL\`). Ensure that the URL is correctly encoded (\`urlencode\`) to avoid issues with special characters in URLs. Lastly, Google Plus is deprecated, so there's no link for that. If you need another social platform, you'll need to replace it with something else, perhaps Instagram, although direct posting via third-party websites to Instagram is not supported in the same way."},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息: coupon_id:优惠券id，字符串类型，格式如:\\"2102024040378314\\" time:活动时间，字符串类型，格式如:\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-5-1 每活动日10点半-20点\\"，如果具体时间为每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59，则可以忽略，只显示年月日即可，如\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-5-1\\"，如果具体时间为每活动日N点-23:59:59，则显示年月日 每天N点开始，如\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-5-1 每天8点开始\\" days:活动持续天数，整数类型，格式如:5 bank:银行名称，字符串类型，若未分析出是哪个银行，默认为“中国银联”，格式如:\\"工商银行\\" card_type:限制银行卡类型，字符串类型，可选值:借记卡、储蓄卡、信用卡、贷记卡、社保卡，若未分析出银行卡类型，默认为“实体银联卡”，格式如:\\"借记卡\\" area:城市地区限制，字符串类型，默认\\"全国\\" platform:享受优惠的app或平台，字符串类型，默认\\"云闪付App\\" payway:支付方式，字符串类型，可选值:主扫、被扫、主扫被扫均可，默认被扫，格式如:\\"主扫\\" shops:门店限制，字符串类型，格式如:\\"王府井奥莱指定门店\\" bins:银行卡bin限制，字符串类型，以顿号隔开，格式如:\\"62258877、62122621\\" daily:同一用户每日领取或优惠次数，整数类型，默认1 month:同一用户每月领取或优惠次数，整数类型，默认1 total:同一用户活动期间内总领取或优惠次数，与days，daily相关，同时结合活动详细规则限制进行修正，整数类型，默认1 scene:支付场景，字符串类型，默认\\"指定消费\\"，格式如:\\"信用卡还款\\" coupons:优惠信息力度，格式如:\\"满10减1元\\"，有多档位的，要全部列出来 state:优惠活动状态，根据活动时间time判断状态，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 以json格式回复，格式如下： {coupon_id,time,days,platform,payway,bank,card_type,area,shops,bins,coupons,daily,monthly,total,scene,state} 一些预设： 三明，即三明市 沙县，即三明市沙县 仅仅提及“付款码”，则属于被扫 仅仅提及“扫码”或“扫一扫”，则属于主扫 提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。 情况2：如间隔连续的时间范围，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-4-5 每天10点~18点，2024-4-10 ~ 2024-4-15 每天10点~18点\\"； 情况2例子：2024年4月10日至2024年5月10日，2024年5月10日至2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。 情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求: 根据time算出活动结束时间，与“当前时间”进行比较判断，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 关于支付场景scene包括: 1、生活缴费(如：话费、水费、煤气费、电费) 2、影票 3、信用卡还款 4、餐饮美食 5、罚没 6、充电(如汽车充电) 7、机票 8、车票 9、船票 10、酒店住宿 11、租车 12、门票 13、购车 14、购房 15、网络购物 16、商超购物 17、中石油加油 18、中石化加油 19、车辆洗护 20、汽车保养 21、地铁 22、公交 23、共享单车 24、共享汽车 25、淘宝天猫 26、京东 27、唯品会 28、拼多多 29、抖音 30、快手 不符合以上归类的，默认为\\"指定消费\\" 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
