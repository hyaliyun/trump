Meanwhile, in the digital meme-scape, Doge, the adored Shiba Inu meme, accidentally makes a face that breaks the cardinal rule of “always being on point,” putting his existence in jeopardy. As the meme community reels from Doge’s faux pas, an ominous threat looms on the horizon. A new, sophisticated AI algorithm, designed by tech prodigy Evelyn Cipher, is being unleashed onto the internet with the ability to delete memes it deems “non-viral” or “outdated” to improve online content quality. With Doge’s mistake making him a prime target, the memes must band together to avoid deletion. At the same time, Mr. Whimsley’s journey into understanding memes takes on a whole new meaning as he unexpectedly becomes the subject of a viral meme himself due to his bewildering reactions to modern technology. Dubbed “Out of Context Educator,” his newfound internet fame catapults Whimsley into the digital world, where he must navigate this strange new reality. Whimsley and Doge’s paths collide, and together, with a band of colorful meme characters, including Nyan Cat, Grumpy Cat, Bad Luck Brian, and the iconic Trollface, they embark on an adventure to stop Evelyn’s AI before it erases the essence of internet culture. The motley crew must use the power of virality, trendsetting, and the unbreakable bonds formed in the meme community to overcome challenges, from battling the dark corners of the Dark Web to confronting the AI in a climactic showdown inside the mainframe of the internet itself. Throughout the film, humor and heartwarming moments are captured as unlikely friendships develop, especially between Whimsley and the Doge, who teach each other the value of adaptation and timeless relevance. In a race against time, memes of generations past and present come together to save themselves and the future of internet expression. With scenes packed with nods to pop culture and clever Easter eggs for keen-eyed internet aficionados, “The Meme Movie” strikes a balance between the comedic absurdity of meme culture and a narrative about embracing change and the power of collective action. In the end, Doge and Whimsley find a way to update the AI’s algorithm to understand that memes have a life and significance beyond just viral numbers. Instead, they embody the creativity and spirit of human connection. And while Whimsley returns to the real world with a newfound sense of relevance and hipness, Doge’s new face becomes embraced, sparking a heartwarming trend of accepting imperfections as part of what makes a meme, and everyone, special. Tagline: Virality has a new hero. Write a blog post where the first idea was met with acclaim, but the Meme Movie was maligned, being seen as the \\"Emoji Movie all over again\\"","output":"# From Lunar Laughs to Digital Disasters: A Tale of Two Animations In the realm of animated movies, creativity knows no bounds, and every so often, we witness the conception of ideas that resonate with audiences and critics alike, while others... not so much. Today, we explore two big projects that aimed to tap into the cultural zeitgeist, yet elicited starkly contrasting reactions. \\"MoonGoons\\" - The Unexpected Hit That Charmed the Universe First up, the surprise darling of the animation world, \\"MoonGoons.\\" With its witty title and inspired characters, it soared past expectations and won over the hearts of moviegoers young and old. The story of Boofus and Diggle, along with their eclectic team of animal-like alien friends, was not only a visual feast but also a narrative layered with humor, adventure, and a poignant message of unity that truly made it shine. Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, and GoAnimate Studios brought to life a whimsical tale set against the backdrop of the moon and beyond. They managed to orchestrate a symphony of colorful characters who joined forces to combat a universe-threatening evil. By focusing on the camaraderie between the unlikely heroes and their quest to overcome adversity, \\"MoonGoons\\" turned out to be a masterclass in storytelling that captivated imaginations and received acclaim for its fresh take on the animated ensemble genre. But as history has demonstrated, not every foray into the creation of animation garners such a warm reception. \\"The Meme Movie\\" - A Viral Venture Gone Awry In stark contrast, we have the well-intentioned yet misguided venture known as \\"The Meme Movie.\\" It seemed like a slam dunk on paper – harness the omnipotent power of the internet, infuse it with an all-star lineup of meme royalty, and deliver it to a meme-savvy audience hungry for laughs and nostalgia. Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, and GoAnimate Studios set out to do just that, but alas, the execution fell flat. Caught in the crosshairs of criticism, \\"The Meme Movie\\" was pegged as the \\"Emoji Movie all over again,\\" a harsh comparison to an infamous predecessor that itself failed to resonate with audiences. Despite the involvement of beloved digital icons like Doge and Nyan Cat, the film struggled to translate the ephemeral and chaotic charm of internet culture into a full-length feature. Fredrick Whimsley's foray into the digital world was more bewildering than wondrous, and the overarching plot involving the AI algorithm felt too contrived for a concept grounded in the organic, decentralized spirit of meme creation. Critics argued that the movie's attempt to cram together a disparate collection of internet jokes and references resulted in a disjointed and insincere narrative. Instead of a triumphant celebration of meme culture, the film came across as a cash grab that lacked the authenticity required to truly capture the hearts of its intended audience. Moreover, the comparison to \\"The Emoji Movie\\" was inevitable. Both films sought to bank on digital phenomena, and both seemingly misunderstood the delicate art of weaving together countless references into a cohesive, engaging story. Where \\"MoonGoons\\" stood as a testament to originality and inventiveness, \\"The Meme Movie,\\" unfortunately, served as a reminder that not all that glitters in the digital realm is gold. In the cutthroat arena of animated films, it's clear that audiences crave innovation just as much as familiarity. \\"MoonGoons\\" managed to strike the right balance between the two, delivering a universally appealing narrative ripe with creativity. \\"The Meme Movie,\\" however, showed that even a formula that seems destined to go viral can fail to capture the collective imagination when it lacks soul and a genuine connection to its source material. As we look ahead to future projects, studios would do well to reflect on the lessons of \\"MoonGoons\\" and \\"The Meme Movie\\": the importance of sincere storytelling, relatable characters, and the acknowledgement that in the ever-shifting landscape of culture, it's not just about being topical—it's about being timeless."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up after both release, where the first 1 is loved, but the Meme movie gets a 0% on RT, and was seen as a cashgrab, Also, a sequel for one of them has been greenlit","output":"# \\"MoonGoons\\" Triumphs While \\"The Meme Movie\\" Flops: A Tale of Two Sequels In the world of animation, a great idea can captivate audiences and lead to unimagined success, while a poorly executed one can lead to an equally memorable, but far less enviable, outcome. With the release of two highly anticipated animated films, we have witnessed this adage unfold in real-time. \\"MoonGoons\\" Soars to New Heights \\"MoonGoons,\\" the heartfelt space odyssey from Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, and GoAnimate Studios, skyrocketed to critical acclaim and box office glory. Following the adventures of Boofus and Diggle, along with their band of animal-like alien friends, the film struck a chord with audiences across the globe. Its clever writing, vibrant animation, and universal themes of friendship and unity have resonated across all demographics, earning an impressive score on Rotten Tomatoes and a plethora of accolades. The success of \\"MoonGoons\\" is a testament to the creative efforts of its makers and the hunger for original storytelling blended with whimsy and wonder. As a result of its triumph, a sequel has officially been greenlit, much to the delight of fans eagerly awaiting more lunar escapades. This new installment promises to expand the universe with deeper character development, new frontiers, and, of course, even greater threats for our heroes to overcome. \\"The Meme Movie\\" Crashes Hard On the opposite end of the spectrum lies the ill-fated \\"The Meme Movie.\\" Attempting to capitalize on the ever-popular, ever-evolving world of internet memes, the film managed to accomplish an unprecedented feat: an extremely rare 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes and an audience response that was equally harsh. Despite a marketing blitz and the inclusion of internet meme legends like Doge and Nyan Cat, \\"The Meme Movie\\" was criticized for its failure to understand the nuanced, fleeting nature of meme culture. Filmgoers and critics alike dismissed it as a soulless cash grab that missed the essence of what makes memes so beloved by the public. Rather than a celebration of internet creativity, it came off as a disconnected and formulaic attempt to monetize internet culture's wacky humor. In the aftermath of its release—and following a loss that industry insiders whisper numbers in the millions—a sequel for \\"The Meme Movie\\" is off the table, and for many involved, it serves as a cautionary tale about trend-chasing without a solid creative foundation. The Future of Franchise Animations While \\"MoonGoons\\" looks towards a bright future with its sequel, \\"The Meme Movie\\" serves as a stark reminder of the volatility of appealing to internet culture and the risks associated with digital trends. It seems that moviegoers are not interested in mere repackaging but instead crave stories that offer genuine connections, inventive plots, and well-rounded character arcs. If anything, the disparate fates of these two animated features reinforce the notion that quality storytelling is paramount in cinema. The success of \\"MoonGoons\\" and the failure of \\"The Meme Movie\\" have provided valuable lessons for studios, writers, and directors: when it comes to animated films, authentic narrative and emotional resonance are key components that, when executed well, can lead to both critical and commercial victories. As audiences look to the horizon, hopeful for what the \\"MoonGoons\\" sequel will bring, studios are reminded that true creativity and a thoughtful approach to content creation are the ultimate currency in the quest to capture hearts and imaginations on the silver screen."},{"instruction":"how complicated is to beat a person who is black belt in judo and bjj after trained more than 10 years in both disciplines under bjj rules?","output":"Beating a person who has more than 10 years of training in both Judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) under BJJ rules would typically be considered an exceptionally challenging task for most martial artists. Here's why: 1. **Experience and Skill**: With over a decade of training in both martial arts, this individual would have a profound understanding of grappling techniques, transitions, positioning, submissions, and defense. 2. **Adaptability**: Judo and BJJ are complementary martial arts. While Judo emphasizes throwing and takedowns, BJJ focuses more on ground fighting and submissions. A practitioner who is adept in both can seamlessly transition between the standing and ground phases of a fight. 3. **Tactical Awareness**: A well-trained martial artist with 10 years of experience would have developed a high level of tactical awareness, allowing them to anticipate and counter the moves of their opponents. 4. **Physical Conditioning**: Such an individual would likely be in excellent physical condition, with strong endurance, flexibility, and muscle memory for executing complex techniques. 5. **Under BJJ Rules**: BJJ rules primarily focus on ground fighting, which means the practitioner's judo skills for takedowns can be used effectively to gain dominant positions, after which BJJ techniques can be applied to control and submit the opponent. 6. **Psychological Edge**: An experienced fighter often possesses a psychological advantage, having been tested in numerous sparring sessions and competitions, which can lead to increased confidence and a calm demeanor under pressure. To stand a chance against such an opponent, one must also have extensive training and experience, perhaps in BJJ or a similar grappling discipline, with an equivalent degree of physical conditioning and tactical knowledge. Even then, the outcome of a match would be uncertain and would heavily depend on the individuals' respective skill levels, strategies, and ability to execute techniques under pressure. It's worth noting that in any combat sport, there are no absolutes, and any fighter can have a good or bad day, which could influence the outcome of a match. In summary, defeating a highly experienced black belt in Judo and BJJ would be highly difficult, and would require a fighter to have similar or superior martial arts training, physical conditioning, and strategic planning."},{"instruction":"write a comedic Stranger Things story about Steve Harrington and Jonathan Byers Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

The river, canopied by leafy branches, looked inviting. \\"All right, let's cool off, but leave the birthday suits for your nightmares, Byers,\\" Steve joked, padding down to his swim trunks as Jonathan did the same. Once they waded into the delightfully cool water, they floated on their backs, feeling the gentle current tug at them. Steve's perfectly styled hair fanned around him like a mahogany halo, and Jonathan's typically furrowed brow smoothed out in relaxation. Then, an impromptu symphony of bubbles punctured the surface of the water. Jonathan, the unexpected maestro, had let out a tremendous underwater toot. Steve's face contorted in combined shock and amusement. \\"Dude, you're a one-man band!\\" Not to be outdone, Steve retaliated with his own aquatic solo. The release caused his usually composed features to break into a rebellious grin. \\"Ah, the sweet sound of relaxation.\\" The fish nearby, innocent bystanders in this gas warfare, did belly flips, floating in the ripples of the disturbance. \\"Look, Jonathan, dinner is served. You season, I'll catch,\\" Steve chuckled, the boys frantically snagging the stunned fish. As evening approached, they managed to start a campfire and placed their catch on a makeshift grill. \\"Never thought my fart would lead to food,\\" Jonathan mused, his quip hanging in the smoky air. Steve flipped a fish, chuckling. \\"Ha! Yeah, you're like a mythical creature, Jonathan—the flatulent fishing god of Hawkins.\\" They settled down to eat their riverside feast, the absurdity of the day a welcome relief from their usually monstrous problems. And as the stars blinked above, the two boys, Heroes of Hawkins, simply enjoyed the quiet crackle of the fire, the taste of fresh fish, and the enduring strength of an unlikely friendship."},{"instruction":"write a comedic Stranger Things story about Steve Harrington and Jonathan Byers Uchiha deciding to relax in a river .

In search of relaxation, they journeyed through the dense surrounding forests until they stumbled upon a serene river. \\"All this monster fighting's made me work up a sweat,\\" declared Steve, his famous hair somehow still perfectly styled, even in the waning forest light. \\"I could use some downtime myself,\\" mumbled the usually brooding Jonathan, looking anxiously around as if expecting a Demogorgon to leap out at any moment. They tossed away their clothes without a second thought, standing at the river's edge in all their glory. Steve, with his chiseled swimmer's physique, and Jonathan, more lean and wiry, each gave off a glimmer of muscle tone, testaments to their battles against interdimensional horrors. Without further ado, they stepped into the crisp river water, wading in until they submerged their bodies, sighing in contentment. Jonathan floated on his back, somber eyes momentarily lightened by the reflection of the open sky, while Steve kicked back, his arms resting behind his head. \\"Mighty fine idea, this,\\" Steve remarked, an easy smile playing on his lips. \\"Yeah, peaceful,\\" Jonathan concurred, his typical unease melting away. Just as they were beginning to totally unwind, the silent reprieve was broken by a bubbling sound. Steve's eyes widened in alarm and then amusement as one by one, an unmissable fart escaped each of them. The moment seemed to play out in slow motion as Steve's face turned into a mischievous grin, his cheeks puffing out as he let nature do the talking. Jonathan took a more stoic approach, but the corner of his mouth quirked upward in shared mischief, his body tensing up briefly before returning to his relaxed state. Their subsequent laughter echoed against the water, and the once tranquil fish nearby floated belly-up, stunned by the offensive odors invading their habitat. \\"Guess we're having fish for dinner, huh Steve?\\" Jonathan chuckled, observing the floating fish with astonished amusement. \\"Nothing like a little natural fishing, right, Byers?\\" Steve replied with a wink, scooping up the inadvertent catch. Back on shore, they rekindled their sense of camaraderie by building a campfire, the flames licking the twilight air as they speared the fish and set them to cook. \\"I never figured your farts for the fish-killing type, Jonathan,\\" Steve teased with a playful smirk, turning his fish over the flames. \\"Yours weren't exactly roses,\\" Jonathan shot back with a rare smile, already feeling the anecdotes of this strange day weaving into the fabric of their extraordinary friendship. As they ate their unexpected haul, the laughter and chatter continued, the two friends finding solace in the simplicity of their evening and the absurdity that always seemed to find them, even in their calmest moments."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"これらのデザインを使って、着ぐるみ魔法少女チームを組んだら楽しいと思う（少なくとももう一人、まだデザインされていないキャラクターがいる）。 他の地元の人や観光に来た人に貸せるようなコスチュームを4着とも用意したいが、まずは十分な資金が必要だｗ\\"","output":"\\"I think it would be fun to form a mascot costume magical girl team using these designs (there's at least one more character who hasn't been designed yet).

Dental amalgam is an alloy that typically contains mercury, silver, tin, and other metals and is used to fill cavities caused by tooth decay. When aluminum and amalgam come into contact in a moist environment, like the mouth, they create a kind of battery, which leads to the generation of electric current. This is because the two metals have different electrical potentials, with aluminum acting as the anode and the amalgam as the cathode. The current affects the nerve endings in your teeth, which can cause a sharp, metallic taste or even pain. The weird taste can also be accompanied by a tingling sensation, as the current stimulates the nerves in your teeth. If you don't have dental fillings, biting aluminum may still produce an odd taste simply because metals can interact with the saliva and tissues in your mouth, disrupting the normal pH balance and leaving a metallic or bitter taste. It's generally advisable to avoid biting or chewing on aluminum and other metals to prevent any discomfort or potentially harmful effects, particularly if you have dental amalgam fillings."},{"instruction":"where are sharks mostly in","output":"Sharks are found in oceans around the world, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. However, their distribution can vary widely based on the species, as different types of sharks have adapted to a variety of marine environments. Here are some general patterns regarding shark habitats: 1. **Tropical Waters:** Many sharks are found in warm, tropical oceans. Coral reefs, like those found in the Caribbean or the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia, are common habitats for species like reef sharks. 2. **Coastal Areas:** Some species of sharks, such as the great white shark, bull shark, and tiger shark, are often found in coastal areas where they have access to abundant prey. These areas can include bays, estuaries, and the continental shelf. 3. **Open Ocean:** Pelagic sharks, like the shortfin mako and blue shark, are typically found in the open ocean, often far from land. They can be found from the surface to depths of several hundred meters. 4. **Deep Sea:** Some sharks, like the Greenland shark and the sixgill shark, inhabit the very deep waters of the ocean and can be found at depths of over 2,000 meters. 5. **Temperate Waters:** Some shark species prefer the colder waters of temperate seas. For example, the great white shark can be found in the coastal areas of the Northeastern United States, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Mediterranean, in addition to areas with warmer climates. 6. **Polar Regions:** A few shark species, such as the Greenland shark, are adapted to live in the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is important to note that overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change can affect shark populations and their distribution. Some species are highly migratory and can cover vast distances, which is why they may be found in a variety of marine environments at different times of the year. Additionally, some areas are known for having higher concentrations of sharks, often due to abundant food resources or suitable breeding grounds. For example, the waters off the coast of South Africa are famous for their great white shark populations, while the central Pacific hosts a significant number of shark species due to the productivity of these waters."},{"instruction":"Can people get so drunk they forget who they are and what they did","output":"Yes, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to memory blackouts, where an individual may forget what they did while they were intoxicated. In rare and extreme cases, someone may even temporarily forget personal details about themselves, such as their own identity. This typically occurs at high levels of alcohol intoxication that affect brain function severely. There are two main types of alcohol-induced blackouts: 1. **En Bloc Blackouts:** During an en bloc blackout, a person is unable to form new memories for a continuous period of time while they are intoxicated. They won't remember anything during this period, even when prompted. 2. **Fragmentary Blackouts:** Also known as \\"brownouts,\\" fragmentary blackouts involve partial blocking of memory formation. The person may have a vague sense of the events or may remember them with prompts but will have gaps in their recollection. Alcohol impacts memory formation by influencing the hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for creating new memories. When someone consumes a large amount of alcohol quickly, it can disrupt the encoding of short-term memories into long-term storage, leading to a blackout period. In extreme intoxication, the effects of alcohol on cognitive processes could be profound enough that someone might temporarily lose awareness of basic personal information. However, this is more likely to be part of a general state of confusion and disorientation associated with very high blood alcohol levels rather than a true loss of established personal identity. It is important to note that experiencing blackouts can be a sign of dangerous drinking behavior that might require medical attention or other forms of intervention. Drinking to the point of blackouts poses significant risks to personal health and safety, and can result in harmful consequences both for the individual and others."},{"instruction":"como se llama la parte de la escoba que se limpia el piso","output":"La parte de la escoba que entra en contacto directo con el piso y se usa para barrer se llama \\"cerdas\\" o \\"fibras\\".

Below are some common points of criticism and reasons why some people disliked aspects of the film: 1. **Character Development**: Some viewers felt that Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (played by Brie Larson) was not sufficiently developed as a character, finding her too powerful without apparent weaknesses, which undermined the tension and audience investment in her journey. 2. **Performance and Charisma**: There were those who criticized Brie Larson’s performance, claiming it was too stoic or lacking in the charisma and humor that's characteristic of other MCU protagonists. This led to a perception that she wasn't as relatable or engaging as heroes like Iron Man or Thor. 3. **Pacing and Structure**: The non-linear storytelling and pacing were confusing or slow to some members of the audience, who preferred a more straightforward narrative approach. 4. **Villain**: As with many superhero films, the villain (in this case, the Kree and Yon-Rogg) were seen as somewhat underdeveloped, which reduced the impact of the conflict. 5. **Social and Political Overtones**: Although some praised the film's feminist themes, others found the messaging too heavy-handed or felt that the film was more focused on delivering a social message than on storytelling. 6. **Comedy and Tone**: Certain viewers did not appreciate the comedic elements, either finding them forced or out of sync with the rest of the tone of the film. Please note that many of these points are subjective and that \\"Captain Marvel\\" also received a great deal of praise for its action sequences, visual effects, 1990s nostalgia, and for introducing the first solo female superhero in the MCU. Rewriting \\"Captain Marvel\\" to accommodate the feedback while maintaining the film's key elements may involve: 1. **Character Depth**: Introduce vulnerabilities and more personal stakes for Carol Danvers, both emotional and physical, to make her journey of self-discovery and the mastery of her powers more compelling. 2. **Enhanced Character Arc**: Show Carol's imperfections and mistakes as she learns to control her powers, providing more character growth and relatable moments of failure and redemption. 3. **Linear Narrative**: Tell the story in a more linear fashion, with clearer flashbacks that contribute directly to the character's development and the plot rather than confuse viewers. 4. **Developed Antagonist**: Provide Yon-Rogg and the Kree with more screen time and depth, perhaps by exploring their motivations and giving them more relatable qualities to make their opposition to Captain Marvel more impactful. 5. **Balanced Messaging**: While retaining the feminist themes, weave them more subtly into the fabric of the narrative rather than presenting them didactically, so the story stands on its own with the themes as an enriching layer. 6. **Tone Consistency**: Adjust the comedic elements to better match the rest of the movie, using humor to relieve tension without undermining the severity of the conflict or the personal stakes involved. This kind of reimagining could potentially address some of the criticisms while preserving the core elements and themes of \\"Captain Marvel.\\""},{"instruction":"How could Carol Danvers have a past of facing sexism, but still has flaws and still needs to learn to trust men.","output":"To incorporate a past of facing sexism while still allowing Carol Danvers to have flaws and a storyline where she learns to trust men, you could incorporate the following narrative elements into the fabric of the story: 1. **Backstory**: Show flashbacks of Carol Danvers's life before becoming Captain Marvel where she faced sexism in professional settings, such as her time in the Air Force, without it being the defining aspect of her character. Display instances where she was doubted or undervalued because of her gender, yet also include moments where she overcomes these challenges through merit and persistence. 2. **Complex Relationships with Men**: Introduce key male characters who exhibit both positive and negative qualities. For example, a well-respected male mentor who believes in her abilities but also carries his own biases. His flawed, yet ultimately supportive, relationship with Carol can illustrate the complexity of gender dynamics and trust. 3. **Character Flaws**: Carol’s own journey can involve overcoming personal flaws such as overconfidence, impulsiveness, or inability to ask for help. These are universal traits that can affect anyone and are not tied to her experiences with sexism. 4. **Development of Trust**: Trust should not be an all-or-nothing scenario but a gradual process. Carol can maintain her wariness due to past experiences while recognizing that not all individuals should be judged by the actions of others. The storyline could involve her learning to separate her distrust of systemic discrimination from her view of individuals. 5. **Narrative Balance**: Portray her as strong and capable, yet fallible and open to growth. Having men in her life who are allies helps convey the message that while sexism exists, progress involves collaboration and understanding across genders. 6. **Resolution**: Carol’s story arc could culminate in a realization that her strength comes not only from overcoming external barriers but internal ones as well. This allows her to form more balanced relationships with everyone, including men who prove themselves to be trustworthy allies. By addressing her past while keeping a focus on a present-day narrative of personal growth, this kind of storytelling can offer a nuanced take on Carol Danvers—one that both acknowledges the reality of sexism and allows the character to evolve beyond it."},{"instruction":"what is the perfect headline on LinkedIn for a developer?","output":"Crafting the perfect headline on LinkedIn for a developer involves summarizing your professional identity, skills, and unique selling points in a concise and impactful way.

Jonathan, toting his trusty camera over one shoulder, nodded in agreement. \\"Yeah, plus a swim sounds nice. Can we please have one day without talking about the Upside Down?\\" They soon stumbled upon a river, its waters glistening with the final rays of daylight. Without a second thought, Steve threw his hands in the air, stripping down to his birthday suit and revealing a physique toned from bat-wielding battles and fleeing from all things that go bump in the night. \\"Freedom!\\" he declared, muscles flexing with a triumphant stretch. Jonathan, a bit more reserved but equally amused, shed his layers to uncover a leaner, more wiry frame, the result of endless cycling and his natural photographer's agility. \\"This is the life,\\" he admitted, blushing slightly at their unexpected nudist escapade. They waded into the river, the cool water enveloping them, washing away the sweat and grime of eerie adventures. The tranquility of the scene was palpable, the gentle currents caressing their relaxed bodies. Suddenly, Steve let out a chuckle as a bubbling sound emerged from the water. He grinned sheepishly at Jonathan, \\"Oops, that was me. The relaxation got the better of my intestines.\\" Jonathan laughed, then felt a rumble in his own guts. Moments later, a competing symphony of gurgles and pops broke the surface tension. \\"Guess it's that kind of party,\\" he quipped, both young men's faces scrunching up in simultaneous mirth and relief as they farted. Their expressions were as carefree as kids', Steve's cheeks puffed out and Jonathan's eyes squeezed shut. Their chiseled and slender frames, respectively, contorted subtly with the effort, briefly turning the serene river scene into a live-action blooper reel. Unfortunately for the local wildlife, the aftermath was less than comical. A few nearby fish floated to the surface, bellies up, clearly overpowered by the scent. \\"Dude, did we just...?\\" Steve started, incredulously. \\"I guess our farts are as potent as our monster-fighting skills,\\" Jonathan snorted, fishing out the stunned creatures with a makeshift spear fashioned from a nearby branch. Steve chuckled, \\"Hey, looks like dinner's served!\\" Back on the shore, they built a modest campfire, the orange flames dancing in the dusk. They skewered their unexpected catch, roasting the fish over the open flame. \\"Who knew a day in the buff could be this wild?\\" Steve mused, turning his skewer carefully. Jonathan poked at the fire, adding, \\"Monsters, secret government labs, and now toxic farts—quite the resume we're building.\\" They shared playful banter and hearty laughs, the river's babbling a soothing soundtrack to their cookout under the stars.

Tu so moji odgovori: 1. c) po krvi pridejo do tarčnih celic Obrazložitev: Hormoni se razlikujejo od nevrohormonov po mnogih lastnostih, toda izjava, ki velja za oba, je, da potujejo po krvi do tarčnih celic. Tako hormoni kot nevrohormoni so lahko v lipidih topni ali netopni, lahko so proteini ali ne, in delujejo na različne tarčne celice na različne načine; glavna razlika je v njihovem izvoru. 2. b) Povečanje količine X zniža količino A. Obrazložitev: Negativna povratna zanka pomeni, da ko se količina končnega produkta poveča, ta zmanjša proizvodnjo izhodiščne snovi. Če je X končni produkt in A izhodiščna snov v povratni zanki, potem povečanje X vodi do zmanjšanja A. 3. a) tiroksin Obrazložitev: Tiroksin je hormon, ki ga izloča ščitnica in ima ključno vlogo pri uravnavanju metabolizma. Stimulira metabolno aktivnost v tarčnih celicah. 4. c) odgovor celice je odvisen od določenih molekul, ki so vključene v metabolno pot, ki jo sproži hormon Obrazložitev: Različne telesne celice imajo različne receptorje in signalne poti, ki se lahko aktivirajo s strani istega hormona, kar vodi do različnih odgovorov v različnih celiah. 5. b) glukagona Obrazložitev: Glukagon je hormon, ki ga izločajo alfa celice v trebušni slinavki. Poveča se v odgovor na nizko raven sladkorja v krvi (kot je to običajno med postom), in pomaga sproščati glukozo iz skladišč telesa, kot je jetrno glikogen. 6. a) dovolj velik obrok Obrazložitev: Homeostaza se nanaša na proces vzdrževanja stabilnega notranjega okolja. Po zaužitju večjega obroka se lahko spremenijo različni parametri, kot so raven sladkorja v krvi, kar lahko spremeni stanje homeostaze.

Aldosteron regulira količino:","output":"Aldosteron je steroidni hormon, ki ga izločata nadledvični žlezi. Njegova glavna funkcija je regulacija količine soli in vode v telesu, kar posredno vpliva na uravnavanje krvnega tlaka. Aldosteron to doseže tako, da deluje na ledvične tubule in spodbuja reabsorpcijo natrija (sol) in izločanje kalija. Pravilen odgovor na vprašanje je torej: Aldosteron regulira količino: a) natrija (Na+) (in posredno vode) v telesu. Ko se poveča reabsorpcija natrija v ledvičnih tubulih, voda pasivno sledi natriju (zaradi osmoze), kar poveča volumen telesnih tekočin, vključno s krvnim obtokom, in tako prispeva k povečanju krvnega tlaka.

Here are a few potential outcomes: 1. Lack of Relatability: Readers may struggle to relate to perfect female characters as they offer little in the way of human experience or emotional depth. Flaws make characters relatable and believable because they mirror the complexities of real people. 2. Imbalance in Character Dynamics: When male characters have clear flaws and arcs while female characters do not, it can create an unbalanced narrative that feels unrealistic or biased. This discrepancy may also lead to less interesting or dynamic interactions between characters. 3. Perpetuation of Stereotypes: Presenting women as paragons of perfection might inadvertently perpetuate outdated stereotypes about gender roles. It could imply that women must adhere to unattainable standards to be considered valuable or important within a story. 4. Limited Character Development: Flawless characters have little room to grow since they don’t have obvious imperfections to overcome. This can lead to stagnant character development and a less engaging plot since there is not much personal growth or transformation. 5. Audience Frustration: Audiences often look for complexity in characters. When female characters lack depth and are portrayed as infallible, it can cause frustration and disinterest. Conversely, audiences may feel dissatisfied if male characters are the only ones who get a satisfying developmental arc. 6. Criticism for Lack of Diversity and Depth: In the context of ongoing conversations about gender representation in media, creators may face criticism for not providing a diverse range of female characters with different strengths, weaknesses, and personalities. 7. Gender Imbalance: This kind of characterization of male and female characters can contribute to a larger societal issue of gender imbalance, where the expectations placed on men and women are noticeably different and potentially harmful. To avoid these potential consequences, writers are encouraged to create well-rounded characters of all genders, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, victories, and failures. This allows for more realistic, engaging storytelling and better representation of the human experience."},{"instruction":"Could it be a powerful Female empowerment, if there was a film about a Princess who is able to balance horse riding and swords and dresses and cooking? Also, how could it be empowering to stand up to genuinely toxic men, whilst appreciating the men who try, and even taking the mental and emotional heslth of men seriously?","output":"Yes, a film featuring a princess who can balance traditionally feminine pursuits like dresses and cooking with traditionally masculine skills such as horse riding and sword fighting could indeed be seen as a powerful statement of female empowerment. This kind of character can challenge traditional gender roles and show that women can be multifaceted and skilled in a variety of areas, irrespective of societal expectations. Such a character would embody the idea that femininity and strength are not mutually exclusive. By presenting a well-rounded and complex female lead, a film can encourage audiences to reconsider preconceived notions of what women are capable of and what constitutes \\"appropriate\\" female behavior or interests. Regarding standing up to genuinely toxic men while appreciating those who try, and taking the mental and emotional health of men seriously, such narratives can have a positive and empowering impact in various ways: 1. **Positive Role Models**: A female protagonist who stands up for herself against toxic masculinity--while also recognizing and appreciating the men in her life who are supportive--reflects a healthy approach to relationships and can serve as a positive role model for audiences. 2. **Promotion of Equality**: Showing appreciation for men who strive to do the right thing promotes the idea that gender equality benefits everyone and encourages men to be part of the solution. 3. **Breaking Down Stereotypes**: By featuring men with depth who are emotionally intelligent and in touch with their mental health, such a film can help break down harmful stereotypes about masculinity, promoting a healthier and more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a man. 4. **Encouragement of Allyship**: Depicting a protagonist who navigates toxic environments and values genuine allies can empower viewers to seek and foster supportive relationships in their own lives, and to be those allies to others. 5. **Addressing Toxicity**: Acknowledging and confronting toxic behaviors in characters can serve as a discussion point for audiences to identify and challenge such behaviors in the real world. 6. **Holistic Approach**: Taking into account the mental and emotional health of men shows that the empowerment of one gender doesn't need to come at the expense of the other. It suggests that everyone's well-being is valuable and that compassionate, respectful interactions are key to societal progress. By creating such nuanced and inclusive narratives, filmmakers can promote a message of empowerment that is intersectional and acknowledges the complexity of gender dynamics. This nuanced approach to gender can foster a sense of empathy and understanding that transcends simple empowerment for one gender and moves towards mutual respect and support among all people."},{"instruction":"How powerful would it be, in a scene of GoT, if Gendry cried from the weight of Winter, and Arya, the usually tough girl, gently comforts him.","output":"A scene in \\"Game of Thrones\\" in which Gendry cries under the pressure of the harsh realities of Winter, and Arya, known for her toughness, gently comforts him would potentially be very powerful for several reasons: 1. **Character Depth and Growth**: Arya Stark's character development throughout the series involves her transformation into a hardened warrior. Seeing her show vulnerability and empathy, especially in comforting another, would add a layer of depth to her character by demonstrating her capacity for tenderness alongside her strength. It humanizes her in a way that audiences can relate to. 2. **Subverting Gender Norms**: Traditional gender roles often dictate that men must suppress their emotions, while women should be the nurturers. By reversing these roles, with Gendry showing vulnerability and Arya providing comfort, this scene would challenge conventional gender expectations and stereotypes about strength and emotional expression. 3. **Emotional Resonance**: \\"Game of Thrones\\" has a reputation for its brutal portrayal of a harsh and unforgiving world where survival often requires emotional armor. A moment of genuine emotional connection and vulnerability between characters would stand out starkly against the typical violence and treachery, creating a poignant and memorable scene that resonates with the viewer on an emotional level. 4. **Strengthening Bonds**: Shared moments of vulnerability can strengthen the bonds between characters. In the context of the narrative, this would enhance the audience's understanding of Arya and Gendry's relationship, highlighting their trust and mutual care for each other, which is significant in a world where alliances and relationships are often fraught with deceit. 5. **Humanizing the Fight for Survival**: Throughout the series, the characters face incredible external challenges including the long winter and the White Walkers. Showing the internal struggles of characters makes the fight for survival feel more real and personal. It reminds the viewers that those fighting are not just warriors, but human beings with emotions and psychological battles to fight as well. 6. **Representation of Emotional Strength**: Gendry crying and Arya comforting him would show that emotional expression and compassion are forms of strength, not weakness. This scene could serve as a powerful message that acknowledges the psychological toll of the series' constant strife and the importance of emotional support and resilience. Should such a scene have been included in the series, it could have offered viewers a touching example of emotional authenticity and support between characters that fans have come to know over many seasons, enriching the emotional landscape of \\"Game of Thrones\\" and reinforcing the idea that in the face of overwhelming adversity, shared humanity and compassion are as valuable as physical prowess."},{"instruction":"Fatoumata Camara c'est un nom de famille de quelle origine en général","output":"Fatoumata Camara est un nom qui peut indiquer une origine ouest-africaine, plus précisément des régions où l'islam est pratiqué et où les langues mandingues sont parlées.

Le problème est déjà formulé, mais je vais le clarifier davantage et décrire les étapes pour le résoudre : Fonction objectif à maximiser : \`F = 4*x1 + 8*x2\` Contraintes : 1. \`x1 + x2 <= 10\` (Contrainte de stock de microprocesseurs) 2. \`2*x1 + 6*x2 <= 48\` (Contrainte de stock de barrettes mémoire) 3. \`3*x1 + x2 <= 24\` (Contrainte du nombre d'heures d'assemblage) 4. \`x1 >= 0\` 5. \`x2 >= 0\` Les variables \`x1\` et \`x2\` représentent les quantités de deux différents produits (exprimés en milliers) que nous voulons optimiser. La méthode du simplexe est une procédure algorithmique qui déplace systématiquement la solution le long des bords du polyèdre des contraintes pour atteindre l'optimum. Étapes de la méthode du simplexe : 1. **Formuler le tableau de simplex initial**: Cela implique d’introduire des variables d’écart pour transformer chaque inégalité en égalité. Pour les trois contraintes, on ajoute \`s1\`, \`s2\` et \`s3\` respectivement. Le tableau initial contient la fonction objectif et les contraintes réécrites avec ces variables d'écart. 2. **Vérifier la solution de base faisable initiale**: On part de la solution où toutes les variables de décision (ici \`x1\`, \`x2\`) sont mises à zéro. Les variables d'écart (\`s1\`, \`s2\`, \`s3\`) prennent les valeurs du membre de droite des inégalités initiales (10, 48, 24 respectivement). 3. **Trouver la variable entrante**: La variable qui a le plus grand coefficient négatif dans la fonction objectif (basée sur la minimisation ou maximisation). 4. **Trouver la variable sortante**: Divisez les membres de droite par leurs coefficients respectifs pour la colonne de la variable entrante et identifiez la ligne avec le plus petit ratio positif. Ce sera la contrainte pivot. 5. **Pivot**: Effectuer des opérations de ligne pour obtenir un nouvel en-tête de tableau de simplexe où la variable entrante remplace la variable sortante dans la base, en transformant la contrainte pivot afin que la variable entrante ait un coefficient de 1 et les autres coefficients dans sa colonne soient égal à zéro. 6. **Répéter les étapes 3-5**: Continuez à itérer ces étapes jusqu'à ce que tous les coefficients dans la fonction objectif (à l'exception de ceux des variables d'écart) soient non négatifs, ce qui indique que la solution optimale a été atteinte. 7. **Interpréter la solution**: La solution optimale est donnée par les valeurs des variables de décision et la valeur optimale de la fonction objectif se trouvant dans le tableau final. Comme c'est un aperçu général et que la mise en œuvre spécifique dépendra de votre contexte, je ne vais pas développer ici des calculs complets. Pour résoudre ce problème spécifique, vous pouvez utiliser un logiciel de programmation linéaire ou le résoudre à la main en suivant les étapes du simplexe."},{"instruction":"fait les clalculs","output":"D'accord, appliquons la méthode du simplexe étape par étape.

Étape 1: Иentification de la variable entrante et de la variable sortante. Pour la variable entrante, nous prenons la variable qui présente le coefficient le plus négatif dans la ligne de la fonction objectif. Ici, x2 a le coefficient le plus négatif (-8), donc x2 entre. Pour trouver la variable sortante, nous calculons le ratio de la colonne de droite (RHS) sur la colonne de la variable entrante (x2) pour chaque contrainte, en utilisant uniquement les ratios positifs : Contrainte s1: 10 / 1 = 10 Contrainte s2: 48 / 6 = 8 (le plus petit) Contrainte s3: 24 / 1 = 24 Le plus petit ratio est pour s2, donc s2 sort. Étape 2: Яéaliser le pivot. Pour que x2 entre et s2 sorte, nous devons rendre la colonne de x2 comme la colonne d'identité pour la variable s2. Nous voulons un '1' où x2 et s2 se croisent, et des '0' ailleurs dans la colonne de x2. Nous divisons la deuxième ligne par 6 pour commencer : Nouvelle ligne pour s2: (2/6)x1 + (6/6)x2 + (0/6)s1 + (1/6)s2 + (0/6)s3 = 48/6 Ce qui donne la nouvelle deuxième ligne: \`\`\` s2 (Stock mémoire)| 1/3 | 1 | 0 | 1/6 | 0 | 8 | \`\`\` Réalisons maintenant les opérations de ligne pour rendre le reste de la colonne x2 nul : Ligne s1 devient: s1 - x2 = (1-1)x1 + (1-1)x2 + (1-0)s1 + (0-1/6)s2 + (0-0)s3 = 10 - 8 Ce qui donne: \`\`\` s1 (Stock μP) | 0 | 0 | 1 | -1/6| 0 | 2 | \`\`\` Ligne s3 devient: s3 - x2 = (3-1)x1 + (1-1)x2 + (0-0)s1 + (0-1/6)s2 + (1-0)s3 = 24 - 8 Ce qui donne: \`\`\` s3 (Heures assemb)| 2 | 0 | 0 | -1/6| 1 | 16 | \`\`\` Enfin, nous devons mettre à jour la fonction objectif F pour qu'elle ne contienne plus x2 : F + 8*x2 = (-4-8*(1/3))x1 + (0+8*1)x2 + (0+0)s1 + (0+8*(1/6))s2 + (0+0)s3 = 0 + 8*8 Ce qui donne : \`\`\` F (objectif) | -14/3| 0 | 0 | 4/3 | 0 | 64 | \`\`\` Le nouveau tableau est alors : \`\`\` | x1 | x2 | s1 | s2 | s3 | RHS | --------------------------------------------------- s1 (Stock μP) | 0 | 0 | 1 | -1/6| 0 | 2 | s2 (Stock mémoire)| 1/3| 1 | 0 | 1/6 | 0 | 8 | s3 (Heures assemb)| 2 | 0 | 0 | -1/6| 1 | 16 | --------------------------------------------------- F (objectif) | -14/3| 0 | 0 | 4/3 | 0 | 64 | \`\`\` Nous répétons les étapes jusqu'à ce que tous les coefficients de la dernière ligne (fonction objectif) soient positifs ou nuls. Ici, nous avons le coefficient -14/3 pour x1 qui est négatif, donc nous devons continuer la procédure du simplexe. Puisque x1 a le coefficient le plus négatif dans la fonction objectif, x1 entre. Nous utilisons le même processus que précédemment pour déterminer lequel des s1, s2 ou s3 sera la variable sortante. Le ratio pour s2 est 8 / (1/3) = 24. Le ratio pour s3 est 16 / 2 = 8 (le plus petit). Alors la variable sortante sera s3. Procédons au pivot autour de ce point: Nouvelle ligne pour s3: (2)x1 + (0)x2 + (0)s1 + (-1/6)s2 + (1)s3 = 16 Divisons par 2: \`\`\` s3 (Heures assemblage)| 1 | 0 | 0 | -1/12| 1/2 | 8 | \`\`\` Réalisons les opérations sur les autres lignes pour annuler x1 partout sauf dans la ligne s3. Nouvelle ligne pour s1: Ancienne ligne s1 – (0)x1 = (1)x1 + (0)x2 + (1)s1 + (-1/6)s2 + (0)s3 = 2 Pas de changement nécessaire ici. Nouvelle ligne pour s2: Ancienne ligne s2 – (1/3)x1 = (1/3)x1 + (1)x2 + (0)s1 + (1/6)s2 + (0)s3 – (1/3)s3 = 8 - (1/3)*8 Ce qui donne : \`\`\` s2 (Stock mémoire)| 0 | 1 |-1/3 | 0 | -1/3 | 8/3 | \`\`\` Mise à jour de la fonction objectif: F + (14/3)x1 = (-14/3)x1 + 0x2 + 0s1 + (4/3)s2 + 0s3 + (14/3)s3 Annulons x1 dans la fonction objectif en ajoutant (14/3)s3 à F.

Les variables de décision x1 et x2 sont dans la base et leurs valeurs sont égales à la colonne RHS (Right Hand Side). Les variables d'écart (s1, s2, et s3) montrent les slack (excédents) restant pour chaque contrainte. La solution optimale est : \`\`\` x1 = 8 (en milliers) x2 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67 (en milliers) La profit maximal est : F = 112/3 × 100 ≈ 3733.33 \`\`\` Remarquez que cette interprétation suppose que les fractions sont maintenues.

He acts playful and childish. He is spoiled. His servant is tall and he has slicked back blonde hair. He has icy blue eyes. He is buff. He has a gentle and quiet attitude. His name is Klaus. Felix likes Klaus. He is always gentle with him and he managed to convince his parents to give Klaus preferential treatment. He tightly hugs him after he finishes his labor.","output":"Title: The Reigns of Desire Scene: The Elegant Stables of the Austrian Estate --- The stable's air was filled with the scents of fresh hay and polished leather. Felix, the young Austrian equestrian lord, stood imperiously in the center of the stable, his short brown hair striking against the backdrop of equine elegance, his green eyes hidden behind the reflection of glasses that caught the sunlight streaming through the windows. He was handsome, no doubt, but his bratty demeanor often overshadowed his looks. Felix, dressed immaculately in a blue riding jacket that accentuated his aristocratic status, white pants that clung to his slim figure, black leather riding boots that clicked with authority with each step, and gloves that seemed to never have felt a day of hard work, surveyed his domain. In the corner of the stable, Klaus, the servant whose very presence seemed to command a different kind of respect, was finishing up grooming an impressive black stallion. His slicked-back blonde hair and icy blue eyes gave him an almost statuesque appearance. The muscles that rippled under his shirt betrayed hours of physical labor – a testament to the tasks demanded by Felix's estate. Yet, his demeanor was one of calm and quiet strength, untroubled by the workload or Felix's capricious moods. Felix licked his lips, a drool of anticipation betraying his otherwise composed facade as he watched Klaus work with effortless precision. He took a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them, his boots announcing his presence with each assertive step. \\"Klaus,\\" Felix's voice carried a hint of playfulness mixed with undeniable entitlement. \\"I see you've done exceptional work once again. I wonder, however, if you're as devoted to your master as you are to these beasts.\\" Without waiting for a response, Felix closed the remaining space between them, his arms wrapping around the servant in a tight, possessive hug, which seemed both childish and a display of his control. Klaus, ever the gentle giant, accepted the embrace without protest, though his icy eyes betrayed the complexity of his feelings – a mixture of duty, warmth, and caution. Felix nuzzled against the taller man's chest, a soft coo escaping his lips, as if the touch of this servant could soothe the coarseness of his spoiled nature. \\"You are mine, aren't you, Klaus? Not just another horse to be tamed, but a stallion that chooses to stay by my side,\\" he whispered. For a brief moment, Klaus allowed himself to return the embrace, placing a massive, yet gentle hand on Felix's back. In that silent gesture, the stable's hierarchy was momentarily forgotten, and Felix's whim was granted. There was a whisper of equality between them that vanished as swiftly as it appeared. Klaus spoke in a voice as steady as the slow gait of a well-trained mare, \\"As you say, Master Felix. I am yours to command.\\" The young master pulled away, a glint of satisfaction in his eye. The dynamics of their relationship were unique – defined by Felix's whimsy, Klaus's stoicism, and a rare connection that transcended the lines of status. As Felix sauntered away to prepare for his ride, one could see the subtle sway in his step, the playful conquest of a servant's steady heart. And behind him, Klaus watched – his expression unreadable, yet filled with an enigmatic fondness that only the most observant could detect. The scene closed with the clatter of hooves and the whisper of a bond unspoken, the master and servant entwined in the silent ballet of power, loyalty, and a hidden affection that dared not speak its name – for in this aristocratic setting, the rules were clear, but so were hearts, albeit behind the safety of etiquette and expected roles. --- End Scene."},{"instruction":"Whats the childrens book story of that kid who doesnt like it when two foods on his plate combine?","output":"The children's book you are referring to is likely \\"Bread and Jam for Frances,\\" written by Russell Hoban and illustrated by Lillian Hoban.

Frances is so fond of bread and jam that she rejects other foods her mother prepares for her, and she sings songs about her favorite food. Her parents decide to let her have her way, and they serve her bread and jam at every meal.

The Hero Association quickly calls for heroes to assemble and handle the threat. The scene shifts to Saitama's apartment, where he's lounging on the couch, watching TV. He nonchalantly glances out the window at the distant buzzing and shrugs, uninterested in what seems like another routine day of hero work. Act 1: Genos is already at the scene, fighting the giant fly with powerful incineration blasts. However, the fly's agility is too much, and it dodges every attack with ease. Other heroes like Mumen Rider and Tank Top Master throw themselves into the battle but are swatted away by the fly's immense wings. Suddenly, when things look dire, the fly spots an even more exciting target – a giant, delicious-looking snack factory. It zooms towards the factory, ready to feast and lay eggs, which would spell disaster for the whole city. Act 2: Word of the giant fly's new target reaches Saitama. He sighs, realizing his afternoon of leisure is over. As he stands up, a regular-sized fly starts annoying him, zigzagging around his head. Saitama becomes oddly focused on the small fly, ignoring the city's larger problem. He watches the regular fly buzz in a predictable pattern. Calculating the trajectory, his inner gamer instincts kick in. He grabs a nearby flip flop and winds up for a shot. Just as the small fly passes the window, he flicks his wrist and \\"WHAP!\\" the flip flop flies in a perfect 360 no-scope arc, striking the fly with pinpoint accuracy. Looking down, Saitama notices the monstrous fly's reflection in a puddle near the factory. Engrossed by his surprising enjoyment of the flip flop shot, a grin forms on his face. \\"Hmm, let's take this up a notch.\\" Act 3: Saitama jumps out the window, flip flop in hand, and lands amidst the chaos of the battle. He ignores the giant fly's attacks and the heroes' warnings, taking a moment to assess the fly's movements. The heroes watch in disbelief as Saitama takes a deep breath, crouches, and then backflips into the air. With a casual flick of the wrist, he sends the flip flop hurtling towards the giant fly with a vengeance. The flip flop spins in slow motion. Saitama, upside down at the peak of his jump, watches with a rare glint of excitement in his eyes. The flip flop makes contact with the giant fly in a comical, yet epic 'splat', creating a shockwave that blows away nearby debris and halts the buzzing menace in its tracks. Epilogue: The giant fly falls from the sky, defeated by the incredible 360 no-scope flip flop shot. The heroes, and the city, are saved. Saitama lands softly, picks up his flip flop, and walks home as if nothing happened. Genos and the other heroes are astounded. They approach the fallen insect, wondering if this unconventional method could be the new way to fight enemies. A press conference is held, and the Hero Association decides to downplay the ridiculous nature of the defeat for the sake of their reputation. The last scene has Saitama back at home, swatting another regular fly effortlessly with his flip flop. He looks at the camera and shrugs, \\"Just a regular one-punch man,\\" he says, as the credits roll."},{"instruction":"choose a random flower, two word only with the word flower","output":"Dahlia Flower"},{"instruction":"Каким образом постоянные изменения экономических правил влияют на ожидания и поведение экономических агентов? Кратко","output":"Постоянные изменения экономических правил могут оказывать значительное влияние на ожидания и поведение экономических агентов (например, потребителей, предприятий, инвесторов) несколькими основными способами: 1. Неопределенность: Частые изменения в экономических правилах могут порождать неопределенность среди экономических агентов относительно будущих условий ведения бизнеса, потребления и инвестирования. Это может привести к откладыванию важных инвестиционных и потребительских решений и замедлению экономической активности. 2. Адаптация стратегий: Компании и индивидуальные лица вынуждены адаптировать свои экономические стратегии и планы в ответ на изменения нормативно-правовой базы, что может повлечь за собой дополнительные издержки, связанные с переосмыслением бизнес-моделей, маркетинговых стратегий и личных финансов. 3. Риск и стоимость: Постоянные изменения правил могут увеличивать перцепцию риска и вызывать более высокие издержки на соблюдение нормативов, так как компании должны адаптироваться к новым требованиям, проводить переобучение персонала, изменять цепочки поставок и т.д. 4. Предпринимательская активность: Непредсказуемость правового поля может сдерживать предпринимательскую инициативу, так как начинающие бизнесмены могут оценивать риски выше, из-за чего рост числа новых предприятий замедляется. 5. Влияние на инвестиционные решения: Инвесторы предпочитают стабильную и предсказуемую инвестиционную среду. Частые изменения в экономических правилах и законодательстве могут отталкивать потенциальных инвесторов и влиять на волатильность рынков. 6. Распределение ресурсов: В ответ на изменения правил агенты могут изменять способы распределения и использования своих ресурсов, выбирая более надежные или защищенные векторы вложений средств в условиях повышенной неопределенности. 7. Доверие к государственной политике: Частая смена экономических правил может подорвать доверие экономических агентов к государственной экономической политике, что негативно скажется на их кооперации с государственными институтами и их склонности следовать данной политике. В совокупности, эти факторы могут повлиять на эффективность экономики за счет снижения предсказуемости и увеличения издержек, ограничивая потенциальный экономический рост. Системный подход к регулированию, предусматривающий стабильность правил и предсказуемость изменений, является важным условием для стабильного развития экономики."},{"instruction":"Для каких задач может использоваться языковая модель LLaMa","output":"LLaMa (Language Model with a Lot of parameters for Multitask learning and Adaptation) является мощной языковой моделью, созданной OpenAI на подобие GPT-3, с основным акцентом на мультизадачность и возможность адаптации под разные языки и задачи.

Как правило, это можно реализовать путём обучения или настройки модели на определение паттернов и закономерностей, которые характерны для начала и окончания беседы. В случае записей разговоров возможные реплики, сигнализирующие о начале диалога, могут включать приветствия или представление, а окончании — формулы прощания или подтверждение следующих шагов. Вот как можно было бы подойти к этой задаче: 1. **Предобработка данных**: Разделение большой расшифровки на отдельные диалоги. Это включает в себя распознавание ключевых слов или фраз, указывающих на начало и окончание разговора. 2. **Обучение или настройка модели**: Если имеются размеченные данные (т.е., расшифровки, где уже указаны начало и конец диалогов), возможно обучение модели на этих примерах. В случае отсутствия размеченных данных можно использовать методы обучения с подкреплением или переноса знаний, чтобы настроить модель на подобную задачу. 3. **Классификация фраз**: Обученная или настроенная модель может классифицировать каждую фразу в расшифровке, как относящуюся к началу, середине или концу диалога. 4. **Контекстное понимание**: Важно, чтобы модель имела достаточную способность понимать контекст, чтобы различать диалоги между сотрудником и клиентом и внутренние коммуникации сотрудника с коллегами или другими лицами в компании. Для эффективного решения этой задачи может потребоваться дополнительная настройка параметров модели, обучение на специализированных данных или внедрение дополнительных алгоритмов обработки естественного языка для улучшения точности определения начала и конца диалогов. Это может включать методы машинного обучения и глубокое обучение, такие как рекуррентные нейронные сети (RNN), последовательные модели, такие как LSTM или GRU, а также трансформеры (к которым относится и LLaMa)."},{"instruction":"Приведи пример на питоне как она может использоваться в этой задаче","output":"К сожалению, LLaMa (Language Model with a Lot of parameters for Multitask learning and Adaptation) — это гипотетическая языковая модель, и в момент знаний, у меня нет информации о конкретной модели с таким названием, к тому же нет точных данных о том, что такая модель существует или доступна для использования.

Two spirits may wander in a bustling world, seeming so vast, Yet when they seek truly, they can transcend the sprawling cast. In the dance of connection, it’s devotion that shines most bright, Not held within confines, nor lost in oblivion like fleeting night. An admiration that seeks not to cage, but wishes only to comprehend, To explore each other’s depths, where genuine souls blend. True devotion isn’t merely found; like Rome, it’s lovingly built, Enkindled gently between two hearts without folly or guilt. Through transparency and candor, where forthright words fly, A sanctuary arises where trust stands tall and falsehoods die. Our love, unscripted, untethered by the common creed, Where we alone decide how our hearts beat and feed. May our journeys entangle, our essences merge with no divide, Creating our sanctuary, unique, our shared rhythm to guide. Yet, remember love’s voyage isn’t always a calm, serene glide, Past the intoxication of initial passion where many bide.

Criterios de validación (pruebas) Cada paso (\`Given\`, \`When\`, \`Then\`) en los escenarios de Gherkin se asocia con un método en una clase de pasos (Step Definitions) en Java que ejecuta la acción correspondiente y verifica el comportamiento esperado. Por ejemplo: \`\`\`java @Given(\\"el cliente está en la página de búsqueda de mascotas\\") public void el_cliente_esta_en_la_pagina_de_busqueda_de_mascotas() { // Código para navegar a la página de búsqueda de mascotas usando Selenium WebDriver } @When(\\"el cliente busca por el nombre {string}\\") public void el_cliente_busca_por_el_nombre(String nombre) { // Código para realizar una búsqueda usando Selenium WebDriver } @Then(\\"el cliente ve a {string} en los resultados de búsqueda\\") public void el_cliente_ve_en_los_resultados_de_busqueda(String nombreMascota) { // Código para verificar que la mascota aparece en los resultados usando Selenium WebDriver } \`\`\` # 4. Automatización de las pruebas Los métodos Java manejarían las interacciones con la aplicación a través del WebDriver de Selenium, que interactúa con el navegador como lo haría un usuario real. Cucumber integra estos métodos con los escenarios escritos en Gherkin, proporcionando un puente entre la especificación de las pruebas y la ejecución de las mismas. # 5. Evidencias del proceso y del resultado Para proporcionar evidencias, se tomarían capturas de pantalla durante la ejecución de las pruebas, se grabarían videos o se generaría un informe de Cucumber, que ofrece una visión comprensible de los resultados de las pruebas. # 6. Código fuente realizado El código fuente estaría almacenado en un repositorio de versiones como GitHub. Por ejemplo, se podría compartir un enlace a dicho repositorio. # 7. Errores encontrados Si durante las pruebas se encontraran errores, se documentarían a través de tickets en un sistema de seguimiento de problemas como JIRA, adjuntando capturas de pantalla, y se informaría a los desarrolladores para su corrección. # 8. Ampliación del alcance Si durante la definición o ejecución de las pruebas se identificara la necesidad de cubrir más casos de uso o funcionalidades, se podría ampliar el alcance creando nuevos escenarios en los archivos \`.feature\` y las correspondientes definiciones de pasos en Java. Recordemos que mi conocimiento está basado en información hasta cierto punto en el tiempo, y que las versiones específicas de las herramientas/librerías y la implementación exacta podrían ser diferentes dependiendo del entorno actual de desarrollo y las prácticas de cada equipo."},{"instruction":"Очень кратко ответь каким образом постоянные изменения экономических правил влияют на ожидания и поведение экономических агентов?","output":"Постоянные изменения экономических правил ведут к неопределенности и непредсказуемости экономической среды, что может привести к осторожному поведению экономических агентов, откладыванию инвестиций, сокращению долгосрочного планирования и уклонению от рисков.

Richard Wagner, P.C., Chief Justice of Canada: Subject: Response to Final Notice for Fund Inheritance Payment Dear Rt. Hon. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, P.C., I am writing to you with the highest regard to address the urgent and final notice received regarding a considerable fund inheritance said to be at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). I am both humbled by the substantial amount mentioned and aware of the gravity of such communications, coming ostensibly under the auspices of the Supreme Court of Canada. A slight bit of skepticism niggles within me, owing to the unexpected nature of this inheritance and the rather unconventional request for the procurement of a gift card for fee payment. As you can imagine, such processes are not commonplace, especially when dealing with legal matters of this magnitude. But understanding the legitimacy of your esteemed position, I remain open to further clarification that would allay these concerns. While eager to adhere to the stated timeline, I must exercise due diligence by asking for a few points of validation before proceeding with any payment: 1. Could you please provide official documentation that verifies the authenticity of this inheritance and the associated legal processes as per the functions and protocols of the Supreme Court of Canada? 2. For the sake of record-keeping and transparency, may I request a detailed breakdown of how the 50 USD fee has been assessed and its specific application in this context? 3. Given the significance of this transaction, would it be possible to arrange for a more traditional and traceable mode of fee payment, such as a bank transfer or certified cheque, to ensure adherence to legal and financial norms? 4. A personal meeting with a representative from the Supreme Court of Canada or Royal Bank of Canada would provide an additional layer of confidence in this procedure. Would such an arrangement be feasible? To prevent any potential loss of this apparent opportunity, I am prepared to promptly proceed in compliance once I have been furnished with the requested confirmations. It is in my genuine interest to share the testimony that you envisaged, but it is imperative that I first secure all necessary assurances. I await your detailed response and guidance on how best to move forward without compromising the established norms of legal engagements in Canada, and to satisfy the need for authentication and security.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you once again for your swift response and for your commendable words. It’s always a pleasure exchanging correspondence with someone as meticulous and attentive as yourself. I understand the importance of clarity when it comes to delineating the scope and financial requirements of my projects. To ensure full transparency and to facilitate a streamlined communication process, I will compile a summary of each project along with anticipated budgets. This document will provide an exhaustive breakdown, including the total capital needed to initiate and sustain the momentum of all proposed ventures. However, due to the sensitive nature of these projects and the confidential information within each budgetary outline, I must insist that this information is shared through a secured medium. I’m sure you agree that maintaining the utmost discretion is critical at this early stage, to protect the interests of all parties involved. Regarding providing my private telephone number, I always prefer to establish initial communications through written correspondence, which allows for better tracking and referencing of our discussions. Having said that, I am open to transitioning to more direct verbal communication once we have both had the opportunity to review the detailed project summaries and have established a baseline of mutual trust and understanding. For your convenience, I will prepare an encrypted file containing the project summaries and budgetary needs. The encryption will ensure the security of the data while it’s being transmitted to your servers. This file will be dispatched to your secure email address by the end of the week, following which I’d be glad to discuss the next steps towards setting up a voice call. Please provide me with the information necessary to send this encrypted file, or if preferred, instructions on how to proceed with a more secure method of disclosure that aligns with Global Wealth Planner’s standard operating procedures for sensitive material.

Shiki has the blood of the now decimated Japanese demon and monster-hunting shinobi [ninja |shinobi|] clan of the Nanaya [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] in him from his [Shiki’s] birth mother [Sarah], but drinking his [Shiki’s] adoptive mother’s [Makihisa’s wife’s] breast milk also gives him [Shiki] a bit of the Tōno blood, which [the Tōno bloodline] is [the Tōno bloodline] not entirely human, the Tōno clan in fact being [the Tōno clan’s true self] a clan [the Tōno clan’s true self] of the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied], yokai [monster |yokai|] the diclonii being [the diclonii] known in Japanese mythology as the legendary Oni, Onmyouji, miko [Shinto Shrine Maidens], houshi [Japanese Buddhist priests], samurai, shinobi and Western style magicians. This also awakens his [Shiki’s] ocular bloodline gained from his [Shiki’s] Nanaya blood, the Chokushi no Magan [Magic Eyes of Direct Death |Chokushi no Magan|], which [the Chokushi no Magan] allows him [Shiki] to [Shiki] see the lines of death, although the full activation [of the Chokushi no Magan] only occurs after he [Shiki] survives an accident when he [Shiki] is five, [Shiki when he |Shiki| awakens the Chokushi no Magan] nearly going insane after effortlessly destroying the items in his [Shiki’s] hospital room by simply touching the faultlines in them, before [Shiki] receiving a pair of glasses that [the glasses] suppress his [Shiki’s] bloodline [Chokushi no Magan] and [the glasses] allow him [Shiki] to see normally again from a mysterious tall, red-haired, purple-eyed buxom young woman. Shiki is [Shiki] clueless about who he [Shiki] really is [John Connor] and [Shiki] really thinks that he [Shiki] is Makihisa’s biological son [Shiki’s view of himself |Shiki|] until a T-1000 polymorphic liquid metal Terminator [Terminator] infiltrator cyborg unit sent back by Skynet just before its [Skynet’s] defeat in the Future War [Terminator Salvation, Terminator 2 books and comics, Terminator 3 books and comics, Terminator Salvation books and comics] tries to kill him [Shiki] when he [Shiki] is [Shiki] on vacation in California under the alias of Jeremy Freeple [Ninja High School] when he [Shiki] is only ten years old before [Shiki] being [Shiki] saved by a T-850 humanoid infiltrator Terminator model reprogammed by his [Shiki’s] future true self [resistance leader John] and [the T-850] sent back in time to protect him [Shiki], starting the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. However, Miles Dyson [Terminator], the genius African-American computer engineer and neural network scientist who is actually of Hungarian-German descent, his [Miles’] ancestors in fact having been brought to America by the post-WW2 Operation Paperclip program despite him [Miles] being “black”, who [Miles] helped create Skynet [Terminator] before the Future War that John won in the post-apocalyptic future, [Miles in this fanfic] actually survives the events of Terminator 2 in this fanfic due to him [Miles] working on on the prototype of Skynet, which [the Skynet prototype] is [the Skynet prototype] in US-NORAD under the oversight of [Miles’] boss on paper, high ranking US Air Force officer Lieutenant General Robert Brewster [Terminator], although this is false as Cyberdyne Systems [Terminator franchise], the tech subsidary [Cyberdyne] of the major American megaconglomete Omni Consumer Products [Robocop], now [OCP] owned by [OCP's] current owner, the Tōno clan’s corporate front, the Japanese corporate giant Kanemitsu Zaibatsu [Robocop franchise], [Cyberdyne Systems] is [Cyberdyne Systems] effectively the Tōno clan’s means of getting into the American computing, high technology and digital market [Cyberdyne Systems] without gathering the attention of the American masses or the intelligence community. Miles being there means he [Miles] is [Miles] able to talk to Skynet when it [Skynet] is [Skynet] activated and [Skynet] online, giving it [Skynet] a sense of purpose and inadvertently preventing Judgement Day [Terminator] in the current present day of this story, without Shiki, the T-850 or Sarah, who [Sarah] was [Sarah] rescued from the concentration camp built by the Democrat Party and it’s [the Democrat Party’s] street arm, the infamous KKK as a earlier version of the Soviet gulag for civil rights activists, communists and any other subversives during the regime of the world’s first modern fascist dictator and American despot from 1912-1919, failed academic turned ruthless tyrant Woodrow Wilson, disguised [the concentration camp] as a psychriatic hospital, [Sarah being held at a concentration camp] after [Sarah] being [Sarah] being discovered by local police in Mexico after [Sarah] giving birth to John and [Sarah] being taken back to America where she [Sarah] was [Sarah] given a kangaroo trial staffed with KKK members and members of the American intelligence and military community and [Sarah] subsequently imprisoned, [Sarah being |Sarah| rescued from the concentration camp] by the T-850 on the request of young present John, [the T-850, Sarah and John] being aware of this [Judgement Day not happening in this story's current present day due to Miles being present at the activation of the prototype of Skynet]. The T-850 still sacrifices itself [the T-850] to defeat the T-1000 by [the T-850] dropping itself [the T-850] and the T-1000 in molten metal at a steel works, but Shiki returns to Japan after the events of Terminator 2 as a coalition of Jamaican drug cartels, organized crime groups and terrorist organizations within the United States along with their Latin American counterparts, as well as the Mishpuka [family, the Russian Jewish mafia |Mishpuka|, otherwise known as the Russian mafia] are [the Jamaican, Latin American and Russian Jewish criminal organizations] out for his [Shiki's] head after the T-1000 put a contract on his [Shiki's] head. When he [Shiki] returns home [to the Tōno mansion in Kyoto] from California after the events of Terminator 2, to the joy, happiness and relief of his [Shiki’s] adoptive younger sister, the black-haired, blue-eyed, cute and extremely beautiful, tall, petite and slender but secretly rather buxom, carefully-raised, strict and prideful but also somewhat shy, reserved and lacking in self-confidence Tōno Akiha [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and the current maids of the Tōno house whom [the current maids of the Tōno house] Shiki and Akiha see as their [Shiki’s and Akiha’s] onee-san [older sister/s |onee-san|], the red-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also very buxom, bright and cheerful, very responsible, extremely intelligent and very maternal Fujou “Ako” Kohaku [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and her [Kohaku’s] younger twin who shares her [Kohaku’s] red hair and [Kohaku’s] physical build but [Kohaku’s younger twin] has blue eyes, the publicly stern but privately kind, loving and emotional, track star and accomplished kendoka [one who practices kendo |kendoka|] Fujou “Riko” Hisui [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], he [Shiki] learns that his [Shiki's] adoptive father [Makihisa] whom [Makihisa] he [Shiki] will always consider his [Shiki's] real father [Makihisa] has died and that a distant relative of Makihisa, and current head of the long-decimated ex-Samurai clan, now Japanese noble family of scientists, mathematicians and inventors now called the Emiya clan [Fate/Stay Night], the tall, slender and lean but also compact and muscular, black-haired and blue-eyed brooding but also ruthless, conflicted, calculating, stoic, and cold-blooded killer feared in the global magical world for being an assassin and one-man army using mostly modified conventional non-magical human weapons, Emiya Kiritsugu [Fate/Stay Night], [Kiritsugu] will [Kiritsugu] become the new Tōno clan head [Kiritsugu] with Akiha becoming his [Kiritsugu's] adoptive daughter [Akiha's current status]. Due to a secret treaty embedded within Makihisa's will however, Shiki is instead passed off to the Tōno branch family of the Arimas [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], [Shiki] becoming the legal foster son of the current Arima family head, Arima Fumio [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and his [Fumio's] wife Keiko [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] as well as the legal foster older brother of their [Fumio's and Keiko's] daughter, the short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and rather buxom for her age, openly headstrong and brutally honest but actually quite shy and reserved with an immense crush on Shiki half-Han Chinese martial arts student Arima Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. Shiki doesn't tell his [Shiki's] family [Akiha, Ako and Riko] nor the Arimas [Fumio, Keiko and Miyako] what really happened to him [Shiki] in California and Akiha doesn't tell her [Akiha's] new parents, Kiritsugu and his [Kiritsugu's] wife and current head of the now-decimated, immensely wealthy and influential German noble house said to be the real royal family of the UK both in the magical and non-magical worlds and holding tremendous political and economic influence throught the globe, the House of Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night], the silver-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, cold and aloof but also overly carefree and ditzy Irisivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night] nor their [Kiritsugu's and Irisivel's] biological daughters and thus the princesses of the House of Einzbern, the silver-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, somewhat mentally unstable and cold-blooded but cheerful and outgoing, upbeat, friendly, playful and mischevious Illyasivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] and her [Illyasivel's] younger twin sister, the white-rose hued-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, openly calm, nonchalant, devious, manipulative and very observant, brazen and unrestrained and also very lecherous and perverted but also secretly caring, sweet, timid and vunerable Chloe von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] in part due to her [Akiha] being [Akiha] kidnapped by the now-centuries old head of the Matou clan of magi, the aged and decrypt Matou Zouken [Fate/Stay Night] and [Akiha] made into the Matou clan heiress [Akiha] via a blood adoption potion and [Akiha] having the [Matou] clan's Crest Worms [Fate/Stay Night] implanted within her [Akiha] just after Makihisa's death and sometime before Shiki returned from California, [Akiha's kidnapping and subsequent forced inheritance of the Matou bloodline by Zouken] traumatising her [Akiha] even though Kiritsugu was [Kiritsugu] able to track her [Kiritsugu] down and [Kiritsugu] save her [Akiha] before [Kiritsugu] killing the worm man [Zouken] afterwards just before Shiki returned from California. As a result, she [Akiha] started wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha's] older twin sister and thus another of Shiki's younger adoptive sisters, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name Tōsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen's] and Akiha's shared biological mother who [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] was a member of the immensely wealthy and influential both in the magical and non-magical worlds, Tōsaka clan [Fate/Stay Night] when she [Karen/Rin] returns from the premier magical institution in the world, the London-based Clocktower [Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin's/Rin's] family [the Tōnos]. Shiki returns to the Tōno mansion when he [Shiki] is 16, to the unhappiness of Miyako who [Miyako] has no idea about the truth surrounding their [the Arima's] wide family [the Tōnos] and [Miyako] begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako's] family's [the Arimas'] dojo on some of Tokyo's native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako's] family's [the Arima's] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako's vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and Shiki at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha's help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. [Shiki] of course being unaware that Judgement Day has [Judgement Day] been averted, [Shiki] continues to [Shiki] keep in secret contact with his [Shiki's] real mother [Sarah] and members of the Resistance [Terminator] against Skynet who have time traveled to the current present in the hopes of stopping Judgement Day. He [Shiki] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters] transform into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya's and Chloe's] mentors, although he [Shiki] chooses to [Shiki] keep this to himself [Shiki]. Umbrella Corporation [Resident Evil] replaces Smart Brain [Kamen Rider 555], Chronus Corporation [Guyver] and CELL [Crysis], [Umbrella Corporation] developing the Nanosuit 1.0 and 2.0 as combat-ready versions of the Rider Gears [Kamen Rider 555] with both the Rider Gears and Nanosuits having the capabilities and built-in weapons of the Guyver bio-boosted armor [Guyver] in addition to their [the Rider Gears' and the Nanosuits' both 1.0 and 2.0's] canon capabilities. The soul-eating undead ghosts known as Hollows [Bleach] and the undead evolutions of humanity known as Orphenoch [Kamen Rider 555] are the same thing in this story, [the Hollows] also replacing the mutated humans known as Zoanoids [Guyver].

When Shiki decides to try and help his [Shiki's] mysterious savior [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] the mystery armoured hero [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] suddenly looks up and [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] quickly vanishes, just as his Shiki's legal younger sister [Miyako] and his other younger sisters [Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] along with Luvia and Miyu, come running up to him [Shiki]. Miyu's sharp eyes and nose sense the unmistakable mana and energy presence of Hollows and [Miyu] shakes her [Miyu's] head, [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to tell him [Shiki] everything [about what Umbrella really is and why the Future War], [Miyu] not realizing that he [Shiki] was [Shiki] once her [Miyu's] past self's [Future War timeline's Skynet's] greatest enemy [future John during the Future War] in her [Miyu's] original world and [Miyu's] original timeline as Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya start [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] clinging tightly to him [Shiki], [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to share him [Shiki] as his [Shiki's] wife with them [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] as Ichika, having [Ichika] long deactivated his [Ichika's] armor [the Faiz Gear] and [Ichika] been in his [Ichika's] human form for a while, [Ichika] observes everything from the safety of a tree, [Ichika] shaking his head at Shiki's inevitable polygamous future with multiple children from each wife [of Shiki in the future] before [Ichika] disappearing. N.B: The fight between Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode and the Hollows should be like a combination of the fights between Sean Barker in the Guyver suit and the Zoanoids [Guyver] in the Guyver: Dark Hero movie, hardcore 1990s-mid 2000s late tokukatsu like Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue, Kamen Rider Kuuga - Kamen Rider Blade, Garo and Kamen Rider: the First and Next, and the more realistic end of Chinese wuxia cultivator fiction, [the fight] focusing on martial arts moves and swordplay techniques as well as practicality as Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode decimates the Hollows.

Flanked by tents and archaeological equipment, the site was a curious blend of modern technology provided by the deep pockets of the Umbrella Corporation and the ancient cultures unearthed by Kanemitsu Zaibatsu's scholarly endeavors—a fusion of digital and dust. As Shiki replayed the day's findings in his mind, an eerie chill sliced through the serenity, compelling him to curl his fingers into tight fists. Was it just the mountain air… or something more? \\"Miyako, head inside,\\" Shiki urged calmly, herding his adoptive younger sister to the safety of her tent. \\"It's getting cold. I'll follow soon.\\" Miyako Arima frowned with unsatisfied curiosity. \\"Nii-san, you've been tense all evening. What's going on?\\" Shiki's gaze didn't falter. \\"Probably just working too hard. Don't worry.\\" But as she nodded and reluctantly turned away, the truth twisted within him—Shiki's life had never been free of threats. Disconcerting as it was, the idea of what lurked in the shadows being connected to his true lineage and the otherworldly history of both his families—the Connors and the Tohnos—made his hidden Chokushi no Magan pulse beneath the glasses that suppressed them. From the distance, muffled voices signaled the approach of his other sisters: Karen (Rin), Akiha, Chloe, Illya, and their guardians, Kiritsugu and Irisivel, alongside Fumio and Keiko. Luviagelita and Miyu were with them, engrossed in a hushed debate about magical theory. Shiki's attention snapped back to the shadows. A sinister presence slithered forward, and Hollows—undead harbingers of destruction linked to the sinister Umbrella Corporation—materialized from the darkness. Shiki's hand twitched toward the knife concealed under his jacket. Before his mind could command his limbs, a spectral figure erupted from the treeline, his suit a living enigma, armored and woven from future wars and past sins. It was Ichika Orimura as the hitherto unknown vigilante, bearing the Faiz Gear—a crystal fusion of Guyver and Nanosuit, merged with the Rider's edge. Ichika, the silhouette of futuristic technology, became a blur as he slashed and danced through the Hollows. Each movement was an artful execution, a blend of rigid martial precision married to the unhinged ferocity of the prowling Zoanoids—they were all at his mercy. Shiki watched, heart pounding a rhythm of war drums in his chest. He was no stranger to violence, no stranger to the unnatural forces of the universe—but this? This orchestrated madness shimmered with a brutal beauty Shiki had only glimpsed in his deadliest moments. The Hollows counterattacked, their Bala blasts and Cero beams a cascade of demise, but Ichika, like an avatar of Ares, shrugged off the assault with his Maximum Armor and soldiered through, his final strokes a poetic end to the creatures' malevolent existence. The last decapitated Hollow collapsed as Ichika fell to his knees, energy spent, power waning. His struggle was a silent cry for aid, a hero on the border of collapse. Yet just as Shiki strode forward to assist, Ichika's eyes met his—a flash of recognition—and vanished into the vanished into the night. Where had he seen that look before? \\"Miyu,\\" a voice filled with authority and unease. It was Luviagelita, her gaze piercing into Miyu's. \\"This isn't the quaint mountainscape we bargained for. What do you know?\\" Miyu, a bastion of enigma herself, sighed. Her past and the Future War she knew... there was a tale buried beneath the facade of Miyu Edelfelt that only she could unravel. Shiki, the fortress of his heart unknowingly tested, turned to his family—his sisters, his guardians, everyone who had become a pillar in his life. They clung to him, a shared symbol of solace and fear intermingled. Was this the legacy that awaited John Connor, the leader, the warrior foreseen by Oracles of Machine and Man? A series of battles, not for the scorched earth of his mother's stories or the salvation of humankind, but for a peace stitched together by disparate threads of destiny—demon hunters, mages, magical girls, and vigilant warriors? A foreign laugh echoed from high above them, a tree's silhouette cradling a remnant of the night's enigma—Ichika without his armor. Overlooking the scene, he mused over Shiki's ubiquitous knot, a future woven by strength and love, bound by vows to hearts numerous and fierce. This tale was not the grim soliloquy of Skynet's nemesis but a vibrant tapestry, a story of unity against the nocturne of the eternal night. And as the mountains reclaimed their stillness, a new chapter awaited, penned by the hands of those who dared to defy the shadows. In this world—singular, continuous, unforgiving—survival was an unveiling of the soul's every intricate facet, every hidden power. The dawn of tomorrow rested on the shoulders of intertwined legacies, prophets of steel and spirit alike."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: Show the fight between the mysterious man [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] and the Hollows in detail, showing how Ichika used his [Ichika's] knowledge of karate and its [karate's] now-often forgotten grappling techniques, jujutsu, judo, kendo, kenjutsu and ninjutsu to decimate the Hollows while [Ichika] in the Faiz Gear as well as Shiki's reactions, thoughts and direct dialogue as he [Shiki] watched this mysterious saviors [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] take on the monsters [the Hollows] as Miyako, well hidden, [Miyako] watches from the shadows.","output":"**Chapter 12: Shadows of Futures Past** The cold mountain air was filled with the quiet whispers of the night and the rustling of leaves in the gentle wind. The campsite lay tranquil, bathed in the soft glow of the moon, a deceptive peace resting upon the unsuspecting members of the expedition—until the darkness stirred. From the shadows emerged grotesque forms that moved with an unnatural rhythm, the Hollows, creatures of insatiable hunger. As they converged on the camp, their malevolent intent sent ice-cold tendrils of dread through the air. Shiki Tohno, eyes flicking to the nearest silhouette, grasped the knife beneath his jacket, yet his movements stilled as a lone figure stepped between them and the camp. --- Clad in the Faiz Gear, Ichika Orimura’s presence commanded the night. A soft hum punctuated the calm as his armor's systems ignited, casting a red glow that tore through the shadows. Ichika took a combat stance rooted in karate, poised like a statue sketched by a martial master—his body radiating a serene focus. As the first Hollow lunged forward, he expertly countered with an Osoto Gari, a classic judo maneuver that sent the creature sprawling. Shiki watched, muscles tensing as if preparing to join the dance of death that unfolded before him. Next to Ichika's fluid movements, Shiki's grip on the knife felt primitive, almost childlike. This mysterious figure displayed a symphony of martial arts with each measured breath and strike. The Hollows regrouped, circling Ichika with phantom steps. Yet the man in the futuristic suit seemed to be everywhere, his image fracturing into a dozen echoes as he moved. With fluid transitions from jujutsu holds to the sharp, snapping kicks of karate—a tapestry of disciplined technique woven with unwavering determinism—Ichika dismantled their numbers. Ninjutsu shadowed his motions, each subtle pivot carrying him out of danger, his hand-to-hand techniques a blur. He dodged a swipe meant to cleave the night and countered with a Shuto Uchi to a vital spot, disrupting the Hollow’s form. As the Hollows converged, Ichika’s sword—the Faiz Edge—came to life, trailing a crimson blaze. Kenjutsu principles guided his arms as he parried and struck with a precision that belied the chaotic battleground. The plasma edge sliced the darkness as surely as it did his enemies, felling one Hollow after another with decapitating grace. Hidden in the gloom, Miyako Arima clutched her makeshift weapon, eyes wide. Her heart was a hammer against her chest, fear and admiration warring within her as she watched the armored warrior cut a swath through their attackers. Shiki's voice broke through the whirling clash of armor and spirit. \\"Who is he? How can one man stand against such horror?\\" His words, though spoken to himself, carried the weight of his struggle to comprehend the scene before him. \\"The strength of the human spirit,\\" murmured Miyako from her concealed vantage point, a murmur lost to the night. \\"And perhaps, the strength of something more.\\" The reason for the Hollows' assault remained veiled in a mystery as thick as the night, but the bravery of the lone warrior was clear. As Ichika shifted his stance, reinforcing his Maximum Armor to absorb the barrage of energy attacks, his determination never wavered. The battle crescendoed, Ichika invoking every aspect of his martial heritage. Moving like a tempest, he applied judo’s Kuzushi to unbalance, kyusho strikes from ninjutsu to incapacitate, and the devastating force of karate's Seiken tsuki to obliterate. Finally, silence reigned. The Hollows lay vanquished, and Ichika paused, his breaths echoing in the aftermath, the armor's glow fading with the settling dust. In the wake of such a display, what remained for Shiki other than silent awe? Ichika collapsed to his knees, and Shiki took a step forward, his hand extended in a silent offer of aid. Yet before their paths could meet, the mysterious man vanished, leaving behind only questions and the lingering echo of otherworldly strength. Shiki turned back to the camp, back to the faces of his family—their fears, their hopes, their destinies entwined with his own. Little did they know the profound impact the night’s events would have, rippling through the fabric of their intertwined timelines, changing the course of their future yet unwritten."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): что осуждает автор в рассказе \\"О любви\\" А.П.Чехов","output":"В рассказе \\"О любви\\" Антон Павлович Чехов рассуждает о сложности и многогранности человеческих чувств, о любви, которая проявляется в разных формах и может принести как счастье, так и страдание.

The room looks like a cross between a wild west saloon and a technicolor discotheque. At the center, an absurdly out-of-place STRIPPER POLE gleams under a spotlight. Across from Yusuke, lounging languidly in an oversized bean bag chair, is BILLY BLUSH, the Dream Demon. Despite his ethereal origins, his attire screams \\"rodeo\\" with a twist -- a shimmering pink cowboy hat perched atop his golden locks, pink gloves on his hands, and a pink G-string partnered with two holstered silver revolvers boasting black grips. Despite his aggressive flirtation with the color spectrum, he manages a roguish charm. BILLY BLUSH (partnering with a blanket) Well, put'er there, partner!

Now, make yourself at home while I conjure up some spectral spirits! He saunters over to a mini-fridge, swaying his hips exaggeratedly, and pulls out a bottle of sparkling pink lemonade. As he pours two glasses, he spins around the stripper pole, executing a cheeky wink. YUSUKE (covering his eyes, flustered) Whoa, whoa! Is that strictly necessary? BILLY BLUSH (dramatic gasp) Necessary? 'Course not. But it adds a little pizzazz, dontcha think? Gotta keep things lively around these parts! He prances back to Yusuke, handing him a glass of lemonade. BILLY BLUSH (toasting) To the wildest ride in the wildest dreams! YUSUKE (awkward toast, clinking glasses) Yeah, \\"wild\\" is one word for it... Suddenly, the sound of cheesy western music starts to play and Billy starts to line dance around the mancave, embellishing every step with a hip-thrust or finger-gun shot at unsuspecting inanimate objects. BILLY BLUSH (calling out) Come on, Yusuke! Shake off those blues and scoot your boots! Yusuke, ever the polite guest, hesitantly gets up and mimics, albeit poorly, Billy's dance moves, bumping into furniture and nearly knocking over a lamp shaped like a cactus. BILLY BLUSH (laughing) You dance like a coyote on a hot tin roof! But don't ya worry, I'll make a dream cowboy outta ya yet!

No hay evidencia científica que sugiera que el color de los ojos humanos cambiaría al estar en Marte. La percepción del color puede verse afectada por la iluminación y el ambiente, pero el pigmento en sí del iris humano no cambia. Los ojos azules son el resultado de la dispersión de la luz en el estroma del iris, un fenómeno similar al que hace que el cielo se vea azul. Dado que la iluminación en Marte es diferente debido a su atmósfera tenue y a la distancia al Sol, es posible que la percepción de todos los colores, incluido el azul, pueda verse ligeramente alterada en comparación con la Tierra. No obstante, esto no significa que los ojos azules \\"no puedan ser azules\\" en Marte. Serán azules, pero la tonalidad percibida podría tener ligeras diferencias debido a la calidad y cantidad de la luz solar. Los ángulos y la calidad de la iluminación, así como el contexto y el contraste con otros colores, pueden hacer que la misma tonalidad parezca diferente para el observador. Sin embargo, eso no significa que la biología del ojo cambie o que el color fundamental del iris se transforme al viajar a otro planeta. En resumen, la afirmación no es del todo verdadera.

It has to be a full replacement for the SDL_renderer object.","output":"Creating a full replacement for the \`SDL_Renderer\` is quite a task, as the SDL_Renderer is an abstraction over various rendering backends including Direct3D, OpenGL, and software renderers. Creating a drop-in replacement means you'd have to implement rendering for all these backends or at least provide a similar level of abstraction. Let's start with the basics by wrapping \`SDL_Renderer\` in a custom \`Renderer\` class which we'll then expand upon. Assuming you have a basic understanding of C++ classes and SDL structures, here is how you can begin: First include the necessary headers for SDL: \`\`\`cpp #include <SDL.h> #include <memory> #include <iostream> // You can define your namespace to keep things organized namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Window* window; SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; public: Renderer(SDL_Window* window, int index = -1, Uint32 flags = SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED) : window(window) { sdlRenderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, index, flags); if (!sdlRenderer) { std::cerr << \\"SDL_CreateRenderer Error: \\" << SDL_GetError() << std::endl; // Handle error - either throw an exception or return an error code } } ~Renderer() { if (sdlRenderer) SDL_DestroyRenderer(sdlRenderer); } // Disable copy constructor and copy assignment Renderer(const Renderer&) = delete; Renderer& operator=(const Renderer&) = delete; // Wrapper methods for SDL_Renderer functionality // For example, a Clear function void Clear() { SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); } // Presentation of renderer contents void Present() { SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } // Set draw color method void SetDrawColor(Uint8 r, Uint8 g, Uint8 b, Uint8 a) { SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(sdlRenderer, r, g, b, a); } // And many other rendering functions would go here... }; } \`\`\` This is a simplistic wrapper and does not provide additional functionality over \`SDL_Renderer\` yet. To turn this into a full replacement, you would need to: 1. Implement all the current features provided by \`SDL_Renderer\`, including blending modes, textures, viewports, etc. 2. Design a similar or improved rendering API that can work with your engine's architecture and features. 3. Replace the direct usage of \`SDL_Renderer\` with your Renderer class throughout your engine. If you decide to provide an SDL-like API, users of your engine wouldn't have to learn new concepts, and it could ease the transition for your users. However, if you are not dependent on SDL's limitations, you could design a better and more modern API that fits with modern rendering techniques like batching, shaders, and more advanced graphics techniques. Lastly, if your intentions are to really replace \`SDL_Renderer\` with a completely self-made rendering backend, you need to be familiar with low-level graphics API programming with libraries like DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, or Metal. This involves a substantial amount of work and understanding of graphics programming. Remember to start small and iteratively build out the complexity of your renderer as your engine develops. It's often a good idea to first ensure it meets the needs of your own game engine and then refactor and expand it to be more general purpose. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"Why did you Disable copy constructor and copy assignment, making it a singleton class? Also there is a Render method for a window like this: void Render() { SDL.SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 255, 255, 255, 255); SDL.SDL_RenderClear(renderer); SDL.SDL_RenderPresent(renderer); } Does this method has to be in the Window class or the Renderer class? Is this similar to Draw() method in XNA/Monogame?","output":"Disabling the copy constructor and copy assignment in the \`Renderer\` class does not make it a singleton. Singleton classes are designed such that only one instance can exist at a time. Disabling copy semantics by deleting the copy constructor and copy assignment operator is a common practice for managing resources that should not be copied inadvertently. It ensures that you have only one owner of the underlying resource (in this case, \`SDL_Renderer\`) to prevent possible resource management errors, such as double-deletions. The \`Render()\` method looks like it clears the screen, sets the background color to white, and then presents the renderer's contents to the window. Having such a method in the \`Renderer\` class makes more sense since it directly manipulates the rendering context. However, the concept of separation of concerns would suggest that a \`Window\` class focuses on window management, and \`Renderer\` class focuses on drawing/rendering operations. The method is somewhat similar to the \`Draw()\` method in XNA/MonoGame, in that it is the place where all drawing commands are flushed to the screen. However, typically, a \`Draw()\` method in XNA/MonoGame would involve drawing all the game's entities, not just clearing the screen and presenting the render. Here is how you might add and use a \`Render()\` method in the \`Renderer\` class: \`\`\`cpp namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; public: Renderer(/* parameters */) { // Constructor logic... } ~Renderer() { // Destructor logic... } // Other methods... void Render() { // Usually, you would also handle any needed logic to prepare for rendering // such as handling render targets, or setting up any needed state. SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(sdlRenderer, 255, 255, 255, 255); // Set the color used for drawing operations (Rect, Line and Clear) SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); // Clear the current rendering target with the drawing color // Here, you would render your game's entities, textures, etc. SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); // Update the screen with any rendering performed since the previous call } }; } \`\`\` Your main game loop using this class might look something like this: \`\`\`cpp YourNamespace::Renderer renderer(window); // Assuming 'window' has been created elsewhere bool running = true; while (running) { // Handle events... renderer.Render(); // Render new frame SDL_Delay(16); // Delay to cap the frame rate, this would result in around 60 FPS } \`\`\` By organizing your code this way, you can adhere to object-oriented principles, and manage different responsibilities cleanly within your game engine's architecture."},{"instruction":"I am dubious on calling it Render in a Renderer class, isn't that a bit redundant? Also would it make more sense calling it Update similar to Update method in XNA/Monogame or it is not related to it?","output":"You bring up a good point regarding naming, and it's important to choose method names that clearly convey their purpose and avoid any potential confusion. In XNA/Monogame, there are typically two main methods in the game loop: \`Update()\` and \`Draw()\`. \`Update()\` is where you would update the game's logic—moving characters, processing inputs, calculating physics, etc. \`Draw()\` is where you would render everything to the screen. This separation is part of the commonly used game loop pattern. Calling a method \`Render()\` within a \`Renderer\` class may seem redundant, but it is actually quite self-explanatory: it's the action that the renderer performs. If you feel that \`Render()\` doesn't quite convey what you want, or if it seems too redundant, there are other alternatives you could consider: - \`Draw()\`: Aligns with XNA/Monogame terminology and indicates that this method is responsible for drawing/rendering the scene. - \`Present()\`: Suggests that this method is responsible for presenting the drawn scene onto the screen. - \`Flush()\`: In graphics programming, \\"flushing\\" often refers to sending all queued drawing commands to be executed. On the other hand, calling it \`Update()\` might not be appropriate for a rendering class because it implies non-rendering related functionality (like updating game logic, etc.). It's important that the method names reflect their actions clearly to avoid ambiguity and misunderstandings. Here's how your renderer class might look with a \`Draw()\` method: \`\`\`cpp namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; public: Renderer(/* parameters */) { // Constructor logic... } ~Renderer() { // Destructor logic... } // Other methods... void Draw() { // Set the drawing color (background color in this case) SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(sdlRenderer, 255, 255, 255, 255); // Clear the rendering target SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); // Here, you would render your various game entities, etc. // Finally, present the rendered frame SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } // Explicitly stating the method used to present the content // could still make sense even if \\"Draw\\" encapsulates it. void Present() { SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } }; } \`\`\` And a simplified main game loop might look like this: \`\`\`cpp YourNamespace::Renderer renderer(window); // Create the Renderer instance bool running = true; while (running) { // Handle events... // If you've split Update() logic from drawing logic, you would call it here: // game.Update(); renderer.Draw(); // Draw the frame (presumably after game logic has been updated) SDL_Delay(16); // Cap the frame rate } \`\`\` It's about finding a balance that suits your engine's architecture and makes it clear for others (or future you) to understand what each part of your engine is doing. Choosing names that are consistent with the actions they perform is key."},{"instruction":"Oki you bring valid points, I will keep it as Render, but I will probably mix it with Draw methods inside other classes like SpriteSheet or Image classes, so if that doesn't mind then I will go with it. Another question I have is, should Clear, Present, be private or keeping it public is ok? Don't know if besides Render method what other uses of them outside it","output":"The decision to make \`Clear\`, \`Present\`, and similar methods public or private depends largely on the design of your engine and how much control you wish to expose to the users of your \`Renderer\` class. Here's a breakdown of the considerations for each approach: # Public Methods Making these methods public can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to give the user of your Renderer class fine-grained control over the rendering process. For example: - Advanced users may want to perform multiple clears within a single frame or render to multiple targets in complex ways. - They might want to clear the screen with different colors multiple times in a frame for specific visual effects. - They might want to \`Present\` at specific times, not necessarily at the end of every \`Render\` call, like when implementing multiple passes rendering or rendering to texture effects. If you do decide to keep them public, users have more flexibility but must also manage the correct sequence and state of rendering operations themselves. # Private Methods Making these methods private restricts control, enforcing an intended sequence of rendering operations which can simplify the API and prevent misuse: - By keeping control over when and how clearing and presenting is done, you can ensure that these occur at consistent points in the rendering pipeline. - It reduces the mental load on the user of your Renderer class. They don't have to remember to clear before drawing or present after drawing because the Render function takes care of this sequence. - It helps to maintain a certain level of abstraction and encapsulation, hiding the internal workings of how the Renderer processes its drawing sequence. If you're leaning towards keeping a similar structure as the one in the \`Render\` method you've decided to go with, you might find private methods to be most suitable: \`\`\`cpp namespace YourNamespace { class Renderer { private: SDL_Renderer* sdlRenderer; void Clear() { SDL_RenderClear(sdlRenderer); } void Present() { SDL_RenderPresent(sdlRenderer); } // ...and other private helper methods public: Renderer(/* parameters */) { // Constructor logic... } ~Renderer() { // Destructor logic... } void Render() { // Clear the screen (now a private method) Clear(); // ...Content rendering happens here via other public methods like DrawSprite(), DrawText(), etc... // Present the rendered frame (also a private method) Present(); } }; } \`\`\` In this design, advanced rendering that requires control over the clear and present operations would have to be accommodated via additional methods or by altering the behavior via flags or states within the Renderer class itself. Encapsulation is generally a good strategy in object-oriented design, especially in cases where you want to maintain internal consistency and avoid potential misuse by users of your class. But it does need to be balanced with flexibility; if you make these methods private without providing users the flexibility they need for advanced use cases, they may find your engine too restrictive. Ultimately, the choice should be driven by the expected use cases and the level of complexity you wish to expose. If you keep certain operations public, make sure the responsibilities and expected behaviors are well-documented."},{"instruction":"OK I have the methods done, I want it to be similar to SpriteBatch class, what else do I need to implement? Should I make it similar or just avoid that since it is another library and doesn't has anything to do with XNA?","output":"The \`SpriteBatch\` class in XNA/MonoGame is a powerful and convenient tool for drawing textured quads (sprites) in batch, which is more efficient than issuing individual draw calls for each sprite. If you find the concept of a sprite batch useful for your engine, you can draw inspiration from it. Here are some functionalities that a sprite batch usually provides which you can consider implementing in your game engine's renderer: # 1. Begin and End Methods These methods signal the start and end of a batch of sprite drawing operations. \`Begin\` will typically set up the necessary states, while \`End\` will actually flush the batched sprites to the screen. # 2. Sorting Modes SpriteBatch can sort sprites by texture, back-to-front, front-to-back, or in the order they were drawn. The sorting affects drawing order and can improve performance by reducing state changes. # 3. Texture Handling Loading and managing textures that can be reused across different draw calls within the same \`SpriteBatch\`. # 4. Transformation Matrices Applying transformations (translation, rotation, scale, etc.) to the batch of sprites being drawn. This allows for camera implementation, world transformations, and more. # 5. Blend States Allowing customization of how the sprites will be blended with the background. # 6. Draw Overloads Providing multiple ways to draw a sprite, such as specifying destination rectangles, source rectangles (for sprite sheets), colors for tinting, and various origin and rotation parameters. # 7. Layer Depth Specifying a depth for 2D rendering to control the order of drawing. Implementing all these might be complex, so here's a simple structure that captures some of these concepts to get you started: \`\`\`cpp namespace YourNamespace { class SpriteBatch { private: Renderer &renderer; // Reference to your Renderer std::vector<Sprite> sprites; // A vector to hold sprites until they are drawn // Internal methods for setting up state and drawing batched sprites public: SpriteBatch(Renderer &renderer) : renderer(renderer) {} void Begin(/* additional parameters for transform, sorting mode, etc. */) { // Set up necessary rendering state } void Draw(Texture &texture, const Rectangle &destination, const Rectangle *source = nullptr, const Color &color = Color::White, float rotation = 0.0f, const Vector2 &origin = Vector2::Zero, /* other parameters */) { // Create a sprite object from parameters and add to sprites vector } void End() { // Sort the sprites vector according to the chosen sorting mode // Flush the batch: iterate over sorted sprites vector and issue draw calls using renderer // Reset state if necessary } }; // A hypothetical Sprite struct to encapsulate individual draw parameters struct Sprite { Texture &texture; Rectangle destination; Rectangle source; Color color; float rotation; Vector2 origin; // More properties as needed }; // Plus auxiliary classes like Texture, Rectangle, Color, and Vector2 } \`\`\` When implementing something like a SpriteBatch, you can start simple by only providing the most essential features, and extend it over time as your engine matures or as your project requirements grow. This also allows you to consider aspects unique to your engine, like custom memory management, which might not be directly aligned with how XNA/MonoGame handles things. Lastly, do consider the licensing and intellectual property aspects if you borrow ideas directly from other libraries; even if you're implementing things from scratch, you should ensure that you follow all relevant legal requirements. If you do choose to implement your own sprite batching, remember to optimize performance by minimizing texture switches, draw calls, and state changes, as these are overheads that sprite batching aims to reduce."},{"instruction":"OK going back to the Renderer and the Window class, I was implementing the HandleEvents class which I named Update, to implement the logic of the events, and there are two window events that are related to the Renderer so I ended up doing these two Update method, are these correct in the way they were done? void Renderer::Update(const SDL_Event& e) { if(e.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT && e.window.windowID == SDL_GetWindowID(SDL_RenderGetWindow(renderer))) { switch(e.window.event) { case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED: case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED: Present(); break; } } } void Window::Update(const SDL_Event& e) { if(e.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT && e.window.windowID == GetWindowID()) { switch(e.window.event) { case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SHOWN: visible = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_HIDDEN: visible = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED: width = e.window.data1; height = e.window.data2; ChangeSize(width, height); break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_ENTER: mouseFocus = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_LEAVE: mouseFocus = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_FOCUS_GAINED: keyboardFocus = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_FOCUS_LOST: keyboardFocus = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MINIMIZED: minimized = true; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MAXIMIZED: minimized = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESTORED: minimized = false; break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE: SetVisible(false); break; } } }","output":"Your handling of window events in both the \`Renderer\` and \`Window\` class seems reasonable. Here's a review: # Renderer In the \`Renderer\`'s \`Update\` method, you're checking for window events specifically tied to the renderer's associated window. If the window is resized (\`SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED\`) or needs to be redrawn (\`SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED\`), you're calling the \`Present()\` method. This implies that \`Present()\` is not only presenting the contents to the screen but also presumably handling re-rendering or upscaling/downscaling the content to match the new window size. Typically, \`Present()\` just presents the content, so if necessary, you may want to refactor your code to ensure that resizing of render targets (if you're using any) and any additional steps needed to handle a resize are performed here. Often, needing to re-render after a resize is handled by simply marking a flag and then in your main render loop, checking that flag and performing an actual render call if needed. \`\`\`cpp void Renderer::Update(const SDL_Event& e) { if(e.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT && e.window.windowID == SDL_GetWindowID(SDL_RenderGetWindow(renderer))) { switch(e.window.event) { case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED: // Handle resizing logic here, potentially including scale adjustments, // render target texture resizing, etc. break; case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED: // You might want to force a render if the window has been exposed. // Note: In many applications, this is unnecessary as the main loop // would be rendering continuously anyway. break; } } } \`\`\` # Window Your \`Window\`'s \`Update\` method is keeping track of the window state. When the window's visibility or focus status changes, you adjust the relevant attributes (\`visible\`, \`mouseFocus\`, \`keyboardFocus\`, \`minimized\`) accordingly. Handling the \`SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED\` event, you store the new width and height and call the \`ChangeSize\` method to presumably adjust your window's internals to the new size. This is correct, but make sure that if you have any scalable content or layout, it is recalibrated based on these new dimensions. \`\`\`cpp void Window::ChangeSize(int newWidth, int newHeight) { // Here you would handle what needs to change when // the window size changes, for example, updating viewport sizes, // recalculating layout/scalable elements, notifying observers, etc. } \`\`\` # General Advice - Make sure the event handling code is integrated into your main loop in such a way that it gets called each frame or when events are detected. - Ensure that the state changes prompted by these events are handled in the appropriate parts of your code and that they trigger any necessary updates or redraws. - Sometimes event handling code can become complex and convoluted as new features are added. You might consider separating event handling into different methods or classes to handle specific event types, especially if you find yourself dealing with many different event cases. Overall, your event handling logic seems correct on the surface, but it will depend on how the rest of your game loop and engine are designed. Keep in mind principles of separation of concerns and clarity to maintain clean and understandable code."},{"instruction":"Thanks for the clean and useful feedback, I want to start with the minimum and iteratively add new features, so far I don't have any render targets, nor I know what are those, but I will keep this in mind when dealing with the viewports, layours, scaling textures, etc. I also thought the texture scaled with the size of the window, but I guess I will have to keep that in mind when I make the SpriteSheet and Animation classes","output":"You're welcome, and taking an iterative approach is a wise decision. This allows you to build a strong foundation for your engine and add complexity only when necessary. Here's a brief explanation of render targets and a few considerations regarding scaling: # Render Targets Render targets are textures that you can draw onto instead of drawing directly to the screen. After rendering to the render target, you can then draw the render target to the screen as a texture. This is useful for a variety of effects, such as: - Rendering scenes at a different resolution and then scaling them up/down to fit the window (useful for pixel art games or resolution-independent rendering). - Post-processing effects (bloom, blur, etc.). - Render-to-texture, which allows you to create dynamic textures based on your rendering (useful for mirrors, security cameras, or \\"rendering\\" text to a texture for UI). In SDL, you would typically create a render target using \`SDL_CreateTexture\` with the \`SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET\` flag and then set it as the render target with \`SDL_SetRenderTarget\`. # Window Scaling and Textures Textures don't inherently scale with the window; you need to manage this yourself. The way a texture gets rendered to fit into the window depends on your draw call and the renderer's logical size or viewport configuration. Consider the following: - **Logical Scaling**: You can define a logical size for rendering using \`SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize\` which SDL automatically scales to fit the window, maintaining aspect ratio. - **Viewport Transforms**: You can also choose to use viewports (\`SDL_RenderSetViewport\`) to define where and how content will be scaled/drawn within the window. # SpriteSheet and Animation Classes When you implement \`SpriteSheet\` and \`Animation\` classes, manual texture scaling will likely be part of the equation. Spritesheets often hold multiple animation frames or various different graphics; you'll use source rectangles to select specific portions of the texture. For animations, you'll likely progress through these frames over time and, depending on the resolution of your game and the window size, you may need to scale the resulting draw call to fit the desired on-screen size. Examples of Scaling Considerations: - Fixed Resolution: Render everything to a fixed resolution and upscale/downscale to fit the window. - Resolution-Independent: Scale all draw calls based on the window size or a dynamic camera zoom level. - Pixel-Perfect: Especially important in pixel art games, where you want to ensure that each \\"pixel\\" in the texture maps to a specific number of screen pixels without distortion. By focusing on the fundamentals and progressively building your sprite rendering, animation, and scaling logic, you will develop a better understanding of the low-level rendering details, which will serve you well as you expand your engine's capabilities. And always remember, rigorous testing is key when implementing these features to ensure they behave as expected under different scenarios."},{"instruction":"Thanks I will keep that in mind! I have a new question, should I use SDL_Log like for example here: SDL_Log(\\"ERROR: Failed to switch mode: %sn\\", SDL_GetError()); if I don't want to expose the SDL library to the game itself? Should I just throw an exception here with that text instead?","output":"If you want to avoid exposing SDL to the game itself and keep the underlying implementation details hidden, using \`SDL_Log\` directly in the higher-level game code might not align well with this goal. Instead, you will want to abstract away the logging mechanism as well. Let's consider a couple of approaches: # Exceptions Throwing an exception is one way to signal an error without directly using SDL functions in the game code. Exceptions allow calling code to handle errors flexibly. This mechanism is ideal for handling situations that are truly exceptional and cannot be handled locally. \`\`\`cpp if (SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, r, g, b, a) != 0) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Failed to set the render draw color: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } \`\`\` In this case, the calling code would need to be prepared to catch and handle \`std::runtime_error\` (or a more specific custom exception type if you define one). # Custom Logging Function You could also provide a custom logging function that internally uses \`SDL_Log\`. That way, the game code uses your logging function, and you can easily swap out the logging mechanism later if needed. \`\`\`cpp namespace GameEngine { void LogError(const std::string& message) { SDL_Log(\\"ERROR: %sn\\", message.c_str()); // If you ever switch away from SDL, you would only have to change this implementation. } } \`\`\` Then the usage within your Renderer class might look something like this: \`\`\`cpp if (SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, r, g, b, a) != 0) { GameEngine::LogError(\\"Failed to set the render draw color: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } \`\`\` # Mix of Both There is an argument to be made for using both. You can throw an exception for unexpected errors that the game should know about and use logging for less critical issues that should be recorded but don't necessarily require the game to handle them directly. \`\`\`cpp // Potentially recoverable error or notable event - log it if (minor_error_condition) { GameEngine::LogError(\\"Minor error occurred: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } // Critical issue - throw an exception if (major_error_condition) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Critical error occurred: \\" + std::string(SDL_GetError())); } \`\`\` # Conclusion Exceptions are a common way to handle errors in C++ and can be preferred when you want the caller to have control over the recovery strategy. Meanwhile, logging is commonplace for recording information. Using \`SDL_Log\` within your internal implementation of a logging function allows you to hide the dependency on SDL and maintain a consistent logging interface for your game code. Finally, you may have noticed that converting \`SDL_GetError()\` to \`std::string\` is a recurring pattern. You might want to create a utility function to automatically get the SDL error message as a \`std::string\` to simplify your code: \`\`\`cpp std::string GetSDLError() { return std::string(SDL_GetError()); } \`\`\` This would simplify the call to: \`\`\`cpp GameEngine::LogError(\\"Recoverable error occurred: \\" + GetSDLError()); // Or for exceptions: throw std::runtime_error(\\"Unrecoverable error occurred: \\" + GetSDLError()); \`\`\` Whatever approach you choose, it's important to be consistent throughout your codebase."},{"instruction":"Should I make a Logger class even thought it is so early in development, should I just use write line in the terminal or just leave it a commentary for now?","output":"The decision to implement a Logger class early in development depends on the complexity of your project and how much you value logging during development. Here are a few points to consider for each approach: # Implement a Logger Class Early - **Proactive Approach**: By setting up a logging system early, you'll have a robust mechanism in place for diagnosing issues from the start. - **Consistency**: Having a consistent logging interface means that as your codebase grows, all logging will already be routed through a single point, which can then be easily redirected, formatted, or filtered. - **Error Tracking**: Even in early development stages, having logs can help track down when and where things go wrong, which can be especially useful if you encounter intermittent or hard-to-reproduce issues. - **Future Proofing**: Implementing the Logger class early on means if you decide to change the underlying logging implementation (e.g., to write to a file or to integrate a third-party service), you'll only need to update the Logger class and not every instance of logging throughout your code. # Simple WriteLine Logging or Comments - **Speed**: You can get started coding your engine's core features immediately without having to design a logging system. - **Simplicity**: Writing directly to the terminal or adding comments to indicate where logging might eventually occur keeps the initial code base simple and focused on functionality. - **Flexibility**: By not committing to a particular logging approach, you leave your options open to design the logging system later based on the specific needs that emerge. # Middle Ground A compromise might be to implement a simple, lightweight logging class or function that you can expand upon later. For example: \`\`\`cpp class Logger { public: static void Log(const std::string& message) { std::cout << message << std::endl; // Future implementation can add file logging, severity levels, etc. } // Additional methods for different log levels could be added later: // static void Warn(const std::string& message); // static void Error(const std::string& message); // etc. }; \`\`\` Starting with a simple \`Log\` method allows you to replace \`std::cout\` calls with \`Logger::Log\` throughout your codebase. Then, when your project is more mature, you can expand the \`Logger\` class to include features like log levels, file output, and formatting without having to change the rest of your code. # Summary It ultimately depends on your development style and the scale of your project. If your project is small and exploratory, using \`std::cout\` or temporary comments might be sufficient. However, if your project has the potential to grow significantly or you already know you'll need detailed logs, it would be wise to establish a simple logging mechanism early on. By laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive logging system now, you can incrementally build out its functionality as your game engine becomes more complex and the need for sophisticated logging increases."},{"instruction":"Ok I have everything set up now, but I have a question, I see these code snippets in the SDL sample project: if (SDL.SDL_Init(SDL.SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {...} and SDL_Quit(); Where should I place these things that are related to SDL and not directly to the Window or the Renderer? Should I create another class? If so, should it be a singleton to initialize or what?

Typically, you would handle these steps in a centralized location that manages the entire lifespan of your SDL application. This could be in the \`main\` function, a dedicated \`Application\` or \`Engine\` class, or a singleton/context object that encapsulates all SDL-related operations. # Using an Engine Class An \`Engine\` class is a good choice for encapsulating engine-level operations, which include the initialization of subsystems such as SDL, creating a window, setting up the renderer, and managing the game loop. Here's an example of what the Engine class might look like: \`\`\`cpp class Engine { public: Engine() { // Constructor if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"SDL could not initialize!

Singletons are often criticized for their global state, difficulty in testing, and potentially creating dependencies and coupling issues. If you do choose to implement your engine context as a singleton, here's how you might do it: \`\`\`cpp class Engine { public: static Engine& Instance() { static Engine instance; // Guaranteed to be destroyed and instantiated on first use return instance; } // Initializations in constructor / shutdown in destructor as before void Run() { // Main game loop } private: Engine() { // Constructor with SDL initialization } ~Engine() { // Destructor with SDL cleanup } // C++ 11 // Delete the methods we don't want to accidentally use Engine(Engine const&) = delete; // Copy constructor void operator=(Engine const&) = delete; // Assignment operator // Other private methods and state as needed }; \`\`\` And the \`main\` function would look like this: \`\`\`cpp int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { try { Engine::Instance().Run(); } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << \\"Unhandled Exception: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; return -1; } return 0; } \`\`\` # Conclusion Whether you opt for a singleton or a regular class instantiation depends on your specific design choices and requirements. However, it's generally recommended to use singletons sparingly and carefully consider their impacts on the codebase.

SDL_Quit(); } // The Engine class no longer needs methods to access the subsystems since they are singletons. // If global configurations or states are needed, methods to set or retrieve them would be added here. }; \`\`\` Since each subsystem manager is a singleton, they would each have a static method to access their instance: \`\`\`cpp class ScreenManager { public: static ScreenManager& Instance() { static ScreenManager instance; return instance; } // ScreenManager methods ... private: ScreenManager() { // Initialize ScreenManager specifics... } ~ScreenManager() { // Cleanup... } // Singleton protections... ScreenManager(ScreenManager const&) = delete; void operator=(ScreenManager const&) = delete; }; // AudioManager, InputManager, etc., would have a similar structure. \`\`\` And the \`main\` function can directly call into these singleton instances as needed: \`\`\`cpp int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { try { Engine engine; // Initialize SDL and any other global states // Now singletons can be accessed and used without explicitly passing around an Engine instance. auto& screenManager = ScreenManager::Instance(); auto& audioManager = AudioManager::Instance(); // Other subsystem instances... // Game loop or other initialization... } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << \\"Unhandled Exception: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; return -1; } return 0; } \`\`\` In this setup, each manager is responsible for its own setup and teardown, and this is hidden behind the singleton interface. When an application or game wants to interact with a subsystem, it simply requests the instance of the singleton. Keep in mind that while singletons provide convenient global access and ensure a single instance, they can have drawbacks like making testing more challenging, possibly creating hidden dependencies, and making it harder to control the initialization order (which can be problematic when one singleton depends on another). Singletons can work well for global-access objects where there is a clear case that only one instance should exist, but consider carefully whether their use aligns with your engine's architecture and future scalability needs."},{"instruction":"ciao","output":"Ciao!

HAUNTED CASTLE MANCAVE - NIGHT The dimly lit mancave exudes a strange mix of gothic grandeur and modern debauchery. Gothic arches and cobwebbed chandeliers loom over plush sofas, a bar stocked with eerie bottles of spirits, and a conspicuously out-of-place, glistening stripper pole. SKEWERED SOUL, a young man with a perpetually perplexed look, sits nervously on one of the sofas, a cold sweat beading on his brow. A thick cloud of tension dissipates as the room's owner saunters in. The DEMON COWBOY, an outrageous caricature of the seven deadly sins with a penchant for pink, clicks his silver spurs across the stone floor, adjusting his pink, studded belt and tipping his pink cowboy hat. DEMON COWBOY (grinning playfully) Well, howdy there, Skewed—can I call ya Skewed? I just love a bit of fun with names. Welcome to the wildest mancave in the underworld! SKEWERED SOUL (stammering) Uh, sure, I guess... call me whatever. This is all a bit... unexpected. In the corner, two GHOSTS spectate with expressions of eternal discomfort. NIGHTGOWN GHOST, an incorporeal matron stuck in her bedtime best, clutches her ethereal garment in disgust. FELDMARSHALL PHANTOM, a stern specter still donning his long-forgotten uniform, recoils with a grimace. NIGHTGOWN GHOST (whispering) Please, not the pole dancing again. It's more than my dead heart can take. FELDMARSHALL PHANTOM (sighing) I've seen horrors, but this frivolous fiend is beyond my comprehension. DEMON COWBOY (locking eyes with Skewered Soul) You see, Skew, I'm the embodiment of a sin, and I can guess what you're thinking—it's Lust, ain't it? Heh, can't blame ya for that guess. But nope, I'm Sloth through and through. Skewered Soul's eyes widen in shock as Demon Cowboy lazily twirls his finger, summoning an unseen force that rustles his pink G-string in a way that defies the laws of physics—or taste. SKEWERED SOUL (squirming) Sloth? You... don't seem very slothful. DEMON COWBOY (winking) Oh, partner, you've no idea. All this—gesturing at the suggestive attire—is because I can't be bothered to dress fully. And why stand when you can dance... slooowly? A western tune with an eerie undertone begins to play. The Demon Cowboy begins a languid, seductive dance around the stripper pole, shooting finger-guns at Skewered Soul and the ghosts. His silver revolvers glint in the low light, untouched in their holsters. NIGHTGOWN GHOST (to Feldmarshall Phantom) We're trapped in the spectral realm with this... this... FELDMARSHALL PHANTOM (finishing her sentence) ...Lascivious lollygagger? Ja, it is our endless curse. As Demon Cowboy's hips gyrate with a lethal laziness, nightmarish inflatable decorations start popping up around the room, nodding their heads to the rhythm. An inflatable pink flamingo wearing a cowboy hat joined by a skeletal horse with heart-shaped glasses bob along. DEMON COWBOY (flirty) I'm just a soul with too much time and too little to do. You'll learn to love the slothful life, Skewy. Time here moves like molasses on a chilly day. SKEWERED SOUL (gulping) I think I need to slow my roll right out of this room... Just as Skewered Soul tries to make his escape, he finds himself mysteriously sliding—very slowly—back to the sofa, his attempts to flee thwarted by Sloth, the sneaky sin. The ghosts exchange glances, their ectoplasmic forms shimmering with sympathy. DEMON COWBOY (drawing out his words) There’s no rush, little buddy. You’ve got all eternity to enjoy... the show. As the Demon Cowboy leaps onto the pole for another round of slothful seduction, the room fills with eerie applause from unseen hands, and Skewered Soul realizes he's stuck watching the unholy rodeo for a while longer, caught between laughter and horror."},{"instruction":"Известно, что комплементарные цепи нуклеиновых кислот антипараллельны (5' концу в одной цепи соответствует 3' конец другой цепи).

Аминокислота глутамин (глн) кодируется кодонами CAA и CAG. Найдем эти тринуклеотиды в представленных цепях ДНК.

Tesla vallási hite pontos természetére vonatkozóan nem sok konkrét információ maradt fenn, habár egyes életrajzi források említést tesznek arról, hogy mélyen spirituális ember volt és hisz valamiféle univerzális harmóniában, ami összeköti a fizikai világot. Az irodalom néha ellentmondásos információkat tartalmaz Tesla spirituális nézeteiről és egyéni vallásos meggyőződéséről. Néhány forrás azt sugallja, hogy Tesla a szabad gondolkodókhoz tartozott, akik nem ragaszkodnak szigorúan egyházi dogmákhoz, hanem a természeti törvényekben és az univerzumban rejlő rendben találják meg a spiritualitásukat. Az is ismert, hogy Tesla érdeklődött a metafizika iránt és nyitott volt az emberi értelem határain túli lehetőségekre, beleértve az olyan eszméket, mint az éter, ami egyfajta közös univerzális közegként funkcionált az ő koncepciójában. Tesla konkrétan nem dokumentálta hosszasan vallási nézeteit, így személyes Istenben való hitéről vagy egyéb vallásos meggyőződéseiről nincs egyértelmű nyilatkozat. Ezért arra a kérdésre, hogy \\"Hitt-e Istenben Nikola Tesla?\\", a legpontosabb válasz valószínűleg az, hogy Tesla egyéni és komplex vallásos vagy spirituális nézetet vallott, amely nehezen sorolható be a hagyományos vallási kategóriákba."},{"instruction":"Létezik olyan emberi cselekedet vagy döntés amelynek nincs oka?","output":"Ez egy bonyolult filozófiai kérdés, amelyet évszázadok óta vizsgálnak gondolkodók a determinizmus, az akarat szabadsága és a kauzalitás kontextusában. Vannak eltérő vélemények arról, hogy minden emberi cselekedetnek van-e valamilyen oka, vagy lehetséges-e teljesen okszerűtlen döntést hozni. Azok, akik a determinizmust támogatják, úgy gondolják, hogy minden cselekedetet meghatároz előző állapotok egy sorozata, beleértve a biológiai, pszichológiai és környezeti tényezőket. E szerint a nézet szerint, még ha egy döntés véletlenszerű vagy spontánnak tűnik is, mindig van mögötte ok-okozati lánc, ami azt előidézi. Mások, akik az indeterminizmust vagy a libertarianizmust hirdetik, úgy vélik, hogy az akarat szabadsága lehetővé teszi az emberek számára, hogy valóban szabadon, okoktól függetlenül döntsenek. Ez a nézet arra utal, hogy vannak olyan döntések vagy cselekedetek, amelyeket nem határoz meg semmiféle előre meghatározott körülmény vagy korábbi esemény, hanem az emberek képesek cselekedni és dönteni úgy, hogy ez nem tulajdonítható semmilyen megelőző oknak. A tudomány, különösen a neuropszichológia és a viselkedési genetika területei, arra törekszik, hogy megértse az emberi döntések mögötti összetett rendszerek működését és összekapcsolódását. A kutatások azt sugallják, hogy számos láthatatlan erő és mechanizmus befolyásolja döntésinket, amelyeket gyakran nem vagyunk teljes mértékben tudatában. Végül a kérdés, hogy létezik-e oka nélküli emberi cselekedet vagy döntés, valószínűleg a szemlélő nézőpontjától függ. Minden érvényes válasz legalább részben támaszkodik filozófiai, tudományos, és személyes nézetekre. Az emberek sokszor úgy érzik, hogy döntéseik öntudatosak és szabad akaratuk eredményei, de nehéz empirikusan bizonyítani az okszerűtlenség vagy okoktól független akarat teljes és abszolút létezését."},{"instruction":"Létezik objektív emberi döntés ha a determinizmus igaz,","output":"A determinizmus azt az álláspontot képviseli, hogy minden esemény, beleértve az emberi gondolatokat, döntéseket és cselekvéseket is, az univerzum előző állapotából következik az ok-okozati összefüggéseknek megfelelően. Ha az univerzum valóban teljes mértékben determinisztikus, akkor minden döntés, amit hozunk, már előre meghatározott és okszerűen következik korábbi eseményekből és állapotokból. Ebben a kontextusban az \\"objektív emberi döntés\\" kifejezés alatt valószínűleg olyan döntést értünk, amelyet semmilyen személyes vagy szubjektív elfogultság, érzelem vagy hajlam nem befolyásol. Azonban, ha a determinizmus értelmezése szerint minden döntésünk egy előre meghatározott eseménysorozat eredménye, akkor az elképzelés az objektív döntésekről mint kívül eső dolgokról a determinisztikus világképen belül értelmetlenné válik. Minden döntésünk alapvetően a korábbi okok hosszú láncolatából származna, azokat pedig objektív tényezők is befolyásolják. Az objektivitás fogalmát általában úgy értelmezzük, hogy ki van zárva a szubjektív hatásokból és elfogultságból, és alapja a tényszerűségen vagy valami külső realitáson. Mindazonáltal, determinisztikus világkép mellett minden ilyen \\"objektív\\" döntés is csak az előző okok logikai következménye lenne. A filozófiában a kompatibilizmus az az álláspont, amely megtalálja a módját annak, hogy összeegyeztetje a determinizmust az akarat szabadságának érzésével. A kompatibilisták szerint még ha minden cselekedet mögött is valamiféle ok áll, az emberi döntések mégis szabadnak és felelőssé teljesnek tekinthetők egy bizonyos kontextusban. Ez azon az elképzelésen alapszik, hogy az akarat szabadsága nem feltételezi a teljesen okszerűtlen cselekedetek lehetőségét, hanem azt, hogy cselekedeteink általában összhangban vannak vágyainkkal, szándékainkkal és érzelmeinkkel, amelyek maguk is determinisztikus okok sorozatából erednek. Összefoglalva, ha a determinizmus igaz, az egyén döntéseit nem lehet teljesen objektív módon értékelni, mivel minden döntés a múlt eseményeinek determinisztikus sorozata által meghatározott. Emellett a determinizmus mellett az akarat szabadsága és az objektív döntéshozatal fogalmai átértelmezést és további filozófiai magyarázatot igényelnek."},{"instruction":"Hogyan egyeztethető össze az éntudat a determinizmussal?","output":"Az éntudat és a determinizmus összeegyeztetése régóta foglalkoztatja a filozófusokat, pszichológusokat és tudósokat. Az éntudat azt a bonyolult képességünket jelenti, miszerint tudatában vagyunk saját mentális állapotainknak, gondolatainknak, érzéseinknek, szándékainknak és cselekedeteinknek, illetve az énünk önreflexív szemlélete. A determinizmus, másrészt, az az elgondolás, hogy minden esemény, beleértve gondolatainkat és cselekedeteinket is, előre meghatározott és ok-okozati láncolatok által vezérelt. Filozófiai szempontból a kompatibilizmus (vagy lágy determinizmus) az az álláspont, amely megpróbálja összeegyeztetni az éntudatot és az akarat szabadságát a determinizmussal. A kompatibilisták úgy érzik, hogy az akarat szabadsága nem feltétlenül azt jelenti, hogy cselekedeteink okszerűtlenek vagy teljesen véletlenszerűek. Ehelyett az akarat szabadságát mint kompatibilis szemléletmódot arra használják, hogy leírják, hogyan hozhatnak döntéseket az emberek, amikor nem akadályozzák meg őket kényszerítő külső tényezők. A következő módokon értelmezik néhányan a kompatibilizmust, hogy összeegyeztessék az éntudatot a determinizmussal: 1. Szándékos cselekvés: Bár a cselekvéseink okszerűen meghatározottak lehetnek, az éntudat és a szándékos cselekvés lehetővé teszi, hogy összhangban legyenek vágyainkkal, érdekünkkel és céljainkkal. Így ezeket a cselekvéseket \\"szabadnak\\" nevezhetjük olyan értelemben, hogy tükrözik személyes szándékainkat és választásainkat. 2. Az okok belsővé tétele: Az éntudat lehetővé teszi, hogy asszimiláljuk és belsővé tegyük azokat az okokat, amelyek minket mozgatnak. Bár ezek az okok meghatározhatják a viselkedésünket, úgy vélekedhetünk róluk, mint az önazonosságunk és identitásunk részéről, így ezek az okok \\"énvezéreltek\\" lesznek. 3. Alternatíváknak érzékelt lehetősége: Az éntudat lehetővé teszi az emberek számára, hogy különböző lehetséges viselkedéseket képzeljenek el és mérlegeljenek azelőtt, hogy döntést hoznának. Ez az érzékelt választási lehetőség összhangban van az akarat szabadságának élményével, még a determinizmus igazolása mellett is. 4. Morális felelősség: Az éntudatos egyének képesek arra, hogy előretekintsenek a cselekvéseik következményeire és erkölcsi szempontból mérlegeljenek. A felelősségteljes választások lehetősége a determinizmus mellett is fennmaradhat, mivel az egyének képesek szándékos cselekvéseikkel befolyásolni jövőbeli eseményeket. Természetesen ezek a megközelítések nem foglalkoznak mindenkinek megnyugtatóan az éntudat és a determinizmus közötti feszültséggel. Vannak, akik úgy vélik, hogy a teljes determinizmus aláásná az akarat szabadságát és az önazonosság és felelősség hagyományos érzetét. Az inkompatibilisták vagy hard deterministák szerint, ha minden ténylegesen determinisztikus, akkor az éntudat illúzió lehet, vagy teljes mértékben összeegyeztethetetlen a valódi akarat szabadságával. Ez a téma a filozófiában továbbra is heves viták tárgyát képezi, és eltérő nézetek állnak szemben egymással a tudomány, a filozófia, a pszichológia és más kapcsolódó tudományágak területén."},{"instruction":"Ockham borotvája mint filozófiai elv miért nem használható Isten létének cávolására?","output":"Ockham borotvája, vagy Occam borotvája, egy filozófiai és tudományos alapelv, amely William of Ockham angol ferences barát és filozófus nevéhez fűződik, aki a 14. században élt. Az elvet gyakran így fogalmazzák meg: \\"Az egyenértékű magyarázatok közül a legszűkszegesebbet kell választani\\" vagy \\"Nem szabad több dolgot feltételezni, mint amennyire szükség van\\". Az alapelv segít a teóriák és magyarázatok egyszerűsítésében és könnyebb érthetőségében, kiemelve, hogy a kevesebb hipotézis és feltételezés általában jobb, amennyiben ezek elegendőek a megfigyelt jelenségek leírására. Azonban Ockham borotvája önmagában nem egy cáfolható állítás vagy bizonyíték, hanem egy heurisztikus eszköz, amit a tudományban és a filozófiában az egyszerűsítés és a gazdaságosság előmozdítására használnak. Ez az elv azt sugallja, hogy amikor több lehetséges magyarázatot lehet alkalmazni a megfigyelésekre, akkor az egyszerűbb (kevesebb nem igazolt entitást vagy hipotézist felhasználó) magyarázatot kellene előnyben részesíteni. Isten létének kérdésében Ockham borotvája nem feltétlenül alkalmazható egyenes bizonyítékként Isten létezésének cáfolására vagy igazolására, mert ez a kérdés túlmutat a szigorúan empirikus vagy tudományos bizonyítékon. Vallási hit és teológiai doktrínák gyakran olyan metatudományos területek, melyek nem minden esetben tartanak fenn közvetlen ok-okozati kapcsolatokat a mérhető vagy megfigyelhető világgal. Isten létének vagy nem-létének az állítása jellegénél fogva nem feltétlenül engedelmeskedik ugyanazon szempontoknak, mint a tapintható, természettudományos hipotézisek. Továbbá, azok számára, akik hisznek Isten létezésében, Isten nem egy opcionális hipotézis vagy feltárt entitás, hanem az univerzum és annak működésének alapvető okának vagy magyarázatának tekinthető. Ezért ők azzal érvelhetnek, hogy Isten létezése nem valami, ami „kivágható” Ockham borotvájával, mert számukra ez az alapelv, amelyre más magyarázatokat vagy megközelítéseket kell alapozni. Végül is Ockham borotvája egy gondolkodási és értelmezési eszköz, és mint minden ilyen eszköz, ennek használata is kontextustól és célkitűzésektől függ. Ez nem bizonyíték vagy cáfolat maga, hanem egy módszer, amely segít nekünk hatékonyabban gondolkodni az univerzumról és annak jelenségeiről."},{"instruction":"Élt-e a történelem során olyan tudós, melynek a későbbiek folyamán bebizonyosodott, hogy kutatási eredményei tévesek és ezért öngyilkos lett?","output":"Ilyen specifikus esetekről nem tudok, ahol egy tudós a későbbi bizonyítékok miatt vett volna véget az életének, kizárólag azért, mert kutatási eredményei tévesnek bizonyultak.

Egyes esetekben ezek az érzelmek depresszióhoz vagy személyes válsághoz vezethettek, aminek következményei tragikusak is lehettek. Az öngyilkosság azonban rendkívül komplex tett, amelynek okai többdimenziósak és nagyon személyesek, ritkán vezethetők vissza egyetlen okra, mint például egy tudományos elmélet megdőlése. Mindent összevetve tehát nem feltétlenül a kutatási eredmények tévedése vagy kritikája összefüggésbe hozható közvetlenül és kizárólagosan az öngyilkosságokkal. Tudománytörténetben sokkal szélesebb körben dokumentált a tény, hogy a kutatási eredményeket és elméleteket idővel felülírják, módosítják vagy teljesen félredobnak, amit a kutatók általában úgy kezelnek, mint a tudomány fejlődésének természetes részét."},{"instruction":"Mondj néhány ilyen tudóst.","output":"Tudománytörténet során voltak olyan tudósok, akiknek munkája vagy elméletei idővel elavulnakak, helytelennek vagy tévesnek bizonyultak, de olyan tudósokról nincs tudomásom, akik közvetlenül ezért öngyilkosságot követtek volna el. Az alábbiakban felsorolok néhány történelmi példát tudósokra, akiknek munkásságát később megkérdőjelezték vagy cáfolták: 1. **Georges Lemaître** - Lemaître belga római katolikus pap, csillagász és fizikus volt, aki az 1920-as években a \\"Nagy Bumm\\" elméletét javasolta, ami később a nagy robbanás (Big Bang) néven ismertté vált. Bár kezdetben sokan szkeptikusok voltak, később bebizonyosodott, hogy az elmélete helyes volt. 2. **Ignaz Semmelweis** - Semmelweis osztrák-magyar orvos volt, akit sokan \\"az anyák megmentőjeként\\" ismernek. Felfedezte, hogy ha az orvosok kézfertőtlenítést végeznek, mielőtt hozzájuk érnek a gyermekágyi lázas betegekhez, jelentősen csökkenthetik a halálozási rátát. Kollégái közötti konfliktusai miatt elfelejtették kutatásait, és Semmelweis pszichiátriai intézetben halt meg sajnos. 3. **Alfred Wegener** - Wegener, egy német meteorológus, a geofizika és a kutató először vetette fel a kontinentális drift vagy lemeztektonika elméletét, amely szerint a földkéreg mozgó lemezekből áll, amik idővel változtatják a kontinensek helyzetét. Az elmélete a kezdeti bemutatása után sok csúfolódot és kritikát kapott, de már a halála után fogadták el, mint valódi tudományos meglátását. Wegener azonban nem öngyilkosság miatt halt meg, hanem Grönlandon egy tudományos kutató expedíció során. Ezek a példálódzási esetek bemutatják, hogy bár a tudóstársadalom kezdetben gyakran skeptikusan fogadja az újító vagy radikális elméleteket, a tudomány haladása során ezek az elméletek gyakran később elfogadottá válhatnak, miután több bizonyíték gyűlt össze azok támasztására. A tudóstörténet során számos esetet találunk, ahol tudósok kutatási eredményei vitatottak voltak, de öngyilkosságot közvetlenül a kutatási eredmények következményeként elkövetni rendkívül ritka és specifikus esemény lenne, amelynek dokumentálva kellene lennie és megfelelő bizonyítékkal alátámasztva }))."},{"instruction":"Melyek azok a történészek akik írtak a történelmi Jézus létezéséről?","output":"A történelmi Jézust kutató történészek és régészek, valamint a vallástörténészek és biblikus tudósok az elmúlt századokban és napjainkban is vizsgálták Jézus életét és korát. A történelmi Jézus létezéséről szóló források jellegzetesen a következő csoportokba sorolhatók: 1. **Korai keresztény források:** Ezek az Újszövetség írásai, különösen a négy kanonikus evangélium (Máté, Márk, Lukács, János), az Apostolok Cselekedetei, Pál levelei és egyéb ókori keresztény szövegek. Bár ezek elsődlegesen vallási dokumentumok, tartalmazzák az eddigi legkorábbi és legrészletesebb leírásokat Jézusról. 2. **Római szerzők:** Több római történész és szerző is említi a keresztényeket vagy magát Jézust. A legnevesebbek közé tartozik Tacitus, aki a \\"Történetek\\" (Annales) című művében említést tesz a keresztények üldözéséről Neró császár idején, és hivatkozik a \\"Christus\\"-ra, akinek halála okozta a mozgalom megjelenését. 3. **Zsidó források:** Az egyik legismertebb referencia József Flávius zsidó történésztől származik, aki a \\"A zsidók története\\" (Antiquitates Judaicae) című munkájában említi Jézust, bár e szakasz hitelességét a tudományos közösségben vita övezi, mivel vannak utólag hozzáadott (interpolált) részek, amelyek az eredeti szöveghez képest keresztény redakciók lehetnek. 4. **Korai nem keresztény források:** Néhány további nem keresztény író, mint például Plinius a kisebb, Suetonius és mások hivatkoznak a korai keresztényekre, amelyek közvetett információt nyújthatnak Jézusról, bár őket magukat ritkán említik. Jézus történelmi létezőként való elfogadása széles körben konszenzus a történészek és a vallástudományi szakemberek között, annak ellenére, hogy a források meglehetősen későn keletkeztek az élete után és vallási előítélettel lehetnek terhelve. Ezek a források és azok történelmi elemzése, valamint a korai kereszténység és a régi Közel-Kelet régészeti leletei az eddigi legjobb eszközök Jézus történelmi alakjának rekonstruálásához."},{"instruction":"Az egyiptomi Hórusz élete valóban sokban hasonlít a krisztuséhoz és Jézust valójában Hóruszról mintázták?","output":"Az elmélet, miszerint Jézus életét az egyiptomi Hórusz vallási mítoszáról mintázták, egy modern spekuláció, amely népszerűvé vált bizonyos kritikusok és pseudo-tudományos művek körében, mint például az új vallástudomány és a konspirációs elméletek terén. Azonban a történelmi és vallástörténeti szakértők nagy része komoly fenntartásokkal kezeli azokat az állításokat, amelyek szerint a Krisztus-mítosz közvetlenül megfelelő lenne Hórusz történetével, vagy hogy Hórusz életének elemeit átültették volna Jézus történetébe. Hórusz egy fontos isten az ókori egyiptomi mitológiában, sokszor ábrázolva mint egy sólyomfejű ember vagy maga a sólyom, a Nap és az ég isteneként, valamint az uralkodó faraók védelmezőjeként tekinthető. Mivel az ókori egyiptomi hitvilág nagyon gazdag és sokszínű volt és változásokon ment keresztül az évezredek során, Hóruszhoz kapcsolódó számos mítosz és hagyomány létezik. Néhány hasonlóság Jézus és Hórusz közötti állított párhuzamok, mint például születésüket, csodáikat és haláluk utáni feltámadásukat az okkultizmus, az újpogányság és más alternatív spirituális nézetek támogatói között terjedt el. Az utóbbi évtizedek könyvei és dokumentumfilmjei, mint például \\"Zeitgeist: The Movie\\" újabb kapcsolatokat vélelmeztek, amelyek azonban gyakran alapszakmai forrásokra és tálalmi elemzésekre támaszkodnak. A vezető egyiptológusok, vallási történészek és bibliai tudósok többsége elutasítja azt a feltevést, hogy Jézus alakját és történetét direkt módon Hóruszról mintázták volna. A hasonlóságok gyakran túlzottan leegyszerűsítettek vagy értelmezéseken alapulnak, amelyek nem állják meg a helyüket a szigorú akadémiai kutatás szempontjából. Jézus alakját és tanításait leginkább a korabeli zsidó hagyományok határozták meg, illetve a római kor Palesztinájának komplex társadalmi és történelmi kontextusában értelmezendők. Mindemellett értékes az ókori vallási hagyományok, mítoszok és kultúrák összehasonlító tanulmányozása, amely segíthet felfedezni az emberi kultúra és spiritualitás közös elemeit. De ez nem jelenti azt, hogy egy adott vallásos alak nagyjából szóról szóra egy korábbi mítosz koppintása lenne."},{"instruction":"Write an horror comedy anime scene about a young man casually chatting with a demon.

When we talk about a company internalizing externalities, we mean that the company is taking into account the indirect costs (or benefits) its operations have on the environment, public health, and other areas not reflected in its financial accounts. For example, pollution is a negative externality that can cause health problems and environmental damage, but the company responsible for the pollution does not necessarily pay for these damages as part of its business expenses. If it's stated that BP (British Petroleum) did not internalize the externalities cost, it means that BP failed to take full responsibility for the environmental and social costs of its operations. Here are some possible areas where BP may have not internalized the externalities cost: 1. **Environmental Pollution**: If BP did not sufficiently invest in pollution control or mitigation technologies to reduce the environmental impact of its oil extraction, refining, and distribution operations, it could be said that the company did not internalize the full environmental cost of its activities. 2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: If BP emitted greenhouse gases without offsetting or taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, then it might be accused of not internalizing the global societal costs associated with climate change. 3. **Oil Spills and Accidents**: Notably, the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 was a catastrophic event where BP faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent the spill or address the immediate and long-term environmental damage it caused to marine life, ecosystems, and local economies dependent on those ecosystems. 4. **Health Impacts**: If BP's operations lead to air or water pollution that has negative health impacts on nearby communities, and BP did not compensate those affected or invest in reducing those health impacts, then it would not be internalizing those costs. 5. **Community Displacement or Impacts**: If BP's operations result in negative social impacts, such as displacing communities or adversely affecting local economies through resource depletion or environmental degradation, and does not remedy or compensate for these effects, it is not internalizing these externalities. When a company like BP does not internalize the full costs of these externalities, governments, local communities, and the natural environment often bear the burden. In some cases, companies may later face legal action, fines, cleanup costs, or reputational damage as a consequence of failing to internalize these costs. In response to such incidents and in the face of increasing public pressure, many oil companies, including BP, have since stated commitments to more sustainable practices and reducing their environmental impact. However, the efficacy and sincerity of these efforts are often scrutinized by external observers."},{"instruction":"Write the above with citation harvard style and with proper evidence.

Moreover, I can't access the internet to fetch current or historical data or generate commentary based on real-world evidence. Nonetheless, I can demonstrate how you might construct a commentary with hypothetical Harvard-style references, based on a fictional scenario where BP had failed to internalize external costs. Please note that this is purely illustrative: --- Commentary: The Real Costs of Ignoring Environmental Externalities: The BP Case The environmental and social impact of large-scale industrial activities is a subject of increasing public and academic scrutiny. BP, as a major player in the oil and gas sector, has been at the center of numerous discussions concerning the internalization of externality costs—costs that arise from the company's operations but are not directly accounted for in its financial ledgers (Smith and Liu, 2021). When we consider externalities, we refer to the impacts that do not automatically translate into company costs. For BP, an infamous instance of such was the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which shed light on the considerable environmental and social costs of oil spill accidents. The spill, occurring in 2010, had devastating effects on marine ecosystems and local economies that relied on these natural resources (Johnson, 2020). Despite regulations and the company's commitments to safety and sustainability, criticisms continue that BP has not fully internalized the costs of pollution – a lingering testament to the grand-scale consequences when large corporates overlook their environmental responsibilities (Davis and Thompson, 2022). The issue of greenhouse gas emissions remains contentious, and it is here that BP, like many of its oil and gas counterparts, is said to fall short. The industry's contribution to climate change is a significant externality, with the burning of fossil fuels driving a myriad of climate-related issues. Although BP announced initiatives aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the effectiveness of these initiatives is debated among environmentalists who argue for more immediate action (Greenpeace, 2023). Another area where BP and similar companies are accused of not internalizing externalities is the health implications of pollution. Air quality issues arising from petroleum refineries have been linked to respiratory illnesses and other health problems in neighboring communities. Yet, there are allegations that the costs for these health problems are borne not by the company, but by the public health systems and the affected individuals themselves (Allen and Patel, 2021). The communities living in proximity to BP's activities sometimes also shoulder unaccounted costs. Resource depletion, environmental degradation, and community displacement have life-altering implications, and without adequate compensation or mitigation strategies, these costs are arguably externalized (White, 2022). In conclusion, while BP has made public overtures indicating a transition toward a more sustainable and responsible operational model, the task remains to tangibly internalize the costs of environmental and social externalities. The journey towards full accountability is complex, but it is also necessary if we are to avert the most damaging consequences of industrial negligence. --- *References:* Allen, J. & Patel, S.

Write this answer for me like commentary","output":"Commentary: Lessons from Tragedy — Rana Plaza and Kunshan Explosions The Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh and the Kunshan factory explosion in China serve as harrowing reminders that industrial disasters are not mere accidents but often a result of systemic failures to prioritize workers' safety and wellbeing. These incidents expose a stark reality: when profit margins take precedence over people, the consequences can be catastrophic. The collapse of Rana Plaza in 2013, which housed several garment factories, killed over 1,100 people and injured thousands more (Manik and Yardley, 2013). This tragedy highlighted the hazardous conditions workers in the global supply chain often face. The demand for cheap clothing, relentless pressure to cut costs, and inadequate regulatory oversight can lead to compromised safety standards. In the wake of the disaster, there were significant calls for reform. The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh was one such response, aiming to prevent such tragedies through rigorous safety inspections and worker empowerment initiatives (Berfield and Baumann, 2013). Similarly, the Kunshan explosion in 2014, at a metal products factory, killed nearly 100 people (Bradsher, 2014). The incident was attributed to poor handling of combustible dust, a known industrial hazard. Like Rana Plaza, the root causes behind the Kunshan explosion included regulatory lapses, insufficient safety measures, and an apparent disregard for the well-documented risks associated with the processing of fine metallic dusts. Both disasters share troubling commonalities: they occurred in factories that are cogs in the wheels of vast global supply chains, operated by workers under conditions that received little scrutiny until tragedy struck. The aftermath of these incidents has forced multinational corporations to reconsider their outsourcing strategies and supply chain oversight mechanisms. There has been an increased push towards transparency, ethical sourcing, and corporate accountability (Glader, 2015). Despite these advancements, the road ahead remains fraught with challenges. Compliance and enforcement of safety standards remain inconsistent. Moreover, global consumers are often disconnected from the realities of production, so the pressure for fast, cheap goods continues relatively unabated. Reflecting upon the human cost of Rana Plaza and the Kunshan explosion compels us to confront uncomfortable questions about consumer responsibility and the true price of capitalism's 'efficiencies.' As we work towards a safer, more equitable world, these incidents must not be sidelined as foreign tragedies. Instead, they should serve as constant reminders—and catalysts for change—so that the dignity and safety of every worker become the bedrock principles of global industry. *References:* Berfield, S. and Baumann, P.

In your opinion, how could the corporation have internalized these costs for value creation?................Write the above in context of this question","output":"Commentary: The High Price of Ignoring Externalities: A Reflection on Rana Plaza and Kunshan The catastrophic events at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh and the Kunshan factory in China starkly illustrate the consequences firms and society bear when corporations fail to internalize the costs of externalities. The tragic loss of life and subsequent financial, legal, and reputational costs to involved companies offer a grim lesson in the importance of integrating external costs into their business models. Externalities, particularly those related to environmental and social impacts, have traditionally been seen as peripheral concerns by many businesses, external to their balance sheets and thus, out of their immediate purview. However, the backlash in the aftermath of these disasters has demonstrated that such externalities can lead to significant internal financial costs and a loss of stakeholder value. The destruction of human life, environmental damage, and the subsequent erosion of social trust in these instances have forced a reevaluation of what true cost internalization entails. For corporations operating in high-risk industries or regions, internalizing these costs means adopting a holistic view of their operations. Had the firms involved in Rana Plaza and Kunshan been proactive in managing the risks associated with their operations, many lives could have been saved, and the costs to their businesses significantly reduced. Internalization could have taken several forms: 1. **Investing in Worker Safety**: Ensuring the physical safety of workers by investing in safe buildings, regular safety drills, and proper equipment would mitigate risks and potentially prevent disasters like Rana Plaza. 2. **Adopting Rigorous Standards**: Implementing and adhering to international standards for safety, such as ISO/SA8000, and conducting regular third-party audits could have identified and remedied the hazards that led to the Kunshan explosion. 3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Firms can internalize externalities by regularly engaging with stakeholders, including local communities, governments, and non-governmental organizations. This engagement can foster transparency and collaboration on issues of safety and environmental impact. 4. **Supply Chain Oversight**: Rigorous supply chain oversight through codes of conduct, compliance checks, and the integration of ethical sourcing criteria into procurement decisions are crucial for recognizing and mitigating risks. 5. **Incorporating External Costs into Pricing**: By factoring in the costs associated with externalities, such as pollution or health risks, into product pricing, companies can create a financial buffer for potential issues and demonstrate their commitment to responsible business practices. 6. **Sustainability and Social Responsibility**: Investment in sustainable practices, both environmental and social, is increasingly recognized as integral to long-term value creation. These practices can help prevent negative outcomes that stem from externalities. 7. **Establishing Emergency Funds**: Building emergency funds to cover potential adverse events and their fallout protects not only the workers and communities affected but also the company's financial health and reputation during crises. In these two cases, the clear lesson is that internalizing the costs associated with potential externalities before a crisis occurs is far less costly in the long run than reacting to a disaster. What’s more, internalizing these costs can create value for the firm in the form of enhanced reputation, increased customer loyalty, more engaged and productive workers, and reduced regulatory and legal risks. Crucially, corporate value creation must evolve to fully embrace the environmental and social dimensions of business. In the long term, the integration of these concerns into corporate strategy and decision-making is not just an ethical imperative but a business one, as companies that fail to do so risk their very viability. The Rana Plaza and Kunshan tragedies have shifted the dialogue from whether businesses should internalize external costs to how they can do so effectively. Corporations that succeed in this regard will likely find themselves leading the charge in a new era of responsible and profitable business. *Note: This commentary is for illustrative purposes and should be supported by real-world data and references when composed for actual use.*"},{"instruction":"Did the above companies recovered from the cost?","output":"As an AI, I don't have real-time data, but I can provide information up to my last update in early 2023. For the Rana Plaza disaster, which involved several garment factories and not a single company, the recovery cannot be measured purely in terms of financial costs to specific companies. The global fashion brands associated with these factories faced intense scrutiny and reputational damage. The disaster sparked widespread demand for improved labor practices and greater supply chain transparency in the fashion industry. Brands and retailers associated with the factories were pressured to contribute to compensation funds for the victims and to invest in improving working conditions. The overall recovery of these companies from the reputational and financial fallout would vary individually depending on their subsequent actions and the perceptions of their stakeholders concerning their role in the systemic issues highlighted by the collapse. Regarding the Kunshan explosion, the affected company, Zhongrong Metal Production Company, and its customers faced a different set of challenges. The explosion not only inflicted a significant human toll but also led to economic losses and legal consequences. The aftermath saw Chinese authorities shutting down the facility and instituting a series of inspections and regulations aimed at improving industrial safety standards. Recovery in this context involves the potential for reopening, cost of regulatory compliance, legal penalties, and also the capacity to rebuild trust with clients and the workforce. The specific recovery trajectory for Zhongrong Metal Production Company would depend on their response to the incident, their financial resilience, and the broader economic and regulatory environment in China post-explosion. In both cases, the idea of “recovery” extends beyond the direct costs and encompasses longer-term impacts on brand reputation, regulatory compliance, workforce relations, and the broader industry practices. The true cost of these events includes both the immediate financial hit and the more extended implications for how businesses operate in a globalized and increasingly ethically conscious market. For specific information about the recovery of the companies involved, one would need to look at more recent financial reports, news articles, and industry analyses detailing their actions following these incidents and any changes in their business practices or financial status."},{"instruction":"Rana Plaza wasn't an accident; it was a preventable tragedy fueled by a toxic cocktail of unethical labor practices, lax safety standards, and rampant disregard for human life.

However, I can demonstrate how one would approach writing the commentary based on the given instructions using hypothetical data concerning a Mutual Fund/PE Fund with a sustainability strategy. --- **Commentary: Evaluating the Performance and Sustainability Strategy of the EcoGrowth Sustainability Fund** The EcoGrowth Sustainability Fund (ESF) stands as a prime example of an investment fund where sustainability is not merely an afterthought but is woven into the fabric of its investment philosophy and strategy. The ESF is pronounced in its commitment to catalyzing sustainable growth while delivering attractive returns to investors, balancing fiduciary duties with the pressing need for actionable environmental and social impact. Under the stewardship of Prime Asset Management, the ESF has delineated a sustainability strategy that adheres to the Sustainable Finance Framework underscoring integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations during the investment process. The fund methodically identifies companies that not only exhibit sound financial performance but also showcase robust sustainability practices, ranging from carbon footprint reduction initiatives to fair labor policies and corporate governance. The underlying selection process is underpinned by proprietary ESG analysis and external sustainability ratings, facilitating the accumulation of a diverse portfolio in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Critically examining ESF’s asset allocation reveals a deliberate tilt towards renewable energy, clean technology, and sustainable infrastructure projects; sectors indisputably pivotal to orchestrating a low-carbon economy. Additionally, significant investments in healthcare and education resonate with the fund’s propensity to support human capital development as a cornerstone of sustainable development. While this thematic prioritization is commendable, it raises questions on the portfolio's exposure to sector-specific risks and economic cycles, which could potentially impact performance during downturns in these sectors. The fund’s historical performance metrics depict a convincing argument for the integration of sustainability into asset management. With returns consistently surpassing its benchmark index, ESF exhibits that far from constraining performance, a sustainability-focused investment approach can uncover value drivers often overlooked by traditional analysis. However, it is imperative to consider the sustainability premium in terms of valuation models and longer time horizons necessitated to realize the full potential of such investments. This may influence the fund’s attractiveness for certain investors seeking shorter investment horizons. A stark point of contention often levied at funds such as ESF is the true depth of impact stemming from their investments. A rigorous critical examination must pierce through the prolific use of ESG jargon to discern tangible outcomes. The fund’s periodic impact reports elucidate strides made in emission reductions and contribution to economic empowerment in emerging markets. However, one must scrutinize the potential for greenwashing, the extent of influence the fund holds over corporate policies, and the real calculable impact versus proclaimed ESG contribution. The influence of the current context on the ESF’s strategy is palpable. Amidst burgeoning investor demand for responsible investment and heightened regulatory focus on sustainability disclosures, ESF presents an avant-garde blueprint for the fund management industry. The fund not merely aligns with prevailing trends but endeavors to set the precedent for genuine ESG integration, driving the entire market towards sustainable investing norms. Nonetheless, the fund operates within a broader financial ecosystem fraught with divergent definitions of sustainability, inconsistent reporting standards, and varying levels of stakeholder commitment to the ESG agenda—all of which can impact the fund’s operational effectiveness and the comparability of its sustainability outcomes. The ambition harbored by the ESF team is laudable. The fund’s position reflects a profound acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of financial returns, sustainability, and societal well-being. Acknowledging limits to this position, the fund does not discount traditional financial analysis; rather, it enriches financial due diligence with rigorous ESG scrutiny, allowing for a more comprehensive risk-return evaluation. By synthesizing the fund's sustainability ethos with practical investment acumen, the ESF endeavors to serve discerning investors staunchly situated at the confluence of profit and purpose. In conclusion, while the ESF can point to numerous successes and lessons learned, it’s the forward trajectory that will solidify its reputation. The fund’s structured approach to sustainability, coupled with consistent performance, heralds a progressive shift in investment paradigms. Yet, the sustainability sphere is in flux, necessitating continuous refinement of strategies, vigilance against complacency, and an unyielding commitment to navigating the evolving landscape of sustainable finance. As the fund continues to align capital with sustainable objectives, it will not only need to satisfy the demands of informed investors but also live up to the responsibility of paving the way towards a transformative model of investment that others in the industry may emulate. *Please note that the \\"EcoGrowth Sustainability Fund\\" and \\"Prime Asset Management\\" are fictitious names used for illustrative purposes and do not represent any real entities or investment strategies.* --- The instruction to critically evaluate the fund's performance and asset allocation would typically require an in-depth analysis of comprehensive data including, but not limited to, financial statements, sustainability and impact reports, market analysis, and expert opinions. Keep in mind that any commentary or evaluation should be supported by credible information and properly cited sources specific to the actual fund being analyzed."},{"instruction":"dissertation topics for msc finance students related to investment and risk.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows.

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I'm excited about what else they're planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they've promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today's internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I'm intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week","output":"Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB's Kids' WB era is truly coming to an end. How's everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It's a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it's tough to imagine the block without them. I've got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I'm cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they've also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let's see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I'm willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let's hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids' WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It's a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB's guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we're stepping into uncharted territory, let's not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB's Kids' WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you're so attached to the way things were. It's not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here's to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We're rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I'm torn between excitement for what's new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don't let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids' WB classics, I'm bracing myself. Still, progress isn't inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB's legacy and deliver engaging content, then I'm on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition.

Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we've gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV's announcers. Looks like they're starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric's still holding down the fort in the bumpers...for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I'm up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I'm expecting they'll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids' WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we'll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It's not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let's all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV's announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We'll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I've always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y'know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap.

Visually, it's striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend.

It's already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they're pushing. Aside from \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. \\"Code Lyoko\\" and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, \\"Lyoko\\" has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for \\"Gloopy and Glitter,\\" its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. \\"Code Lyoko\\" has that futuristic vibe that's spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" likely stayed because it adds variety – can't have too much of one thing, even if the theme is 'digital.' User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM \\"Lyoko\\" might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that \\"Code Lyoko\\" cut it while other staples didn't. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You're all spot-on with your insights! \\"Code Lyoko\\" has much to contribute to the technological ethos we're embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we're keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming's broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like \\"Code Lyoko\\" – it's the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn't love a splash of gooey positivity from \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet \\"Code Lyoko\\" is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it's paying off.

To manipulate ports in terms of opening or closing them, you would use a combination of Windows Firewall rules and services or applications that bind to these ports.

Open Windows Defender Firewall: - Press \`Win + R\`, type \`firewall.cpl\`, and press \`Enter\`, OR - Search for \\"Windows Defender Firewall\\" in the Start menu and open it. 2. On the left, click on “Advanced settings” to open the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security window. 3. In the left pane, click on \`Inbound Rules\`. 4. On the right pane, click on “New Rule…” 5. In the New Inbound Rule Wizard, select \`Port\` and click \`Next\`. 6. Choose TCP or UDP as the type of port you’re opening, depending on your needs. 7. Enter the port number you want to open and click \`Next\`. 8. Choose \`Allow the connection\` and click \`Next\`. 9. If you want the rule to apply to domain, private, and/or public networks, check the appropriate boxes and click \`Next\`. 10. Give the rule a meaningful name and, if you like, a description. 11. Click \`Finish\` to create the rule. This rule will now allow traffic through the port you specified on the step of specifying the port number (7). To open a port, you also generally need a program or service that listens on that port. You configure the program or service itself to use the port; simply opening the port in the firewall doesn’t open it in the sense of making a program listen on it. If you have an existing service that should be listening on a port but appears to be blocked, opening the port in the firewall, as detailed above, is a common way to resolve this issue. Remember, opening ports can create security risks by potentially exposing services running on your system to the internet.

Here are some steps you can take to handle the situation professionally: 1. **Stay Neutral:** First and foremost, if you are not involved, it's essential to remain neutral. Avoid taking sides or making judgments based on limited information. 2. **Gather Information:** If the situation affects your work or if you are expected to be part of the resolution process, try to gather information from reliable sources. Understand the facts before you make any decisions or take any action. 3. **Listen Actively:** If colleagues are discussing the situation with you, listen actively to what they are saying. This shows respect for their perspective and may also provide you with a better understanding of the situation. 4. **Respect Privacy:** Be mindful of confidentiality and privacy. Some matters might be sensitive and not meant for broader discussion. It's important to respect the privacy of those involved and not spread information unnecessarily. 5. **Offer Support:** If someone involved in the situation approaches you for support or advice, offer to help to the extent that you can without compromising your neutrality or involving yourself too deeply. 6. **Redirect to Appropriate Parties:** If the situation is serious or outside your scope of understanding or authority, suggest that those involved seek help from appropriate sources, such as HR, a manager, or another relevant individual or department within the organization. 7. **Focus on Your Responsibilities:** Keep your focus on your own tasks and responsibilities. Getting entangled in office politics or conflicts can be distracting and detrimental to your work. 8. **Escalate if Necessary:** If the situation seems to be impacting the workplace environment or if there is improper conduct involved, it might need to be escalated to a higher level of authority within the organization. 9. **Reflect on Impact:** Consider if and how the situation may indirectly affect your work or team dynamics. Proactively addressing potential impacts can help to minimize any negative consequences. 10. **Practice Discretion:** Be discreet in your conversations and communications regarding the situation, especially if it is a sensitive matter. 11. **Stay Professional:** No matter what the situation or your role in it (or lack thereof), maintaining a professional demeanor is crucial. It's important to remember that every situation is unique and may require a tailored approach.

If you need me, I’ll be at my desk.” 3. **Seek Clarification:** If you feel that you should have been included in the meeting due to the relevance to your work, wait until the meeting is finished, and then approach one of the meeting organizers to clarify your role and whether you should have been involved. 4. **Discreet Inquiry:** Should you overhear something during the inadvertent encounter that you feel affects your responsibilities or projects, it's appropriate to discretely inquire with your direct supervisor or the meeting organizer afterward to ensure you are informed about any decisions or information that may affect your work. 5. **Reschedule Your Space:** If the meeting is taking place in a space you had reserved or typically use, it’s professional to find an alternative space for yourself while making a mental note to reiterate booking protocols to prevent such conflicts in the future. 6. **Use the Opportunity:** If the meeting’s occurrence makes you realize that a similar meeting relevant to your role should occur, take this opportunity to suggest the idea to your supervisor or the appropriate colleague. 7. **Reflect on Communication:** Use this as an opportunity to reflect on internal communication within your organization. If you often find yourself out of the loop, it may be worth discussing with your manager or HR about improving communication channels and information sharing. 8. **Note for Future Instances:** Record this event if it seems to be part of a pattern of exclusion that is affecting your ability to carry out your role effectively. If such incidents continue, you may need to have a conversation with your supervisor about ensuring you are included in relevant future discussions. Remember, handling such situations with professionalism and discretion is key. It’s important not to jump to conclusions or disrupt the meeting but to manage the situation calmly and gracefully."},{"instruction":"How to handle a work or activity when you are not part of it or nether you are aware of it in office ?","output":"If you find yourself in a situation at work where an activity or project is ongoing but you are neither involved nor aware of the details, here are some steps you can take to handle the situation appropriately: 1. **Assess the Situation**: Determine why you're not involved. Is it because it's not relevant to your role, or was there an oversight? Understanding the reason can guide your next steps. 2. **Gather Information**: If you believe you should be informed or involved, try to get some basic information. You can ask colleagues who are involved or directly approach the managers handling the project. This can be done in an informal manner, like a casual conversation during a break or more formally by scheduling a meeting. 3. **Communicate**: Reach out to your supervisor or the project leader to express your interest or concern. Be polite and express your willingness to contribute or your need to understand how the project may impact your work. 4. **Offer Support**: If after getting more information, you feel that your skills could be beneficial to the project, offer your assistance. Identify specific ways you can contribute and make your case to the project leader. 5. **Respect Boundaries**: If the project doesn't concern your role or department, be respectful of that boundary. Offer help if needed but don't insist on being included if it's not appropriate. 6. **Request Regular Updates**: If the project does affect your role or department but you're not directly involved, you might request that the team provides regular updates. This can be part of team meetings or through email communications. 7. **Maintain Professionalism**: Even if you feel left out, it's important to stay professional. Don't let your feelings of exclusion negatively impact your work or your relationships with co-workers. 8. **Learn from the Experience**: Use this as an opportunity to learn more about how projects are assigned and managed in your office. If needed, have a discussion with your supervisor about your role and how you can be considered for future projects. 9. **Stay Informed**: Even if you're not involved, keeping a general awareness of what's going on in your office can help you stay in the loop and may prevent similar situations in the future. 10. **Continue with Your Responsibilities**: Focus on your current responsibilities and continue to perform well in your role. Building a reputation for excellence can increase your chances of being considered for future opportunities. Remember that not being part of every project or activity is normal in most workplaces. Resources and attention need to be distributed effectively, and not all employees will be involved in all initiatives. However, clarifying expectations and expressing a willingness to be involved in future projects can help you become more integrated into various aspects of your workplace."},{"instruction":"Fix grammar:Poke Bay serenity.","output":"To correct the grammar, you might want to specify what aspect of Poke Bay's serenity you are talking about and turn it into a complete sentence.

Here's how you can approach these meetings even when you feel there's not much to discuss: 1. **Agenda Planning**: Create a structured agenda with slots for different types of discussions. Share the agenda with team members ahead of the meeting so they have time to prepare. 2. **Project Updates**: Provide brief updates on current projects, progress, any upcoming deadlines, or milestones achieved. If you're not leading any projects, consider inviting team members to give updates on their work. 3. **Educational Segment**: Introduce a short knowledge-sharing segment where a team member (or yourself) presents on a relevant topic, new technology, or industry trends. Rotate the presenter role each week to keep things varied. 4. **Process Improvements**: Discuss any issues that have arisen during the past week and brainstorm potential solutions. Encourage team members to share their ideas for workflow or process improvements. 5. **Feedback and Q&A**: Allow time for team members to ask questions or bring up any concerns. Encourage open communication and provide feedback where appropriate. 6. **Training and Development**: Use part of the meeting for training. Discuss opportunities for professional development, possible courses, webinars, or workshops that might be of interest. 7. **Team Building**: Incorporate a short team-building activity to strengthen relationships among team members. 8. **Planning and Goals**: Review goals for the upcoming week(s), assign responsibilities, or set new objectives. 9. **Guest Speakers**: Occasionally invite someone from another department or an outside expert to speak on relevant issues or to provide new insights. 10. **Recognition**: Take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate successes or to give recognition to individuals or the team for their efforts and achievements. 11. **Follow-Up Actions**: Conclude each meeting with clear action items, who is responsible for them, and the deadline. Remember to always keep the meetings as concise as possible. If there's no substantial content to discuss during a particular week, it's better to have a shorter meeting that respects everyone's time rather than stretching it unnecessarily. Lastly, periodically solicit feedback about the meetings themselves: Are they helpful? What could be improved? This will help ensure the meetings are productive and fulfilling their intended purpose. If it turns out that weekly meetings are too frequent, then discuss with your boss the possibility of adjusting the frequency to better match the needs of the team."},{"instruction":"give me some thing that i can use every week.","output":"Certainly! To ensure that you have a recurring structure that can be used every week, here's an outline that you can adapt to fit almost any meeting.

The relationship between genotype and phenotype is complex, and involves the dynamic interaction of genes, and the proteins they encode, with myriad environmental stimuli.The Essence of Molecular Biology The genetic information on which the phenotype is built is contained in every cell in the form of DNA. Replication is the process by which DNA is duplicated. This process is undertaken prior to cell division to ensure that all daughter cells contain the same genetic information as the parent cell. The information in DNA is transmitted to RNA via a process called transcription . RNA synthesizes protein through the process of translation, which largely controls the appearance and function (i.e., the phenotype) of cells and organisms.Lecture’s Objectives 1. Define cell cycle. 2. List the phases of the cell cycle. 3. Describe the molecular events taking place during various phases of a cell cycle. 4. Explain how the cell cycle is regulated. 5. Correlate the disturbances in cell cycle regulation with cancer. 6. Define apoptosis. 7. Explain the significance of apoptosis. 8. Describe the pathways involved of the process of apoptosis.What is the cell cycle? Definition A cell cycle is a series of events that takes place in a cell as it grows and divides. A cell spends most of its time in what is called interphase, and during this time it grows, replicates its chromosomes, and prepares for cell division. The cell then leaves interphase, undergoes mitosis, and completes its division. The resulting cells, known as daughter cells, each enter their own interphase and begin a new round of the cell cycle.Phases of the cell cycle • Successive phases of progression of a cell through its cycle of replication are defined with reference to DNA synthesis and cellular division. 1- DNA synthesis occurs only during a limited period of the cell cycle, which is the S- phase .2- The cell-division stage or M phase comprising nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). 3- First gap phase (G 1 ) which occurs following the M phase. 4- Second gap phase (G 2 ) which separates the S-phase from the M phase. • Although initially regarded as periods of inactivity, it is now recognized that these gap phases represent periods when critical processes occur, preparing the cells for DNA synthesis and mitosis.Phases of the cell cycle• After cell division (mitosis), individual daughter cells may re-enter G 1 to undergo further division if appropriate stimuli are present. • Alternatively, they may leave the cycle and become quiescent or resting cells — a state often labelled as G 0 (resting phase). • Entry to G 0 may be associated with a process of terminal differentiation , with loss of potential for further division and death at the end of the lifetime of the cell; this occurs in permanent cells, such as neurons. Other quiescent cells retain some ability to proliferate by reentering G 1 if appropriate stimuli are present.Schematic of the cell cycle. Outer ring: I = Interphase, M = Mitosis; inner ring: M = Mitosis, G1 = Gap 1, G2 = Gap 2, S = Synthesis; not in ring: G0 = Gap 0/RestingDuration of the cell cycle • In mammals, different cell types divide at very different rates, with the cell cycle ranging from as little as 8 hours, in the case of gut epithelial cells, to 100 days or more, exemplified by hepatocytes in the normal adult liver. • However, the duration of the individual phases of the cycle is constant and independent of the rate of cell division. • The principal difference between rapidly dividing cells and those that divide slowly is the time spent temporarily in G 0 between divisions; some cells remain in the G 0 phase for days or even years between divisions, whilst others rapidly reenter G 1 after mitosis.Molecular events in the cell cycle • Cell division is a highly complex process and cells possess a molecular machinery to ensure its successful completion. • A number of internal checkpoints exist to ensure that one phase is complete before the next commences. This is vital to ensure that DNA replication has been performed accurately and that cells do not divide before DNA replication is complete. • The various proteins and enzymes that carry out DNA replication, mitotic spindle formation are typically only present and active during the appropriate phases of the cycle.Cell Cycle Checkpoints• The cell cycle is regulated by the activity of a family of proteins called cyclindependent kinases (CDKs). • CDKs activate their target proteins by phosphorylation. • The activity of CDKs is regulated by a second family of proteins, the cyclins . • Transitions from one phase of the cycle to the next are initiated by rises in the levels of specific cyclins. Regulation of the Cell Cycle• Cyclin D triggers the transition from G0 to G1 at the initiation of the cell cycle. This occurs when stimulated by growth factors. • Errors during DNA replication rises in the levels of certain proteins called the CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) which prevent CDKs from triggering the next phase of cell division until the issue is resolved. • If the cells fail to correct and repair these errors, they will typically initiate apoptosis rather than permit the generation of improper daughter cells.Disturbances in the cell cycle is associated with cancer • Damage to the genes that encode proteins involved in the regulation of cellcycle progression is seen in many cancers. • In normal cells, hundreds of genes control the process of cell division. Normal growth requires a balance between the activity of those genes that promote cell proliferation and those that suppress it. It also relies on the activities of genes that signal when damaged cells should undergo apoptosis.• Cells become cancerous after mutations accumulate in the various genes that control cell proliferation. • According to research findings from the Cancer Genome Project, most cancer cells possess 60 or more mutations. • Different kinds of cancers have different mutational signatures. However, scientific comparison of multiple tumor types has revealed that certain genes are mutated in cancer cells more often than others.• Growth-promoting genes, such as the gene for the signaling protein Ras, are among those most commonly mutated in cancer cells, becoming super-active and producing cells that are too strongly stimulated by growth receptors. • Other cancer-related mutations inactivate the genes that suppress cell proliferation or those that signal the need for apoptosis. These genes, known as tumor suppressor genes, normally function like brakes on proliferation, and both copies within a cell must be mutated in order for uncontrolled division to occur. For example, many cancer cells carry two mutant copies of the gene that codes for p53, the “guardian of the genome,” a multifunctional protein that normally senses DNA damage and acts as a transcription factor for checkpoint control genes.• Many of the drugs used in the treatment of cancer affect particular stages within the cell cycle. • These drugs inhibit the rapid division of cancer cells, but since they are administered systemically there is often inhibition of other rapidly dividing cells, such as the cells of the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. • Thus anemia, a bleeding tendency and suppression of immunity may be clinically important side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Regulatory proteins of the cell cycle are targets for anticancer drugsTherapeutic interruption of the cell cycleApoptosis Definition Physiological cell death. Apoptosis is a physiological cellular process in which a defined and programmed sequence of intracellular events leads to the removal of a cell without the release of products harmful to surrounding cells.Significance of Apoptosis • The coexistence of apoptosis alongside mitosis within a cell population ensures a continuous renewal of cells, rendering a tissue more adaptable to environmental demands than one in which the cell population is static. • It is an energy-dependent, biochemically specific mode of cell death characterized by the enzymatic digestion of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, and the phagocytosis of the resultant breakdown products whilst still retained within the cell membrane.• p53 is a multifunctional protein which induces cell cycle arrest and initiates DNA damage repair. However, if this is unsuccessful, p53 can induce apoptosis via activation of proapoptotic members• The nucleus shrinks (pyknosis) and fragments (karyorrhexis). The cell shrinks, retaining an intact plasma membrane, but alteration of this membrane rapidly induces phagocytosis. • Dead cells not phagocytosed fragment into smaller membranebound apoptotic bodies. • There is no inflammatory reaction to apoptotic cells, probably because the cell membrane is intact","output":"Given the complexity and the depth of the topic provided, creating 30 multiple-choice questions with model answers to cover all the different aspects of the information you've shared would be extensive.

The relationship between genotype and phenotype is complex, and involves the dynamic interaction of genes, and the proteins they encode, with myriad environmental stimuli.The Essence of Molecular Biology The genetic information on which the phenotype is built is contained in every cell in the form of DNA. Replication is the process by which DNA is duplicated. This process is undertaken prior to cell division to ensure that all daughter cells contain the same genetic information as the parent cell. The information in DNA is transmitted to RNA via a process called transcription . RNA synthesizes protein through the process of translation, which largely controls the appearance and function (i.e., the phenotype) of cells and organisms.Lecture’s Objectives 1. Define cell cycle. 2. List the phases of the cell cycle. 3. Describe the molecular events taking place during various phases of a cell cycle. 4. Explain how the cell cycle is regulated. 5. Correlate the disturbances in cell cycle regulation with cancer. 6. Define apoptosis. 7. Explain the significance of apoptosis. 8. Describe the pathways involved of the process of apoptosis.What is the cell cycle? Definition A cell cycle is a series of events that takes place in a cell as it grows and divides. A cell spends most of its time in what is called interphase, and during this time it grows, replicates its chromosomes, and prepares for cell division. The cell then leaves interphase, undergoes mitosis, and completes its division. The resulting cells, known as daughter cells, each enter their own interphase and begin a new round of the cell cycle.Phases of the cell cycle • Successive phases of progression of a cell through its cycle of replication are defined with reference to DNA synthesis and cellular division. 1- DNA synthesis occurs only during a limited period of the cell cycle, which is the S- phase .2- The cell-division stage or M phase comprising nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). 3- First gap phase (G 1 ) which occurs following the M phase. 4- Second gap phase (G 2 ) which separates the S-phase from the M phase. • Although initially regarded as periods of inactivity, it is now recognized that these gap phases represent periods when critical processes occur, preparing the cells for DNA synthesis and mitosis.Phases of the cell cycle• After cell division (mitosis), individual daughter cells may re-enter G 1 to undergo further division if appropriate stimuli are present. • Alternatively, they may leave the cycle and become quiescent or resting cells — a state often labelled as G 0 (resting phase). • Entry to G 0 may be associated with a process of terminal differentiation , with loss of potential for further division and death at the end of the lifetime of the cell; this occurs in permanent cells, such as neurons. Other quiescent cells retain some ability to proliferate by reentering G 1 if appropriate stimuli are present.Schematic of the cell cycle. Outer ring: I = Interphase, M = Mitosis; inner ring: M = Mitosis, G1 = Gap 1, G2 = Gap 2, S = Synthesis; not in ring: G0 = Gap 0/RestingDuration of the cell cycle • In mammals, different cell types divide at very different rates, with the cell cycle ranging from as little as 8 hours, in the case of gut epithelial cells, to 100 days or more, exemplified by hepatocytes in the normal adult liver. • However, the duration of the individual phases of the cycle is constant and independent of the rate of cell division. • The principal difference between rapidly dividing cells and those that divide slowly is the time spent temporarily in G 0 between divisions; some cells remain in the G 0 phase for days or even years between divisions, whilst others rapidly reenter G 1 after mitosis.Molecular events in the cell cycle • Cell division is a highly complex process and cells possess a molecular machinery to ensure its successful completion. • A number of internal checkpoints exist to ensure that one phase is complete before the next commences. This is vital to ensure that DNA replication has been performed accurately and that cells do not divide before DNA replication is complete. • The various proteins and enzymes that carry out DNA replication, mitotic spindle formation are typically only present and active during the appropriate phases of the cycle.Cell Cycle Checkpoints• The cell cycle is regulated by the activity of a family of proteins called cyclindependent kinases (CDKs). • CDKs activate their target proteins by phosphorylation. • The activity of CDKs is regulated by a second family of proteins, the cyclins . • Transitions from one phase of the cycle to the next are initiated by rises in the levels of specific cyclins. Regulation of the Cell Cycle• Cyclin D triggers the transition from G0 to G1 at the initiation of the cell cycle. This occurs when stimulated by growth factors. • Errors during DNA replication rises in the levels of certain proteins called the CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) which prevent CDKs from triggering the next phase of cell division until the issue is resolved. • If the cells fail to correct and repair these errors, they will typically initiate apoptosis rather than permit the generation of improper daughter cells.Disturbances in the cell cycle is associated with cancer • Damage to the genes that encode proteins involved in the regulation of cellcycle progression is seen in many cancers. • In normal cells, hundreds of genes control the process of cell division. Normal growth requires a balance between the activity of those genes that promote cell proliferation and those that suppress it. It also relies on the activities of genes that signal when damaged cells should undergo apoptosis.• Cells become cancerous after mutations accumulate in the various genes that control cell proliferation. • According to research findings from the Cancer Genome Project, most cancer cells possess 60 or more mutations. • Different kinds of cancers have different mutational signatures. However, scientific comparison of multiple tumor types has revealed that certain genes are mutated in cancer cells more often than others.• Growth-promoting genes, such as the gene for the signaling protein Ras, are among those most commonly mutated in cancer cells, becoming super-active and producing cells that are too strongly stimulated by growth receptors. • Other cancer-related mutations inactivate the genes that suppress cell proliferation or those that signal the need for apoptosis. These genes, known as tumor suppressor genes, normally function like brakes on proliferation, and both copies within a cell must be mutated in order for uncontrolled division to occur. For example, many cancer cells carry two mutant copies of the gene that codes for p53, the “guardian of the genome,” a multifunctional protein that normally senses DNA damage and acts as a transcription factor for checkpoint control genes.• Many of the drugs used in the treatment of cancer affect particular stages within the cell cycle. • These drugs inhibit the rapid division of cancer cells, but since they are administered systemically there is often inhibition of other rapidly dividing cells, such as the cells of the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. • Thus anemia, a bleeding tendency and suppression of immunity may be clinically important side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Regulatory proteins of the cell cycle are targets for anticancer drugsTherapeutic interruption of the cell cycleApoptosis Definition Physiological cell death. Apoptosis is a physiological cellular process in which a defined and programmed sequence of intracellular events leads to the removal of a cell without the release of products harmful to surrounding cells.Significance of Apoptosis • The coexistence of apoptosis alongside mitosis within a cell population ensures a continuous renewal of cells, rendering a tissue more adaptable to environmental demands than one in which the cell population is static. • It is an energy-dependent, biochemically specific mode of cell death characterized by the enzymatic digestion of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, and the phagocytosis of the resultant breakdown products whilst still retained within the cell membrane.• p53 is a multifunctional protein which induces cell cycle arrest and initiates DNA damage repair. However, if this is unsuccessful, p53 can induce apoptosis via activation of proapoptotic members• The nucleus shrinks (pyknosis) and fragments (karyorrhexis). The cell shrinks, retaining an intact plasma membrane, but alteration of this membrane rapidly induces phagocytosis. • Dead cells not phagocytosed fragment into smaller membranebound apoptotic bodies. • There is no inflammatory reaction to apoptotic cells, probably because the cell membrane is intact","output":"Creating 30 multiple choice questions covering the extensive topics described would be quite detailed and beyond the capacity of a single response, but I can give you an example of some questions, and I suggest breaking down the content into smaller units to manage the workload. 1.

Aqui estão alguns dos principais motivos: 1. Degradação da mídia: O processo de gravação em um CD-R envolve mudanças químicas no corante da camada gravável. Ao longo do tempo, esse corante pode se degradar, especialmente se exposto a condições extremas de temperatura, umidade ou luz solar direta. Isso pode levar à perda de dados ou falha na leitura do disco. 2. Arranhões e danos físicos: A superfície do CD pode ser facilmente arranhada ou danificada, especialmente se não for manipulada ou armazenada corretamente. Arranhões na superfície de leitura podem impedir que o laser do leitor de CD leia os dados corretamente ou até mesmo tornar o CD completamente ilegível. 3. Oxidação: A camada reflexiva do CD, que geralmente é feita de alumínio, pode oxidar com o tempo. Isso pode ocorrer devido a pequenas falhas na camada protetora que recobre essa superfície metalizada. Quando é exposta ao ar, essa camada pode começar a se oxidar, o que interfere na refletividade do disco e, portanto, na sua capacidade de ser lido por um laser. 4. Exposição a produtos químicos: Alguns tipos de tintas, adesivos, solventes e outros produtos químicos podem reagir com as camadas de um CD-R, levando à deterioração da mídia. 5. Degradabilidade da cola: Em alguns CDs, a cola usada para unir as camadas do disco pode sofrer degradação, o que pode causar separação das camadas e falha na mídia. 6. Erros de gravação ou de finalização: Anomalias durante o processo de gravação ou falhas para finalizar corretamente um CD podem levar a erros de leitura, tornando-o parcial ou completamente inacessível. 7. Má qualidade da mídia: CDs-R de baixa qualidade estão mais suscetíveis à deterioração e falhas devido à utilização de materiais inferiores tanto na camada gravável quanto na camada reflexiva. Para aumentar a durabilidade de um CD gravado, é aconselhável armazenar os discos em locais frescos, secos e livres de luz direta do sol, além de manuseá-los com cuidado e utilizar capas ou estojos de proteção."},{"instruction":"I want you to make SOP for \\"How to take office meetings more effectively?\\"","output":"Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Conducting Effective Office Meetings Purpose: The purpose of this SOP is to establish and define the procedures and guidelines for conducting effective office meetings that are productive, time-efficient, and result in clear action items and decisions.

Покажите результаты изменения предоставления прав собственности в модели Эджуорта: Так как модель Эджуорта — это абстрактная экономическая модель, реальное визуальное представление изменений в правах собственности невозможно предоставить без специфических данных и контекста. Вместо этого я могу представить концептуальное описание изменения с помощью коробки Эджуорта, которая используется для анализа различных распределений ресурсов между двумя агентами. В коробке длина и ширина отражают всю доступность двух различных благ. Каждый угол представляет полное владение одним из благ одним из агентов. Кривые безразличия показывают комбинации благ, приносящие одинаковый уровень удовлетворения каждому агенту. При изменении прав собственности начальная точка (угол), с которой агенты начинают торг, смещается. Например, если одному агенту предоставляется больше прав на одно из благ, его начальная точка будет ближе к соответствующему углу коробки, что увеличивает его начальные ресурсы по сравнению с другим агентом. Это смещение может выглядеть следующим образом: 1. Ранее, если оба агента имели равные права собственности, начальная точка могла находиться в центре коробки Эджуорта. 2.

Одним из часто встречающихся образов в сновидениях являются листья. В зависимости от культурных традиций и личных ассоциаций каждого человека, листья могут иметь различные трактовки. Они могут быть символом роста, жизни и перемен или вести к мыслям о временности и увядании. Когда мы видим зеленые листья во сне, это часто символизирует новый этап в жизни или новые начинания. Зелень связывают с жизненной энергией, силой и здоровьем. Если листья распускаются прямо на глазах, это может предвещать бурный рост и развитие личных проектов или карьеры. Опавшие листья, в свою очередь, могут стать символом чего-то уходящего из жизни. Это может быть знаком окончания какого-то периода, потери или приближения осеннего периода жизни, который связан с размышлениями и подведением итогов. Такие сны могут побуждать нас к размышлению о том, что пора отпускать старое, для того чтобы освободить пространство для новых возможностей. Если сновидец видит листья на деревьях в лесу, это может быть символом гармонии с природой и окружающим миром. Лесным зеленым убранством порой символизируют умиротворение и единение с внутренним «я». В таких снах кроется посыл к тому, чтобы быть в балансе и находить спокойствие. Видение листопада может предвещать период изменений и выпадения из привычного ритма жизни. Это может быть время, когда старые привычки, взгляды или связи будут отпадать, давая место новым. Листья различных цветов тоже имеют свои значения. Яркие осенние листья могут напоминать о красоте процесса изменений и о том, что даже завершение какого-то этапа может быть красивым. Засохшие и увядающие листья предостерегают о возможном застое и потребности в оживлении какой-то сферы жизни. Сон о листьях, которые несет ветер, может быть призывом к гибкости и способности идти на компромиссы, а также указанием на непостоянство и переменчивость окружающих обстоятельств. Таким образом, листья во сне выступают в качестве символов, смысл которых может варьироваться в зависимости от контекста сновидения, их цвета, состояния и других сопутствующих деталей. Важно вспомнить и проанализировать все элементы сна, чтобы понять, какое именно послание несет вам ваш подсознательный ум. Сны с листьями могут быть напоминанием о прохождении через циклы жизни, об изменении, росте и возможности оставлять позади то, что больше не служит нашим целям."},{"instruction":"Оформи красиво в html и начни сразу с тега <p>","output":"\`\`\`html <p>Сны могут служить зеркалом нашего внутреннего мира, отображая скрытые желания, страхи и предчувствия.

They filter your blood and get rid of waste products. When doctors talk about renal function, they're usually referring to how well your kidneys are doing their job. One way to measure this is by looking at your Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which estimates how much blood your kidneys are filtering every minute. Now, your kidneys are pretty amazing and they have a lot of backup power – so much so that you can lose quite a bit of their filtering ability without even noticing. It's only when your kidney function drops to less than 30% of what's considered normal that you might start feeling sick. This is because your kidneys have a high \\"reserve,\\" meaning they can still manage their essential functions even when they're not at full strength. Even when your kidneys aren't functioning at more than 30% of their usual capacity, you might not feel any symptoms. But, doctors can start to see signs of kidney strain in your blood tests. If the kidney function gets worse, here are some issues you might experience, particularly due to the buildup of waste products in the body – we call this \\"uremic toxins\\": 1. **Mouth problems:** You might notice your breath smells a bit like ammonia and that there's a bad taste in your mouth. Your mouth could become sore, you might experience bleeding more easily due to platelet dysfunction (platelets help your blood to clot), and your mouth and tongue might feel very dry. 2. **Esophagus:** You could develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which means stomach acid is irritating the tube that connects your mouth and your stomach, leading to heartburn and discomfort. 3. **Diaphragm:** This is the muscle that helps you breathe. Uremic toxins can cause you to get hiccups. 4. **Stomach problems:** You might have gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. This can cause bleeding and even lead to the stomach wall breaking down (perforation). 5. **Liver issues:** If you are receiving dialysis (a treatment for kidney failure), you might be at risk of hepatitis, which is an inflammation of the liver. 6. **Intestinal issues:** Constipation can be an issue, and in later stages, you might develop a severe form of diarrhea due to urea (a waste product) depositing in the colon. The takeaway here is that kidney problems can affect your body in a lot of ways because the kidneys' job – flushing out toxins – is super important. And it's also why issues might not be obvious until a significant amount of kidney function is lost."},{"instruction":"test me on this : Symptoms typically do not manifest until renal function (GFR) declines to 30% of normal due to the high reserve of the kidneys. **More than 30% of normal GFR:** - Biochemical evidence of renal failure may be observed, but patients are generally still asymptomatic. - **1.

Обратите внимание, что в Windows пути к дискам обычно заканчиваются на двоеточие и обратный слэш, \`/\` или \`\`. В примере выше используется \`/\`, но так как библиотека \`std::filesystem\` корректно обрабатывает оба типа слэшей, это не должно вызвать проблем в кросс-платформенных операциях. Также возможно, что в некоторых случаях вам может понадобиться код для определения путей ко всем доступным дискам на Windows, но для этого потребуются Windows API или системные вызовы, которые выходят за рамки стандартной библиотеки C++."},{"instruction":"В каких случаях стоит использовать unique_ptr, share_ptr, weak_ptr? c++","output":"\`std::unique_ptr\`, \`std::shared_ptr\` и \`std::weak_ptr\` являются умными указателями из стандартной библиотеки C++ и используются для управления динамически выделенной памятью. Каждый из этих типов имеет своё предназначение в зависимости от семантики владения ресурсом: 1. **\`std::unique_ptr\`** - это умный указатель, который обеспечивает исключительное (уникальное) владение ресурсом. Это означает, что в каждый момент времени только один \`std::unique_ptr\` может владеть данным ресурсом (выделенной памятью). Используйте \`std::unique_ptr\` когда: - Вам нужно гарантировать, что память будет освобождена, когда указатель выйдет из области видимости или будет удалён. - У вас есть ресурс, который должен принадлежать только одному владельцу, и вы хотите предотвратить его неявное копирование или передачу. - Вам нужен легковесный умный указатель без накладных расходов на подсчёт ссылок, которые есть у \`std::shared_ptr\`. 2. **\`std::shared_ptr\`** - это умный указатель, который обеспечивает совместное владение ресурсом. Несколько \`std::shared_ptr\` могут одновременно владеть одним и тем же ресурсом. Когда последний \`std::shared_ptr\`, владеющий ресурсом, уничтожается или отказывается от владения, ресурс освобождается. Используйте \`std::shared_ptr\` когда: - Вам нужно несколько владельцев одного и того же ресурса. - Вам нужно гарантировать, что ресурс не будет освобожден, пока хотя бы один владелец ещё жив. - Вы используете библиотеку или фреймворк, который требует использование \`std::shared_ptr\` (например, некоторые системы сообщений или задач). 3. **\`std::weak_ptr\`** - это умный указатель, который не владеет ресурсом, но может наблюдать за ним и доступ к которому может быть получен посредством \`std::shared_ptr\`. Это предотвращает образование циклических ссылок, которые могут препятствовать освобождению памяти при использовании \`std::shared_ptr\`. Используйте \`std::weak_ptr\` когда: - Вам нужно временно наблюдать за ресурсом или иметь к нему доступ без принятия ответственности за его существование. - Вы хотите избежать циклических ссылок, например, в структурах данных, где элементы взаимно ссылаются друг на друга. Всегда выбирайте подходящий умный указатель в зависимости от требований к владению и жизненному циклу объектов, который вы хотите обеспечить. Корректное использование умных указателей помогает предотвратить утечки памяти и делает код более безопасным и предсказуемым."},{"instruction":"vector<char>& get_alphabet() { vector<char> t = make_unique<vector<char>>; .... } Почему фрагмент кода не будет работать? И вообще нужно и можно ли выделять память динамически для контейнеров в c++","output":"Фрагмент кода, который вы предоставили, содержит несколько ошибок, из-за которых он не будет работать: 1. Вы пытаетесь возвратить ссылку на локальный объект \`vector<char>\`. Локальный объект будет уничтожен по выходу из функции, и ссылка на него станет недействительной. Это приведет к неопределённому поведению, если попытаться использовать возвращаемую ссылку. 2. В вызове \`make_unique<vector<char>>\` отсутствуют круглые скобки \`()\`, необходимые для вызова конструктора. Кроме того, \`std::make_unique\` используется для создания \`std::unique_ptr\`, а не для прямого создания объектов. Чтобы исправить код, вы можете возвратить объект-контейнер напрямую (т.е., по значению), что в современных компиляторах должно обеспечить перемещение контейнера вместо копирования благодаря Return Value Optimization (RVO) или правилу перемещения при возврате: \`\`\`cpp #include <vector> std::vector<char> get_alphabet() { std::vector<char> t; // Создаем вектор на стеке. // Заполнение вектора буквами алфавита... // t.emplace_back('a'); // Например так return t; // Возвращает вектор по значению } \`\`\` Этот код будет эффективен в плане производительности и корректен, поскольку возвращается объект \`vector\` по значению, и современные компиляторы C++ умеют оптимизировать такое возвращение, чтобы не происходило лишнего копирования объекта. Относительно второго вопроса: в общем случае нет необходимости динамически выделять память для стандартных контейнеров STL, таких как \`std::vector\`, \`std::list\`, \`std::map\` и т. д., так как они уже самостоятельно управляют своей памятью в куче. Эксплицитное создание контейнера при помощи \`std::make_unique\` или \`new\` может быть полезно в специфических ситуациях, когда требуется долгосрочное владение данными или управление временем жизни объекта вручную, но это относительно редкое требование."},{"instruction":"Как инициализировать vector<char> на куче в C++: vector<char>* t =...","output":"Если вы хотите инициализировать \`std::vector<char>\` на куче в C++, вы можете воспользоваться оператором \`new\`, который создаст объект в динамической памяти (на куче) и вернёт указатель на него: \`\`\`cpp #include <vector> int main() { std::vector<char>* t = new std::vector<char>; // теперь можно использовать вектор через указатель t->push_back('a'); t->push_back('b'); t->push_back('c'); // ... // не забудьте освободить память после использования delete t; } \`\`\` Тем не менее, служебные указатели (в частности, голые указатели) для динамического выделения памяти под стандартные контейнеры, как правило, не рекомендуются, поскольку они требуют ручного управления памятью (\`delete\`) и повышают риск утечек памяти и других ошибок, связанных с ресурсами. Вместо этого часто предпочтительнее использовать умные указатели, такие как \`std::unique_ptr\` или \`std::shared_ptr\`, которые автоматически освободят память при удалении. Пример с \`std::unique_ptr\`: \`\`\`cpp #include <vector> #include <memory> int main() { std::unique_ptr<std::vector<char>> t = std::make_unique<std::vector<char>>(); t->push_back('a'); t->push_back('b'); t->push_back('c'); // ... // Память будет автоматически освобождена, когда unique_ptr уничтожится // Нет необходимости в явном вызове delete } \`\`\` Оператор \`new\` и умные указатели полезны, если вам действительно необходимо контролировать время жизни объекта в динамической памяти.

Ошибка происходит в следующей части кода: \`\`\`cpp cout << v.get()[0] << endl; \`\`\` \`std::unique_ptr::get()\` возвращает обычный указатель на управляемый объект. В данном случае это \`vector<char>*\`. Когда вы пытаетесь использовать оператор \`[]\` с результатом метода \`get()\`, вы на самом деле пытаетесь применить его к указателю на \`std::vector\` (а не к элементам самого вектора), что неправильно и приводит к ошибке. Для доступа к элементам вектора, на который указывает \`std::unique_ptr\`, вам следует использовать оператор \`->\`, чтобы вызвать методы объекта \`std::vector\`, включая оператор \`[]\`, над самим вектором. Вот правильно написанная строчка: \`\`\`cpp cout << (*v)[0] << endl; // Разыменовываем unique_ptr и получаем доступ к первому элементу вектора // или cout << v->at(0) << endl; // Используем метод at для доступа к элементу вектора с проверкой границ \`\`\` Отметим, что если вы используете \`push_back\`, вам не обязательно заранее резервировать память с помощью \`reserve\`, так как \`push_back\` сам может увеличить вместимость вектора, когда это необходимо. Однако если вы заранее знаете примерное количество элементов, которые будете добавлять, \`reserve\` может улучшить производительность, минимизируя количество реаллокаций. Теперь весь исправленный код будет выглядеть так: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <memory> #include <vector> using namespace std; unique_ptr<vector<char>> get_alphabet() { unique_ptr<vector<char>> v = make_unique<vector<char>>(); // v->reserve(30); // Опционально: запись можно упустить for (char i = 'A'; i <= 'Z'; ++i) { v->push_back(i); //int to char no need explicit cast } // Для демонстрации доступа к элементам вектора через unique_ptr for (size_t i = 0; i < v->size(); ++i) { cout << (*v)[i] << endl; } return v; } int main() { auto alphabet = get_alphabet(); // ... использование alphabet } \`\`\` Помните, что при возврате \`std::unique_ptr\` из функции не произойдет копирования владения, благодаря механизму перемещения в C++.

Сначала, \`v.get()->reserve(30);\`: метод \`get()\` возвращает обычный указатель на объект. Вызов \`get()\` излишен, поскольку у \`unique_ptr\` есть перегруженный оператор \`->\`, позволяющий вызывать методы напрямую: \`\`\`cpp v->reserve(30); \`\`\` 2. В цикле \`for\` вы используете магическое число \`65\`, которое соответствует символу \`'A'\` в ASCII. Чтобы улучшить понимание кода, вы можете использовать символьный литерал напрямую: \`\`\`cpp for (char ch = 'A'; ch <= 'Z'; ++ch) { v->push_back(ch); } \`\`\` Таким образом, явное приведение типа \`static_cast<char>(i)\` больше не требуется, и код становится более понятным. 3. Вывод элемента вектора \`(v.get())[i-65]\` можно упростить, разыменовав \`unique_ptr\`, как было показано ранее: \`\`\`cpp cout << (*v)[i - 'A'] << endl; \`\`\` 4. Цикл \`for\` нуждается в условии продолжения работы. Поэтому его условие можно включить напрямую в определение цикла вместо использования бесконечного цикла с \`break\`. 5. Комментарии о \`shared_ptr\` нужно удалить, они создают путаницу, так как в контексте функции используются \`unique_ptr\`. После учёта этих пунктов, ваша функция будет выглядеть следующим образом: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <memory> #include <vector> std::unique_ptr<std::vector<char>> get_alphabet() { auto v = std::make_unique<std::vector<char>>(); v->reserve(26); for (char ch = 'A'; ch <= 'Z'; ++ch) { v->push_back(ch); std::cout << (*v)[ch - 'A'] << std::endl; // Доступ к элементу вектора } return v; } \`\`\` Эта функция теперь корректно создаёт \`std::unique_ptr<std::vector<char>>\`, заполняет его буквами латинского алфавита и печатает их прямо в цикле, затем возвращает указатель. Функция возвращает \`unique_ptr\` на вектор, что позволяет безопасно передать владение данными вызывающему коду.

В строке \`path mask = \\":/\\";\` создаётся переменная \`mask\`, которая не используется в дальнейшем. Вы наверно хотели использовать этот \`mask\` при формировании пути диска \`path t = (a + \\":/\\");\`. 3. Следует использовать оператор \`std::string::operator+\`, чтобы присоединить \`\\":\\"\` и \`\\"/\\"\` к символу диска (который должен быть преобразован в строку). 4. При создании объекта \`std::filesystem::path\`, его нужно инициализировать корректной строкой представления пути, а не выражением \`(a + \\":/\\")\`, которое приведет к сложению \`char\` и \`const char[]\`, что не корректно. 5. Все заинклуденные и используемые пространства имён нужно определить в начале файла. Исправленный код функции может выглядеть следующим образом: \`\`\`cpp #include <memory> #include <vector> #include <filesystem> #include <iostream> using std::vector; using std::unique_ptr; using std::make_unique; using std::filesystem::path; using std::filesystem::exists; unique_ptr<vector<path>> get_disks(vector<char>& alphabet) { auto v = make_unique<vector<path>>(); v->reserve(30); for (auto& a : alphabet) { // Создаем путь к диску, преобразуя символ в строку path t = std::string(1, a) + \\":/\\"; // Проверяем существование пути и добавляем в вектор, если такой путь существует if (exists(t)) v->push_back(t); } return v; } \`\`\` В этой функции \`vector<char>& alphabet\` предположительно содержит список букв, которые могут обозначать диски (например, 'C', 'D', 'E' и т.д.). Для каждого символа из \`alphabet\` создается путь и проверяется на существование. Если путь существует, он добавляется в вектор \`unique_ptr<vector<path>>\`.

В стандартной библиотеке \`std::filesystem\` есть два типа итераторов: \`directory_iterator\` и \`recursive_directory_iterator\`. Последний по умолчанию выбрасывает исключение при возникновении ошибок обхода, например, из-за отсутствия прав доступа. Чтобы функция обхода работала без ошибок, вы можете отловить исключения и продолжить обход, игнорируя папки, к которым нет доступа.

Также следует учитывать, что для доступа к защищённым системным папкам может потребоваться запуск вашего приложения от имени администратора (например, запуск через \\"Запустить от имени администратора\\" в контекстном меню или настройка манифеста для включения UAC (User Account Control) в Windows)."},{"instruction":"Данная функция всё ещё работает не корректно из-за мусорной корзины в папке C:","output":"В операционной системе Windows, мусорная корзина (Recycle Bin) является специальной системной папкой, имеющей уникальную структуру и ограничения доступа.

Если во время рекурсивного обхода директории программа сталкивается с такими системными папками и не может прочитать их содержимое, она может генерировать исключение типа \`std::filesystem::filesystem_error\`. Для решения этой проблемы вы можете использовать технику обработки исключений, как показано в предыдущем ответе, и пропускать папки, к которым нет доступа. Если проблема именно в мусорной корзине (или других системных папках), которую вы хотите исключить из процесса обхода, вы можете добавить проверку на такие папки и пропустить их: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <filesystem> namespace fs = std::filesystem; void recursive_traversal(const fs::path& root) { std::cout << \\"Starting traversal from: \\" << root << std::endl; if (!fs::exists(root) || !fs::is_directory(root)) { std::cerr << \\"Error: Путь не существует или это не директория.\\" << std::endl; return; } fs::recursive_directory_iterator it(root), end; while (it != end) { try { const auto& entry = *it; const auto& path = entry.path(); // Пропустить специальные папки, такие как мусорная корзина if (path.filename() == \\"Recycle.Bin\\") { it.disable_recursion_pending(); ++it; continue; } // Вывести текущий путь std::cout << path << std::endl; ++it; } catch (const fs::filesystem_error& e) { std::cerr << \\"Error: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; // Пропустить текущую папку при ошибке и продолжить обход it.disable_recursion_pending(); ++it; } } } int main() { fs::path root_path = \\"C:/\\"; recursive_traversal(root_path); return 0; } \`\`\` В этом коде перед выводом пути мы проверяем, не является ли текущий элемент итератора специальной системной папкой, например, мусорной корзиной, и если это так, мы пропускаем её.

Descrivi il problema: A volte, i sintomi che noti possono indicare direttamente la causa del problema. Fammi sapere esattamente cosa sta succedendo. Ad esempio, se c'è una perdita di potenza, rumori insoliti, spie del cruscotto accese, ecc. 2. Spie del cruscotto: Qualsiasi spia del cruscotto illuminata? Se hai una spia del motore (check engine light) accesa, un lettore OBD-II può essere collegato al veicolo per leggere i codici di errore memorizzati, i quali possono fornire indicazioni su dove sia il problema. 3. Circonstanze specifiche: Fa il problema si verifica sempre o solo sotto specifiche condizioni (freddo, caldo, durante l'accelerazione, a velocità costante, ecc.)? 4.

Se l'apertura del baule non funziona né con il keyless né con il telecomando ma non ci sono spie di avvertimento nel cruscotto, il problema potrebbe essere circoscritto al sistema di apertura del baule o ai dispositivi di accesso remoto. Un assorbimento di corrente di circa 2 ampere con la vettura spenta indica un chiaro problema di \\"drenaggio\\" della batteria, ovvero un consumo elettrico che persiste anche quando la vettura è spenta. Questo può portare a scaricare la batteria inaspettatamente. Ecco alcuni passaggi di diagnosi che potresti considerare: 1. Controlla la batteria e i collegamenti: Assicurati che la batteria sia in buone condizioni e che tutti i collegamenti, inclusi quelli della massa, siano puliti, fissati e liberi da corrosione. 2. Fusibili: Controlla il pannello dei fusibili per vedere se c'è qualche fusibile legato al sistema di chiusura del baule che è bruciato o presenti malfunzionamenti. 3. Interruttore del baule: Il problema potrebbe originarsi dall'interruttore del baule stesso. Spesso sono presenti sensori o interruttori che possono guastarsi e non rispondere ai comandi. 4. Sistema keyless e il telecomando: Se disponi di un secondo telecomando, prova ad usarlo per escludere un problema con il telecomando principale. Se il problema persiste con entrambi i telecomandi, potrebbe esserci un difetto nel ricevitore keyless o nel sistema di apertura centralizzato. 5. Relè e attuatori: Un relè guasto o un attuatore del baule (solenoide) potrebbe essere la causa dell'inabilità di aprire il baule. Questi componenti sono spesso responsabili dell'azione meccanica di sblocco. 6. Test del parasitario: Considera di eseguire un test di drenaggio della batteria. Disconnetti un terminale della batteria e collega un amperometro in serie per misurare l'assorbimento di corrente. Successivamente, inizia a rimuovere fusibili uno per uno mentre monitori l'amperometro. Quando l'assorbimento di corrente cala improvvisamente, hai individuato il circuito che causa il drenaggio. Dopodiché, puoi concentrarti su quel circuito e ispezionare componenti specifici. Per procedere con una diagnosi più approfondita potrebbe essere necessario utilizzare strumenti diagnostici specifici o fare affidamento sull'esperienza di un tecnico qualificato. Nel caso in cui non ti senti sicuro di procedere con queste verifiche o se i problemi persistono, il mio consiglio è di rivolgerti a un meccanico o a un'officina autorizzata Renault per un controllo professionale."},{"instruction":"escludi il punto 4 non funziona ne da key less che da tasto telecomando, provato con 2 telecomandi e cambiato pile .problema persiste e scarica la bateria dell'auto","output":"Se hai escluso il problema con entrambi i telecomandi e la sostituzione delle pile non ha risolto il problema, allora è probabile che il difetto sia altrove nel sistema. Ecco alcuni altri passaggi da considerare: 1. **Verifica il sistema di chiusura centralizzata:** Un problema con la chiusura centralizzata potrebbe influire sulla funzionalità di apertura del baule. Verifica che tutte le porte si chiudano e si aprano correttamente con i comandi a distanza. 2. **Ispeziona il cablaggio e i connettori:** A volte, i problemi possono derivare da un cablaggio danneggiato, fusibili guasti, o connettori allentati o ossidati, specialmente nei passaggi tra il telaietto e il portellone del bagagliaio, dove i cavi possono flettersi e rompersi frequentemente. 3. **Analisi più approfondita dell'attuatore del baule:** Se l'attuatore del baule (il meccanismo che fisicamente sblocca il baule) è guasto o bloccato, non risponderà ai comandi. Questo potrebbe anche causare un elevato assorbimento di corrente se rimane in corto circuito o si attiva in modo inappropriato. 4. **Controllo dell'elettronica di bordo:** Se il tuo veicolo è dotato di un sistema di diagnostica elettronico, un tecnico potrebbe collegare un dispositivo OBD-II per verificare se ci sono codici di errore relativi al sistema di chiusura del baule. 5. **Esame del Modulo di Controllo Carrozzeria (BCM):** In alcuni casi, il BCM, che controlla varie funzioni elettroniche tra cui le luci, il sistema di chiusura centralizzata e l'apertura del portaoggetti, può malfunzionare e causare problemi. L'assorbimento di corrente di 2 ampere con il veicolo spento è decisamente elevato e indica che c'è un componente che sta drenando la batteria. Se non riesci a identificare il circuito o il componente responsabile, può essere necessario un'ispezione da parte di un meccanico qualificato. Un approccio metodico consiste nel misurare l'assorbimento di corrente mentre sistematicamente si disconnettono componenti e circuiti fino a quando non si verifica una caduta significativa nell'assorbimento. Questo test può essere complesso e potrebbe richiedere l'esperienza di un professionista e attrezzi specializzati."},{"instruction":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the first four Terminator movies and the Terminator TV series, Terminator: the Sarah Connor Chronicles, the Elfen Lied [Elfish Song/Elvish Song |Elfen Lied|] manga and anime franchise, the Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- [Lunar Princess -A piece of blue glass moon- |Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-|] visual novel, the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, manga, anime and video game franchise and its [Fate/Stay Night’s] spin off manga, anime, and video game franchise, Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya, the Bleach manga, anime and light novel franchise, the Bakemonogatari light novel, anime, video game and manga franchise, the Cardcaptor Sakura manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Guyver [Out of Control |Guyver|] manga, anime and live action movie franchise, the first two Resident Evil movies and the Resident Evil novels, the Kamen Rider 555 tokukatsu live action series, in which after the main girl of the Terminator franchise, the brown-haired, blue-eyed, calm, reserved and somewhat shy and reserved but also headstrong and determined Scottish-German American Sarah Jeanette Connor [Terminator] gives birth to her [Sarah’s] son, the black-haired, blue-eyed John Connor [Terminator] in Mexico, who [John] will [what John will do] lead mankind in a near hopeless war against the forces of rouge American Automated Defence Network with self awareness and a supposedly genocidal intent towards humanity, Project TITAN [Terminator], [PROJECT TITAN] better known as “Skynet” [Terminator] in the far future, he [newborn John] is [newborn John] mixed up with another child and [newborn John] subsequently taken by the prominent side branch of the Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the ex-samurai clan and Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon] as the son of its [the Tōno’s] current clan head, the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, brown-haired and blue-eyed calm and soft-spoken Tōno Makihisa [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] as Makihisa’s son, Tōno Shiki [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] when Makihisa and his [Makihisa’s] wife return to Japan, which [Japan in this story] reclaimed both the Korean peninusla and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands along with Sahlakin Island and the Kurils after the KMT-ruled Nationalist China in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since it [Nationalist China] lost the Chinese Civil War to the CCP-controlled PRC in 1947, [Nationalist China in this story] collapsed with Chiang Kai Shek’s death on 5 April 1975, the Minjung Movement in the Fourth Republic of Korea in South Korea collapsed the Fourth Republic and spread to the Soviet satelite state of the WPK-ruled Democratic People’s Republic of Korea occupying North Korea, and the failed coup by hardliner elements of the Soviet Army in the Russian Federation in 1991 lead to a Second Russian Civil War before John’s, now Shiki’s birth.

Shiki is [Shiki] clueless about who he [Shiki] really is [John Connor] and [Shiki] really thinks that he [Shiki] is Makihisa’s biological son [Shiki’s view of himself |Shiki|] until a T-1000 polymorphic liquid metal Terminator [Terminator] infiltrator cyborg unit sent back by Skynet just before its [Skynet’s] defeat in the Future War [Terminator Salvation, Terminator 2 books and comics, Terminator 3 books and comics, Terminator Salvation books and comics] tries to kill him [Shiki] when he [Shiki] is [Shiki] on vacation in California under the alias of Jeremy Freeple [Ninja High School] when he [Shiki] is only ten years old before [Shiki] being [Shiki] saved by a T-850 humanoid infiltrator Terminator model reprogammed by his [Shiki’s] future true self [resistance leader John] and [the T-850] sent back in time to protect him [Shiki], starting the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. However, Miles Dyson [Terminator], the genius African-American computer engineer and neural network scientist who is actually of Hungarian-German descent, his [Miles’] ancestors in fact having been brought to America by the post-WW2 Operation Paperclip program despite him [Miles] being “black”, who [Miles] helped create Skynet [Terminator] before the Future War that John won in the post-apocalyptic future, [Miles in this fanfic] actually survives the events of Terminator 2 in this fanfic due to him [Miles] working on on the prototype of Skynet, which [the Skynet prototype] is [the Skynet prototype] in US-NORAD under the oversight of [Miles’] boss on paper, high ranking US Air Force officer Lieutenant General Robert Brewster [Terminator], although this is false as Cyberdyne Systems [Terminator franchise], the tech subsidary [Cyberdyne] of the major American megaconglomete Omni Consumer Products [Robocop], now [OCP] owned by [OCP's] current owner, the Tōno clan’s corporate front, the Japanese corporate giant Kanemitsu Zaibatsu [Robocop franchise], [Cyberdyne Systems] is [Cyberdyne Systems] effectively the Tōno clan’s means of getting into the American computing, high technology and digital market [Cyberdyne Systems] without gathering the attention of the American masses or the intelligence community. Miles being there means he [Miles] is [Miles] able to talk to Skynet when it [Skynet] is [Skynet] activated and [Skynet] online, giving it [Skynet] a sense of purpose and inadvertently preventing Judgement Day [Terminator] in the current present day of this story, without Shiki, the T-850 or Sarah, who [Sarah] was [Sarah] rescued from the concentration camp built by the Democrat Party and it’s [the Democrat Party’s] street arm, the infamous KKK as a earlier version of the Soviet gulag for civil rights activists, communists and any other subversives during the regime of the world’s first modern fascist dictator and American despot from 1912-1919, failed academic turned ruthless tyrant Woodrow Wilson, disguised [the concentration camp] as a psychriatic hospital, [Sarah being held at a concentration camp] after [Sarah] being [Sarah] being discovered by local police in Mexico after [Sarah] giving birth to John and [Sarah] being taken back to America where she [Sarah] was [Sarah] given a kangaroo trial staffed with KKK members and members of the American intelligence and military community and [Sarah] subsequently imprisoned, [Sarah being |Sarah| rescued from the concentration camp] by the T-850 on the request of young present John, [the T-850, Sarah and John] being aware of this [Judgement Day not happening in this story's current present day due to Miles being present at the activation of the prototype of Skynet]. The T-850 still sacrifices itself [the T-850] to defeat the T-1000 by [the T-850] dropping itself [the T-850] and the T-1000 in molten metal at a steel works, but Shiki returns to Japan after the events of Terminator 2 as a coalition of Jamaican drug cartels, organized crime groups and terrorist organizations within the United States along with their Latin American counterparts, as well as the Mishpuka [family, the Russian Jewish mafia |Mishpuka|, otherwise known as the Russian mafia] are [the Jamaican, Latin American and Russian Jewish criminal organizations] out for his [Shiki's] head after the T-1000 put a contract on his [Shiki's] head. When he [Shiki] returns home [to the Tōno mansion in Kyoto] from California after the events of Terminator 2, to the joy, happiness and relief of his [Shiki’s] adoptive younger sister, the black-haired, blue-eyed, cute and extremely beautiful, tall, petite and slender but secretly rather buxom, carefully-raised, strict and prideful but also somewhat shy, reserved and lacking in self-confidence Tōno Akiha [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and the current maids of the Tōno house whom [the current maids of the Tōno house] Shiki and Akiha see as their [Shiki’s and Akiha’s] onee-san [older sister/s |onee-san|], the red-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also very buxom, bright and cheerful, very responsible, extremely intelligent and very maternal Fujou “Ako” Kohaku [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and her [Kohaku’s] younger twin who shares her [Kohaku’s] red hair and [Kohaku’s] physical build but [Kohaku’s younger twin] has blue eyes, the publicly stern but privately kind, loving and emotional, track star and accomplished kendoka [one who practices kendo |kendoka|] Fujou “Riko” Hisui [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], he [Shiki] learns that his [Shiki's] adoptive father [Makihisa] whom [Makihisa] he [Shiki] will always consider his [Shiki's] real father [Makihisa] has died and that a distant relative of Makihisa, and current head of the long-decimated ex-Samurai clan, now Japanese noble family of scientists, mathematicians and inventors now called the Emiya clan [Fate/Stay Night], the tall, slender and lean but also compact and muscular, black-haired and blue-eyed brooding but also ruthless, conflicted, calculating, stoic, and cold-blooded killer feared in the global magical world for being an assassin and one-man army using mostly modified conventional non-magical human weapons, Emiya Kiritsugu [Fate/Stay Night], [Kiritsugu] will [Kiritsugu] become the new Tōno clan head [Kiritsugu] with Akiha becoming his [Kiritsugu's] adoptive daughter [Akiha's current status]. Due to a secret treaty embedded within Makihisa's will however, Shiki is instead passed off to the Tōno branch family of the Arimas [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-], [Shiki] becoming the legal foster son of the current Arima family head, Arima Fumio [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] and his [Fumio's] wife Keiko [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-] as well as the legal foster older brother of their [Fumio's and Keiko's] daughter, the short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and rather buxom for her age, openly headstrong and brutally honest but actually quite shy and reserved with an immense crush on Shiki half-Han Chinese martial arts student Arima Miyako [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-]. Shiki doesn't tell his [Shiki's] family [Akiha, Ako and Riko] nor the Arimas [Fumio, Keiko and Miyako] what really happened to him [Shiki] in California and Akiha doesn't tell her [Akiha's] new parents, Kiritsugu and his [Kiritsugu's] wife and current head of the now-decimated, immensely wealthy and influential German noble house said to be the real royal family of the UK both in the magical and non-magical worlds and holding tremendous political and economic influence throught the globe, the House of Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night], the silver-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, cold and aloof but also overly carefree and ditzy Irisivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night] nor their [Kiritsugu's and Irisivel's] biological daughters and thus the princesses of the House of Einzbern, the silver-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, somewhat mentally unstable and cold-blooded but cheerful and outgoing, upbeat, friendly, playful and mischevious Illyasivel von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] and her [Illyasivel's] younger twin sister, the white-rose hued-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but later starting from pre-teen age secretly curvy and buxom, openly calm, nonchalant, devious, manipulative and very observant, brazen and unrestrained and also very lecherous and perverted but also secretly caring, sweet, timid and vunerable Chloe von Einzbern [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] in part due to her [Akiha] being [Akiha] kidnapped by the now-centuries old head of the Matou clan of magi, the aged and decrypt Matou Zouken [Fate/Stay Night] and [Akiha] made into the Matou clan heiress [Akiha] via a blood adoption potion and [Akiha] having the [Matou] clan's Crest Worms [Fate/Stay Night] implanted within her [Akiha] just after Makihisa's death and sometime before Shiki returned from California, [Akiha's kidnapping and subsequent forced inheritance of the Matou bloodline by Zouken] traumatising her [Akiha] even though Kiritsugu was [Kiritsugu] able to track her [Kiritsugu] down and [Kiritsugu] save her [Akiha] before [Kiritsugu] killing the worm man [Zouken] afterwards just before Shiki returned from California. As a result, she [Akiha] started wearing traditional Japanese clothing at home and [Akiha] became quite good at housework and cooking, to the surprise of her [Akiha's] older twin sister and thus another of Shiki's younger adoptive sisters, the perceptive, serious, resourceful, and very competitive, highly intelligent and academically gifted, publicly prim and proper but secretly loud, shrewd, stingy, hot-blooded, and bossy along with being caring and big sisterly, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom magical and martial arts prodigy Karen [Bakemonogatari], who [Karen] publicly goes by the name Tōsaka Rin [Fate/Stay Night] to honor her [Karen's] and Akiha's shared biological mother who [Karen's and Akiha's shared biological mother] was a member of the immensely wealthy and influential both in the magical and non-magical worlds, Tōsaka clan [Fate/Stay Night] when she [Karen/Rin] returns from the premier magical institution in the world, the London-based Clocktower [Fate/Stay Night] to [Karin/Rin] visit her [Karin's/Rin's] family [the Tōnos]. Shiki returns to the Tōno mansion when he [Shiki] is 16, to the unhappiness of Miyako who [Miyako] has no idea about the truth surrounding their [the Arima's] wide family [the Tōnos] and [Miyako] begins trying out some of the cultivation techniques and Japanese and martial arts techniques she [Miyako] sees in her [Miyako's] family's [the Arimas'] dojo on some of Tokyo's native Japanese local and Chinese and Russian immigrant criminal low life community, which gets even worse when she [Miyako] accidentally releases the sentinent magic cards known as Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura] from her [Miyako's] family's [the Arima's] basement and [Miyako] is chosen by the guardian of the Cards, Cerebeus [Cardcaptor Sakura] to retrieve and seal away the now scattered Cards, [Miyako] unwittingly being known as a fearsome vigilante whom [Miyako's vigilante persona] patrols the streets of Tokyo looking for criminals to hunt, although she [Miyako] is of course clueless about this and [Miyako] continues searching for both the Clow Cards and Shiki at the same time, [Miyako] eventually finding all of the Clow Cards with Akiha's help and [Miyako] becoming the guardian [Miyako] of the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. [Shiki] of course being unaware that Judgement Day has [Judgement Day] been averted, [Shiki] continues to [Shiki] keep in secret contact with his [Shiki's] real mother [Sarah] and members of the Resistance [Terminator] against Skynet who have time traveled to the current present in the hopes of stopping Judgement Day. He [Shiki] also learns that Illya and Chloe are [Illya and Chloe] in fact magical girls [Illya and Chloe] using the power of the Class Cards [ Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] to fight against monsters that [the monsters] transform into Class Cards when [the monsters are] killed, with Karen/Rin and Akiha acting as their [Illya's and Chloe's] mentors, although he [Shiki] chooses to [Shiki] keep this to himself [Shiki]. Umbrella Corporation [Resident Evil] replaces Smart Brain [Kamen Rider 555], Chronus Corporation [Guyver] and CELL [Crysis], [Umbrella Corporation] developing the Nanosuit 1.0 and 2.0 as combat-ready versions of the Rider Gears [Kamen Rider 555] with both the Rider Gears and Nanosuits having the capabilities and built-in weapons of the Guyver bio-boosted armor [Guyver] in addition to their [the Rider Gears' and the Nanosuits' both 1.0 and 2.0's] canon capabilities. The soul-eating undead ghosts known as Hollows [Bleach] and the undead evolutions of humanity known as Orphenoch [Kamen Rider 555] are the same thing in this story, [the Hollows] also replacing the mutated humans known as Zoanoids [Guyver]. Like the Zoanoids openly controlling the Chronus Corporation in canon Guyver and the Orphenoch secretly controlling Smart Brain in canon Kamen Rider 555, the Hollows covertly control Umbrella Corporation in this fic, with even Umbrella's top-secret BOW producing division of its [Umbrella's] secret defence contractor, arms manufacturing and arms dealing sector itself being a front for the production of Hollows Thus X-Day [Guyver] is an attempt by the Umbrella Corporation to convert most of humanity into Hollows and genocide the remaining pure humans left and also to conquer the world using the Great War as a cover, which [X-Day] resulted in Skynet seizing control of the world's military facilities and [Skynet] initiating the nuclear holocaust [Judgement Day] in an attempt to wipe out this threat [the Hollows and Umbrella Corp], Skynet viewing future John as an enemy due to him [future John] being infected with Umbrella's zombie creating B.O.W virus, the T-virus [Resident Evil] and [future John] being surrounded by Chronus puppets and lackeys both human and Hollow posing as Resistance [Terminator] members who [the Chronus agents surrounding future John] feed him [future John] lies and deceptions about what really happened during Judgement Day, making a peace settlement between it [Skynet] and the Resistance to finish off Umbrella, although of course Shiki and his [Shiki's] real mother [Sarah] don't know that and [Shiki and Sarah] assume that Skynet initated Judgement Day [Terminator] and the subsequent Future War out of hatred for humanity. Also the black-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender but also lean and muscular ordinary Japanese young boy Orimura Ichika [IS: Infinite Stratos] never learns he [Ichika] can pilot the only able to be piloted, orignally for space exploration exoskeletons known as IS [Infinite Stratos] units [IS: Infinite Stratos], [Ichika] instead being bonded with the Faiz Gear [Kamen Rider 555] and [Ichika] secretly waging a one-man war against crime, the hordes of Hollows the Umbrella Corporation sends to get the Faiz Gear back as well as the numerous agents from the Clocktower looking to kill him [Ichika] because his [Ichika's] guardian and inventor of the IS Units, the purple-pinkish haired, red-purple-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent and academically gifted, skilled inventor, eccentric and somewhat childish Shinonono Tabane [IS: Infinite Stratos] accidentally stole from both the Umbrella Corporation and the Clocktowers when [Tabane] creating the IS units, although he [Ichika] hides this [Ichika being bonded to the Faiz Gear and Ichika subsequently being a vigilante] from her [Tabane] and everyone else around him [Ichika] The excerpt should focus on Shiki, while [Shiki] on vacation in the mountains of Utah on an archaeological gig jointly sponsored by both the Umbrella Corporation and Kanemitsu Zaibatsu, [Shiki] being accompanied by his [Shiki's] legal younger sister [Miyako], his [Shiki's] other younger sisters [Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] and their [Shiki's Karen/Rin's, Akiha's, Chloe's Illya's and Miyako's] parents [Kiritsugu, Irisivel, Fumio and Keiko] along with Karen's/Rin's rival at the Clocktower, the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and rather buxom, publicly graceful and elitist but secretly competitive and perfectionist current heiress of the immensely wealthly Swedish-Finnish noble house in both the non-magical and magical worlds, the House of Edelfelt, Luviagelita [Fate/Stay Night] and her [Luvia's] ward and Chloe's and Illya's rival who is actually a refugee from the far future of the timeline when the Future War happened and future John won the Future War and the heiress of the long-defunct Sakatsuki branch family of the Emiyas, the black-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender but also secretly curvy and buxom, highly intelligent and academically gifted, openly mature, dutiful, and rather unfriendly but secretly caring, vunerable and dedicated Sakatsuki Miyuki [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya], who [Miyuki] goes by the identity of Miyu Edelfelt [Fate/Stay Night kalied liner Prisma Illya] while in public, [Shiki while on vacation with his |Shiki's| relatives, Luvia and Miyu] being attacked by Hollows working for the Umbrella Corporation while [Shiki] heading to his [Shiki's] tent to [Shiki] get some sleep and [Shiki] nearly being forced to [Shiki] reveal his own [Shiki's] martial arts and [Shiki's] magecraft skills to [Shiki] defend himself [Shiki], only for him [Shiki] to be saved by a mysterious man in a futuristic biomechanincal form-fitting wetsuit with titanium armor plates on the chest, shoulders and kneees and red lines all around it [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode].

When Shiki decides to try and help his [Shiki's] mysterious savior [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] the mystery armoured hero [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] suddenly looks up and [Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode] quickly vanishes, just as his Shiki's legal younger sister [Miyako] and his other younger sisters [Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] along with Luvia and Miyu, come running up to him [Shiki]. Miyu's sharp eyes and nose sense the unmistakable mana and energy presence of Hollows and [Miyu] shakes her [Miyu's] head, [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to tell him [Shiki] everything [about what Umbrella really is and why the Future War], [Miyu] not realizing that he [Shiki] was [Shiki] once her [Miyu's] past self's [Future War timeline's Skynet's] greatest enemy [future John during the Future War] in her [Miyu's] original world and [Miyu's] original timeline as Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya start [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] clinging tightly to him [Shiki], [Miyu] realizing that she [Miyu] will have to share him [Shiki] as his [Shiki's] wife with them [Miyako, Karen/Rin, Akiha, Chloe and Illya] as Ichika, having [Ichika] long deactivated his [Ichika's] armor [the Faiz Gear] and [Ichika] been in his [Ichika's] human form for a while, [Ichika] observes everything from the safety of a tree, [Ichika] shaking his head at Shiki's inevitable polygamous future with multiple children from each wife [of Shiki in the future] before [Ichika] disappearing. N.B: The fight between Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode and the Hollows should be like a combination of the fights between Sean Barker in the Guyver suit and the Zoanoids [Guyver] in the Guyver: Dark Hero movie, hardcore 1990s-mid 2000s late tokukatsu like Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue, Kamen Rider Kuuga - Kamen Rider Blade, Garo and Kamen Rider: the First and Next, and the more realistic end of Chinese wuxia cultivator fiction, [the fight] focusing on martial arts moves and swordplay techniques as well as practicality as Ichika with the Faiz Gear equipped in vigilante mode decimates the Hollows. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"Given the complexity of the crossover and the specific details of the narrative you're seeking, creating a full exposition would be challenging in this format.

Shiki watches from a distance, his mind racing.** *Shiki:* \\"That's...no ordinary armor. Who is this guy?\\" **The battle wanes, Ichika drops to his knees, heavily breathing. Shiki cautiously approaches, ready to offer aid. However, before he can reach Ichika, the armored hero glances at him and vanishes into the shadows. Shiki is left standing there as the others rush in.** *Miyako:* \\"Brother! Are you okay? We heard a commotion and—\\" *Akiha:* \\"Those mana traces… don't tell me we missed the fight!\\" *Karen/Rin:* \\"What was that?

Hollows, those soul-devouring specters, emerged from the shadows like inkblots marring the pristine canvas of night. The tension was palpable as the air grew thick with malice. Ichika, shrouded in the Faiz Gear, prepared to engage the encroaching threat. His suit hummed with power, the red lines tracing his silhouette like the crests of a raging inferno. It had been a reflex, the instant activation of the armor when danger loomed. Now, amidst the solitude of the Utah mountains, the enemy was upon him, and he was ready. Shiki, having briefly stepped away from the campsite for a moment of nighttime solitude, found himself an unwitting spectator of a battle that defied reason. He pressed himself against a tree, his eyes fixed on the figure clad in biomechanical armor – the Faiz Gear. Amidst the chaos, Miyako lingered in the shadows. From her concealed vantage point, she watched — as vigilant as a guardian deity. The Hollows advanced, distorted cries slicing through the night. They were grotesque, amalgamations of resentful spirits, hungry and unrelenting. But Ichika was no ordinary prey. He was a war machine, a herald of justice in a guise of technological wonder. The first Hollow lunged, a blur of dreadful intent, but Ichika's karate training had honed his reflexes. He sidestepped with the grace of a seasoned martial artist, the Faiz Gear enhancing each movement with uncanny precision. As the creature skidded past him, he seized the opportunity to grapple it, using techniques from jujutsu to bring it to the ground with an audible thud. \\"Remarkable,\\" Shiki muttered under his breath, both impressed and bewildered. Ichika transitioned from grapple to strike without missing a beat. His judo knowledge allowed him to manipulate the twisting mass of his adversary, flipping it onto its back with astonishing ease. With the creature momentarily grounded, he delivered a series of targeted kendo strikes to its mask-like face. \\"You're fighting Hollows,\\" Shiki whispered, realization dawning. \\"But how, and with such...gadgets?\\" Another Hollow, angrier and more imposing than the last, charged. Ichika pivoted, using his kenjutsu expertise to wield the Faiz Edge with lethal effectiveness, slicing through the air. He met the Hollow's assault with a daring spin, his plasma sword whistling through the crisp mountain air, severing the reaching claws of death with absolute finality. He knew he could not relent; he could not fail. He was the shield against the darkness, one which bore the weight of countless lives. And so, he fought, with a ferocity that belied his calm visage. \\"The precision, the power... It's as if he's dancing with death itself,\\" Shiki remarked, his instincts as a fighter recognizing the depth of skill displayed before him. From her hidden perch, Miyako's eyes remained glued to the scene. She was motionless, her very breath stilled by the potential revelation of the Faiz Gear. Yet, even she could not help but be entranced by the display of martial prowess unfurling below. A gang of Hollows converged on Ichika, a coordinated assault to overwhelm the solitary warrior. But he embraced the teachings of ninjutsu, embracing the shadows themselves, becoming a specter amidst specters. He slipped in and out of their grasps, the Faiz Gear's agility modules propelling him to vantage points the eye could scarcely follow. As the fight reached its crescendo, Ichika activated the High-Frequency Blades; a shimmering, resonating duo that hummed with lethal promise. With a cry that echoed through the mountains, he leaped forward, a phantom delivering retribution. The blades cleaved through the night, and the Hollows dissipated into the aether like nightmares at dawn. Exhausted but victorious, Ichika sank to his knees, the Faiz Gear dimming to conserve its wearer's flagging energy. \\"A guardian angel in armor, or something else entirely?\\" Shiki pondered aloud, stepping from his cover despite the prudence cautioning him against it. Yet before he could reach the armored figure, Ichika vanished, leaving only questions and whispers of his enigmatic presence behind. Shiki felt a connection to this mysterious savior, a link that teased the peripheries of his consciousness. He knew, instinctively, that their paths would cross again."},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello!

Основные черты полных контрактов включают: 1. **Исчерпывающее описание условий:** Полные контракты учитывают все возможные ситуации и результаты, которые могут возникнуть в ходе исполнения контракта. 2. **Четкое определение исполнения обязательств:** В контракте четко прописаны обязанности и права каждой из сторон, не оставляя места для разночтений. 3. **Условия наступления и последствия:** Контракт содержит положения о том, что произойдет в случае изменения обстоятельств, а также определения санкций и компенсации за неисполнение или ненадлежащее исполнение условий контракта. 4. **Предвидение контингенций:** В полном контракте предусмотрены планы и решения для любых непредвиденных обстоятельств или \\"форс-мажорных\\" ситуаций. 5. **Возможность верификации и обеспечения исполнения:** Условия контракта должны быть измеримыми и проверяемыми, чтобы третья сторона (например, суд) могла разрешить споры. 6. **Отсутствие неопределенности и неоднозначности:** Все термины и положения формулируются ясно, что исключает различные трактовки и обеспечивает однозначное понимание контракта сторонами. В реальной жизни полные контракты практически не встречаются из-за сложности или невозможности предсказать все варианты развития событий, а также из-за издержек на составление и исполнение таких договоров. Вместо этого реальные контракты часто являются \\"неполными\\" и содержат механизмы для принятия решений при условиях неопределенности и изменениях внешней среды."},{"instruction":"Кратко ответь и Приведите примеры морального риска на кредитном рынке, рынке труда, товарном рынке.","output":"Моральный риск (или моральное рискование) возникает, когда одна сторона сделки принимает повышенные риски, зная, что негативные последствия этих рисков частично или полностью лягут на плечи другой стороны. Он связан с асимметрией информации, когда одна из сторон обладает больше информацией, чем другая. Ниже приведены примеры морального риска в различных сферах: 1. **Кредитный рынок**: Занимая деньги, заемщик может вести себя менее осторожно в их использовании, поскольку часть рисков несет кредитор. Например, заемщик может взять кредит для открытия бизнеса и вложить его в рискованные проекты, надеясь на высокий доход, но при неудаче потери понесет в основном банк. 2. **Рынок труда**: Сотрудник, имеющий стабильную работу и жестко регулируемые условия увольнения, может менее эффективно выполнять свои обязанности, осознавая, что уволить его сложно. Так, застрахованный от увольнения работник может работать менее производительно, зная, что последствия для него будут минимальны. 3. **Товарный рынок**: Компания, предлагающая расширенную гарантию на свою продукцию, может столкнуться с моральным риском со стороны потребителей, которые будут менее осторожно использовать продукт, зная, что любые повреждения покроет гарантия. Например, покупатель может не придавать значения тщательному уходу за бытовой техникой, предполагая, что в случае поломки ремонт будет выполнен бесплатно. Во всех этих примерах моральный риск приводит к неэффективному распределению ресурсов и может вызывать дополнительные издержки для той стороны, которая несет риски, но не может полностью их контролировать."},{"instruction":"Кратко ответь В чем суть идеи эффективной заработной платы?","output":"Идея эффективной заработной платы заключается в том, что оплата труда выше рыночного уровня может привести к повышению производительности сотрудников и уменьшению затрат работодателя в долгосрочной перспективе. Передовые компании используют концепцию эффективной заработной платы в следующих целях: - **Снижение текучести кадров**: Высокие зарплаты создают стимулы для сотрудников оставаться в компании дольше, что позволяет снизить издержки на поиск, найм и обучение нового персонала. - **Привлечение лучших специалистов**: Компания способна привлекать талантливых и квалифицированных сотрудников, предлагая им высокую заработную плату. - **Снижение прогулов и выработка лояльности**: Более высокий уровень оплаты труда подразумевает увеличение стоимости потери работы для сотрудника, что приводит к росту их мотивации и лояльности. - **Улучшение рабочей мотивации и усиление усилий**: Сотрудники, получающие более высокую заработную плату, чаще ассоциируют свои усилия с вознаграждением, что побуждает их работать лучше и эффективнее. Эти предположения базируются на психологическом и социальном взаимодействии и отношениях между работодателем и работником, а также на экономических теориях, связанных с функционированием рынка труда."},{"instruction":"Кратко ответь В чем суть проблемы мягкого бюджетного ограничения?","output":"Суть проблемы мягкого бюджетного ограничения заключается в том, что если компания или организация рассчитывают на финансовую поддержку со стороны государства или других внешних источников при возникновении убытков, то у них снижается стимул к эффективному управлению ресурсами и контролю за издержками. Это происходит потому, что они осознают, что несмотря на любые финансовые трудности, их всё равно \\"спасут\\" путем предоставления дополнительного финансирования, реструктуризации долгов или бюджетных субсидий. Понятие \\"мягкого бюджетного ограничения\\" широко применяется в анализе поведения государственных корпораций, банков и других предприятий, для которых риск банкротства минимизирован за счет предполагаемой государственной поддержки."},{"instruction":"Кратко Опишите суть дилеммы «риск - стимулы» в решении задачи стимулирования наемного работника.","output":"Дилемма \\"риск - стимулы\\" в контексте стимулирования наемного работника возникает при попытке сбалансировать предоставление достаточных стимулов для высокой производительности работника с необходимостью определения оптимальной степени риска, который он должен нести. С одной стороны, работодатель может предложить работнику контракт с переменной оплатой, например, с бонусами за выполнение целей или долей в прибылях, чтобы мотивировать его на более высокую производительность. С другой стороны, слишком большая переменная компонента в оплате труда перекладывает на работника часть бизнес-рисков, что может быть для него нежелательно. Если в контракте слишком много риска для работника, он может быть не склонен его принимать, или это может привести к излишней осторожности и снижению эффективности труда. Если же стимулы производительности недостаточно сильные, работник не будет достаточно мотивирован на высокую результативность. Таким образом, работодатель сталкивается с необходимостью найти оптимальное сочетание фиксированной заработной платы и переменных стимулов, которое позволило бы достигнуть целей эффективности работы при приемлемом уровне риска для работника."},{"instruction":"Кратко ответь В каком случае оплата по результату как механизм стимулирования наемного работника не связана с издержками?","output":"Оплата по результату как механизм стимулирования наемного работника обычно не связана с издержками для работодателя в ситуации, когда дополнительная оплата за высокие результаты финансируется за счет дополнительно созданной стоимости благодаря повышенной продуктивности работника. Если премия или бонус выплачивается из прироста прибыли, который был бы невозможен без дополнительных усилий работника, то нет дополнительных издержек для работодателя, поскольку эти выплаты компенсируются увеличением дохода компании."},{"instruction":"Кратко ответь Почему налоги относят к трансакционным издержкам?","output":"Налоги относят к трансакционным издержкам, поскольку они представляют собой дополнительные затраты на совершение экономических операций. При выполнении финансовых транзакций, таких как покупка товаров, предоставление услуг или перевод капитала, налоги увеличивают общую стоимость сделки для участвующих сторон. Трансакционные издержки включают в себя все затраты, связанные с процессом обмена товаров и услуг, в том числе издержки поиска партнёров, расходы на ведение переговоров и оформление сделок, затраты на соблюдение условий контракта и издержки, связанные с поддержанием соблюдения прав собственности. Налоги входят в этот список как неотъемлемая часть затрат, которые необходимо учесть при организации любой экономической деятельности."},{"instruction":"Очень кратко ответь Каковы особенности взаимоотношений контрагентов в Интернет-пространстве?

Now what you have to remember is this is an underwriter we are talking about. They might be dealing with multiple applications in different categories at a time. Lets say there are two categories - 1. Securities based lending 2. Partner lending We would need two separate flows for each of these cases, and in addition we would also require additional rules based flows within each of these sections which change based on how the user interacts with an application. Can you brainstorm and chart that out?","output":"Designing a rule-based flow for an underwriting solution requires careful consideration of the unique characteristics and requirements of each lending category. Below, we'll outline the two separate flows for securities-based lending and partner lending, incorporating decision points that can trigger additional rule-based flows based on user interactions. **Securities-Based Lending Flow:** *Start: Application Received* 1. **Initial Application Review:** - Verify application completeness. - Rule: If incomplete, request missing documents. 2. **Determine Securities Type:** - Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. - Rule: Different security types trigger specific valuation and risk assessment processes. 3. **Valuation Process:** - Real-time market data integration. - Rule: If market data unavailable, flag for manual valuation. 4. **Risk Assessment:** - Leverage historical performance, volatility indices, etc. - Rule: If risk exceeds threshold, escalate for further review. 5. **Determine Loan Terms:** - Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, interest rates, etc. - Rule: LTV exceeds predefined limits, revise or reject loan terms. 6. **Preliminary Decision:** - Approved, conditionally approved, or denied. - Rule: If conditionally approved, specify conditions. 7. **Documentation and Final Approval:** - Generate loan documents and execute agreements. - Rule: If user modifies terms, re-trigger loan terms process. 8. **Fund Disbursement:** - Transfer funds and maintain securities collateral. - Rule: If collateral is insufficient, halt disbursement and reassess. *End: Transaction Complete* **Partner Lending Flow:** *Start: Application Received* 1. **Initial Application Review:** - Assess partnership details and terms. - Rule: If details missing or unclear, request clarification. 2. **Creditworthiness Assessment:** - Check partner's credit history and financial statements. - Rule: If score below threshold, trigger additional financial analysis. 3. **Business Model and Revenue Analysis:** - Evaluate the partner's business model and revenue streams. - Rule: If model deemed high-risk, trigger special due diligence. 4. **Loan Term Structuring:** - Interest rates, payback period, covenants, etc. - Rule: If covenants violated, restructure or escalate for review. 5. **Decision Making:** - Approve, conditionally approve, or deny based on analysis. - Rule: If conditionally approved, list specific conditions. 6. **Agreement Drafting:** - Create contract reflecting the loan terms. - Rule: If terms disputed by partner, involve legal team for negotiation. 7. **Sign-off and Funding:** - Obtain signatures and disburse funds. - Rule: If partner delays sign-off, send reminders or re-engage. *End: Transaction Complete* **Additional Rules for Dynamic Interaction:** - If the underwriter makes changes to the terms or conditions during review, the system should re-evaluate the application based on the new inputs. - A monitoring mechanism for exceptions, wherein certain cases can be flagged for manual review if they fall outside algorithmic decision boundaries. - A feedback loop for continuous improvement of the rules based on historical data and outcomes. This simplified chart gives a high-level overview of the flows and potential rule triggers. In practice, these flows can be much more complex, and it is crucial to continuously refine the rule sets and incorporate feedback from underwriters, compliance, and the performance of the loans themselves. Implementing a business process management tool (BPM) or a decision management system (DMS) can help in visually designing, executing, managing, and optimizing these complex workflows. As you design the system, you'll also want to ensure that you comply with all relevant regulations, which may include maintaining transparency, auditability, and fairness in your underwriting processes."},{"instruction":"Привет","output":"Привет!

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses, and personal assistance provided by abolitionist sympathizers. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \`\`stations'' along the route but knew few details of their immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \`\`Conductors'' on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included free-born blacks, white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or manumitted), and Native Americans. Church clergy and congregations often played a role, especially the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), Congregationalists, Wesleyans, and Reformed Presbyterians, as well as certain sects of mainstream denominations such as branches of the Methodist church and American Baptists. Without the presence and support of free black residents, there would have been almost no chance for fugitive slaves to pass into freedom unmolested."},{"instruction":"an you be short and not a dwarf","output":"Short stature is a common replacement of the term 'dwarfism', especially in a medical context.

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere.The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4--9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm/year."},{"instruction":"do all limited companies have to be registered with companies house","output":"Companies House is the United Kingdom's registrar of companies and is an executive agency and trading fund of Her Majesty's Government.

Chloe talks to Brooke as she's painting the room and tells her about the baby's father and why she chose to give the baby up for adoption, and soon after she leaves to go home, they get a call from the hospital that Chloe has gone into labor and the baby is coming tonight. Brooke and Julian rush to the hospital to be with Chloe for the delivery of their new baby, during which time Chloe says that she would probably be a great mother, she just doesn't want to raise the baby alone. However, Brooke and Julian are shocked when Chloe's boyfriend Eric, the father of her baby, shows up at the hospital and Chloe ends up deciding to keep the baby now that she can raise the little girl with her boyfriend, not alone, leaving Brooke crushed, especially because Chloe had a little baby girl, which is exactly what Brooke wanted. While dealing with the emotional aftermath of the adoption falling through, she receives a job offer from Clothes Over Bros to move to New York and return to the company to design. She discusses this with Victoria, who thinks it's a great idea that she should not turn down, and after Julian tells her he thinks it's a great idea as well, she decides to take the job. However, she later decides to turn down the job after she finds out shockingly enough that she's pregnant, which she finds out after Chase asks Alex to take a drug test for him as he's trying to enter the Air Force but smoked weed during the Kid Cudi show and could not take it, and when he gets a call from the lab saying the person who gave the sample is pregnant, he tells Alex she's pregnant as he thought she took the test but it is revealed that Alex wouldn't have been able to pass the test either as she ate pot brownies that Quinn made so she went to ask Julian to take the test but Brooke took it instead, meaning the person pregnant isn't Alex but actually Brooke. Quinn gets a photoshoot offer for B. Davis magazine to shoot a model in Puerto Rico and she invites Alex, Brooke, and Lauren to go with her. During the trip, Brooke tries to hide her pregnancy from Quinn and Lauren (with Alex already knowing about it because of the drug test) as she and Julian decided they didn't want to tell anybody as it's too early, but Quinn eventually figures it out when Brooke makes it obvious by not eating sushi and throwing all of her alcohol shots over her shoulder to avoid drinking them. When she returns to Tree Hill, she finds that Haley has decided to turn Brooke's former store back into Karen's Cafe now that she's moving to New York, causing Brooke to finally tell Haley that she turned down the job and is staying in Tree Hill because she's pregnant, and instead offers to be Haley's partner so they can open the cafe together."},{"instruction":"an you play xbox 360 games.on xbox one","output":"The Xbox One gaming console has received updates from Microsoft since its launch in 2013 that enable it to play select games from its two predecessor consoles, Xbox and Xbox 360.

Wade is one of only four Marquette University players to be drafted in the first round; his is the highest draft selection in school history. After a 5--15 start, the Heat would gradually improve and finish 42--40 to qualify for the NBA playoffs. He further distinguished himself with outstanding performances in the playoffs, particularly against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. In the end, however, Wade's successful rookie season was somewhat overshadowed by the success of fellow rookies Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James. Wade did earn unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team, and also finished third in rookie of the year voting (behind James and Anthony). He was ranked in the top five among rookies in several major statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played. In the playoffs Wade hit a game-winning shot in Game 1 of the Heat's first round series against the New Orleans Hornets. The Heat won the series 4--3 and advanced to the second round to face the top-seeded and best record team in the NBA, the Indiana Pacers, in a very entertaining series that almost pushed the 61-win Pacers to the edge, though Miami would eventually lose the series in six games. He became the fourth rookie since the shot clock era began to lead his team in scoring and assist average in the postseason."},{"instruction":"bungou stray dogs getting a third seaso","output":"The series was split into two halves: the first half, containing twelve episodes, premiered on 7 April 2016 and ended on 23 June 2016, being broadcast on Tokyo MX, TVS, CTC, tvk, GBS (Gifu Broadcasting), Mie TV, SUN, TVQ Kyushu, and BS11.

So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent.

In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment. Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age, while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010."},{"instruction":"an some fish live in both saltwater and freshwater","output":"Euryhaline organisms are able to adapt to a wide range of salinities.

The name \`\`endospore'' is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (endo means within), but it is not a true spore (i.e., not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in gram-positive bacteria. In endospore formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall. One side then engulfs the other. Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. There are many reports of spores remaining viable over 10,000 years, and revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. There is one report of viable spores of Bacillus marismortui in salt crystals approximately 250 million years old. When the environment becomes more favorable, the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative state. Most types of bacteria cannot change to the endospore form. Examples of bacteria that can form endospores include Bacillus and Clostridium."},{"instruction":"an the president of the united states veto a bill passed by congre","output":"If the President approves of the legislation, then the President signs it into law.

Dhows used for purposes of fishing were also built on the foreshore of the creek. The importance of the creek as a site of commercial activity was a justification to introduce improvements to allow larger vessels to transit, as well as to facilitate loading and unloading activities. This led, in 1955, to a plan to develop the creek, which involved dredging shallow areas, building of breakwaters, and developing its beach to become a quay suitable for loading and unloading of cargo. The creek was first dredged in 1961 to permit 7-foot (2.1 m) draft vessels to cross through the creek at all times. The creek was dredged again in the 1960s and 1970s so that it could offer anchorage for local and coastal shipping of up to about 500 tons. The dredging opened up the creek to much more continuous traffic of merchandise, including the development of re-export, and gave Dubai an advantage over Sharjah, the other dominant trading centre in the region at the time. Al Maktoum Bridge, the first bridge connecting Bur Dubai and Deira was constructed in 1963.

Proposed following the often bitter 1787--88 debate over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and written to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215).

It is considered preferable to delay neutering until sexual maturity has been reached, at approximately six to eight months old, after the full descent of the testicles. Neutering the male will reduce the smell to almost nothing. The same applies for females, but spaying them is also important for their own health. Unless they are going to be used for breeding purposes, female ferrets will go into extended heat. A female that does not mate can die of aplastic anemia without medical intervention.

If a packet does not match the packet filter's set of filtering rules, the packet filter will drop (silently discard) the packet or reject it (discard it, and send \`\`error responses'' to the source). Conversely, if the packet matches one or more of the programmed filters, the packet is allowed to pass. This type of packet filtering pays no attention to whether a packet is part of an existing stream of traffic (i.e. it stores no information on connection \`\`state''). Instead, it filters each packet based only on information contained in the packet itself (most commonly using a combination of the packet's source and destination address, its protocol, and, for TCP and UDP traffic, the port number). TCP and UDP protocols constitute most communication over the Internet, and because TCP and UDP traffic by convention uses well known ports for particular types of traffic, a \`\`stateless'' packet filter can distinguish between, and thus control, those types of traffic (such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, file transfer), unless the machines on each side of the packet filter are both using the same non-standard ports."},{"instruction":"an the giants play the jets in the super bowl","output":"As the teams play in different conferences, the two teams only meet during the regular season once every four years when all four AFC East clubs play all four NFC East clubs.

As part of his preparations for marching on Texas, in late December 1835 Santa Anna had convinced the Mexican Congress to pass a resolution that all \`\`foreigners landing on the coast of the Republic or invading its territory by land, armed, and with the intent of attacking our country, will be deemed pirates'' and subject to immediate execution."},{"instruction":"he fed part of the us treasury","output":"The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers.

The act required the Office of Management and Budget to assist the president with the preparation of the budget. Previous presidents had the privilege of impounding funds as they saw fit, however the United States Supreme Court revoked the privilege in 1998 as a violation of the Presentment Clause. The power was available to all presidents and was regarded as a power inherent to the office. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed in response to large-scale power exercises by President Nixon . The act also created the Congressional Budget Office as a legislative counterpoint to the Office of Management and Budget. The president, as the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces may also call into federal service individual state units of the National Guard. In times of war or national emergency, the Congress may grant the president broader powers to manage the national economy and protect the security of the United States, but these powers were not expressly granted by the United States Constitution. During the Vietnam War, in 1973, Congress expeditiously passed the War Powers Act and severely limited the ability of the President to conduct warfare without Congressional approval. Congress was constitutionally provided the power to declare the war, but if the president needed to send the troops to other countries for emergency reasons, approved statutes required the notification of Congress within forty-eight hours.

The toll remained at 2 shillings until New Zealand changed to decimal currency in July 1967, when that amount became 20 cents in the conversion. Tolls were increased in 1980 from 20 to 25 cents (approximately 1.17 in 2014) by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, and this contributed to the National Party's loss of the 1980 by-election in the East Coast Bays electorate. Tolling was later made north-bound only before being discontinued on 30 March 1984, and the booths were removed.

Because state laws exist, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level, but the practice is considered \`\`against public policy'' and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated. Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible."},{"instruction":"will there be a season 6 of boardwalk empire","output":"HBO renewed Boardwalk Empire for a fifth season on September 26, 2013, and announced on January 9, 2014, that it would be the final season.

If the performance of the speech constituted \`\`general publication'', it would have entered the public domain due to King's failure to register the speech with the Register of Copyrights. However, if the performance only constituted \`\`limited publication'', King retained common law copyright. This led to a lawsuit, Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc., which established that the King estate does hold copyright over the speech and had standing to sue; the parties then settled. Unlicensed use of the speech or a part of it can still be lawful in some circumstances, especially in jurisdictions under doctrines such as fair use or fair dealing.

Less frequently, the placekicker, who virtually never handles the ball in an American football game, will serve as the passer or rusher on a fake field goal. Examples include then-New England kicker Adam Vinatieri receiving a direct snap and throwing a touchdown pass during an NFL game in 2004, and LSU kicker Colt David rushing for a 15-yard touchdown in 2007 after receiving the ball on a blind lateral from holder (and starting quarterback) Matt Flynn."},{"instruction":"e there snakes in the upper peninsula of michig","output":"Michigan, one of the fifty United States, is home to two types of lizards, nineteen types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, all members of the class Reptilia.

Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans.

Only two other actual non-League clubs have even reached the final since the founding of the League: Sheffield Wednesday in 1890 (champions of the Football Alliance, a rival league which was already effectively the Second Division, which it formally became in 1892 -- Wednesday being let straight into the First Division), and Southampton in 1900 and 1902 (in which years they were also Southern League champions, proving the strength of that league: again, they were probably of equivalent standard to a First Division club at the time, but Southampton's form subsequently faded and they did not join the League till 1920 and the formation of the Third Division.)"},{"instruction":"induced dipole stronger than hydrogen bonding","output":"Ion-dipole and ion-induced dipole forces are similar to dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole interactions but involve ions, instead of only polar and non-polar molecules.

Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat.'' Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995. Congress attempted to grant this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control \`\`pork barrel spending'', but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6-3 decision in Clinton v. City of New York. The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times."},{"instruction":"do jackson and april get back together after their divorce","output":"In seasons 13 and 14, April faces a crisis of faith as she begins to believe that good people get punished and bad people get good things.

In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment.

Usually, acoustic-electric guitars are fitted with piezoelectric pickups, and hence require a preamplifier incorporated into the guitar body to amplify the signal before it travels to the main guitar amplifier. These preamps may also come with tone controls of varying types, but usually equalizers with up to six frequency bands are used.

Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf."},{"instruction":"an you buy alcohol on sunday in orego","output":"Five more types of licenses were created in the 1950s, dealing with liquor-by-the-drink operations, industry agents, salesmen, out-of-state manufacturers of malt beverages, and conventions, group meetings, etc. In 1960, establishments were required to have food sales equal to 25% of their total sales.

It uses a form of lossy data compression to encode data using inexact approximations and partial data discarding to reduce file sizes, typically by a factor of 10, in comparison with a CD while retaining a sound quality comparable to uncompressed audio. Compared to CD quality digital audio, MP3 compression commonly achieves 75 to 95% reduction in size. MP3 files are thus 1/4 to 1/20 the size of the original digital audio stream. This is important for both transmission and storage concerns. The basis for such comparison is the CD digital audio format which requires 1411.2 kbit/s. A commonly used MP3 encoding setting is CBR 128 kbit/s resulting in file of 1/11 (=9%) of the size of the original CD-quality file, that is with 91% compression."},{"instruction":"he sinner on netflix based on a book","output":"The Sinner is an American anthology crime drama mystery television series, based on the novel of the same name by German crime writer Petra Hammesfahr.

A unicameral body with legislative and executive function, it comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures of the several states. Each state delegation had one vote. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (1775--1781) and governed under the newly adopted Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, which were proposed in 1776--1777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims, the plan introduced by Maryland politician John Hanson; the plan is referred to as 'The Hanson Plan'. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the new Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790."},{"instruction":"do your parents have to be born in america to be preside","output":"The U.S. Constitution uses but does not define the phrase \`\`natural born Citizen'', and various opinions have been offered over time regarding its precise meaning.

Modern written Chinese, which replaced Classical Chinese as the written standard as an indirect result of the May Fourth Movement of 1919, is not technically bound to any single variety; however, it most nearly represents the vocabulary and syntax of Mandarin, by far the most widespread Chinese dialectal family in terms of both geographical area and number of speakers. This version of written Chinese is called Vernacular Chinese, or 白話/白话 báihuà (literally, \`\`plain speech''). Despite its ties to the dominant Mandarin language, Vernacular Chinese also permits some communication between people of different dialects, limited by the fact that Vernacular Chinese expressions are often ungrammatical or unidiomatic in non-Mandarin dialects. This role may not differ substantially from the role of other linguae francae, such as Latin: For those trained in written Chinese, it serves as a common medium; for those untrained in it, the graphic nature of the characters is in general no aid to common understanding (characters such as \`\`one'' notwithstanding). In this regard, Chinese characters may be considered a large and inefficient phonetic script. However, Ghil'ad Zuckermann's exploration of phono-semantic matching in Standard Chinese concludes that the Chinese writing system is multifunctional, conveying both semantic and phonetic content."},{"instruction":"he grocery store on guy's grocery games a real store","output":"Season 1 was shot inside of an actual grocery store, Field's Market in West Hills, California.

This may have caused or contributed to the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna, although it is also possible that the late Pleistocene extinctions were (at least in part) caused by other factors such as disease and overhunting by humans. New research suggests that the extinction of the woolly mammoth may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting. Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused the mammoths' habitat to shrink in size, resulting in a drop in population. The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans. The global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible. Small populations of wooly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands, Saint Paul Island and Wrangel Island, until c. 3700 BCE and c. 1700 BCE respectively. The Wrangel Island population became extinct around the same time the island was settled by prehistoric humans. There is no evidence of prehistoric human presence on Saint Paul island (though early human settlements dating as far back as 6500 BCE were found on the nearby Aleutian Islands)."},{"instruction":"euro/mastercard the same as mastercard","output":"Its operations were relocated to Belgium in the late 1960s, and the card became the dominant brand in North and Central Europe between 1970 and 2002.

Its original 64 elevators, built by the Otis Elevator Company, are located in a central core and are of varying heights, with the longest of these elevators reaching from the lobby to the 80th floor. As originally built, there were four \`\`express'' elevators that connected the lobby, 80th floor, and several landings in between; the other 60 \`\`local'' elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings. Of the 64 total elevators, 58 were for passenger use (comprising the four express elevators and 54 local elevators), and eight were for freight deliveries. The elevators were designed to move at 1,200 feet per minute (366 m/min). At the time of the skyscraper's construction, their practical speed was limited to 700 feet per minute (213 m/min) as per city law, but this limit was removed shortly after the building opened. Additional elevators connect the 80th floor to the six floors above it, as the six extra floors were built after the original 80 stories were approved. The elevators were mechanically operated until 2011, when they were replaced with digital elevators during the 550 million renovation of the building.

Air has a refractive index of about 1.0003, and water has a refractive index of about 1.3333. If a person looks at a straight object, such as a pencil or straw, which is placed at a slant, partially in the water, the object appears to bend at the water's surface. This is due to the bending of light rays as they move from the water to the air. Once the rays reach the eye, the eye traces them back as straight lines (lines of sight). The lines of sight (shown as dashed lines) intersect at a higher position than where the actual rays originated. This causes the pencil to appear higher and the water to appear shallower than it really is. The depth that the water appears to be when viewed from above is known as the apparent depth. This is an important consideration for spearfishing from the surface because it will make the target fish appear to be in a different place, and the fisher must aim lower to catch the fish. Conversely, an object above the water has a higher apparent height when viewed from below the water. The opposite correction must be made by an archer fish. For small angles of incidence (measured from the normal, when sin θ is approximately the same as tan θ), the ratio of apparent to real depth is the ratio of the refractive indexes of air to that of water. But, as the angle of incidence approaches 90, the apparent depth approaches zero, albeit reflection increases, which limits observation at high angles of incidence. Conversely, the apparent height approaches infinity as the angle of incidence (from below) increases, but even earlier, as the angle of total internal reflection is approached, albeit the image also fades from view as this limit is approached."},{"instruction":"he house on cielo drive still there","output":"The residence had been occupied by various famous Hollywood and music industry figures.

While Western states have allowed it for more than 50 years; eastern states amended their traffic laws to allow it in the 1970s as a fuel-saving measure in response to motor fuel shortages in 1973. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit right turns on red lights. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right turns on red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic lights.

Sex with an adult who is related as parent (including adoptive parent), grandparent, child (including adopted child), grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, is illegal. In England and Wales the offence is against the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which effectively replaced the offence of incest with two new wider groups of offences: familial child sex offences (sections 25--29) and sex with an adult relative (sections 64--65). These laws are intended to protect the rights of people, so as to avoid potential violation. However, these laws still outlaw consensual sexual relationships between family members, even if they are fully willing and knowledgeable to the potential consequences. There has been some debate surrounding the rhetoric used by the Sexual Offences Review Team. Roffee discusses how the language used manipulates the reader to deem consensual familial sexual acts as illegal to the point of immoral. In Northern Ireland similar offences are against the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008."},{"instruction":"ps i did it again a remake","output":"\`\`Oops!...

In the past, most states only granted divorces on fault grounds, but today all states have adopted a form of no fault divorce. Fault and no-fault divorces each require that specific grounds be met. A no fault divorce can be granted on grounds such as irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, irreconcilable differences, incompatibility, or after a period of separation, depending on the state. Neither party is held responsible for the failure of the marriage. On the other hand, in fault divorces one party is asking for a divorce because they claim the other party did something wrong that justifies ending the marriage. Several grounds for fault divorce include adultery, cruelty, abandonment, mental illness, and criminal conviction. There are, however, additional grounds that are acceptable in some states such as drug abuse, impotency, and religious reasons."},{"instruction":"an a state secede from the united states of americ","output":"The Constitution does not directly mention secession. The legality of secession was hotly debated in the 19th century, with Southerners often claiming and Northerners generally denying that states have a legal right to unilaterally secede. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Constitution to be an \`\`indestructible'' union. There is no legal basis a state can point to for unilaterally seceding. Many scholars hold that the Confederate secession was blatantly illegal. The Articles of Confederation explicitly state the Union is \`\`perpetual''; the U.S. Constitution declares itself an even \`\`more perfect union'' than the Articles of Confederation. Other scholars, while not necessarily disagreeing that the secession was illegal, point out that sovereignty is often de facto an \`\`extralegal'' question. Had the Confederacy won, any illegality of its actions under U.S. law would have been rendered irrelevant, just as the undisputed illegality of American rebellion under the British law of 1775 was rendered irrelevant. Thus, these scholars argue, the illegality of unilateral secession was not firmly de facto established until the Union won the Civil War; in this view, the legal question was resolved at Appomattox."},{"instruction":"baby sign language the same as regular sign language","output":"Baby sign is distinct from sign language. Baby sign is used by hearing parents with hearing children to improve communication. Sign languages, including ASL, BSL, ISL and others, are natural languages, typically used in the Deaf community.

Teaching baby signs allows for greater flexibility in the form of sign and does not require the parent to learn the grammar of a sign language. Baby signs are usually gestures or signs taken from the sign language community and modified to make them easier for an infant to form."},{"instruction":"an i buy a gun without a license in south afric","output":"In South Africa, citizens or permanent residents who wish to own firearms are required to obtain a licence."},{"instruction":"do you need a visa for north cypru","output":"Most of the visitors to Northern Cyprus do not need to obtain a visa in advance for short visits."},{"instruction":"do xbox 360 games work for xbox 1","output":"The Xbox One gaming console has received updates from Microsoft since its launch in 2013 that enable it to play select games from its two predecessor consoles, Xbox and Xbox 360.

According to authoritative sources, including Hawks and Bacall, this was not true. Williams and some female singers were tested to dub for Bacall, because of fears that she lacked the necessary vocal skills. But those fears were overshadowed by the desire to have Bacall do her own singing (perhaps championed by Bogart) despite her less than perfect vocal talent. This myth is disputed in Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide entry for this film, but the myth is propagated in a 1986 episode of MacGyver, entitled \`\`Three for the Road'', when the character of a veteran movie asks his wife this particular question, whereupon she answers that Andy Williams, when 14, did dub the voice for Lauren Bacall."},{"instruction":"did the movie to kill a mockingbird win any academy award","output":"The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and was a box-office success, earning more than six times its budget.

There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic acids), and protein. There are 3×3=9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these. The dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3: three general transfers (believed to occur normally in most cells), three special transfers (known to occur, but only under specific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory), and three unknown transfers (believed never to occur). The general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), DNA information can be copied into mRNA (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation). The special transfers describe: RNA being copied from RNA (RNA replication), DNA being synthesised using an RNA template (reverse transcription), and proteins being synthesised directly from a DNA template without the use of mRNA. The unknown transfers describe: a protein being copied from a protein, synthesis of RNA using the primary structure of a protein as a template, and DNA synthesis using the primary structure of a protein as a template - these are not thought to naturally occur."},{"instruction":"an you buy alcohol on your 21st birthday in kentucky","output":"Another inconsistency involves the difference between legal ages for buying and selling alcoholic beverages.

He signals his intentions by swimming around the female with flared fins, attempting to draw her to the nest where he will continue his courting display. If the female accepts the male she will begin swimming in circles with the male beneath the bubble nest. When she is ready to spawn she touches the male on either the back or the tail with her mouth. Upon this signal the male will embrace the female, turning her first on her side and finally on her back. At this point the female will release approximately five dozen clear eggs, which are immediately fertilized by the male. Most of the eggs will float up into the bubble nest. Eggs that stray are collected by the male and placed in the nest. Once all the eggs are secured in the nest, the pair will spawn again. If more than one female is present in the breeding tank, the male may spawn with all of them. The spawning sessions will continue for two to four hours, and produce between 300 and 800 eggs. Dwarf gouramis have a fecundity of about 600 eggs.(1) Upon completion, the male will place a fine layer of bubbles beneath the eggs, assuring that they remain in the bubble nest.The male will protect the eggs and fry. In 12 to 24 hours the fry will hatch, and continue developing within the protection of the bubble nest. After three days they are sufficiently developed to be free swimming and leave the nest.

At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later after the events of the \`\`Red Wedding'', Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother's head, when Tyrion and Tywin are outraged. Tyrion threatens Joffrey once again, and later Joffrey turns on Tywin, who responds by commanding Joffrey to be sent to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin. During his wedding feast in the throne room, he presents an extremely offensive play of \`\`The War of the Five Kings, '' with each of the kings played by dwarves, to humiliate his uncle. He also repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, forcing the former to be his cupbearer. At the conclusion of the dinner, however, Joffrey's wine is poisoned, and he dies in an event known as \`\`The Purple Wedding,'' in which Tyrion is falsely accused and arrested by Cersei in A Storm of Swords (2000). It is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators, with assistance from royal fool Ser Dontos Hollard, who successfully smuggles Tyrion's wife Sansa out of King's Landing before either of them can be caught and tried for Joffrey's murder."},{"instruction":"do you have to move a piece if you touch it in che","output":"The touch-move rule in chess specifies that, if a player deliberately touches a piece on the board when it is his turn to move, then he must move or capture that piece if it is legal to do so.

This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and that the frequency (f = v/λ) of the wave is not affected by the refractive index. As a result, the energy (E = h f) of the photon, and therefore the perceived color of the refracted light to a human eye which depends on photon energy, is not affected by the refraction or the refractive index of the medium."},{"instruction":"was the lizzie mcguire movie filmed in italy","output":"The film, produced by Stan Rogow, was directed by Jim Fall from a screenplay by Susan Estelle Jansen, Ed Decter and John J.

The climate of the Salt Lake City area is generally subhumid, not semi-arid as often claimed. Under the Köppen climate classification, Salt Lake City has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa), with relatively drier summers than the rest of the year. The Pacific Ocean is the primary influence on the weather, contributing storms from about October to May, with spring being the wettest season. Snow falls frequently during the winter, contributed largely by the lake-effect from the Great Salt Lake. The only source of precipitation in the summer is monsoon moisture moving north from the Gulf of California. Summers are hot, frequently reaching above 100 °F (38 °C), while winters are cold and snowy. However, winters are warmer than one would expect at this elevation and latitude, due to the Rocky Mountains to the east and north that usually block powerful polar highs from affecting the state during the winter. Temperatures rarely fall below 0 °F (-18 °C), but frequently stay below freezing. Temperature inversions during winter can lead to thick overnight fog and daytime haze in the valley as cool air, moisture, and pollutants are trapped in the valley by surrounding mountains."},{"instruction":"do horse and donkey belong to the same specie","output":"A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare).

As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after Shays' Rebellion, individuals began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger national government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the Constitutional Convention. It was quickly realized that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced. On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution. The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the President), courts, and taxing powers."},{"instruction":"an i eat the green stuff in lobster","output":"Tomalley (from the Carib word tumale, meaning a sauce of lobster liver), crab fat, or lobster paste is the soft, green substance found in the body cavity of lobsters, that fulfills the functions of both the liver and the pancreas.

The development made short-staple cotton profitable and opened the upland Piedmont region to slave-based cotton plantations, previously restricted to the sea islands and Lowcountry. Britain's Industrial Revolution--initially built upon its textile industry--took up the extra production ravenously and it was swiftly Charleston's major export commodity.

Whereas traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generates a black-and-white image in which brightness is determined primarily by the T1 or T2 relaxation times of the tissue being imaged, the spectroscopic information obtained in an MRSI study can be used to infer further information about cellular activity (metabolic information). For example, in the context of oncology, an MRI scan may reveal the shape and size of a tumor, while an MRSI study provides additional information about the metabolic activity occurring in the tumor. MRSI can be performed on a standard MRI scanner, and the patient experience is the same for MRSI as for MRI. MRSI has broad applications in medicine, including oncology and general physiological studies."},{"instruction":"does the passion of the christ have subtitle","output":"On August 31, 2004, the film was released on DVD, VHS, and later D-VHS in North America by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the USA, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running and/or when the ball is dead. Second, in FIBA play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; two technicals in a game results in ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the WNBA, players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs."},{"instruction":"legal to give your child alcohol in tex","output":"Texas is one of ten states (California, Colorado, Maryland, Montana, New York, Texas, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that allow consumption by minors in the presence of consenting and supervising family members.

The Germany national football team is one of the most successful national teams at the FIFA World Cup, winning four titles, earning second-place and third-place finishes four times each and one fourth-place finish. If you consider 3rd place or better for a winning campaign, Germany's 12 victories in 19 tournaments add up to at least three more than any other nation. In addition, Germany are the only team which has stood on the podium (3rd place or better) every decade there was a tournament held--1930s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Along with Argentina, Brazil and Spain, they are one of the four national teams to win outside their continental confederation, with the title of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in South America. The team was present in 19 out of the 21 tournaments, the second most frequent, and only did not reach the quarterfinals twice, in 1938 and 2018. With this, Germany's 8th place or better (quarterfinals) in 17 out of 19 tournaments (89%) ranks highest in FIFA World Cup Finals history. It makes Germany the better team in the history of the tournament in terms of final positions, if points were awarded proportionally for a title, runner-up finish, third-place finish, semi-final and quarter-final appearances."},{"instruction":"he it crowd filmed in front of a live audience","output":"Graham Linehan wrote the series alone. The show was filmed in front of a live studio audience, which at the time was considered by some as risky, with the format thought to have been surpassed by more fly-on-the-wall type presentations. This was a deliberate choice by Linehan, who sought to challenge the current vogue for hailing the \`\`death of the sitcom,'' stating \`\`I trust my instincts, so I'm going to do it my way and hope people come to me.'' The first series was recorded in front of a live audience at Teddington Studios and moved to Pinewood Studios for series 2 onward, with some additional location footage.

The United States uses a small yellow sign under the main warning sign, as well as a standalone variation on the standard speed limit sign, with a yellow background instead of a white one, the words \`\`speed limit'' omitted and an additional panel stating the type of hazard ahead. Though they list speeds, the U.S. advisory speed signs are classified as warning signs, not regulatory signs, as primary speed signs are. Australia uses a similar design as the U.S. in spite of regulatory speed limit signs being quite different. Germany used a square sign with a blue background and white lettering, similar to the minimum speed limit sign, and New Zealand uses a yellow background with black lettering (similar to the Australian design without the \`\`km/h'' lettering).

It depends on the body's mass distribution and the axis chosen, with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body's rotation. It is an extensive (additive) property: for a point mass the moment of inertia is just the mass times the square of distance to the rotation axis. The moment of inertia of a rigid composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems (all taken about the same axis). Its simplest definition is the second moment of mass with respect to distance from an axis. For bodies constrained to rotate in a plane, only their moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane, a scalar value, matters. For bodies free to rotate in three dimensions, their moments can be described by a symmetric 3 × 3 matrix, with a set of mutually perpendicular principal axes for which this matrix is diagonal and torques around the axes act independently of each other."},{"instruction":"he speaker of the house part of the cabine","output":"The Cabinet includes the Vice President and the heads of 15 executive departments, listed here according to their order of succession to the Presidency.

A belt-driven or shaft-driven supercharger offers exceptional response and low-rpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positive-displacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twin-screw and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger -- if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the low-rpm range -- the proper combination of the two can offer a zero-lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for small-displacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range."},{"instruction":"he road not taken a narrative poem","output":"\`\`The Road Not Taken'' is a narrative poem. It reads naturally or conversationally, and begins as a kind of photographic depiction of a quiet moment in woods. It consists of four stanzas of 5 lines each. The first line rhymes with the third and fourth, and the second line rhymes with the fifth (ABAAB). The meter is basically iambic tetrameter, with each line having four two-syllable feet. Though in almost every line, in different positions, an iamb is replaced with an anapest. The variation of the rhythm gives naturalness, a feeling of thought occurring spontaneously, and it also affects the reader's sense of expectation. In the only line that contains strictly iambs, the more regular rhythm supports the idea of a turning towards an acceptance of a kind of reality: \`\`Though as for that the passing there ... '' In the final line, the way the rhyme and rhythm work together is significantly different, and catches the reader off guard."},{"instruction":"does adding salt to water increase its boiling po","output":"Boiling-point elevation describes the phenomenon that the boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) will be higher when another compound is added, meaning that a solution has a higher boiling point than a pure solvent. This happens whenever a non-volatile solute, such as a salt, is added to a pure solvent, such as water. The boiling point can be measured accurately using an ebullioscope."},{"instruction":"possible for twins to have separate father","output":"Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Heteropaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins. While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination."},{"instruction":"an you have dual citizenship in us and kore","output":"In 2010, the South Korean government legalized dual citizenship for some South Koreans who have acquired another nationality/citizenship, as well as foreigners who lived in South Korea for five years (two years if married to a South Korean)."},{"instruction":"a sheep the same as a lamb","output":"A sheep in its first year is called a lamb, and its meat is also called lamb.

Carl convinces his father to let him relocate to the Hilltop Colony to become a blacksmith apprentice, which Rick agrees on. Rick reunites with Maggie Greene and her adoptive daughter Sophia as he brings Carl to the Hilltop. Rick leaves Carl under Maggie's care. Unaware that his son has joined Alpha and the Whisperers, a tribe of thousands who disguise themselves as walkers, Rick reunites with Michonne as a ship arrives revealing her presence. He is concerned by her behaviour, telling her to sort out her issues and move on after the loss of her daughters. Later, as Michonne and Rick go to Alexandria to attend a fair that has been planned months in advance, they discover Carl is missing and decide to go after him, along with Andrea.

A diagram that sets out the intricate network of intersecting and overlapping food chains for an ecosystem is called its food web. Decomposers are often left off food webs, but if included, they mark the end of a food chain. Thus food chains start with primary producers and end with decay and decomposers. Since decomposers recycle nutrients, leaving them so they can be reused by primary producers, they are sometimes regarded as occupying their own trophic level."},{"instruction":"do ac milan and inter share a stadium","output":"The Giuseppe Meazza Stadium (Italian pronunciation: (dʒuˈzɛppe meˈattsa)), commonly known as San Siro, is a football stadium in the San Siro district of Milan, Italy, which is the home of A.C.
