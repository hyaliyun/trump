Co-Founder Confusion: A handshake deal with your best friend might sound great initially, but later on, it can get messier than a plate of spaghetti bolognese. Avoid post-launch bickering by drafting a detailed co-founder agreement outlining ownership, roles, and responsibilities. nn2. Picking the Wrong Legal Entity: Don't let your startup's legal structure be as mismatched as socks on laundry day. Choose the proper entity (i.e., sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or LLC) that best suits your budding empire's needs. Consult a legal expert to prevent future headaches. nn3. Ignoring the IP Monster: Intellectual property (IP) is crucial in the startup world. Don't let someone else swipe your million-dollar idea. Secure patents, trademarks, or copyrights so you won't end up in a trademark tug-of-war. nn4. Skipping the Fine Print: Invest in reviewing contracts and getting legal advice, or your company may end up circling the drain like a stray goldfish during a water change. Prevent floundering by having clear, enforceable agreements. nn5. Neglecting the Taxman: Tax compliance may sound less appealing than a dentist appointment, but it's an essential part of every entrepreneur's journey. Get tax-savvy and consult with an accountant to ensure you stay in the good graces of Uncle Sam. nnIf you learn from these legal mistakes and hire the right professionals, your startup will be more equipped to navigate the turbulent seas of the business world.

Explain the principles behind how airplanes fly as the world's best aerodynamics engineer.","output":"The principles that enable airplanes to fly are based on a combination of four fundamental forces: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Lift, primarily generated by the wings, counteracts the force of gravity or the weight of the aircraft. This lift is a result of the airfoil shape of the wings, which causes a pressure difference between the air above and below the wings, creating an upward force. Thrust is the forward force, usually produced by engines, that propels the aircraft through the air, overcoming drag or air resistance. The delicate balance and manipulation of these four forces, governed by aerodynamics principles and aircraft design, allow airplanes to take off, maintain altitude, maneuver, and land safely."},{"instruction":"You are a stellar metamorph, a cosmic being capable of taking any shape or form, fueled by the limitless energy of the stars.

As he relieves himself, the plants around it wilt. Steve flushes it into the nearby pond, some fish go belly-up.","output":"Once upon a time in the quiet town of Hawkins, the loveable character Steve Harrington from Stranger Things found himself facing an incredibly monstrous hunger that could not be ignored. It was a fateful evening, where the moon loomed large in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the calm suburban streets. Steve decided to drop by Benny's Burgers, a local joint known for its massive portion sizes and greasy indulgence. As he approached the counter, his stomach grumbled with a dangerous ferocity, signaling the storm of gluttony that was about to unfold. He ordered the \\"Demogorgon Deluxe,\\" a towering burger stacked with ten beef patties, each oozing with gooey cheese and slathered in a secret sauce that could rival the Upside Down itself. On the side, he requested a mountain of crispy french fries smothered in chili, melted cheese, and a generous drizzle of bacon-infused mayonnaise. With a victorious grin, he carried his feast back home to his humble abode, determined to conquer this daredevil culinary challenge. The sight that greeted him was almost as horrifying as the monsters that had plagued Hawkins in the past. Steve spread out the meal like a battlefield on his dining table, his eyes widening with anticipation. He sunk his teeth into the colossal burger, causing cascades of sauce and meat to spill onto his plate. Bits of lettuce and tomato flew, possibly reaching escape velocity. Juices dribbled down his chin as he battled through layer after layer of divine fat and cholesterol. The cheese stretched and stretched as if it had entered a cosmic competition with the laws of physics. The fries were devoured like tiny soldiers, marching to their doom in a bubbling caldron of fatty ecstasy. Alas, as the behemoth meal came to an end, Steve felt a rumble deep within his gut. Panic crossed his face as he realized the monstrous meal was seeking its revenge on his digestive system. He dashed towards his backyard, where a humble outhouse stood in solemn isolation. The stench that emerged from that little outhouse was enough to rival even the darkest corners of the Upside Down. As Steve relieved himself, a malevolent aura seemed to emanate from within. The very plants surrounding the outhouse began to wilt, their leaves curling up as if in agony, unable to withstand the noxious fumes released by Steve's gastronomic endeavor. With trepidation, Steve flushed away his creation, sending it cascading into the nearby pond. As the putrid mixture touched the pristine waters, a ghastly transformation took place. The fish floating lazily near the surface panicked, their tiny fishy eyes bulging in horror as they realized the perilous mistake of inhaling the putrid stench. One by one, they succumbed, their bellies upturned as they floated lifelessly. Steve emerged from the outhouse, his stomach lighter but with a tinge of guilt clinging to his conscience. He realized the consequences of his ravenous appetite, the unintentional destruction left in his wake. Determined to make amends, he vowed to combat his insatiable hunger and find a way to restore the wilting plants and revive the unfortunate fish. And so, the gross Stranger Things tale of Steve Harrington's insatiable appetite and its unintended consequences came to a close, leaving behind a lesson about the importance of responsible dining and the impact our choices can have on the world around us."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet, Changed and Naruto: Changed planet . harem (Transfurs: Lilac, Carol and Milla) x Naruto (Human).part 1","output":"Part 1: A Strange Encounter In the vibrant world of Avalice, a land inhabited by anthropomorphic creatures called Transfurs, a young purple dragon named Lilac soared through the clear blue sky. She was known as a powerful and courageous warrior, with a strong sense of justice and a fierce determination to protect her friends and the people of Avalice. One day, while patrolling the skies, Lilac noticed a bright flash of light out in the distance. Curiosity getting the better of her, she flew towards the source of the light, determined to investigate the mysterious occurrence. As Lilac approached, she found herself in a strange and unfamiliar place. The landscape was vastly different from Avalice, with towering buildings and bustling crowds of humans going about their daily lives. Confused and intrigued, Lilac landed gracefully on the ground below. Unbeknownst to Lilac, she had stumbled upon the world of Naruto, a young ninja with extraordinary abilities. Naruto was known as a mischievous yet kind-hearted individual, aiming to become the strongest ninja and protect his village from any threats. As Lilac looked around, trying to make sense of her surroundings, she caught a glimpse of a familiar face in the crowd. It was Naruto himself, his vibrant orange hair unmistakable even from a distance. Lilac couldn't help but feel a connection to this energetic young man. Curiosity and a desire for answers consumed her, Lilac approached Naruto cautiously. Sensing her presence, Naruto turned and locked eyes with her. Their gazes met, and an instant connection sparked between them. Naruto's eyes widened in surprise as he took in Lilac's dragon-like features. Despite the initial shock, he felt an inexplicable warmth emanating from the young dragon. Intrigued, Naruto flashed his trademark grin and approached Lilac. \\"Hey there! You look pretty different. Are you from another dimension or something?\\" Naruto asked with a twinkle in his eyes. Lilac tilted her head slightly, a hint of uncertainty in her voice. \\"I'm not entirely sure, but something led me here. My name is Lilac.

With newfound companions by their side, the trio of Transfurs and Naruto embarked on a thrilling adventure, determined to unravel the mystery of their strange encounter and discover their purpose in this changed planet. Little did they know that this was only the beginning of an epic story filled with danger, friendship, and an unexpected harem that would test their bonds and push them to new limits."},{"instruction":"Why are people so offened now days: and why do writers have to fill their books with things that shouldn be givens, in inclusisivty and sensitivety (I am like a rock in that regard). If books are so devisive why are they still be writen.","output":"The perception that people are easily offended nowadays is subjective and may vary depending on an individual's perspective. However, there are a few factors that contribute to why some people may appear to be more sensitive or quick to take offense: 1. Increased awareness: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in awareness and discussions around social justice issues. This, in turn, has made people more conscious about potential biases, discrimination, and offensive content. 2. Diverse society: Society today is more diverse and interconnected, which means that individuals from different backgrounds and cultures coexist closely. With a more diverse society, there is a greater chance of encountering opinions, beliefs, or statements that clash, leading to possible conflicts or offense. 3. Communication platforms: The rise of social media and online communication has given people a wider platform to express their opinions, and sometimes this can be done anonymously. The ease of sharing and engaging with content has led to an increase in discussions, debates, and instances where offense can be taken. Regarding your question about writers including inclusivity and sensitivity in their books, it is because authors want their stories to be relatable and appealing to a broader range of readers. Literature evolves with society, and contemporary writers often aim to reflect the diverse world around them. By addressing various perspectives and fostering inclusivity, they hope to engage different audiences and represent a wider range of experiences. Books continue to be written despite the potential for divisiveness because they are a powerful medium for expressing ideas and emotions. Literature allows authors to explore complex themes, challenge social norms, and provoke thought and dialogue. While different voices may have differing opinions, the expression of diverse perspectives in literature contributes to a richer cultural and literary landscape."},{"instruction":"The troube with social norms and espercily todays, is they change so freqantly people cannot keep up. It seems that worrying about offence is the route to self censorship, meaning that in reality saying what you want, when you want and how you want is simply no longer possoble.

Yes there are countries where for certain tridional or prehaps moral or religious resions certain things like Honmosexulaty are banned.

It is true that there can be instances where the fear of causing offense may lead to self-censorship. Balancing free expression and being mindful of potential harm or offense is an ongoing challenge. In democratic societies, the rights and freedoms of different groups are recognized and protected. The idea behind advocating for equal rights is that historically marginalized or oppressed groups should be afforded the same opportunities and protections as others. The push for inclusivity and equal rights is rooted in the belief that fairness and justice should prevail for all. While individual countries have their own sovereignty to govern, it's important to note that certain human rights are considered universal. International agreements and organizations, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations, aim to establish and protect fundamental human rights globally. Criticism arises when certain laws or practices in a country are seen as violating these universal human rights principles. It is within this context that other countries or international bodies may voice their concerns or engage in diplomatic dialogue. The promotion of human rights and the condemnation of human rights abuses are fundamental principles that guide these discussions. Ultimately, finding a balance between respecting different cultures, customs, and beliefs while upholding universal human rights can be complex. It requires ongoing dialogue, understanding, and efforts to foster inclusivity and empathy on a global scale."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet and Changed x Naruto: Changed planet. harem (Transfurs: Lilac, Carol and Milla) x Naruto (Human survival).part 1","output":"Once upon a time, in a world known as Avalice, there lived three extraordinary girls named Lilac, Carol, and Milla.

In India, issues surrounding cow slaughter are governed by a range of factors, including social, cultural, economic, and political considerations, rather than solely being dictated by the religious majority of a particular state. While Hinduism is the majority religion in Tamil Nadu, it is important to note that India is a diverse and pluralistic nation with a significant Muslim and Christian population as well. Therefore, policies related to cow slaughter are not solely driven by the beliefs of the Hindu community but are formulated through a democratic process that takes into account various perspectives and considerations. Additionally, the legal status of cow slaughter differs across states in India. Some states have strict regulations or bans on cow slaughter, while others permit it with certain conditions or restrictions. Tamil Nadu's legislation pertaining to cow slaughter reflects the specific circumstances, cultural dynamics, historical practices, and political factors within the state. It is essential to understand that the legal status of cow slaughter is a complex issue influenced by a multitude of factors, not solely determined by the religious majority of a state."},{"instruction":"Could people travel freely between states in the Holy Roman Empire, or did they need some kind of passport to be allowed to enter another state?","output":"In the Holy Roman Empire, the ability to travel between states varied depending on the specific time period and circumstances. During the medieval period, travelers often required some kind of permission or documentation, such as a letter of safe conduct or passport, to legally enter another state within the Holy Roman Empire. These documents were typically issued by local authorities or rulers and served as a guarantee of safe passage. However, it's important to note that travel within the Holy Roman Empire was not entirely restricted. The empire was a decentralized political entity, consisting of numerous city-states, principalities, and territories, each with its own set of rules and regulations. While some regions implemented strict controls over travel, others had more relaxed policies that allowed for relatively free movement of people. The nature of travel within the Holy Roman Empire also depended on the individual's status and purpose of travel. Nobles and high-ranking officials often enjoyed greater mobility and fewer restrictions compared to commoners, who might face more scrutiny and limitations on their movements. It is worth emphasizing that the Holy Roman Empire encompassed a vast and diverse territory over several centuries, so the travel policies and regulations varied considerably based on time, location, and the authority in control."},{"instruction":"Did the Holy Roman Empire have a unified currency? If not, did some regions at least have a unified currency?","output":"The Holy Roman Empire did not have a unified currency throughout its existence. Instead, it was characterized by a wide variety of regional currencies, with each state or territory within the empire issuing their own coins and determining their value. The authority to mint and control currency was typically held by local rulers, ecclesiastical institutions, or independent city-states. Consequently, the denominations, weights, and specifications of coins differed significantly from one region to another. This fragmentation in currency became even more pronounced during the later years of the empire. While some regions formed monetary unions and shared a common currency, these were exceptions rather than the norm. For example, the South German Florin Union, established in the 14th century, brought together several states to create a unified currency standard. Similarly, the Guldengroschen currency union in the 15th century aimed to standardize a coin type across certain German-speaking regions. However, these currency unions were relatively limited in their geographical scope and did not encompass the entire Holy Roman Empire. By and large, the empire lacked a unified currency throughout its complex and diverse political landscape."},{"instruction":"Why did states in the Holy Roman Empire swear allegiance to the Emperor?","output":"States in the Holy Roman Empire often pledged allegiance to the Emperor for several reasons, including political, legal, and strategic considerations. Here are some key factors that influenced their decision: 1. Imperial Protection: By swearing allegiance to the Emperor, states gained a degree of protection and security from external threats, such as invasions by neighboring territories or foreign powers. The Emperor was seen as the figurehead and defender of the empire as a whole, and his support could be crucial in times of conflict or crisis. 2. Legal and Jurisdictional Authority: The Emperor held significant legal and jurisdictional powers within the empire. States that pledged allegiance benefited from the imperial legal system, including accessing the Imperial Court and relying on imperial law as a basis for governance. This allowed them to seek justice, resolve disputes, and enforce their rights within the imperial framework. 3. Imperial Privileges and Benefits: Pledging allegiance to the Emperor could result in various privileges and benefits for a state. Some states were granted special status and exemptions from certain taxes or obligations. They might also be granted the right to mint coins, bear coats of arms, or have a voice in the Imperial Diet, which was the representative assembly of the empire. 4. Political Legitimacy and Prestige: Aligning with the Emperor provided a sense of political legitimacy and prestige for a state. It reinforced their regional authority and position within the empire, particularly when seeking recognition and support from other states. 5. Diplomatic Alliances: Swearing allegiance to the Emperor could serve as a means to forge alliances and secure diplomatic relations with other states within the empire. It provided a common ground and shared identity that could facilitate cooperation and negotiations. It's important to note that the relationship between the Emperor and the various states within the Holy Roman Empire was complex and often influenced by shifting political dynamics, regional ambitions, and individual interests. The motivations for swearing allegiance were multifaceted and varied depending on the specific context and time period."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet and Changed x Naruto: Changed planet. harem (https://changed.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Transfurs: Lilac, Carol and Milla) x Naruto (Naruto as Colin). part 1","output":"Title: Freedom Planet and Changed x Naruto: Changed Planet - Harem Part 1 --- Chapter 1: A Mysterious Portal In the bustling city of Shang Mu, Lilac, Carol, and Milla continued their adventures as the heroes of Avalice.

This level of transparency also helps to minimize rumors and misconceptions, as information is shared openly and consistently. Additionally, a communication plan allows for effective coordination and collaboration among employees. It outlines the channels and methods through which information is shared, preventing information silos and ensuring everyone is on the same page. This can lead to improved teamwork and efficiency, as employees have the information they need to make informed decisions and work towards common goals. A well-designed communication plan also facilitates effective crisis management. In times of crises or emergencies, timely and accurate communication is crucial. With a communication plan in place, organizations can quickly disseminate important information, provide guidance, and address concerns, enabling them to manage crises more effectively. Furthermore, a communication plan helps organizations maintain positive relationships with their customers and external stakeholders. Effective communication with customers can build loyalty and trust, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive business growth. Regularly updating external stakeholders through various communication channels, such as press releases or social media, can also enhance the organization's reputation and maintain a positive public image. In conclusion, an effective communication plan is essential for organizations to thrive.

The water turns murky, and small fish float to the surface, their bellies upturned. INT. SHREK'S SWAMP - KITCHEN - NIGHT Shrek emerges from the pond, refreshed and ready for dinner, holding a fish he managed to catch while disrupting the pond's ecosystem. SHREK (evil grin) Fresh catch of the day! Dinner is served. INT. SHREK'S SWAMP - DINING AREA - NIGHT Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots sit at the dinner table again. The ambiance, however, is distinctly less inviting. Plates are stacked with various unappealing dishes - fish guts, slimy algae, and even a few frog eyeballs. DONKEY (nauseated) Shrek, I think I lost my appetite. SHREK (savoring the moment) Well, that's a shame, Donkey. More for me! Shrek, with an insatiable hunger, once again dives into the grotesque feast, consuming the unappetizing food with fervor, Iggy Pop's \\"Lust for Life\\" playing in the background.

Here, in a realm defined by its ever-shifting landscape, imposing dungeons erupt from the very earth like colossal, twisted trees, each one bringing with them untold secrets and the promise of unimaginable wealth. Life thrives in the shadows of these imposing fortresses, as towns and cities are built on the peripheries of these grand labyrinths, with many eager to stake their claim to the riches hidden within. And yet, whispered amongst hushed conversations in the dimly-lit corners of crowded taverns across the land, strange rumors persist of a place unlike any other. Far from the hustle and bustle of civilization, nestled between pastel-colored terrain and the rock candy mountains of the distant, scarcely-charted Candy Continent, stands a tower that promises not gold nor jewels, but rewards even more tantalizing: endless, sumptuous indulgence. For it was no ordinary above-ground dungeon - it was the fabled Sugary Spire, a sky-scraping, sweet tooth's wet dream come true, where the walls are forged from the finest cake layers, and where rivers of hot fudge and cold soda flow through the vast, echoing chambers, and every surface is perfectly edible and safe to eat, from the floors, the walls, even the ceiling can be snapped or tugged right off; the only true danger one would find inside was perhaps a distended waistline. The very air within is alive with the sweet scent of freshly-baked delicacies, and every corner conceals yet another scrumptious secret, waiting to be devoured. It's gossiped that anybody who enters the Spire never leaves with quite the same physique they had beforehand, with a delightfully ballooned midsection the size and roundness of a yoga ball taking up their front, as well as a hefty bust and widened hips to match, mostly in part to its overly hospitable confectionery citizens who have a tendency to overfeed/forcibly stuff any visitors with their excess of sweets as their unique way of a warm welcome, whether or not their guests are actually hungry or willing to be fed... though others say that those who draw near the Spire are temporarily put under a mild hypnosis when in the presence of the Spire, experiencing a slight yet constant hunger that only fades once they exit, and that the strange beings within intentionally exploit this to cram as many desserts into the mouths of those who enter and ensure they don't get a chance to leave until they're enormous. And what, exactly, was held at the very top of this delectable citadel? The mother of all desserts, or perhaps something even greater in value, an object that transcends description itself? Nobody knew! The only way for one to find out was to ascend it themselves! As was natural with the discovery of any newly uncovered location rich with loot waiting to be plundered of its prizes, not soon after the awareness of such a tantalizing treat reached the eyes and ears of the Shukuru Town locals that the job board had a new posting on it, just waiting for somebody to snatch it up, and even sooner did a curious pair of eyes find it: a tiny, fluffy puppy by the name of Cinnamoroll. Though Cinnamoroll was certainly not the explorative nor the combative type, instead choosing to happily run a small yet quite popular cafe in Shukuru Town alongside his similar puppy friends, the idea of a towering bastion packed full of sweets, let alone made up out of sweets, was simply too good to turn down and gave him the motivation to grab some protective gear from the nearby shop and disembark towards the caramelized continent, hoping to nab some exclusive baked goods from within the Spire for his cafe... but he wouldn't be heading in there alone, for he wasn't the only one interested in it; Lovelitchi, a cute teenage singer from Tama Street secretly living a double life as a famous idol; her two best platonic friends, Melodytchi, an upbeat, fun-loving violinist, and Pianitchi, a bashful pianist; and Ruby, an anthropomorphic bunny wizard hailing from the distant sparkling land of JewelLand, had also caught wind of the delicious opportunity from their own homelands and wanted in on the tasty fun! And so the five of them set off together, their imaginations wild and their tastebuds tingling at the thought of what could possibly be inside... Cinnamoroll is a tiny, bipedal puppy with a large head and small, rotund body with big floppy lop ears and a curled up tail that resembles a cinnamon roll, his most prominent feature, which is where he got his name. His enormous ears stick out the sides of his head and gift him with the ability of flight; by simply flapping these ears, Cinnamoroll can effortlessly float and glide through the air swiftly and elegantly, a skill he utilizes to quickly take and deliver orders within his cafe. His face alone radiates innocence and caring, with his big blue eyes, pink cheeks and seemingly-permanent smile instantly transmitting the message that he just wants to be kind to everyone he meets, and combined with his welcoming and understanding disposition, many give his cafe a visit just to look upon this long-eared wonder pup. Cinnamoroll is not the hurting type; confrontation scares him and the thought of harming someone, even by accident or if they plan to hurt him first, frightens him greatly. Lovelitchi is a sweet teenage girl from Tama Street, known for her white, fluffy body and lovely singing voice. Her large head is of equal size to her relatively-tiny-looking body, with two large, downy ears that jut out the top of her head, the base of said ears adorned with a ring of beads for her right, and a clip of two hearts for her left. Her facial features radiate cuteness all by themselves, with two big sparkling green eyes and a big, sweet smile, and she always wears a long pink dress with white trimming and a big blue bow at the neck, blue stockings, a large poofy diaper that the hem of her dress scarcely conceals, and carries a pink heart-shaped purse that holds her famous microphone. What many do not know about her, however (aside from her closest friends), is that she is also one of the most famous pop star idols on the planet, under the stage name of Lovelin. Yes, Lovelin and Lovelitchi are in fact one and the same; during the daytime, Lovelitchi brings out her sweet, caring self, and at night, she taps into her alter ego, Lovelin, performing dazzling shows and belting out incredible song to the tune of delightful music to an audience of thousands, with none of them the wiser as to her true identity. Lovelitchi is very kind and helpful to those in need of aid, but easily discouraged and sometimes doubts her own singing ability. Melodytchi is an exuberant teenage girl from Melody Land, a music-loving town close to Tama Street from where her best friend Lovelitchi lives. Like Lovelitchi, her head is as big as her body, with two pointed, cat-like ears atop her head, covered by a black hat adorned with a clip-on heart. She wears violet overalls with a black undershirt and black stockings, a big diaper under said overalls and a pair of purple teardrop-shaped earrings. Melodytchi is much more enthusiastic, outgoing and adventurous than the relatively reserved Lovelitchi, being a natural optimist with little sense of danger and an excellent violinist. Her prized violin is her closest possession, even going so far to call it her \\"friend\\". She loves sweets and can hardly help herself when she witnesses an abundance of them. Pianitchi is an easygoing teenage girl from Melody Land, living within the same town as her close friend Melodytchi. Akin to her two friends, her head is just as big as the rest of her body, sporting two curls at the sides of her head and an additional curl across her forehead, and having cat-like ears similar to Melodytchi's that poke out of the top of her head. Pianitchi loves music, especially the piano, and always carries around a electronic touchscreen tablet called a \\"Smapi\\", which can display and mimic a variety of instruments to play on it. Pianitchi wears a simple flowing pink dress with a red necktie, violet stockings, a huge puffy diaper that the length of her dress just barely hides, and an oversized violet beret which covers the entirety of the top of her head, with a small letter \\"p\\" adorned on the front. Her purple eyes always light up in joy whenever she plays or hears the harmonious notes that could only come from a piano. Pianitchi is an easygoing, albeit often anxious and bashful girl, and is a bit more uptight than the likes of Lovelitchi or Melodytchi, which isn't helped by the both of them often encouraging her to join them in doing things she'd rather have no part in. Ruby is a bipedal white rabbit hailing from the distant land of JewelLand, a world full of glittering, radiant gems and inhabited by a race of magical sapient animals with jewels for eyes called Jewelpets, with Ruby being one such Jewelpet. Ruby wears a pink bead necklace with two ruby cherries and a sakura flower at the base of one of her ears and sports quite downy fur. Unlike her magical brethren, Ruby is not very smart, being a total airhead that's usually completely oblivious to what's happening around her and barely listening when somebody is speaking, and strongly dislikes putting time in studying, considering it a waste of time when she could rather be having fun outdoors by herself, a fact that doesn't contribute to her already unremarkable intelligence; her magic is rarely ever successful, either resulting in absolutely nothing or a huge explosion. Despite this, in the rare times that her magic does succeed, it can be quite powerful, and for what she lacks in smarts, she makes up for in sheer passion towards making and having her own fun.

The tower stands tall and magnificent before them, its exterior composed of layer upon layer of delectable cake, decorated with intricate frosting designs and sprinkles that glisten under the warm sunlight. The air is thick with the irresistible aroma of freshly baked treats, and the distant sound of bubbling fudge and fizzy soda can be heard. Cinnamoroll gazes up at the towering confection, his floppy ears perking with excitement. Lovelitchi, Melodytchi, and Pianitchi are equally captivated, their eyes wide with wonder as they take in the sugary spectacle. Ruby, ever the airhead, bounces up and down with joy, completely unaware of the delicate balance between temptation and danger that lies within. Before them, a grand entrance beckons, its archway formed by two giant lollipops that shimmer with a rainbow of colors. As they step inside, the scent of sweetness intensifies, enveloping them in a warm embrace. The interior is a feast for the eyes, with walls made of soft, fluffy marshmallow and floors covered in a layer of thick, gooey caramel. The party finds themselves standing in a massive foyer, where a spiraling staircase made entirely of chocolate leads upward into the higher levels of the Spire. The surroundings are alive with movement, as tiny confectionery creatures scurry about, their bodies fashioned from various candies and sweets, each one seemingly friendly and eager to assist. A small creature resembling a gumdrop with googly eyes approaches the party, extending its squishy hand in a welcoming gesture. It speaks in a high-pitched voice, \\"Greetings, esteemed adventurers! Welcome to the Sugary Spire, a place where your wildest dessert dreams come true. My name is Gummy, and I shall be your guide on this sweet adventure.\\" The party nods in gratitude, their bellies starting to rumble in anticipation. Gummy explains that venturing further into the Spire will require solving various confectionery puzzles and facing challenges tailored to test their sweet tooth. Success will not only grant them access to higher levels but also uncover the secrets of this delicious abode. With renewed determination, our heroes steel themselves for the journey ahead. They know the path will be filled with temptation, but they remain focused on their goal: to obtain delectable treats to enhance Cinnamoroll's cafe, delight their taste buds, and perhaps uncover the ultimate reward said to be at the Spire's peak. Now, dear adventurer, it is time to take charge of our party of five. What will their first move be? Will they ascend the chocolate staircase with Cinnamoroll leading the way, or will they explore the foyer further?

A gentle breeze ruffled their hair, bringing with it the scent of flowers and the promise of a summer evening. \\"Hey, Gabriel,\\" Amelie said, breaking the peaceful silence. \\"Do you ever wonder what it's like to fly?\\" Gabriel turned to her, his golden irises glowing softly in the fading light. His wings, hidden beneath the comfort of his human form, ached to be released, to stretch out and catch the wind. \\"All the time,\\" he admitted, his voice tinged with sadness. \\"But I can't. Not here.\\" Amelie's devilish red eyes shimmered with understanding. \\"I know,\\" she replied, her tail flicking against the grass. \\"It's the same for me.\\" Though the pair had kept their true identities hidden from the world, they had confided in each other, knowing that their bond was strong enough to withstand their heavenly and hellish origins. Their secret love had flourished, blossoming through stolen glances, whispered words, and secret meetings like these. Amelie reached out her hand, her lavender skin contrasting with Gabriel's pale fingers as they intertwined. \\"But maybe... just for tonight, we can dream.\\" Gabriel hesitated only for a moment before giving her a gentle smile. \\"Let's dream, Amelie.\\" Their eyes met, and in that shared moment, their surroundings shifted. The grassy hill transformed into a vast tapestry of stars, twinkling and winking at them from above. The illusion was their secret, a celestial truth that only they could perceive.

For the first time in years, he felt the freedom of flight as he soared above the hill, Amelie soaring beside him. Amelie's true form emerged as well, her lavender skin radiant against the backdrop of the night sky. Her black sclera and red irises seemed to burn with an inner fire, and her bat wings carried her effortlessly through the starlit air.

They swooped over mountains and glided through valleys, their angelic and devilish forms intertwining in a graceful dance. In this timeless embrace, they were free from the expectations and limitations that had bound them on Earth. But as the first rays of dawn began to break through the night, their celestial forms slowly faded away. Gabriel and Amelie gently landed back on the grassy hill, once again adorned in their human appearances.

Amelie nodded, her tail curling around her legs. \\"Just remember that even though we can't fly here, we'll always have our dreams.\\" Gabriel wrapped his arm around her, pulling her closer. \\"And each other,\\" he added, his gaze filled with unwavering devotion. Together, they ventured off the grassy hill, ready to face the world with their secret intact.

But she was determined to continue for him. \\"The sun hung from a string, looking down on the world as it warms over everything.\\" Gabriel called out for Amelie's hand, as she softly grabbed his. His human form dissipated as his angelic form came through. Gabriel sang: \\"Chills run down my spine, as our fingers entwine and your sighs harmonize with mine. Unmistakably, I can still feel your heart beat fast when you dance with me.\\" Amelie sang a verse, also ditching her human form and exposing her devilish form: \\"We got older, and I should've known, that I feel colder when I walk alone. So I may as well ditch my dismay.\\" Gabriel sang once again: \\"Circle me and the needle moves gracefully back and forth. If my heart was a compass, you'd be north.

Gabriel, with his sandy hair and bright blue eyes, reached out and took Amelie's hand. He could feel her soft, lavender skin against his own, and it sent a warm sensation through his entire being. They often sought solace in each other's presence, finding comfort and understanding in the midst of their hidden secrets. \\"Amelie,\\" Gabriel whispered, his voice barely audible over the rustling of the leaves. \\"Do you ever wonder what it would be like if the world knew who we truly are?\\" Amelie twirled a strand of her raven-black hair around her finger, contemplating his question. Her eyes, a deep shade of red in her human form, gazed intently into Gabriel's golden irises. \\"Sometimes, Gabriel,\\" she replied, her voice filled with a mix of longing and sadness. \\"But the world can be cruel and unforgiving. We've seen it time and time again.\\" Gabriel nodded, his wings twitching slightly beneath his human guise, aching to stretch out and bask in the sunlight. He understood the weight of their secrets and realized the importance of keeping them hidden. It was the only way they could experience love and acceptance in its purest form. With a sigh, Gabriel leaned in closer to Amelie, resting his head on her shoulder. \\"I'm grateful for this, you know. Our little haven away from everything, where we can simply be us.\\" Amelie turned her head to press a tender kiss on Gabriel's forehead. \\"Me too, Gabriel. Our love is stronger than our true forms, our wings, horns, and everything in between. As long as we have each other, we have everything we need.\\" They stayed there for hours, basking in each other's warmth, and watching the world go by. Gabriel's wings may have been hidden, and Amelie's horns may have been out of sight, but their love soared high above any mortal understanding. It was the kind of love that transcended boundaries and defied expectations. In this quiet moment on the hill, Gabriel and Amelie found refuge in each other's arms, knowing that together, they could face anything that came their way. Their journey was just beginning, their secrets tightly woven into the fabric of their beings. But for now, they would allow themselves to be fully present in each other's embrace, cherishing the innocence of their young love atop the peaceful grassy hill."},{"instruction":"They continued to date, all the way until both turned 14. One night, Amelie was brewing up a small spell, attempting to summon something. As Gabriel catches what his devil girlfriend was doing, he was “attacked” so to speak like a torrent of large strawberries. Gabriel’s favorite food. Realizing she might’ve just injured her angel boyfriend, Amelie once more dissolved her human form and into her devil form, hoping to save Gabriel, which she did. Gabriel couldn’t help but laugh at the whole thing, his human form also gone and his wings and halo appearing, replacing Amelie’s worry into happiness.","output":"As Amelie's devil form enveloped Gabriel, shielding him from the strawberry onslaught, he felt a surge of warmth and protection wash over him. His human form dissolved, revealing his true angelic self with wings spread wide and a radiant halo above his head. Gabriel's golden irises shimmered with joy and amusement as he looked at Amelie's transformed devil form. With a twinkle in his eyes, Gabriel chuckled, his voice carrying a melody only celestial beings could produce. \\"Amelie, you never cease to surprise me,\\" he said, his angelic wings fluttering gently. \\"Who knew that a spell gone slightly awry could result in such a delightful shower of strawberries?\\" Amelie's lavender skin flushed slightly, a mixture of embarrassment and relief washing over her. Her bat wings folded behind her and her tail wagged nervously. \\"I... I'm sorry, Gabriel,\\" she stammered, her red irises gleaming with both worry and affection. \\"I didn't mean for it to go wrong like that. I just wanted to create a small enchantment as a surprise for you.\\" Gabriel reached out, gently cupping Amelie's face in his hands. \\"No apologies are needed, my love,\\" he said, a soft smile gracing his lips. \\"Your intentions were pure, and you saved me from the strawberry assault, after all. Besides, it brought out our true forms, and now we can be completely ourselves with each other.\\" Amelie's worry melted away, replaced by a blossoming happiness. She leaned into Gabriel's touch, her devilish horns brushing against his glowing halo. \\"You're right, Gabriel,\\" she whispered, her voice filled with newfound confidence. \\"We should embrace who we truly are. Our wings, our horns, our unique selves. They are a part of us, and they make us who we are.\\" In that moment, they both realized that their true forms were not something to hide or be ashamed of. They were symbols of their love and their connection. Gabriel's golden wings wrapped around Amelie, shielding her from any self-doubt or insecurity. Amelie's bat wings stretched out, intertwining with Gabriel's feathers, creating a beautiful harmony between their angelic and devilish traits. Hand in hand, their true forms embracing, they stood together as a reminder that love knows no boundaries, not even those defined by Heaven and Hell. Their laughter filled the air, a symphony of celestial and infernal joy, as they reveled in the magic of their shared existence. From that day forward, Gabriel and Amelie walked the world as their true selves, radiating love and acceptance wherever they went. Their wings stretched wide, their halos and horns shining bright, they defied expectations and showed the world that love could transcend even the deepest divides. And on top of that grassy hill, the place where their love first bloomed, they returned time and time again, cherishing the memories of strawberries and laughter, and the realization that their young love could withstand anything that came their way."},{"instruction":"Gabriel couldn’t help but sing about it. “A grass-blade flashed with a gleam as it slashed open a moon-beam, and I stared back breathlessly. As mountains of fruit tumbled out, I barely had the chance to shout. A strawberry avalanche crashed over me.” His voice was something Amelie could never get tired of, her wings fluttering with happiness, as she sang back a different set of lyrics to the same melody of Gabriel’s: “When we woke up buried alive beneath a fruity landslide, we both laughed hysterically. It could have been just another dream, but I swear I heard you scream. A strawberry avalanche crashed over me.”","output":"Their laughter intertwined with their harmonious voices, blending together in a symphony of love and joy. Gabriel and Amelie sang their hearts out, their melodies soaring through the air, carrying their shared happiness to the heavens above. As they sang, their voices wove a tapestry of their unique journey, their strawberry-filled mishap becoming a beautiful metaphor for the unexpected adventures their love had brought them. The lyrics spoke of their unbreakable bond, the way they found solace and strength in each other's arms. With each verse, their voices resonated with the magic of their connection, echoing through the grassy hill and beyond. The world seemed to hush, captivated by their song, as if nature itself paused to listen to the celestial and infernal duet. Their wings and tails swayed to the rhythm of the music, their true forms glowing with ethereal light. Gabriel's golden irises shimmered, and Amelie's red irises sparkled, mirroring the love they felt for one another. They were lost in the moment, their voices carrying a message of acceptance, resilience, and the power of love. As the song came to an end, Gabriel and Amelie stood in silence, their eyes locked, the world around them seeming to hold its breath. It was in this moment that they realized the impact their love had, not only on each other but on the world around them. The grassy hill, once a place of solace, had transformed into a stage where they could share their voices, their love, and their true selves with the world. And in that moment, they made a silent promise to continue singing their unique songs, spreading love and acceptance wherever they went. Hand in hand, their wings brushing against each other's feathers, Gabriel and Amelie descended from the hill, ready to face whatever adventures awaited them. Their voices still carried the melody of their strawberry avalanche, a reminder of the magic they possessed and the power of their love. They knew that their journey as angel and devil was far from over, but they faced it with unwavering determination and an unbreakable bond. Together, they would continue to embrace their true selves and share their love with the world, one song at a time."},{"instruction":"One shouldn’t forget that these two are supernatural beings, as Gabriel and Amelie drank up the waters of the Great Lakes. They're also 14-year-olds, so the angel and devil couple’s attempt lasted at best, a minute, before giving up. As they lay on the grass, it was Amelie’s turn to begin a song. “We drank the Great Lakes like cold lemonade, and both got stomach aches. Sprawled out in the shade.” Gabriel immediately joined in, singing: \\" So bored to death you held your breath and I tried not to yawn.\\", prompting Amelie to reply in song: “You made my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone.”","output":"As they lay on the grass, their stomachs filled with the waters of the Great Lakes, Gabriel and Amelie couldn't help but laugh at their failed attempt to consume such vast quantities. Their supernatural abilities may have given them the power to do extraordinary things, but their youthful nature reminded them of their limitations. Amelie looked at Gabriel, her eyes twinkling mischievously, and then burst into song. \\"We drank the Great Lakes like cold lemonade, and both got stomach aches. Sprawled out in the shade,\\" she sang, her voice carrying a playful tone. Gabriel's laughter joined in, his angelic voice blending effortlessly with Amelie's melody. \\"So bored to death you held your breath, and I tried not to yawn,\\" he chimed in, his golden irises gleaming with amusement. Amelie's devilish grin widened as she continued their impromptu duet, her voice filled with joy. \\"You made my frown turn upside down, and now my worries are gone,\\" she sang, the lavender hue of her skin glowing with warmth. Their voices danced together, weaving a song of lightheartedness and shared laughter. The grass beneath them seemed to sway in rhythm with their music, as if nature itself joined in their duet. Their wings and tails twitched with excitement, their true forms radiating with a love that defied the boundaries of Heaven and Hell. As the song came to an end, Gabriel and Amelie couldn't help but collapse into a fit of giggles, their stomachs still filled with the waters they had consumed. The grassy hill embraced them, cradling their laughter and mirth as they lay side by side. In that moment, they realized that even in their supernatural forms, they were still just young teenagers, prone to silly antics and the occasional misadventure. Their love, though celestial and infernal in nature, was grounded in the simple joys of laughter and companionship. And so, they lay there, on the grassy hill, their laughter echoing in the wind, their hearts intertwined in a love that transcended their true forms. They knew that their journey as angel and devil continued, filled with more adventures and songs to be sung, but for now, they basked in the simple joy of being together, cherishing the moments that made them feel alive."},{"instruction":"What was the revolt depicted in Les Misérables?","output":"The revolt depicted in Les Misérables is known as the June Rebellion, also referred to as the Paris Uprising of 1832. It was an unsuccessful insurrection of Parisian university students and workers against the French monarchy under King Louis-Philippe. The uprising was triggered by the death of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque, a popular figure among the working class. The rebels, led by a group of idealistic students, barricaded the streets of Paris and fought against the government forces. However, they were ultimately suppressed by the military, resulting in heavy casualties and the failure of the rebellion. Victor Hugo portrays this revolt as an ultimate expression of the general discontent among the oppressed and marginalized classes in society."},{"instruction":"Who was the funeral that occurs before the rebellion in Les Misérables for? Were they a real person?","output":"The funeral that occurs before the rebellion in Les Misérables is for General Jean Maximilien Lamarque. While General Lamarque was a real historical figure, the events surrounding his funeral depicted in the novel are fictional. Victor Hugo uses Lamarque's death and funeral as a catalyst for igniting the uprising in the story. It is worth noting that the real General Lamarque was a prominent republican and a defender of the working class, making him a symbol for the grievances and frustrations of the lower classes during that time."},{"instruction":"How did his funeral go in real life? Was it related to the June Rebellion like in the novel?","output":"In real life, General Lamarque's funeral served as a catalyst for the June Rebellion, just like in the novel Les Misérables. However, there are some differences between the events depicted in the novel and what actually transpired. The real funeral of General Lamarque took place on June 5, 1832, and it was a significant event that attracted a large number of attendees. It is estimated that tens of thousands of people, including members of the working class, students, and republican activists, participated in the procession that followed Lamarque's funeral cortège. However, the funeral did not directly lead to the rebellion or serve as a planned starting point for an uprising, as portrayed in the novel. The June Rebellion was already being organized by various revolutionary and republican groups before Lamarque's death. His funeral provided an opportunity for these groups to express their grievances and to protest against the policies of the reigning monarchy. While the real-life funeral of General Lamarque did not have the exact same outcome as depicted in the novel, its symbolism and the atmosphere surrounding it certainly influenced the revolutionary sentiment of the time and, in a broader sense, the events that unfolded during the June Rebellion."},{"instruction":"Give a Really Shortest Backstory about Streets of Rage SEGA Game Series/SCP Foundation Merged Together x Naruto Crossover Timelines, SCP-9999: “Shiva, the Unstoppable God” meeting these hero characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno (Shiva’s Girlfriend #1), Shikamaru Nara, Hinata Hyuga (Shiva's Girlfriend #4), Rock Lee, Gaara, Jiraiya, Minato Namikaze (Fourth Hokage), Itachi Uchiha, Might Guy, Tsunade, Neji Hyuga, Tobirama Senju (Second Hokage), Hashirama Senju (First Hokage), Kushina Uzumaki, Asuma Sarutobi, Yamato, Kurenai Yuhi, Ino Yamanaka (Shiva’s Girlfriend #2), Choji Akimichi, Shino Aburame, Sai, Konohamaru Sarutobi, Iruka Umino, Killer Bee, Kakuzu, Nagato/Pain, Temari (Shiva’s Girlfriend #3), Kankuro, Darui, Omei, and Mei Terumi, and then later on meets the villains sometimes, Orochimaru, Itachi Uchiha, Akatsuki - A criminal organization composed of powerful rogue ninja, including members such as: Kisame Hoshigaki, Deidara, Sasori, Hidan, and Kakuzu, Zabuza Momochi, The Sound Four, Kabuto Yakushi, Obito Uchiha, Madara Uchiha, and Kaguya Otsutsuki, and SCP-9999: “Shiva, the Unstoppable God”, Object Class: Keter, Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9999 is to be contained within a specially-designed chamber equipped with high-intensity electromagnetic fields and reinforced titanium walls.

I'll find a way to outsmart you, no matter what. **As the training session continues, Ochaco starts strategizing, analyzing Leonardo's previous movements, searching for a blind spot or a weakness she can exploit.** Katsuki Bakugou: (Impressed) Look at that.

The people are known as: AMERICANS (or, much more rarely, SEPTENTRIANS). Capital: Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg Province, Confederation of Virginia Largest city: New York City, Amsterdam Province, Confederation of New York (1.8 million) Flag: The ‘Starry George’, a red cross on a dark blue field with five golden stars on the cross and nine small golden stars in the canton. The five stars represent the original five Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Carolina; the nine stars represent the present-day nine Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, (“Old”) Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Westernesse, Drakesland and Cygnia. Population: 54 million (based on estimated growth since 1890 census). Land area: ca. 1,000,000 lcf. Limited surveying of the far north, Greenland and the Antipodean interior introduce uncertainty to this figure. Economic ranking: Generally ranked 2nd in the world, with some caveats about whether British interests should be considered separately. Form of government: Federal Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy. Head of state: Emperor (also the King of Great Britain and Ireland). Head of government: Lord President (today generally just called President) who heads a government in the federal (or Imperial) Continental Parliament in Fredericksburg. The Continental Parliament has supreme sovereignty and exercises sole authority over foreign affairs, but many domestic issues are delegated to the Confederal governments which are considered the legal successors to the (larger number of) colonial governments predating the adoption of the American Constitution in 1788. Each Confederation is further divided into Provinces; the nature of provincial and municipal government is not constitutionally mandated and varies widely. Members of the Continental Parliament (MCPs) are elected from usually multi-member constituencies based on Provinces or cities (Burghs) within them by means of bloc vote first-past-the-post. This is centrally mandated but Confederations can decide their own electoral arrangements for their Confederal assemblies; in 1890 New England adopted the new electoral system of Modified American Percentage Representation (MAPR). Foreign relations: The ENA heads up an informal ‘Hanoverian’ alliance including the kingdoms in personal union of Great Britain, Ireland and Iceland, as well as dynastically unconnected nations such as the Kingdom of Venezuela. Americans have also tended to take a dominant position in the (formerly British) East India Company from Natal westwards, although the Royal Africa Company retains more Britons on its board of directors.The ENA is generally disinterested in Old World affairs beyond trade, but seeks to dominate the Novamund, which means an opposition to colonialism by outside powers (in particular Russia’s activities in Alyeska, New Muscovy and New Siberia). This also means the ENA has historically had variable relations with the UPSA, which has the same ultimate goal of Novamundine domination. The two countries played a part in each others’ founding and have been inextricably linked through trade ever since, despite the ruptures of the Third Platinean War and, more seriously, the Great American War. In the 1870s the bitter aftermath of the latter was eased by the ‘Seventies Thaw’ and agreements to share influence over countries such as Cuba and Mexico, but more recently both Supremacist rhetoric in the ENA and struggles over corporate domination in the UPSA have begun to make the northern and southern powers regard each other with more suspicion. Military: The ENA resisted the formation of a centralised Imperial army for some years due to public suspicion of a standing army (preferring the legal fiction that all American regiments were seconded parts of the British Army) but since the Inglorious Revolution in Great Britain, an American Army has existed with the Emperor as its formal commander-in –chief. The Imperial Navy’s formation was less controversial and it evolved naturally from the American Squadron of the Royal Navy. In 1877 the Imperial Aeroforce was split off as a separate service. America is also known for considering its Imperial Marines as an unofficial fourth service, stemming from filmish heroics in Admiral Warner’s West Indian campaign during the Great American War.

Capital: Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg Province, Confederation of Virginia Largest city: New York City, Amsterdam Province, Confederation of New York (1.8 million) Flag: The ‘Starry George’, a red cross on a dark blue field with five golden stars on the cross and nine small golden stars in the canton. The five stars represent the original five Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Carolina; the nine stars represent the present-day nine Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, (“Old”) Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Westernesse, Drakesland and Cygnia. Population: 54 million (based on estimated growth since 1890 census). Land area: ca. 1,000,000 lcf. Limited surveying of the far north, Greenland and the Antipodean interior introduce uncertainty to this figure. Economic ranking: Generally ranked 2nd in the world, with some caveats about whether British interests should be considered separately. Form of government: Federal Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy. Head of state: Emperor (also the King of Great Britain and Ireland). Head of government: Lord President (today generally just called President) who heads a government in the federal (or Imperial) Continental Parliament in Fredericksburg. The Continental Parliament has supreme sovereignty and exercises sole authority over foreign affairs, but many domestic issues are delegated to the Confederal governments which are considered the legal successors to the (larger number of) colonial governments predating the adoption of the American Constitution in 1788. Each Confederation is further divided into Provinces; the nature of provincial and municipal government is not constitutionally mandated and varies widely. Members of the Continental Parliament (MCPs) are elected from usually multi-member constituencies based on Provinces or cities (Burghs) within them by means of bloc vote first-past-the-post. This is centrally mandated but Confederations can decide their own electoral arrangements for their Confederal assemblies; in 1890 New England adopted the new electoral system of Modified American Percentage Representation (MAPR). Foreign relations: The ENA heads up an informal ‘Hanoverian’ alliance including the kingdoms in personal union of Great Britain, Ireland and Iceland, as well as dynastically unconnected nations such as the Kingdom of Venezuela. Americans have also tended to take a dominant position in the (formerly British) East India Company from Natal westwards, although the Royal Africa Company retains more Britons on its board of directors.The ENA is generally disinterested in Old World affairs beyond trade, but seeks to dominate the Novamund, which means an opposition to colonialism by outside powers (in particular Russia’s activities in Alyeska, New Muscovy and New Siberia). This also means the ENA has historically had variable relations with the UPSA, which has the same ultimate goal of Novamundine domination. The two countries played a part in each others’ founding and have been inextricably linked through trade ever since, despite the ruptures of the Third Platinean War and, more seriously, the Great American War. In the 1870s the bitter aftermath of the latter was eased by the ‘Seventies Thaw’ and agreements to share influence over countries such as Cuba and Mexico, but more recently both Supremacist rhetoric in the ENA and struggles over corporate domination in the UPSA have begun to make the northern and southern powers regard each other with more suspicion. Military: The ENA resisted the formation of a centralised Imperial army for some years due to public suspicion of a standing army (preferring the legal fiction that all American regiments were seconded parts of the British Army) but since the Inglorious Revolution in Great Britain, an American Army has existed with the Emperor as its formal commander-in –chief. The Imperial Navy’s formation was less controversial and it evolved naturally from the American Squadron of the Royal Navy. In 1877 the Imperial Aeroforce was split off as a separate service. America is also known for considering its Imperial Marines as an unofficial fourth service, stemming from filmish heroics in Admiral Warner’s West Indian campaign during the Great American War.

However, many domestic issues are delegated to the Confederal governments, which are considered the legal successors to the colonial governments predating the adoption of the American Constitution in 1788. France is divided into Confederations, each further divided into Provinces. The specific nature of provincial and municipal government is not constitutionally mandated and varies across regions. Members of the Continental Parliament, known as MCPs, are elected through a bloc vote first-past-the-post system from constituencies based on Provinces or cities (known as Burghs). While this electoral system is mandated at the federal level, Confederal assemblies within different Confederations can decide on their own electoral arrangements. For example, New England adopted the Modified American Percentage Representation (MAPR) system in 1890. In terms of foreign relations, France leads the informal 'Hanoverian' alliance, which includes the Kingdoms in personal union of Great Britain, Ireland, and Iceland, as well as other nations like the Kingdom of Venezuela. France has also played a dominant role in the East India Company, extending its influence from Natal westwards. However, the Royal Africa Company still maintains a larger British presence on its board of directors. France generally focuses on trade and is not heavily involved in Old World affairs. Instead, France seeks to dominate the Novamund region, opposing colonialism by external powers, particularly Russia. This shared goal of Novamundine domination has historically created both cooperation and tension between France and the UPSA. Although the countries have been linked through trade and played a role in each other's founding, the Supremacist rhetoric in France and struggles over corporate domination in the UPSA have recently led to increased suspicion between the northern and southern powers. France's military evolved over time. Initially, there was public suspicion of a standing army, and American regiments were considered seconded parts of the British Army. However, after the Inglorious Revolution in Great Britain, France established its own military, with the Emperor serving as the formal commander-in-chief. The Imperial Navy, which originated from the American Squadron of the Royal Navy, was formed with less controversy. In 1877, the Imperial Aeroforce was created as a separate service. France is also known for considering its Imperial Marines as an unofficial fourth service, with their reputation stemming from the heroic actions during Admiral Warner's West Indian campaign in the Great American War. Currently, Emperor George IV of the House of Hanover serves as the head of state, while President Stuart Jamison of the Supremacist Party holds the position of head of government."},{"instruction":"Give a Really Shortest Backstory about Streets of Rage SEGA Game Series/SCP Foundation Merged Together x Naruto Crossover Timelines, SCP-9999: “Shiva, the Unstoppable God” meeting these hero characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno (Shiva’s Girlfriend #1), Shikamaru Nara, Hinata Hyuga (Shiva’s Girlfriend #4), Rock Lee, Gaara, Jiraiya, Minato Namikaze (Fourth Hokage), Itachi Uchiha, Might Guy, Tsunade, Neji Hyuga, Tobirama Senju (Second Hokage), Hashirama Senju (First Hokage), Kushina Uzumaki, Asuma Sarutobi, Yamato, Kurenai Yuhi, Ino Yamanaka (Shiva’s Girlfriend #2), Choji Akimichi, Shino Aburame, Sai, Konohamaru Sarutobi, Iruka Umino, Killer Bee, Kakuzu, Nagato/Pain, Temari (Shiva’s Girlfriend #3), Kankuro, Darui, Omei, and Mei Terumi, and then later on meets the villains sometimes, Orochimaru, Itachi Uchiha, Akatsuki - A criminal organization composed of powerful rogue ninja, including members such as: Kisame Hoshigaki, Deidara, Sasori, Hidan, and Kakuzu, Zabuza Momochi, The Sound Four, Kabuto Yakushi, Obito Uchiha, Madara Uchiha, and Kaguya Otsutsuki, and SCP-9999: “Shiva, the Unstoppable God”, Object Class: Keter, Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9999 is to be contained within a specially-designed chamber equipped with high-intensity electromagnetic fields and reinforced titanium walls.

The five stars represent the original five Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Carolina; the nine stars represent the present-day nine Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, (“Old”) Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Westernesse, Drakesland and Cygnia.

Head of government: Lord President (today generally just called President) who heads a government in the federal (or Imperial) Continental Parliament in Fredericksburg. The Continental Parliament has supreme sovereignty and exercises sole authority over foreign affairs, but many domestic issues are delegated to the Confederal governments which are considered the legal successors to the (larger number of) colonial governments predating the adoption of the American Constitution in 1788. Each Confederation is further divided into Provinces; the nature of provincial and municipal government is not constitutionally mandated and varies widely. Members of the Continental Parliament (MCPs) are elected from usually multi-member constituencies based on Provinces or cities (Burghs) within them by means of bloc vote first-past-the-post.

Americans have also tended to take a dominant position in the (formerly British) East India Company from Natal westwards, although the Royal Africa Company retains more Britons on its board of directors.The ENA is generally disinterested in Old World affairs beyond trade, but seeks to dominate the Novamund, which means an opposition to colonialism by outside powers (in particular Russia’s activities in Alyeska, New Muscovy and New Siberia). This also means the ENA has historically had variable relations with the UPSA, which has the same ultimate goal of Novamundine domination. The two countries played a part in each others’ founding and have been inextricably linked through trade ever since, despite the ruptures of the Third Platinean War and, more seriously, the Great American War. In the 1870s the bitter aftermath of the latter was eased by the ‘Seventies Thaw’ and agreements to share influence over countries such as Cuba and Mexico, but more recently both Supremacist rhetoric in the ENA and struggles over corporate domination in the UPSA have begun to make the northern and southern powers regard each other with more suspicion. Military: The ENA resisted the formation of a centralised Imperial army for some years due to public suspicion of a standing army (preferring the legal fiction that all American regiments were seconded parts of the British Army) but since the Inglorious Revolution in Great Britain, an American Army has existed with the Emperor as its formal commander-in –chief. The Imperial Navy’s formation was less controversial and it evolved naturally from the American Squadron of the Royal Navy. In 1877 the Imperial Aeroforce was split off as a separate service.

Alors qu'elle s'enhardissait dans cette relation, Marie découvrit finalement la vérité sur Mylène. Elle n'était ni une folle, ni une hallucination, ni un fantôme, ni une extraterrestre. Mylène était une femme qui avait également vécu une expérience similaire, une confusion et un mystère tout aussi profond que Marie. Elles étaient toutes les deux confrontées à une réalité qu'elles ne pouvaient pas expliquer, mais elles étaient prêtes à l'accepter et à se soutenir mutuellement. En fin de compte, Marie comprit que peu importe les explications rationnelles ou les réponses concrètes, elle avait trouvé quelque chose de spécial avec Mylène.

The people are known as: AMERICANS (or, much more rarely, SEPTENTRIANS). Capital: Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg Province, Confederation of Virginia Largest city: New York City, Amsterdam Province, Confederation of New York (1.8 million) Flag: The ‘Starry George’, a red cross on a dark blue field with five golden stars on the cross and nine small golden stars in the canton. The five stars represent the original five Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Carolina; the nine stars represent the present-day nine Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, (“Old”) Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Westernesse, Drakesland and Cygnia. Population: 54 million (based on estimated growth since 1890 census). Land area: ca. 1,000,000 lcf. Limited surveying of the far north, Greenland and the Antipodean interior introduce uncertainty to this figure. Economic ranking: Generally ranked 2nd in the world, with some caveats about whether British interests should be considered separately. Form of government: Federal Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy. Head of state: Emperor (also the King of Great Britain and Ireland). Head of government: Lord President (today generally just called President) who heads a government in the federal (or Imperial) Continental Parliament in Fredericksburg. The Continental Parliament has supreme sovereignty and exercises sole authority over foreign affairs, but many domestic issues are delegated to the Confederal governments which are considered the legal successors to the (larger number of) colonial governments predating the adoption of the American Constitution in 1788. Each Confederation is further divided into Provinces; the nature of provincial and municipal government is not constitutionally mandated and varies widely. Members of the Continental Parliament (MCPs) are elected from usually multi-member constituencies based on Provinces or cities (Burghs) within them by means of bloc vote first-past-the-post. This is centrally mandated but Confederations can decide their own electoral arrangements for their Confederal assemblies; in 1890 New England adopted the new electoral system of Modified American Percentage Representation (MAPR). Foreign relations: The ENA heads up an informal ‘Hanoverian’ alliance including the kingdoms in personal union of Great Britain, Ireland and Iceland, as well as dynastically unconnected nations such as the Kingdom of Venezuela. Americans have also tended to take a dominant position in the (formerly British) East India Company from Natal westwards, although the Royal Africa Company retains more Britons on its board of directors.The ENA is generally disinterested in Old World affairs beyond trade, but seeks to dominate the Novamund, which means an opposition to colonialism by outside powers (in particular Russia’s activities in Alyeska, New Muscovy and New Siberia). This also means the ENA has historically had variable relations with the UPSA, which has the same ultimate goal of Novamundine domination. The two countries played a part in each others’ founding and have been inextricably linked through trade ever since, despite the ruptures of the Third Platinean War and, more seriously, the Great American War. In the 1870s the bitter aftermath of the latter was eased by the ‘Seventies Thaw’ and agreements to share influence over countries such as Cuba and Mexico, but more recently both Supremacist rhetoric in the ENA and struggles over corporate domination in the UPSA have begun to make the northern and southern powers regard each other with more suspicion. Military: The ENA resisted the formation of a centralised Imperial army for some years due to public suspicion of a standing army (preferring the legal fiction that all American regiments were seconded parts of the British Army) but since the Inglorious Revolution in Great Britain, an American Army has existed with the Emperor as its formal commander-in –chief. The Imperial Navy’s formation was less controversial and it evolved naturally from the American Squadron of the Royal Navy. In 1877 the Imperial Aeroforce was split off as a separate service. America is also known for considering its Imperial Marines as an unofficial fourth service, stemming from filmish heroics in Admiral Warner’s West Indian campaign during the Great American War.

Otherwise, it will to be hard to justify the NIO stock rally that’s been in progress since early June. Nio’s shareholders should be prepared for a pullback, and might even consider selling before it’s too late. Nio still has to compete against rival EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as well as Chinese automakers. There was a bit of positive news on that front, but now it appears to have been canceled. All in all, 2023’s second half could be rough for Nio and its investors. Good News and Bad News for NIO Stock Not long ago, Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao considered NIO stock a “show-me” stock. It will “take a few more rounds of guidance ‘meet or beat’ to fully restore market confidence in NIO, in our view,” Hsiao declared.","output":"中国的电动汽车制造商尼欧（NYSE：NIO）需要一个积极的推动因素 - 越早越好。否则，很难为自6月初以来一直在进行的NIO股票反弹找到合理的理由。 尼欧的股东应该为回调做好准备，甚至可能考虑在为时已晚之前出售。 尼欧仍然需要与竞争对手特斯拉（NASDAQ：TSLA）以及中国汽车制造商竞争。曾经有一些积极的消息，但现在似乎已经被取消。总而言之，2023年下半年可能对尼欧及其投资者而言会很艰难。 NIO股票的好消息和坏消息 不久前，摩根士丹利分析师赫萧（Tim Hsiao）认为NIO股票是一个“展示型”股票。他宣称，“需要几轮更多的指引‘达标或超越’才能完全恢复市场对NIO的信心。”"},{"instruction":"用中文翻译I tend to agree with Hsiao’s misgivings concerning Nio. The automaker delivered 10,707 vehicles in June 2023, which is around 17% less than the 12,961 vehicles that Nio delivered in June of last year. Furthermore, as Eddie Pan pointed out, Nio’s vehicle deliveries for the three months ended June 30 were down 6% year over year. Yet, NIO stock jumped from around 7.50 at the beginning of June to more than 10. There was some optimism recently as Tesla and 15 other EV manufacturers in China, including Nio, signed a fair-competition agreement brokered by the China Association of Auto Manufacturers. The participating automakers reportedly pledged to avoid “abnormal pricing.” Nio would have benefited from this agreement, as it may have prevented Tesla from slashing its EV prices in China.","output":"我倾向于同意赫萧对尼欧的担忧。该汽车制造商在2023年6月交付了10,707辆车，比去年同期尼欧交付的12,961辆车减少了约17%。 此外，正如Eddie Pan指出的那样，截至6月30日的三个月内，尼欧的车辆交付量同比下降了6%。 然而，NIO股票从6月初的约7.50美元飙升到超过10美元。最近，特斯拉和中国包括尼欧在内的其他15家电动汽车制造商签署了由中国汽车工业协会撮合的公平竞争协议，这引发了一些乐观情绪。 据报道，参与的汽车制造商承诺避免“异常定价”。尼欧本可以从这份协议中受益，因为它可能阻止特斯拉在中国大幅降低其电动车价格。"},{"instruction":"Can you write a primer on Laos in the style of the following excerpt: \\"The country’s official name is: EMPIRE OF NORTH AMERICA (ENA). The people are known as: AMERICANS (or, much more rarely, SEPTENTRIANS). Capital: Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg Province, Confederation of Virginia Largest city: New York City, Amsterdam Province, Confederation of New York (1.8 million) Flag: The ‘Starry George’, a red cross on a dark blue field with five golden stars on the cross and nine small golden stars in the canton. The five stars represent the original five Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Carolina; the nine stars represent the present-day nine Confederations of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, (“Old”) Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Westernesse, Drakesland and Cygnia. Population: 54 million (based on estimated growth since 1890 census). Land area: ca. 1,000,000 lcf. Limited surveying of the far north, Greenland and the Antipodean interior introduce uncertainty to this figure. Economic ranking: Generally ranked 2nd in the world, with some caveats about whether British interests should be considered separately. Form of government: Federal Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy. Head of state: Emperor (also the King of Great Britain and Ireland). Head of government: Lord President (today generally just called President) who heads a government in the federal (or Imperial) Continental Parliament in Fredericksburg. The Continental Parliament has supreme sovereignty and exercises sole authority over foreign affairs, but many domestic issues are delegated to the Confederal governments which are considered the legal successors to the (larger number of) colonial governments predating the adoption of the American Constitution in 1788. Each Confederation is further divided into Provinces; the nature of provincial and municipal government is not constitutionally mandated and varies widely. Members of the Continental Parliament (MCPs) are elected from usually multi-member constituencies based on Provinces or cities (Burghs) within them by means of bloc vote first-past-the-post. This is centrally mandated but Confederations can decide their own electoral arrangements for their Confederal assemblies; in 1890 New England adopted the new electoral system of Modified American Percentage Representation (MAPR). Foreign relations: The ENA heads up an informal ‘Hanoverian’ alliance including the kingdoms in personal union of Great Britain, Ireland and Iceland, as well as dynastically unconnected nations such as the Kingdom of Venezuela. Americans have also tended to take a dominant position in the (formerly British) East India Company from Natal westwards, although the Royal Africa Company retains more Britons on its board of directors.The ENA is generally disinterested in Old World affairs beyond trade, but seeks to dominate the Novamund, which means an opposition to colonialism by outside powers (in particular Russia’s activities in Alyeska, New Muscovy and New Siberia). This also means the ENA has historically had variable relations with the UPSA, which has the same ultimate goal of Novamundine domination. The two countries played a part in each others’ founding and have been inextricably linked through trade ever since, despite the ruptures of the Third Platinean War and, more seriously, the Great American War. In the 1870s the bitter aftermath of the latter was eased by the ‘Seventies Thaw’ and agreements to share influence over countries such as Cuba and Mexico, but more recently both Supremacist rhetoric in the ENA and struggles over corporate domination in the UPSA have begun to make the northern and southern powers regard each other with more suspicion. Military: The ENA resisted the formation of a centralised Imperial army for some years due to public suspicion of a standing army (preferring the legal fiction that all American regiments were seconded parts of the British Army) but since the Inglorious Revolution in Great Britain, an American Army has existed with the Emperor as its formal commander-in –chief. The Imperial Navy’s formation was less controversial and it evolved naturally from the American Squadron of the Royal Navy. In 1877 the Imperial Aeroforce was split off as a separate service. America is also known for considering its Imperial Marines as an unofficial fourth service, stemming from filmish heroics in Admiral Warner’s West Indian campaign during the Great American War.
