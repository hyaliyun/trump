Three men rob a millionaire of diamonds aboard an airliner in flight. When Police Superintendent Benting tries to intervene, Jack Drake, another passenger, knocks him out to save him from being shot. The thieves force the pilot to land so they can dump the passengers. However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake).  Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction. The baroness tells her maid Annie that certain passages somehow remind her of Drake, who broke her heart.  By coincidence, she is residing in the same hotel as Drake. He goes to see her, but she does not forgive him for leaving her without a word in Berlin. He explains that he was forced to leave suddenly, but she is not mollified. Meanwhile, Drake instructs Burdge, his secretary, to send a cheque for £10,000 to the Buckingham Hospital for a new wing, even though Burdge informs him he is overdrawn at the bank. Drake tells him that the wealthy Mrs. Humbold's pearls will provide ample funds. The Humbolds are hosting a masquerade ball that night, and the baroness will be there. At the ball, part of the entertainment is a group called the \\"Four Gangsters\\", who have been tied up and replaced by a gang of real gangsters, the same thieves from the aeroplane caper. Sculpie, their leader, kills an unarmed man who foolishly tries to resist. Afterward, however, Sculpie is furious to learn that the pearls he took from Mrs. Humbold are fakes. Once again, Drake has the real ones. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who stole the diamonds is Jack. Jack Drake is the character who steals the diamonds and acts as a modern-day Robin Hood, donating the proceeds of his robberies to fund various causes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).

In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century.

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The 1923 Tokyo earthquake\\" correctly answer the question \\"What event allowed the zaibatsu conglomerates to take advantage of an economic upsurge?\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the paragraph, the response \\"The 1923 Tokyo earthquake\\" correctly answers the question \\"What event allowed the zaibatsu conglomerates to take advantage of an economic upsurge?\\" The paragraph mentions that even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed, and riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: If you ask someone why he or she wears clothes, the answer will probably be \\"to keep warm and to cover my body\\". These are the basic reasons why clothes are worn, but people also want to look attractive and appear successful to others.     If people only wore clothes for warmth and to cover their bodies, most clothes would be simple and cheap. In most Western countries, however, clothes are sometimes very expensive. The main reason for this is not the cost of the cloth or the cost of making the clothes. The clothes are expensive because of fashion .     Successful businessmen, for example, often wear very expensive suits, shirts and ties. Sometimes they pay thousands of dollars for a suit and hundreds of dollars for a tie. It's just a suit and a tie but they pay these prices because of the famous name of the designer. A suit costing much less would be just as warm and would cover the wearer's body just as well.     Fashion is always changing, which means those who want to be fashionable have to buy new clothes every few months, even if last month's clothes have only been worn once or twice. Some people have wardrobes full of clothes that have hardly been worn but are no longer in fashion. Being fashionable, therefore, can be a very expensive pastime ! Question: We can learn from the passage that   _  .

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of Allan Alvarez's two loves?  The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte.  The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat.  One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride.    Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice.  Mia left for Malaysia.  Two years after, when Allan  finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy.  It was now Mia's turn to make a choice.  She chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family.

The Tlingit language (English: , ; Tlingit: Lingit [linkit]) is spoken by the Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska and Western Canada. It is a branch of the Na-Dene language family. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture. Missionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit, using the Cyrillic script to record and translate it, when the Russian Empire had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to Sonoma County, California. Tlingit has eight vowels, four vowels further distinguished formally by length. However, the length distinction is often in terms of tenseness rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low tone; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an acute accent, e.g. aa, and low tone is unmarked, e.g. aa. The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which is marked by a grave accent, e.g. aa.  As noted in the vowel chart above, there is an allophone of /a:/ (orthographic aa) which is realized as [a:] under the influence of uvular consonants, however this is not consistent for all speakers. The backness influence arises from articulation with uvular consonants, thus the word khaa \\"person\\" is often spoken as [qha:], whereas the word (a) kaa \\"on (its) surface\\" is said as [(?^) kha:] by the same speakers.  Word onset is always consonantal in Tlingit, i.e. no word may begin with a vowel. Where one would occur theoretically by e.g. prefixing or compounding, the vowel is obligatorily preceded by either [?] or [j]. The former is universal in single words, and the latter is found varying with [?] in word-medial position in compounds. The orthography does not reflect the [?] in word-initial position, but either . or y may be seen in medial position. For example, the word khoowat'aa \\"the weather is hot\\" (khu-yu-ya-t'aa, INDH.OBJ-PERF-(0, -D, +I)-hot) is phonetically [qhu:w^t'a:], but when the perfective prefix yu- is word initial in uwat'aa \\"it is hot\\" (0-yu-ya-t'aa, 3NEU.OBJ-PERF-(0, -D, +I)-hot) the phonetic form is [?Uw^t'a:] where the glottal stop appears to ensure that the word begins with a consonant. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what do you mean by tones?","output":"By \\"tones\\" in the Tlingit language, the article refers to the variations in pitch that can be applied to vowels, which can change the meaning or function of words.

President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Singular Mercedes Aims for Another Record DOMINATOR The Mercedes W196 at the 1954 German Grand Prix; a streamlined W196 can be seen farther back. More Photos » A 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 grand prix car raced by the five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina will go on the block Friday at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Britain. The rarity and historical significance of the car make it a contender to set a record for an automobile sold at auction. Driven by Fangio to wins at the grands prix of Germany and Switzerland in its debut year, it is the only one of the 14 built for the Mercedes racing team in 1954 and 1955 that found its way to a private owner. The current high-water mark for a car sold at public auction is 16.4 million, brought by a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa racing sports car of unimpressive provenance at a sale in Pebble Beach, Calif., in August 2011. The Mercedes auction, to be conducted by Bonhams, has attracted considerable attention because of the carâs breakthrough engineering and its dominance in both seasons of its competitive career, taking Fangio to consecutive world drivers championships. The W196 â the factoryâs internal designation for the cars â was built in two versions, open-wheel and with a streamlined body, and with three different wheelbases. The car was powered by an in-line 8-cylinder engine that had its power takeoff in the middle, making it the equivalent of two 4-cylinder engines, a measure intended to minimize crankshaft whip. The engineâs valvetrain used a desmodromic system for positive mechanical opening and closing, and it was equipped with fuel injection, an innovation at the time. Ten of the original 14 cars still exist: six remain with Mercedes and three are in museums, in Indianapolis, Vienna and Turin, Italy. The continuing surge in the prices paid for classic cars has given rise to speculation of a sale price of around 20 million. Other factors â the car canât be driven without a support staff of mechanics, it canât be licensed for the road â may keep it out of record territory, though. A veteran collector and car dealer, Don Williams, head of the Blackhawk Collection, has maintained for years that the âheavy hittersâ with millions to spend donât go to auctions. But, he said in a telephone interview, âIf you donât buy this one, you wonât be able to find another.â The top prices in recent private sales â generally accepted as correct by experts close to the transactions but not confirmed by the parties involved â are on another scale: 40 million in 2010 for a 1936 Bugatti Atlantic by Peter Mullin, who specializes in French cars, and 35 million for a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO coupe by the collector Craig McCaw last year. The W196 for sale at Goodwood was presented by Daimler-Benz to the Beaulieu National Motor Museum in Britain in 1973 with the understanding that it would be kept in the museum. But there was no binding agreement. The museum eventually sold it to the British heavy equipment manufacturer Sir Anthony Bamford. It later went to a French collector, then to a German, and about 10 years ago was bought by a member of the ruling family of Qatar. Whatever the sale price, the value escalation in the vintage and classic car market has been little short of staggering. When Henry Manney, a Road & Track editor, brought his Ferrari GTO to California from Europe in the 1960s, he had no takers at 8,000 and had to lower the price to 6,000. By these standards, the Bugatti collector Dr. Peter Williamson paid what must have been considered an exorbitant price when, in 1971, he gave 59,000 for the car now owned by Mr. Mullin.","output":"A special car called the 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 raced by a famous driver named Juan Manuel Fangio will be sold at an event called the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Britain.

Right now, the most expensive car sold at an auction is a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa for 16.4 million. Some people think this special Mercedes-Benz might sell for around 20 million. However, it can't be driven without help from mechanics and it can't be driven on the road, so it might not sell for a record-breaking price.

Question: How many major inuries did Lincoln get from his fqll? Movie plot title: Sniper Movie plot: Hartman Fong (Richie Jen) succeeds Shane (Bowie Lam) as the leader of Hong Kong's Special Duties Unit Sniper Team. Hartman who is by-the-book and hierarchical, got the job despite being the second best shooter in team history. The best was Hartman's former teammate Lincoln (Huang Xiaoming), whose unorthodox methods and confidence makes him arrogant and disdainful of authority. Hartman and Lincoln are two alpha males with a long-running rivalry, with only room at the top for one sharpshooter. Lincoln however was dismissed and jailed for accidentally killing a hostage (the son of the bank chairman) during a bank robbery committed by crime boss Tao (Jack Kao). Lincoln maintained in defense that Tao was about to pull the pin of a grenade but no one else on the Sniper Team could support his story, indeed there is a feeling that Hartman (who was the only other person who could have been in a position to see Tao with the grenade) may have withheld key evidence that would have exonerated Lincoln. Back to the present, upon his release from prison after a four-year stint, Lincoln still harbors a grudge against his former SDU teammates despite being welcomed back into society by Shane. Within days Lincoln has purchased an illegal sniper rifle. He also rekindles his relationship with his wife Crystal (Mango Wong) who encourages him to seek revenge, after they view the wedding ring in the aquarium.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir.  Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls.  Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.  Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction?  With my previous cell phone, in order to charge it I would have a plug the charger into the wall and the plug the cord into my phone to connect it to the electric source. With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly.  Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. The answer to this question is:","output":"Your new cell phone was being charged using induction. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that your new phone charges wirelessly when placed on the charging dock. This process is accomplished through charging by induction, where the phone and the charging dock do not need to touch directly or have a physical connection to transfer energy. They establish an electromagnetic field that allows power transfer between the devices, causing your phone to charge without any direct contact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\".

Inappropriate location: Finding a crab in your underpants is not only highly unexpected but also extremely uncomfortable. Crabs should be found in water or natural habitats where they can survive and thrive, not in such a personal and intimate space. 2. Health and hygiene concerns: Having a crab in your underpants poses potential health risks such as injury from the crab's claws, causing pain and discomfort. Additionally, the presence of a crab in such a location may lead to unhygienic conditions and possible infections. 3. Safety issues: A crab's natural defense mechanism involves using its claws to pinch and hold onto things. Having a crab in one's underpants could lead to injury from the crab's claws, especially in sensitive areas. 4. Other options are related to natural habitats or food chain: Comparing \\"underpants\\" to the other options like Chesapeake Bay, Seychelles, fishing boat, and cooking pot - these are all places where finding crabs would make sense in terms of their natural habitats, where they are commonly found, or food preparation.

Question: \\"What might have strengthened the structural integrity of the cathedrals in Gothic styles?\\"  Context: \\"From the early 12th century, French builders developed the Gothic style, marked by the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The structural integrity of cathedrals in Gothic styles might have been strengthened by several architectural innovations, including the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, and flying buttresses. 1. Rib vaults: These are a type of ceiling structure made up of intersecting arched ribs, which help distribute the weight of the roof more evenly across the supporting walls. This allowed for thinner walls and larger window openings, making room for stained glass windows. 2. Pointed arches: Unlike rounded Romanesque arches, pointed arches direct the weight of the structure down towards the ground more effectively, reducing lateral force on supporting walls. This allowed architects to build taller, more slender structures. 3. Flying buttresses: These are external, arched structures that support the walls and help counteract the lateral force exerted by the roof and vaults. They enabled architects to build taller, narrower walls with larger windows, again allowing for the incorporation of more stained glass. These innovations in Gothic architecture not only strengthened the structural integrity of cathedrals but also allowed for greater use of light and intricate detailing, such as the extensive use of stained glass windows, a hallmark of the style."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His head is kept hooded, and his \\"owner,\\" who views him as retarded, is paid by Treves to bring him to the hospital for exams. Treves presents Merrick to his colleagues and highlights his monstrous skull, which forces him to sleep with his head on his knees, since if he were to lie down, he would asphyxiate. On Merrickâs return he is beaten so badly by Bytes that he has to call Treves for medical help. Treves brings him back to the hospital. John is tended to by Mrs. Mothershead, the formidable matron, as the other nurses are too frightened of Merrick. Mr. Carr-Gomm, the hospitalâs Governor, is against housing Merrick, as the hospital does not accept âincurablesâ. To prove that Merrick can make progress, Treves trains him to say a few conversational sentences. Carr-Gomm sees through this ruse, but as he is leaving, Merrick begins to recite the 23rd Psalm, which Treves did not teach him. Merrick tells the doctors that he knows how to read, and has memorized the 23rd Psalm because it is his favorite. Carr-Gomm permits him to stay, and Merrick spends his time practicing conversation with Treves and building a model of a cathedral he sees from his window. Merrick has tea with Treves and his wife, and is so overwhelmed by their kindness that he shows them his motherâs picture. He believes he must have been a \\"disappointment\\" to his mother, but hopes she would be proud to see him with his âlovely friendsâ. Merrick begins to take guests in his rooms, including the actress Madge Kendal, who introduces him to Shakespeare. Merrick quickly becomes an object of curiosity to high society, and Mrs. Mothershead expresses concerns that he is still being put on display as a freak.

Question: \\"What policy serves to protect children according to the church?\\"  Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\".

Premise: \\"The rule is designed to strengthen the Commission's enforcement of the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA).\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The rules were voted on before they were implemented. \\"?","output":"The premise, which states that \\"The rule is designed to strengthen the Commission's enforcement of the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA)\\", tells us that there was a specific rule created for the purpose of enhancing the implementation of the CTA. The CTA itself is a law aimed at promoting educational programming for children and limiting the number of commercials during children's programs. The premise implies that the Commission, most likely referring to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in this context, found that the existing mechanisms for enforcing the CTA needed improvement, and therefore, a new rule was created to address this issue. However, the premise does not provide explicit information about the process through which the rule was established. Therefore, it is not logically necessary that it entails the hypothesis \\"The rules were voted on before they were implemented.\\" Nevertheless, some contextual understanding of how rules and regulations typically come into force can offer an educated conjecture concerning the hypothesis. In general, when a new rule or regulation is proposed, there is a formal process followed by government agencies or commissions to ensure that all stakeholders have the opportunity to review, discuss, and possibly vote on the proposal before it is implemented. In the case of the FCC, rulemaking procedures typically involve a period of public comment, followed by internal review and analysis that could ultimately result in the adoption of a final rule. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the rules in question were probably voted on before they were implemented. The premise depicts a situation in which the Commission has identified a deficiency in their enforcement of the CTA and recognizes the need to establish a stronger rule. It is expected that the decision-making process would have involved deliberation and a consensus reached among the members of the Commission. However, it is important to note that this inference is based on an understanding of typical rulemaking procedures in government agencies and not deduced from the premise itself. The premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm the hypothesis that \\"The rules were voted on before they were implemented.\\" Thus, while the hypothesis might be considered plausible given the context, the premise itself does not directly entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Dealing with a Car Accident: Essential Steps to Follow After the Incident Introduction Car accidents can happen anytime, anywhere and to anyone, leaving victims startled, confused, and at times, injured. In the heat of the moment, it can be difficult to think clearly about the necessary actions that should be taken immediately after an incident. The key to handling this stressful situation is staying calm and prepared. This article outlines the crucial steps to be followed in the aftermath of a car accident, focusing on three main areas: looking for witnesses, exchanging information with the other involved party, and documenting the incident. 1. Look for Witnesses Whether the car accident is a major collision or just a minor fender-bender, it is crucial to have witnesses who can corroborate the events that took place. Witnesses can provide additional perspectives on the incident and may be able to provide vital evidence that can help determine fault or liability in the future. When seeking out witnesses, follow these steps: - Identify potential witnesses: Look around the area where the accident occurred for individuals who may have witnessed the incident. This can include pedestrians, other drivers, or even security personnel. - Approach them politely: Explain the situation calmly and ask if they saw the accident. If they agree to provide a statement, make sure to get their contact information, including their names and phone numbers. - Take brief statements: Ask the witnesses to provide their account of what happened in brief detail. Record their statements either through writing or recording on a digital device if possible. 2. Exchange Information with the Other Driver In most jurisdictions, it's mandatory to exchange personal and insurance information after a car accident. The importance of this step cannot be understated, as it lays the foundation for insurance claims and potential legal processes. Make sure to exchange the following information with the other driver: - Full names and contact details of all the parties involved. - Insurance company information and policy numbers. - Driver's license numbers. - License plate numbers and registration information. - Vehicle make, model, and year. It is essential to remain calm and respectful during this step, as tensions might be high or emotions heightened. 3. Document the Incident Proper and thorough documentation of the car accident is essential to protect yourself legally and ensure a smooth insurance claims process. Take the following actions to document the incident: - Photograph the scene: Use your phone or any other camera device to take clear pictures of the accident scene, capturing the damage to the vehicles, road conditions, and any traffic signs. - Record the location, date, and time: Note the exact location of the accident, including street names, landmarks, and the date and time it occurred. - Draw a diagram: Sketch a simple diagram of the accident scene, including the position of each vehicle before and after the collision, as well as any relevant traffic signs. - Write down your observations: Record what you believe happened, including details about the weather, visibility, and road conditions. - Collect relevant documents: Keep the police report, insurance information, and any other relevant documents in an organized file for future reference. Conclusion Dealing with a car accident can be a nerve-wracking experience, but by following these essential steps, you can ensure a smoother process for filing insurance claims, handling any legal issues, and moving forward with your life. Always remember to stay calm and communicate effectively with the other party and witnesses involved. Most importantly, prioritize your safety and the safety of others around you, seeking medical attention when necessary or appropriate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - \\"Master Cat, or The Booted Cat\\", commonly known in English as \\"Puss in Boots\\", is a European literary fairy tale about a cat who uses trickery and deceit to gain power, wealth, and the hand of a princess in marriage for his penniless and low-born master. The oldest record of written history dates from Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola, who included it in his \\"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\\" (c. 155053) in XIVXV. Another version was published in 1634, by Giambattista Basile with the title \\"Cagliuso\\". The tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault (16281703), a retired civil servant and member of the \\"Académie française\\". The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called \\"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\\". The book was an instant success and remains popular. Perrault's \\"Histoires\\" has had considerable impact on world culture. The original Italian title of the first edition was \\"Costantino Fortunato\\", but was later known as \\"Il gatto con gli stivali\\" (lit. \\"The cat with the boots\\"); the French title was \\"Histoires ou contes du temps passé, avec des moralités\\" with the subtitle \\"Les Contes de ma mère l'Oye\\" (\\"Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals\\", subtitled \\"Mother Goose Tales\\"). The frontispiece to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed \\"MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES\\" and is credited with launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. \\"Puss in Boots\\" has provided inspiration for composers, choreographers, and other artists over the centuries. The cat appears in the third act \\"pas de caractère\\" of Tchaikovsky's ballet \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\", for example, and makes appearances in other media, most famously the sequels to the animated film \\"Shrek (film)\\". Puss in Boots is a popular pantomime in the UK.  - Tie Me Up ! Tie Me Down ! ( Spanish : ¡ Átame ! , pronounced : ( a.ta.me ) , \`\` Tie Me !

Please answer a question about the following article about Eritrea: When Emperor Haile Selassie unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and annexed the country in 1962, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) waged an armed struggle for independence. The ensuing Eritrean War for Independence went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), a successor of the ELF, defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of Ethiopian rebel forces take control of the Ethiopian Capital Addis Ababa.

If \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain.\\", does this mean that \\"There are childern playing\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain\\" implies that \\"There are children playing.\\" This is because toddlers are young children who are usually between the ages of 1 to 3 years old. Let us analyze both the statements to understand the connection between them. Statement 1: \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain.\\" In this statement, we are given the following information: 1. There are two individuals involved. 2. These individuals are toddlers, which indicates that they are children. 3. The activity they are engaging in is playing. 4. The specific location where they are playing is a water fountain. Statement 2: \\"There are children playing.\\" This statement is broader and conveys the following information: 1. There are one or more individuals involved. 2. These individuals are children. 3. The activity they are engaging in is playing. As we can see, the second statement is a general statement that refers to children playing. Since toddlers are a subset of children, the first statement confirms that there are indeed children playing, specifically in a water fountain. In conclusion, when given the scenario \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain,\\" it confirms that \\"There are children playing\\" as toddlers fall under the category of children. Thus, both the statements are related, and the first statement provides more specific information about the children (toddlers), the activity (playing), and the location (a water fountain)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Indian Rebellion of 1857 The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India during 1857--58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The event is known by many names, including the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and India's First War of Independence. Is this statement correct \\"is the revolt of 1857 the first war of independence\\"?","output":"The statement \\"is the revolt of 1857 the first war of independence?\\" could be seen as both correct and incorrect depending on one's perspective and interpretation of the events. There are differing opinions among historians and scholars regarding the classification of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as the first war of independence. On one hand, considering it the first war of independence may be accurate, as the 1857 rebellion was indeed a significant and widespread armed uprising against British rule in India. The revolt consisted of Indian soldiers, known as sepoys, various regional chieftains, everyday citizens, and disaffected nobility, all opposing the British East India Company's rule. The goals of the rebellion aimed to end British control and restore traditional Indian political and social order, which could be considered as a struggle for independence.  The reasons behind the rebellion were multifaceted. They included rapid changes in Indian society, culture, and economy imposed by the British through their Western-centric policies, land annexations, economic exploitation, heavy taxation, introduction of modern technologies, the decline of traditional Indian institutions, and a sense of growing disillusionment with British rule among both the Indian elite and common people. Additionally, the immediate cause of the rebellion could be traced to the grievances of the sepoys, particularly the introduction of the new Enfield rifle cartridge, rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat, which was offensive to both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.  In this sense, the Indian Rebellion of 1857 can be seen as an early attempt to liberate India from British colonial rule, representing a collective desire for autonomy and self-governance, thus justifying its title as the \\"first war of independence.\\" On the other hand, there are various arguments that challenge the notion of the 1857 rebellion as the first war of independence. Some historians argue that the rebellion was not a unified nationalistic struggle as it lacked a coherent leadership, widespread support among all sections of Indian society, and a clear vision of a post-rebellion India. Others emphasize that the revolt was primarily driven by the grievances of specific social, religious, and regional groups, rather than a united quest for Indian independence. Moreover, prior to the events of 1857, there were already smaller instances of resistance against British rule, such as the Sannyasi Rebellion (late 18th century), the First Anglo-Maratha War (1777-1783), and the Paika Rebellion (1817). These uprisings, though not on the same scale as the Revolt of 1857, incorporate elements of anti-colonial resistance deserving recognition.  In summary, whether the Indian Rebellion of 1857 is considered the first war of Indian independence or not largely depends on one's interpretation. While it was a significant uprising against British rule with certain elements fighting for self-governance and autonomy, it is essential to acknowledge other, earlier instances of resistance, and the fragmented nature of the rebellion when considering its classification as the first war of independence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Tammy Hughes PUBLISHED: 03:54 EST, 22 May 2012 | UPDATED: 08:56 EST, 22 May 2012 These futuristic graphics look more like something from a Star Trek film than pictures of a shopping centre. But the astonishing images are in fact an artist's impression of the future Westfield mega-mall at the World Trade Center in New York. The Australian company has announced  that they will open a retail centre at the iconic site 13-and-a-half years after the September 11 attacks. Futuristic: An artist's impression of the Westfield shopping mall at the World Trade Center in New York Enormous: A total shopping space of 352,000 sq feet would be spread over three above-ground levels and two below ground The above-ground retail will be housed in 4 World Trade Center, which is under construction, and inside 3","output":"World Trade Center, which is yet to be built. Construction projects of this scale require an immense amount of planning and coordination not only in terms of architecture and engineering, but also in terms of economic viability, environment impact, and socio-cultural considerations. This is especially true for the construction site at the World Trade Center, being a location of historical and emotional significance not only for New Yorkers but the entire world.  The concept design as seen in the artist's impression holds a futuristic vision that seamlessly merges the characteristics of modern architecture with the functionalities of a retail space. This high-tech vision brings to mind the cutting-edge technology and sleek designs seen in Star Trek films and other works of science fiction. Spread over a total shopping space of 352,000 sq feet with three above-ground levels and two below ground, this architectural marvel will stand as a landmark of the evolving face of New York City. This is symbolic of the city's resilience and capacity for growth and innovation following the tragic events of the September 11 attacks. The Westfield mega-mall will be situated in 4 World Trade Center, a building currently under construction, and inside 3 World Trade Center which is yet to be built. These are extremely important elements of this grand project that demonstrate how futuristic visions can be integrated into the already existing city framework, symbolizing a simultaneous respect for the past and a push towards the future. The Australian company, Westfield Corporation, known for its successful shopping centres globally, is undertaking the shopping center development at the World Trade Center site. This announcement comes 13-and-a-half years after the September 11 attacks showing a belief in recovery, resilience, and remembrance. When completed, the mall could potentially become an international symbol of defiance against terrorism, and a testament to the power of resilience. It will not only be a commercial center for city dwellers and tourists, but it could also serve as a hub for community events, cultural gatherings, and perhaps even become a beacon of technological advancements in the commercial real estate sector. However, large-scale projects like this also come with numerous challenges including environmental impact, technical complexities, and potential disruption to the community. The journey to the completion of the mega-mall therefore will not only be a test of advanced architectural and engineering prowess but also a showcase of efficient project management, stakeholder coordination, and a deep understanding of social dynamics and local culture. All in all, this futuristic retail space promises to add a vibrant chapter to the story of New York City, inviting the world to participate in the city's ongoing journey of evolution and innovation. The implementation of this project will undeniably encounter numerous challenges and there will be plenty of lessons to learn. Nonetheless, one thing is for certain, it will stand as a testament to the spirit of humanity's resilience, its capacity for progress, and hope for a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is at 8901 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip. The club has been the launching pad for bands including System of a Down, The Doors, The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Steppenwolf, Van Halen, Johnny Rivers, Guns N' Roses, Linkin Park and Mötley Crüe. In 2006, the venue was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records.  - Greenwich Village, often referred to by locals as simply \\"the Village\\", is a neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan, New York City. Greenwich Village has been known as an artists' haven, the Bohemian capital, the cradle of the modern LGBT movement, and the East Coast birthplace of both the Beat and '60s counterculture movements. \\"Groenwijck\\", one of the Dutch names for the village (meaning \\"Green District\\"), was Anglicized to \\"Greenwich\\". Two of New York's private colleges, New York University (NYU) and the New School, are located in Greenwich Village.  - The Byrds were an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) remaining the sole consistent member, until the group disbanded in 1973. Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Rolling Stones for a short period in late 1965, the Byrds are today considered by critics to be one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Initially, they pioneered the musical genre of folk rock, melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music. As the 1960s progressed, the band was also influential in originating psychedelic rock, raga rock, and country rock.  - \`\` Triad '' is a song written by David Crosby in 1967 about a ménage à trois , a subject perfectly in keeping with the \`\` free love '' hippie philosophies of the day . The song was written while Crosby was a member of the rock band The Byrds , who were at that time recording their fifth studio album , The Notorious Byrd Brothers . Although the band did record \`\` Triad '' and perform it live during a September 1967 engagement at the Whisky a Go Go , it was not included on The Notorious Byrd Brothers album . According to Crosby , Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman felt that its subject - matter was too controversial , McGuinn allegedly deriding the song as a \`\` freak - out orgy tune . '' However , this has since been denied by Hillman who has stated \`\` I do n't think it was a moral decision . The song just did n't work that well . David was drifting and bored and wanted to do something else , and that song just added fuel to the fire . '' There had been growing animosity between Crosby and the rest of the band throughout 1967 . Tensions had arisen from several factors , including Crosby 's displeasure over the band 's wish to record the Goffin -- King composition \`\` Goin ' Back '' , his fraternization with fellow L.A. musicians , and his controversial remarks to the audience during The Byrds ' performance at the Monterey Pop Festival . These factors , along with the discord over \`\` Triad '' , contributed to McGuinn and Hillman 's decision to fire Crosby in October 1967 . Crosby gave the song to Jefferson Airplane , who recorded it on their 1968 album , Crown of Creation . A live recording of \`\` Triad '' was later included on Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young 's 1971 album , 4 Way Street . The song 's lyrics were largely inspired by the sexual freedom that Crosby enjoyed at his home in Beverly Glen in Los Angeles . However , the song also features allusions to author Robert A. Heinlein 's science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land , with references to \`\` sister lovers '' and \`\` water brothers '' . \`\` Triad '' ,...  - The Flying Burrito Brothers was an American country rock band, best known for their influential 1969 debut album, \\"The Gilded Palace of Sin\\". Although the group is perhaps best known for its connection to band founders Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman, the group underwent many personnel changes and has existed in various incarnations, currently known as \\"The Burrito Brothers\\".  - The British Invasion was a phenomenon that occurred in the mid-1960s when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom, as well as other aspects of British culture, became popular in the United States, and significant to the rising \\"counterculture\\" on both sides of the Atlantic. Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion.  - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ian Stewart (piano), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (196782), Billy Preston (through the mid 1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles.  - Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album \\"Hybrid Theory\\" (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album \\"Meteora\\" continued the band's success, topping the \\"Billboard\\" 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. \\"Billboard\\" ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the \\"Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\\" by \\"Kerrang!\\".  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation. The term \\"folk rock\\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued.  - Baroque pop (or baroque rock) is a pop music subgenre that fuses classical music, orchestral pop, rock, and Baroque music. It is identifiable for its use of contrapuntal melodies, functional harmony patterns, and dramatic or melancholic gestures. The genre emerged in the 1960s after pop musicians and record producers began placing the harpsichord in the foreground of their arrangements. Other typical baroque pop instrumentation includes string sections, French horns, and oboes.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Ingram Cecil Connor III (November 5, 1946  September 19, 1973), known professionally as Gram Parsons, was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist. Parsons is best known for his work within the country music genre; he also popularized what he called \\"Cosmic American Music\\", a hybrid of country, rhythm and blues, soul, folk, and rock. Besides recording as a solo artist, he played with the International Submarine Band, The Byrds, and The Flying Burrito Brothers. His relatively short career is described by AllMusic as \\"enormously influential\\" for country and rock, \\"blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.\\"  - The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. They emerged at the vanguard of the \\"California Sound\\", initially performing original surf songs that gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Rooted in jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to music production, arranging his compositions for studio orchestras, and experimenting with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque styles.  - Gary Usher (December 14, 1938  May 25, 1990) was an American rock musician, songwriter, and record producer.  - The Notorious Byrd Brothers is the fifth album by the American rock band The Byrds and was released in January 1968 on Columbia Records (\\"see\\" 1968 in music). Musically, the album represents the pinnacle of The Byrds' psychedelic experimentation, with the band blending together elements of folk rock, psychedelic rock, country music, electronic music, baroque pop and jazz on many of the songs. Of these disparate styles, the subtle country and western influences evident on a number of tracks pointed towards the full-blown country rock direction that the band would pursue on their next album. In addition, \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" saw the band and record producer Gary Usher making extensive use of a number of studio effects and production techniques, including phasing, flanging, and spatial panning. The Byrds also introduced the sound of the pedal steel guitar and the Moog modular synthesizer into their music for the first time on the album, making it one of the first LP releases on which the Moog appears.   - Harold Eugene \\"Gene\\" Clark (November 17, 1944  May 24, 1991) was an American singer-songwriter and founding member of the folk rock band the Byrds. He was the Byrds' principal songwriter between 1964 and early 1966, writing most of the band's best-known originals from this period, including \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\", \\"She Don't Care About Time\\", \\"Set You Free This Time\\" , \\"Eight Miles High.\\" Although he did not achieve commercial success as a solo artist, Clark was in the vanguard of popular music during much of his career, prefiguring developments in such disparate subgenres as psychedelic rock, baroque pop, newgrass, country rock, and alternative country.  - Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985.

Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Polyamory (from Greek ', \\"many, several\\", and Latin ', \\"love\\") is typically the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships where individuals may have more than one partner, with the knowledge and consent of all partners. It has been described as \\"consensual, ethical, and responsible non-monogamy\\". However, the meaning of polyamory is also an issue of ongoing debate. For example, although polyamory is typically defined as a relationship practice or approach to relationships, some believe that it should also be considered an orientation or identity (analogous to sexual orientation or gender identity).  - Christopher \\"Chris\\" Hillman (born December 4, 1944) is an American musician.

It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock.  - A ménage à trois (French for \\"household of three\\") is a domestic arrangement in which three people having romantic and/or sexual relations with each other occupy the same household. It is a form of polyamory.  - Raga rock is rock or pop music with a heavy Indian influence, either in its construction, its timbre, or its use of instrumentation, such as the sitar and tabla.

Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - A hippie (or hippy) is a member of a liberal counterculture, originally a youth movement that started in the United States and the United Kingdom during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world.

Selena Gomez came of age in the spotlight, and now the young actress and singer advocates for children as UNICEF's youngest goodwill ambassador. Gomez, 18, has also been involved with CNN Heroes since 2008, when she served as a presenter at \\"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute.\\" She recently sat down with CNN Heroes producer Allie Torgan to talk about the Heroes campaign and her humanitarian work. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allie Torgan: Why did you decide to get involved with UNICEF? Selena Gomez: I started working with them for the Trick-or-Treat campaign [a fundraiser where children go door-to-door to collect money on Halloween], and I ended up falling in love with what they do. There's 24,000 children that die a day from preventable causes like malaria, not getting enough food, dirty water, and UNICEF's goal is to make that number zero. They asked me to be their ambassador, so I help them out as much as I can. Torgan: Tell me about your recent mission trip to Ghana. Gomez: UNICEF chose Ghana because of its high child mortality, so we got to see exactly what UNICEF is doing to provide healthy clean water, education, and protect these kids from preventable diseases. I got to see firsthand, and I got to help out myself. It was a really humbling experience for me. I remember a 14-year-old and his friends going to each village, telling everybody how they wanted an education. You think about how many kids hate school here and how much they just wish they didn't have to go to school. You know, I was one of those kids. I complained all the time about having to do homework and I wanted to go out and play, and these kids are begging for school. ... It was so powerful. It makes you more aware of how fortunate you are. There was this little kid playing with a bunch of plastic bags that he wrapped string around, and it was a soccer ball. That's all he needed. And you think about all the Game Boys and all the things that kids \\"need\\" to be entertained here. It was all about simplicity with them. I loved being around them. It got me excited to help more. Torgan: Do you think your work is having an impact with kids here in the U.S.? Gomez: I am very blessed to have a lot of fans, and basically my goal is to use my voice to educate them on all of these things. Kids want to help. You just need to tell them how. And you just need to encourage them. Torgan: How would you describe a hero? Gomez: A hero to me would be someone that truly believes in something. The passion and the drive of wanting to make the world a better place, or to help out and to contribute in some small way, that's a hero to me. Torgan: Back in 2008, you were a presenter at \\"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\\" and you helped honor Maria Ruiz, who helps children in Juarez, Mexico. What was that experience like, and what did you think of her? Gomez: She was so amazing, and she was so sweet. She takes clothes and food across the border, and you could tell that everything that she does, she does because she wants to. But then that night was about her, and I loved that. It was a very good moment. This award show is by far my favorite. It was so cool to see these people that help out and really genuinely care about everything they do. I loved it. I cried so many times, and I met some amazing people, and the whole time I was just very grateful to just be there. I'm looking forward to going again.","output":"1.

Information:  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.  - Night Stalker is an action shooting video game for the Intellivision console .  - The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600.

Here is a premise: \\"Three women are crossing a street\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The three women are best friends.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise, \\"three women are crossing a street,\\" provides limited information about the relationship between these women. It simply states that they are together at that specific moment, doing a particular activity (i.e., crossing the street). There could be any number of reasons why these women are crossing the street together, such as being strangers who happened to be at the crosswalk at the same time, coworkers going to lunch, or family members. The hypothesis, \\"the three women are best friends,\\" is a possible speculation about the nature of their relationship. However, the premise does not provide enough evidence to confirm or refute this hypothesis. The information given doesn't explicitly mention their friendship or any signs indicating their interpersonal connection. Therefore, we cannot determine the truthfulness of the hypothesis based on the premise alone. To further investigate the hypothesis and establish its validity, more context or specific details about the women's interactions and shared experiences would be needed. For example, if the women were observed engaging in deep conversation, laughing together, or doing other activities that generally suggest a close bond, this might support the hypothesis. Additionally, it is important to consider alternative explanations and hypotheses as well. For instance, the women could all be relatives, colleagues, or members of the same social group or organization, which would provide alternative explanations for their shared presence at the street crossing. In conclusion, although it is plausible that the three women are best friends, the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or reject the hypothesis. Additional observations, context, and evidence would be necessary to determine the truthfulness of the hypothesis and better understand the nature of their relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto?  From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert.       In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty's 1936 set.

These plants are characterized by their tall, slender trunks, and large, fan-like leaves. They can be found in various types of habitats, including rainforests, swamps, and coastal regions. Borassodendron palms usually grow in tropical and subtropical areas where the climate is warm, humid, and receives plenty of rainfall. In their natural environments, Borassodendron species can play essential roles in the local ecosystem. Their fruits provide food for various animals, while their trunks and leaves offer shelter or nesting sites for diverse wildlife.

No Plan to Extend Health Care Enrollment Deadline or Delay Mandate WASHINGTON — Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said Wednesday that the Obama administration would not extend the deadline for people to sign up for health insurance or delay the requirement for most Americans to have coverage. And Ms. Sebelius declined to say whether the administration was still committed to its original goal of enrolling seven million people in private coverage through federal and state exchanges by March 31. Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Sebelius said categorically that the administration would not delay the “individual mandate,” under which most Americans must have insurance or pay a tax penalty. In addition, she said that officials would not extend the six-month open enrollment period, scheduled to end on March 31. Ms. Sebelius reported on Tuesday that 4.2 million people had selected health plans through the federal and state exchanges from October through February. Representative James. B. Renacci, Republican of Ohio, noted that the number of sign-ups was well short of the administration’s original goal and asked, “What do you now call success?” Ms. Sebelius declined to reaffirm the goal of seven million and said she would define success as “millions of people having affordable coverage” from private insurers and from Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act is already a success, she said, because the range of private health plans available to consumers is “more robust than ever.” However, a few Democrats expressed disappointment and dismay at the way the health law was being carried out. “So much of the original promise of the Affordable Care Act has been undermined by faulty implementation,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas. In Texas, Mr. Doggett said, “more than 90 percent of the people for whom we wrote this law have not been covered.” In parts of the state, he said, it is nearly impossible for consumers to obtain “in-person assistance” in selecting a health plan. So far, according to the latest data from the federal government, 295,000 people in Texas have selected private plans through the federal marketplace. The Times would like to hear from Americans who have signed up for health care under the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Sebelius said that state laws and other barriers had made it difficult for some Texans to take advantage of the new insurance options. State officials in Texas, which has the highest uninsured rate of any state, rejected the expansion of Medicaid and declined to establish their own health insurance marketplace. Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York, noted that in a special congressional election in Florida this week, the Democratic candidate defended the health care law but said it should be “fixed.” Ms. Sebelius said she was open to possible changes, but had not sent any draft legislation to Congress. However, she said, “We have implemented a number of changes in the way the law was written to ease the transition” for consumers, insurers and employers. Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, said that, with so many changes and delays by the administration, her constituents were “really confused.” The senior Democrat on the committee, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, said millions of Americans were benefiting from the new law and its insurance marketplaces. But, he said, “Republicans are so invested in making the Affordable Care Act a failure that they are blinded by the successes staring them in the face.” Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the committee, opened the hearing with a barrage of questions and criticism for Ms. Sebelius. “How much did the failed launch of the exchange cost taxpayers?” Mr. Camp asked. “How many people have actually paid a premium? How many previously uninsured Americans have signed up for Obamacare?” “Increasingly,” Mr. Camp said, “we must ask, ‘When is the next delay or next administrative change in the law coming?’ It seems that not a holiday goes by without a new announcement from the administration that delays some part of Obamacare.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The person in charge of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, said that the Obama administration will not change the deadline for people to sign up for health insurance or the requirement for most Americans to have it. She also didn't say if they still want to get seven million people signed up for health insurance by March 31st. So far, 4.2 million people have signed up for health plans. Some people are disappointed with how the new health care law is working, but Ms. Sebelius says it is already successful because there are many good private health plans available."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The five include two police officers and three government officials who were arrested earlier this month They are facing various charges, including manslaughter and negligence. Prosecutors say the fire at the Virgen de la Asunción shelter began when one of the girls set fire to a mattress after a riot. They had been locked in a room after trying to escape and protesting against overcrowding and alleged sexual abuse by staff. Reports say the capacity of the home in San José Pinula is 400. But that many more children were living there at the time. The officials charged are senior members of social and child protection agencies. Two - Brenda Chaman Pacay and Harold Augusto Flores - are accused of manslaughter, and a third - Gloria Patricia Castro Gutiérrez - of negligence. The police officers - Luis Armando Pérez and Lucinda Marroquín - face abuse charges. The former director of the shelter, the former minister of social welfare and his deputy were charged in April. They were sacked by President Jimmy Morales after the fire on 8 March. The tragedy has put a spotlight on failings in Guatemala's child protection services. Months before the tragedy, prosecutors had recommended that the shelter, near Guatemala City, should be closed over allegations of abuse. Mr Morales also called for the shelter's closure, but many Guatemalans have called for his resignation. The shelter takes in children up to the age of 18 who have suffered abuse or have been abandoned. Local media said the shelter was also functioning as a juvenile detention centre, to which judges were sending adolescents involved in criminal cases. Summary:","output":"This article focuses on the arrest and subsequent charging of five individuals - two police officers and three government officials - in relation to a fire that took place at the Virgen de la Asunción shelter in San José Pinula, Guatemala. The fire, which prosecutors believe started when one of the girls residing there set fire to a mattress during a riot, led to multiple charges being brought against the five individuals including manslaughter, negligence, and abuse. Amidst allegations of overcrowding, sexual misconduct by the staff, and overall failings of the child protective services, the victims had reportedly been locked in a room after attempting to protest and escape. The shelter, meant to cater to a capacity of 400, allegedly housed many more children at the time of the incident and primarily catered to those who have endured abuse or been abandoned, up to the age of 18. Alongside this, it allegedly functioned as a juvenile detention center to which judges would send adolescents implicated in criminal cases. Those charged, including Brenda Chaman Pacay, Harold Augusto Flores, Gloria Patricia Castro Gutiérrez, Luis Armando Pérez, and Lucinda Marroquín, were members of social and child protection agencies and the police force, held in high regard. Furthermore, the former shelter director, the former minister of social welfare and his deputy were previously charged and dismissed by President Jimmy Morales following the fire on March 8. Despite President Morales's call for the shelter's closure, many Guatemalans have petitioned for his resignation. Previously, prosecutors had recommended the shelter be shut down due to abuse allegations. The tragedy has subsequently cast a harsh light on the inefficacies of Guatemala's child protection services and brought urgent attention to the urgent need for reform in protection agencies and social services."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  and the situation: John was studying the characteristics of tropical forests. For that, he chose forests in Laos. To compare the forests in Laos with the temperate zone forests he chose forests in Ireland. He could clearly see that how they differed in important ways.  Answer the following question: Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland? The answer is:","output":"Ireland would receive less rainfall compared to the tropical forests in Laos. This is because the tropical forests, such as those found in Laos, experience higher levels of insolation and rainfall due to their location near the equator and their exposure to warm, moist air from the ocean. These conditions lead to a longer growing season and greater biomass productivity, as well as greater chemical weathering rates. In contrast, temperate forests like those found in Ireland receive comparatively less rainfall and insolation due to the country's higher latitude and more variable climate influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. The temperate forests experience milder, wetter winters and cooler summers compared to tropical forests, resulting in a shorter growing season and less overall rainfall throughout the year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

This was Tierney’s seventh go-round atop lacrosse’s coveted pedestal, and he was focused on his players, who were soaking in their first. As Tierney embraced the sophomore defenseman Christian Burgdorf, Tierney asked him how it felt. “The best,” Burgdorf said. “The best.” With an authoritative 10-5 win over Maryland at Lincoln Financial Field on Monday, Tierney and the Pioneers created a transformative moment for a sport that has been gaining westward momentum for years: Never in the 44-year history of the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s lacrosse tournament had a non-East Coast team won the title. What lacrosse’s evolution needed, perhaps, was a breakthrough win, which the trailblazing Tierney helped provide, with the Pioneers beating the defensive-minded Terrapins at their own game and extending Maryland’s title drought to 40 years. The new epicenter of lacrosse is now in a state better known for snowboarding, long home runs and Peyton Manning. But for Tierney, who won his first six national titles at Princeton, this win still felt like a long time coming. “I feel like we were carrying a burden around,” said Tierney, who joined Denver in 2009. “And now it’s off. And now we move on.” That burden was the disappointment of having reached the Final Four three times in the previous four years without advancing to the title game. Tierney relished the strides his program had made; Denver had never won an N.C.A.A. tournament game before he arrived. But he ached for another chance at a title. “It still kind of gets to you,” he said. “It’s still there.” No other coach has claimed as many rings, and no other coach has won titles with two programs. But Monday’s game also signaled to other coaches and administrators that Tierney’s stunning decision to move west was not as preposterous as it once might have appeared. “I hope it gives some athletic directors some courage and some school presidents some courage,” Tierney said. “This is a sport that’s here to stay. This is a sport that means something in our country.” Denver (17-2) never trailed after the senior attacker Wesley Berg scored three goals in the opening 10 minutes to give the team a 3-1 lead. Goalie Ryan LaPlante — wearing his customary gray sweatpants even though the temperature was in the mid-80s — made four of his game-high 11 saves in the opening quarter. After Denver slipped past top-seeded Notre Dame in overtime on Saturday, Trevor Tierney, the coach’s son and an assistant coach for the team, urged the players to remain subdued. A goalie on the title-winning 2001 Princeton team, he saw what happened the next year, when the Tigers lost in the championship game to Syracuse. Instead of celebrating, the Pioneers remained focused on completing their task. The coaching staff drew up a 12-page scouting report. The players slept late and dined at Terminal Market. “The guys were really loose yesterday,” Trevor Tierney said. “It was almost worrisome.” Trailing by 4-1 in the second quarter, Maryland settled in, scoring twice to cut Denver’s lead to 5-3. As time wound down in the half, Maryland’s Henry West had a decent look, but his shot was stymied by LaPlante, who rapped his stick against his chest as time expired. “He played great,” Maryland Coach John Tillman said of LaPlante. “I think if we had hit a couple of those and closed the gap, maybe we could have gotten some momentum.” The Terrapins led Division I in goals allowed (6.9 per game) this season, but their unfamiliarity with Denver’s attack made things difficult. The slippery Berg finished with five goals and was recognized as the tournament’s most outstanding player. The game was expected to have few and precious possessions, placing a premium on the afternoon-long battle at midfield between the face-off specialist Trevor Baptiste of Denver and Charlie Raffa of Maryland. Baptiste, a freshman who led the nation in winning percentage this season, and Raffa, a senior, ripped and plowed for each possession, a game within the game. Baptiste won 10 of 19 face-offs, including the one that tipped the balance with 32 seconds remaining, signaling to Denver’s bench that it could start celebrating. Bill Tierney will mark the achievement by hitting the road to recruit again in about a week, Trevor Tierney said. They will push deeper into places like California, Oregon and Washington, where lacrosse is still increasing in popularity at an impressive clip. They will point to Colorado, that outlier on the map of lacrosse’s winning programs, which for so long could be represented by only a handful of Eastern states. Bill Tierney was speaking about himself, about his decision to leave Princeton, but he could have been remarking about lacrosse in general when he said, “It was time for something different.” A version of this article appears in print on May 26, 2015, on page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: A Coach Reaffirms His Standing as Denver Breaks New Ground.

Question: Reed started studying protozoa and was more interested in the predatorial behaviors of protozoa, while Brad wanted to know more about other types of protozoa, suck as grazers and decomposers.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person learned less about protozoa that graze on algae?  Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Reed was more focused on studying the predatory behaviors of protozoa, while Brad was more interested in learning about other types of protozoa, such as grazers and decomposers. Given that herbivorous protozoa are the ones that graze on algae, it would be accurate to say that Reed learned less about protozoa that graze on algae compared to Brad. To elaborate further, protozoa occupy various positions in the food chain and play different roles as consumers. Reed's research focused primarily on the predatory aspect of protozoa, wherein they prey on other single-celled organisms like bacteria. This predation is essential in regulating bacterial populations and maintaining a balanced ecosystem. On the other hand, Brad was interested in exploring other types of protozoa beyond the predators, which included grazers and decomposers. Grazers are herbivorous protozoa that feed directly on algae, thus making them primary consumers in the food chain. Decomposers, as the name suggests, are responsible for breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. In contrast to Reed's focus on predatory protozoa, Brad's research encompassed a wider range of protozoan roles and interactions within their environment. With his interest in grazers and decomposers, Brad would have undoubtedly learned more about protozoa that graze on algae – the herbivorous ones – as opposed to Reed, whose primary focus was on protozoan predators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"The man kicked the ball\\" can be assessed by analyzing its structural, lexical, and semantic coherence within the domain of English language.  1. Structural Coherence: The sentence follows the basic rules of English grammar and syntax, establishing a structurally coherent statement. In terms of sentence constituents, it contains a subject (\\"The man\\"), a verb (\\"kicked\\"), and an object (\\"the ball\\"), arranged in a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern common to English declarative sentences. This pattern facilitates a clear understanding of the intended message. 2. Lexical Consistency: The lexical items used in the sentence are consistent within the English language. \\"Man,\\" \\"kicked,\\" and \\"ball\\" are readily recognizable English words, each with established meanings. \\"The\\" is a definite article that specifies the noun it precedes, conveying uniqueness or previously known entities (in this case, \\"the man\\" and \\"the ball\\"). \\"Kicked\\" is a transitive verb with a clear lexical meaning in the context of action. The combination of these words in the sentence showcases lexical consistency in the expression. 3. Semantic Coherence: Semantically, the sentence is coherent and meaningful. The action of a man kicking a ball is something that is easily understood and visualized by an English speaker. It presents a clear, focused, and plausible scenario rooted in everyday experiences. The relationships between the sentence constituents (i.e., subject, verb, and object) signal a logical sequence of actions that contribute to the overall comprehensibility of the message. 4. Pragmatic Aspects: Although there is limited context provided in terms of speaker intention, presupposition, or broader situational context, the sentence itself can still be regarded as having linguistic integrity due to its grammatical, lexical, and semantic coherence. However, it is important to note that further pragmatic analysis might be required to understand the speaker's meaning or intention in using this sentence within a specific communicative situation. In conclusion, the sentence \\"The man kicked the ball\\" can be considered as having linguistic integrity in terms of its adherence to the grammatical rules, lexical consistency, and semantic coherence within the framework of the English language. However, a more nuanced understanding of its pragmatic implications may require additional contextual information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: CIA interrogations report: New Congress must tackle how to get intelligence right. As I read news reports detailing the Senate Committee Report on the CIA interrogation program after the September 2001 terrorist attacks , I concluded there are several recurring problems to this latest effort to govern our national intelligence agencies . As an old man, I have had the opportunity to have first-hand exposure to how complex it is for Congress or even the White House to assert control over these vital intelligence activities . After there were revelations in the 60's that the CIA had engaged in a variety of activities that were highly questionable including efforts to kill Fidel Castro and others , the Carter administration reacted and went through the kind of political process that many are urging should be done today . In an attempt to purge the agency of its tendency to use nefarious individuals to carry out some of its covert projects, the CIA was directed to refuse to associate with any persons who could not meet the test of good character . One CIA officer told me how absurd that directive was . \\"We are trying to get people to betray their governments and to lie and cheat on our behalf. You cannot expect us to find those people in the front pew at the local churches.\\" Perhaps the directive was well-intentioned but it made no sense . Richard Helms, the CIA head from 1966 to 1973, whom I knew well and admired greatly, told me of his personal problems when he was indicted by the Carter Justice Department for perjury . In testimony he gave to the Congress, Helms denied under oath his agency had been involved in the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile, an action ordered by President Nixon . Helms told me he was following instructions he had been given repeatedly by various Senators including such powerful men as Senators Richard Russell and Walter George to the effect that if he were ever asked at an open hearing a question the answer to which \\"would put any of our people at risk\\" he should feel free to protect the secrets in whatever manner he wished . Of course Helms knew of many instances when he and others in the Agency had relied on that authority . Helms was defended by the powerful Washington lawyer, Edward Bennett Williams and the case against Helms was quickly resolved when Williams explained to the Justice Department his plan to have Helms take the stand and recite all the covert programs that had been protected by various forms of prevarications by intelligence officials . Of course no such trial in public made any sense and the danger to ongoing intelligence activities of testimony such as Williams would have had Helms provide was so great the ill- advised indictment of Helms resulted only in a slap on the wrist . Williams made a deal in which Helms pled guilty to a misdemeanor with no punishment . Later ,  President Ronald Reagan gave Helms the National Intelligence Medal as an obvious act of apology . Perjury is not to be condoned and lying before the Congress is criminal conduct . But the intelligence world involves subtle issues . If we want to have a major intelligence effort , there are clear costs to be accepted . One of them is that much of the necessary supervision by Congress has to be done with deft caution . It can hardly be conducted in open hearings . Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law Professor and prominent civil libertarian, contends torture to save lives should be permitted as long as there are rigorous procedural safeguards . He points out the Israelis have used torture for years with apparent success . Getting information from unwilling prisoners cannot be done without some risks to civilized process . It can be a dirty game . I once visited Vice President Walter Mondale at his White House office where he served under President Carter from 1977 to 1981 . His desk was piled high with documents he said were mainly reports from the CIA . He volunteered his frustration at the then weaknesses at the CIA . He told me he had come to regret he had been such a vigorous supporter of the gutting of that agency that followed the suggestions of the so-called Church Committee on which Mondale had served as a Senator . His comment was an isolated one and I merely listened . But the effects of the Church Committee recommendations were damaging to the CIA and the remedial work took years . Every forty years we may have to endure periodic reports like those produced under Senators Church and Feinstein that represent well intentioned reviews of the intelligence community . The suggested reforms speak of following our sense of justice and fairness and civility . The problem is obvious : Our enemies do not play fair and war is Hell . Any reforms of the intelligence universe cannot easily be effected . The idea of a transparent intelligence agency is an inherent contradiction . Moreover how can Congress talk openly of reforms without damaging our intelligence efforts? And politicians are among those least likely to be willing to accept the secrecy that is at the core of any well managed intelligence agency . Can we imagine a Congress that can keep the secrets? The new flurry of attacks on the intelligence community -- harmful and unnecessary-- will not have any more lasting impact than did the indictment of Helms or the work of the Church Committee . But there should be some quiet and thoughtful debate within our Congress about how it can supervise these vital intelligence programs . After all ,  our national intelligence work is existential .

Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.

Given the following context:  Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded.

At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued  for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founder of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights. Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: \\"She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years. She could neither read nor write, yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal.\\" Question: What did Mumbet learn from discussions about the new consititution? Answer: A:","output":"Mumbet learned from discussions about the new Massachusetts constitution that all people were free and equal. This inspired her to believe that the constitution should apply to her as well, which ultimately led her to sue for her freedom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Connie Ley made an unusual request in her will before she died last month in Aurora, Indiana: She asked that her German shepherd, Bela, be euthanized and buried with her. Three weeks later, however, Bela, who is 9 years old and male, is healthy and very much alive. And there's a growing movement on social media to defy his late owner's wishes and spare the animal. Ley's attorney, Doug Denmure, told CNN affiliate WCPO-TV that his late client preferred to send Bela to Best Friends Animal Society's no-kill sanctuary in southern Utah to live out the remainder of his days. But if transporting the dog across the country proved too expensive, Ley wanted a close friend to take charge of Bela and carry out her request that \\"the dog be put to sleep, cremated and that the dog's ashes be placed with her own ashes.\\" As it turned out, sending Bela to the Utah animal sanctuary was not financially feasible, Denmure told WXIX-TV, another CNN affiliate. But following a public outcry, a decision about the dog's fate has been put on hold for now, he said. Bela was with Ley when she died at home November 25. The dog is now being housed in a special kennel at PAWS of Dearborn County Humane Center in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Director Becky Foster said the center has no legal control over the dog's future and is waiting to hear from Ley's attorney. \\"He's been cared for very well,\\" Foster told CNN on Thursday. \\"We're happy to have him here as long as need be. He has toys and blankies and he's just chilling.\\" Meanwhile, animal lovers on Facebook and Twitter are urging that Bela be spared, calling Ley's decision selfish. Supporters have mounted an online petition to save the dog and are rallying around a #SaveBela hashtag. \\"Add me to the list of people who would gladly adopt Bela and give her a happy home. Please #SaveBela from her dead owner's stupidity,\\" one woman wrote. Best Friends Animal Society also has weighed in, posting a statement on its Facebook page urging fans to share #SaveBela messages. \\"We want to save Bela's life and bring him to our sanctuary, but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands,\\" said the post. \\"The decision needs to be made by the person designated in Ms. Ley's will and we are hopeful that she will agree.\\" Denmure maintains that everything about Ley's request is legal. \\"The dog was owned by my client and now it's part of her estate,\\" he told WCPO. \\"And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don't have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client's will and impose what they want.\\" Denmure said Ley didn't trust Bela to be around others and the 105-pound dog has a history of aggressive behavior. He told WCPO that a veterinarian recommended Bela be put down. \\"He could cause damage and inflict bodily harm on strangers, in particular, children.\\" The case has raised ethical questions about how much control deceased people should have over the life of their pets. \\"On the whole, we don't allow people to euthanize healthy pets,\\" said Edward Queen, a professor of ethics at Emory University. On the other hand, he said, it's not uncommon for unwanted pets to be euthanized. \\"As a matter of policy, do we really want people to control the life of a healthy pet on a whim?\\" he pondered. \\"Assuming the dog is healthy and will be cared for, I'm not sure we want to encourage this.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","output":"A lady named Connie Ley passed away last month and she had a German shepherd dog named Bela. Before she died, she requested in her will that her dog be euthanized, which means to put to sleep forever, and be buried with her.

Connie had wanted Bela to go to a no-kill sanctuary for dogs in Utah, but it was too expensive to send him there. So, she asked a close friend to take care of her request instead. Right now, Bela is staying at an animal shelter while people decide what to do. Many people on social media, like Facebook and Twitter, are urging that the dog should be saved and are using the hashtag #SaveBela. Even the sanctuary in Utah wants to save Bela's life, but it's up to the person Connie named in her will.

Indigenous peoples of Mexico (Spanish: pueblos indigenas de Mexico), Native Mexicans (Spanish: nativos mexicanos), or Mexican Native Americans (Spanish: nativo america mexicanos), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comision Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous of many different ethnic groups, which constitute 21.5% of Mexico's population. According to the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015, which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000 Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of \\"usos y costumbres\\", which allows them to regulate internal issues under customary law.  The indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average. Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, the Federal District and the Yucatan Peninsula.  According to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are: Yucatan, with 65.40%, Quintana Roo with 44.44% and Campeche with 44.54% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 65.73% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 36.15%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 36.21%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 35.28%, and Guerrero with 33.92%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potosi and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups. What are some other statistics that are relevant to the indigenous people of Mexico?","output":"Alright, imagine Mexico as a big neighborhood with lots of different families living in it. Some of these families have been living there for a very, very long time, even before other people came from far away to visit. These families that have been there for a very long time are called indigenous peoples. They come from many different groups, and they each have their own way of speaking, dressing, and doing things. In the whole neighborhood of Mexico, about 21.5% of all people say they are from these indigenous families. That's about 25,694,928 people! These families are growing, and more and more people are saying they are a part of these groups because they feel proud of their roots. These indigenous families usually live in smaller towns or villages. But some of them live in bigger cities too, especially in places like Mexico City, Puebla, and the Yucatan Peninsula. Different states in Mexico have more indigenous families than others. The ones with the most indigenous people are Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Hidalgo, Puebla, Guerrero, San Luis Potosi and Veracruz.

A. stress  B. understand themselves  C. pleasure  D. sense of joy  E. debt  The best answer is Answer:","output":"C. pleasure Opening a gift that one has carefully chosen and given to someone else during Christmas can bring an immense sense of pleasure and satisfaction to the gift giver. This pleasure stems from the joy of seeing a positive reaction from the gift recipient, the expression of gratitude, and the knowledge that one has made their loved one happy.  While other options like stress (A), understanding themselves (B), a sense of joy (D), or debt (E) might be experienced during the process of buying and giving Christmas presents, the act of seeing someone open a received gift evokes a clear and undeniable sense of pleasure for the giver. The pleasure experienced while giving a gift during Christmas celebrations is due to a combination of various factors. First, gift-giving is a universally acknowledged expression of love, care, and thoughtfulness. In many cultures, including Western traditions, Christmas is an occasion to demonstrate these emotions and forge stronger bonds with one's family members and friends. Thus, when someone sees their gift being opened by the receiver, the giver feels a sense of accomplishment and contentment for successfully expressing their feelings through the gesture. Second, the happiness of the gift recipient is contagious. As humans, experiencing the joy of others can often incite exhilarating and uplifting emotions within us. Therefore, witnessing someone's delight upon opening a Christmas present can elicit deep feelings of pleasure in the giver. Additionally, Christmas is a time when altruistic behavior is encouraged, and the spirit of giving is celebrated. When someone gives a gift, they might feel a sense of personal growth, as they have acted with generosity and kindness. This feeling of self-betterment further contributes to the pleasure experienced by the gift giver. Lastly, it's important to note that humans are social creatures, and the act of giving – particularly during festive occasions such as Christmas – reinforces social connections and the sense of belonging to a community. Therefore, seeing a loved one open a gift and appreciating the effort strengthens the relationship between the giver and the receiver, ultimately bringing greater pleasure to both parties. In summary, the best answer to the question of what seeing someone open a gift after buying Christmas presents causes for the gift giver is pleasure (C). This pleasure stems from the successful expression of love and care, the contagious joy of the recipient, feelings of self-betterment through generous acts, and the reinforcement of social bonds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on this statement, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) reports directly to the President. However, the President has many other direct reports besides the Director of National Intelligence, including the Vice President and the heads of executive departments that make up the President's Cabinet, such as the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury, and Attorney General, among others. Other key direct reports to the President include the White House Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, though the list goes beyond these positions as well. It is essential to consider that the president's direct reports form an extensive network of individuals responsible for essential aspects of government functioning, and all of them play a critical role in ensuring smooth governance and execution of responsibilities. These individuals report to the President on their respective policy issues to keep the President informed and facilitate decision-making on vital matters related to national security, the economy, domestic policies, and foreign affairs.

Q:Article: In May, 2014, some Chinese tourists found a Chinese-character message \\"Ding Jinhao once visited here\\" on a statue of god in a 3500-year-old Egyptian temple. An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online. Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. \\"We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China.\\" the boy's mother told the local newspaper. With China's economy booming over the past decades, a growing number of the country's residents have become global tourists. Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang addressed: \\"Uncivilized behavior of some of tourists is giving this country a bad reputation abroad.\\" The discussion about Chinese quality was carried out on many media. On the bright side, Egypt government described the damage to the temple as superficial and could be restored and they would forgive the boy. While the act of Ding Jinhao symbolizes a national shame, meanwhile, many people concern about the child's development and wish he could return to anonymity once more. \\"The boy has known his mistake and cried all night. He has to be moved around because reporters rushes to his house for interviews.\\" said a reporter who talked with the parents. Question: The passage is mainly about   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"the wave caused by Chinese uncivilized behavior\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"the wave caused by Chinese uncivilized behavior\\" is appropriate for what the passage is mainly about. The passage primarily discusses a particular event in which a Chinese teenager, Ding Jinhao, defaced a 3500-year-old statue in an Egyptian temple by inscribing Chinese characters on it, translating to \\"Ding Jinhao was here\\". This incident caused widespread outrage and provoked considerable backlash, not just from people in Egypt who were understandably upset about the defacement of their historical monument, but also within China and the larger global community. The incident instigated a widespread discussion on uncivilized behavior, more specifically, of Chinese tourists. The discussion was amplified by the fact that China, in recent years, have seen a significant increase in outbound tourism due to its booming economy. The Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang’s reference to the \\"uncivilized behavior of some tourists\\" further elevates this point. This incident influenced a collective introspection within China about the behavior and manners of its citizens abroad, underlining that the actions of one individual can affect a country's reputation as a whole. The ensuing social consequences for the teenager and his family, who became the targets of public shaming and harassment, were also part of the wave caused by this uncivilized behavior. This case highlighted the extent of public anger towards such actions but also raised ethical issues about how the boy's personal information was exposed and used, and the potential impact on his future development. The wave generated by the uncivilized behavior of Ding Jinhao was indeed extensive, affecting political, social, and personal spheres, domestically and internationally, and sparked a vital discussion on tourist manners, national reputation, and privacy ethics. Furthermore, this incident resulted in renewed calls for better tourist education and manners. Thus, the phrase \\"the wave caused by Chinese uncivilized behavior\\" aptly summarizes the main focus of the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Avery Ludlow (Brian Cox) is a 60-something widower who owns a small-town general store and lives with a 14-year-old mongrel dog named Red. (The dog was a gift from Ludlow's wife, who was murdered shortly afterward by their emotionally troubled son.)While taking a day off from work to go fishing, Ludlow and Red are met on the lakeshore by a deer-hunting trio of teenagers: Danny, his brother Harold, and their friend Pete (Noel Fisher, Kyle Gallner, and Shiloh Fernandez). Their conversation is at first friendly, but turns increasingly menacing as Danny - a swaggering bully - points his shotgun at Ludlow and demands money. Ludlow offers Danny the keys to his pickup truck, and says there's 20 or 30 dollars in his wallet in the glove box. Danny is disgusted at the small pickings, and on an impulse turns his shotgun toward Red, shooting him in the head. The boys walk away from the man and his dying dog, Danny and Pete laughing about it while Harold seems shaken and embarrassed.Ludlow takes his dog home and buries him. He learns Danny McCormack's identity by tracking down where he bought the shotgun. He goes to Danny's home and confronts the boy's father (Tom Sizemore), a wealthy businessman with political connections. Ludlow demands that McCormack discipline his son for what he did. McCormack summons his two sons, but they deny the incident happened. McCormack says Ludlow has the wrong culprits, and sends him away. Ludlow goes to his lawyer, who says even if the boys were tried and convicted of the crime, it is at best a 200-dollar fine and a few days in jail. The lawyer introduces Ludlow to Carrie (Kim Dickens), a TV reporter, who persuades him to let her do a feature story on the killing.What follows is an escalating cycle of hostilities between Ludlow and the McCormacks. After the TV story is aired, a rock is thrown through Ludlow's window, with a note saying he won't be on TV again. The next day Carrie's boss pulls her from the story.

Question: Given the following passage  \\"Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: Why were scientific academies considered more valuable than universities?

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  I am facing a new situation today: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which particle would have lower temperature, particle A or particle B? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify key information from the background article The background article states that in physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. Step 2: Apply this information to the new situation In the new situation, David is teaching school children about two particles of matter - particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, while particle B moves slower. Step 3: Compare the particles' movements to their temperatures Based on the information from the background article, the particle that moves more quickly (particle A) will have a higher temperature due to its greater kinetic energy. The particle that moves more slowly (particle B) will have a lower temperature because it has less kinetic energy. Step 4: Answer the question Given the information provided, we can confidently answer that particle B would have a lower temperature since it moves slower compared to particle A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The Dominican Republic, located in the Caribbean region and sharing the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. The Dominican Republic's official language is Spanish; however, the country is home to a diverse population, which has resulted in a beautiful tapestry of languages and dialects being spoken within its borders. Spanish, the official language, is spoken by the vast majority of the population. As a former Spanish colony, the language has been deeply ingrained into the country's cultural fabric, and it is used at all levels of society, including government, education, media, and business. The Spanish spoken in the Dominican Republic is primarily influenced by Andalusian and Canarian dialects from Spain, along with African and indigenous linguistic elements. This unique blend has given rise to the Dominican Spanish, which is characterized by distinct accents, vocabulary, and expressions that can vary by region. In addition to Spanish, several other languages and dialects are spoken in the Dominican Republic, owing to the country's diverse background. These languages are not official, but still hold importance in the lives of many Dominicans and contribute to the country's multicultural heritage. Some of these languages include: 1. Haitian Creole: It is the main language spoken by the Dominican Republic's Haitian population and their descendants. Haitian Creole is a French-based Creole language with influences from West African languages, Spanish, Taino, and other Amerindian languages. Although not an official language in the Dominican Republic, it is widely spoken in communities near the border shared with Haiti and among Haitian migrants.     2. Samaná English: This is a unique variety of English spoken in the Samaná Peninsula. It developed from a group of African American freed slaves and their descendants, who migrated from the United States to the Dominican Republic in the early 19th century. This English dialect is vibrant, with lexical and grammatical elements from West African languages interwoven with American English and has managed to survive despite isolation and the predominance of Spanish. 3. Dominican Sign Language: The deaf community in the Dominican Republic uses this sign language as their primary means of communication. It evolved independently and is distinct from American Sign Language, although there have been some contacts and exchanges between the two. 4. Indigenous & Minority Languages: The Dominican Republic has a small but significant presence of indigenous peoples, primarily Taino Arawakan descendants. While the original Taino language is considered extinct, some language revitalization efforts are underway. Some Taino vocabulary has been preserved in Dominican Spanish, as well as in the names of geographic locations, plants, and animals. Additionally, some Middle Eastern immigrant communities in the country speak Arabic and other languages from that region. In summary, the Dominican Republic's linguistic landscape is diverse and vibrant, with Spanish serving as the official language. Other languages like Haitian Creole, Samaná English, Dominican Sign Language, and various indigenous and minority languages also contribute to the richness of the nation's cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What type of details about steve refenes  can be gathered from the following bio?

To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation.  In which location the counter gas would be ionized, location B or location C?  Hint: You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the gas in the Geiger counter would be ionized in location B. Since location B has low radiation, the gas would encounter some radiation that would ionize it and cause the Geiger counter to click, indicating the presence of radiation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. So many social errors could be avoided if only more thought were involved. A truly gifted conversationalist will always try to filter what he says before he finally says it. While thinking about everything you're going to say may sound exhausting to some, it doesn't require a lot of brainpower. Really, all you'll usually need is a split-second to figure whether something you say might negatively affect someone around you. If you have a bad feeling about saying something, it's best to keep your mouth shut for the time being. It may help to be conscious of the way your voice is sounding when you speak. While it may be distracting to focus on yourself when you're trying to have a conversation, casually keeping track of the tone, speed and volume of your voice can go a long way towards preventing unintentional rudeness. In particular, be careful with your talking speed. Nervous or awkward people tend to accelerate their speech when they're under pressure. This only serves to add to the awkwardness. There's a lot empathy can do for you in a conversation. Being seen as polite and considerate isn't least among the benefits. Empathy is something virtually everyone has to some extent. The key to bringing it out is to invest a legitimate interest in what the other person is saying. If someone is telling you something about his life, make a concerted effort to see things from his point of view. If he recently lost his job, for example, try to empathize with how that might feel. Empathetic people are in tune with the other person's feelings and it's easier to charm them as such. Empathy works in less-than-pleasant interactions as well. It can be frustrating to talk to someone who is being aggressive or mean-spirited. While it can be easy to let loose on someone like that, you can have an easier time keeping calm by using empathy. Try to see the situation from the unpleasant person's point-of-view. In some cases, you may have a new lease on the situation by taking yourself out of your own perspective for a bit. Gossip is a quick route to rudeness. No one likes being talked about. Even if the subject in question isn't around to hear it, many people take offence to hearing people they know talked about in a negative light. If you want to avoid rudeness on your part, you should steer clear of interactions like this. Even if other people are gossiping, you should turn the other cheek. Those who are there to see you refuse the prospect will think more highly of you as a result. Modesty is a virtue for virtually all polite people. Some people are rude for the fact that they focus too much on themselves. This is most often an innocent fault, but it's one that can easily be avoided if you try to look at the conversation from both perspectives. Even if everything you're saying is gold, you'll still come across as rude if you don't think to hear the other person's side of things. As a general rule, people like to voice their opinions. They'll feel constricted if they can't get a word in. Listening is a skill, as real as any other. If you don't want to be rude, you'll need to have a fine command of listening. Active listening refers to a broad range of reactions that let the other person know you are giving him your fullest attention. This can include body language, such as nodding your head, or soft responses like repeating the gist of what the other person said can get this point across. Summary:","output":"To avoid social errors and rudeness in conversations, practice empathy, be conscious of your tone and talking speed, avoid gossip, practice modesty, and actively listen to others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous 515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed.

In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. \\"I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,\\" he boasts. \\"He didn't have to, Papa,\\" Nicole retorts, \\"he WAS Van Gogh!\\" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces.

Movie title: Into the Blue 2: The Reef Context: On a motorboat traveling off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii, someone is seen dumping two large containers into the ocean and then going to meet with a few guys in business suits expecting to get paid. But because he dumped the containers to avoid detection by the police, and altered the schedule of those container shipments to the customer, he is killed.The next day, Sebastian (Chris Carmack) and his girlfriend Dani (Laura Vandervoort) are dive surfing with a model. We learn that the group owns a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients (mostly mainland tourists). Sebastian doesn't want to do this line of work forever. For Sebastian, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship San Cristobal, which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a lot of treasure. Sebastian believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life.Sebastian hangs out with his friend and employee Mace (Michael Graziadei) and his girlfriend Kimi (Mircea Monroe), Dani's best friend, who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Mace tends to flirt with other women. While Mace and Kimi have a crazy relationship, Sebastian and Dani are very much in love.While at work, they are visited by Carlton (David Anders) and Azra (Marsha Thomason), a couple who wants to hire them for diving in the North Reef for a week because they are looking for the San Cristobal. Of course, Sebastian has been trying for several years to find it but Carlton happens to have a map which may lead them to the treasure. So, both Sebastian and Dani willingly agree to help the couple. The four go on various diving expeditions to find treasure.Over the next few days, we get to see some of the beach life as all six individuals enjoy the beach. Dani, Kimi, Sebastian, and Mace get involved in separate beach volleyball competitions....","output":"In the movie \\"Into the Blue 2: The Reef,\\" various characters get involved in separate beach volleyball competitions. These competitions are a part of the beach life and recreational activities that the characters indulge in between their diving expeditions in search of the sunken Spanish ship San Cristobal and its treasure. The primary characters that get involved in beach volleyball competitions are: 1. Sebastian (played by Chris Carmack): Sebastian is one of the main protagonists of the movie. He is a passionate treasure hunter, who runs a snorkeling business with his girlfriend, Dani. The beach volleyball competition provides a break from his work and treasure-hunting pursuits. 2. Dani (played by Laura Vandervoort): Dani is Sebastian's girlfriend and the co-owner of the snorkeling business. She is highly supportive of Sebastian's quest for the San Cristobal and joins him in these recreational activities, such as beach volleyball competitions. 3. Mace (played by Michael Graziadei): Mace is a close friend of Sebastian's and an employee at the snorkeling business. He is in a tumultuous relationship with Kimi, and the beach volleyball competitions serve as a way for the two of them to bond and spend time together outside of work. 4. Kimi (played by Mircea Monroe): Kimi is Dani's best friend and Mace's girlfriend. Despite their challenging relationship, Kimi participates in the beach volleyball competitions with the others as a means of relaxation and fun. These four characters, along with others visiting the beach, participate in separate beach volleyball competitions as a form of recreation and bonding. The competitions act as moments of leisure amidst their thrilling and sometimes dangerous treasure-hunting expeditions. These activities showcase the beauty of the beach life in Honolulu, Hawaii, and play a role in developing the relationships and dynamics between the central characters in the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Many of the victims had been headed home for R & R or emergency leave when they were killed .","output":"While both sentences share some similarities in meaning, there are subtle differences in their scopes and focus. Let's break down each sentence to better understand their meanings. 1. Many of the victims of Sunday's attack had been headed out of Iraq for R & R (Rest and Recuperation) or emergency leave.    In this sentence, \\"Many of the victims\\" refers to a significant number of people who were affected by the attack. The focus of this sentence is on their intended action - that is, the victims were attempting to leave Iraq. Their goal was to go for R & R (Rest and Recuperation) or to take emergency leave. The sentence explicitly identifies Sunday's attack as the event that affected these victims and highlights their intention to leave Iraq at that specific moment - which, presumably, is the reason they became victims. 2. Many of the victims had been headed home for R & R or emergency leave when they were killed.    In the second sentence, the reference to \\"Many of the victims\\" again signifies a significant number of people who were affected. This time, however, the sentence's focus is on the ultimate outcome - the fact that these people were killed. This sentence also tells us about the victims' intended action: to head home for R & R or emergency leave. Nonetheless, the sentence does not explicitly mention the event (Sunday's attack) that led to the victims' demise; it only indicates that they were killed at the moment they were trying to go home. In summary, both sentences convey that many victims were intending to leave for R & R or emergency leave. The first sentence emphasizes the event (Sunday's attack) and their intention to get out of Iraq, while the second sentence focuses on the fact that they were killed while trying to go home. The two sentences do not necessarily contradict each other, but they provide slightly different perspectives on the same general situation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Chana Orloff ( 1888 -- 1968 ) was an Israeli Art deco and figurative art sculptor .  - Art Deco, or Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I. It became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for \\"Arts Décoratifs\\", from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - The International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts was a World's fair held in Paris, France, from April to October 1925. It was designed by the French government to highlight the new \\"style moderne\\" of architecture, interior decoration, furniture, glass, jewelry and other decorative arts in Europe and throughout the world. Many ideas of the international avant-garde in the fields of architecture and applied arts were presented for the first time at the Exposition. The event took place between the esplanade of Les Invalides and the entrances of the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, and on both banks of the Seine. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries; and it was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The \\"Style Moderne\\" presented at the Exposition later became known as \\"Art Deco\\", after the name of the Exposition.  - Figurative art, sometimes written as figurativism, describes artworkparticularly paintings and sculpturesthat is clearly derived from real object sources, and is therefore by definition representational. \\"Figurative art\\" is often defined in contrast to abstract art:  - Abstract art uses a visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments?, using the article: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff.

The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has set for deciding whether he will run for president in 2016. Rubio is scheduled to huddle with supporters in Miami Beach on Jan. 23 and 24, days that should be circled in red ink on everyone's political calendar. (Surely, the big bosses will want me to stake out that meeting in sunny Florida?) Rubio has been insisting that former Florida governor Jeb Bush's plans to enter the race have no bearing on what he will do. Maybe not. But it probably should. A couple of data points to consider from a few polls: This isn't where Rubio thought he would be two years ago when he was being cast by, well, everyone as the future of the GOP. So what must he and his donors consider as they look at his 2016 prospects? First, what's his path in this crowded field? Republican strategists look at the very full roster of possible candidates and see three camps, some slightly overlapping: the establishment camp, the tea party/libertarian camp and the evangelical camp. Although Rubio has some tea party support, his approach to foreign policy and immigration reform make him a not-perfect fit there. And he is hardly the best fit for the evangelical camp either, despite his efforts at appealing to that group. There is only one savior, and it is not me. #Jesus Which leaves the establishment camp, and the fundraising juggernauts named Bush and Romney. Imagine Rubio in conversations with possible donors. What's his best case for why he is a better investment than Bush or Romney to beat the field and eventually stand onstage with Hillary Clinton? Appeal to Hispanics? Bush has the same argument. Fresh face? Sure. But maybe a little too fresh. He has the Obama problem on that score. And his youth means he has plenty of time. This isn't his last, best chance, like a few others. The best argument to stay on the sidelines is that Rubio's best shot at becoming president, something he clearly wants to become, is his Senate seat. If he runs for president in 2016, that means giving up his launching pad. (He has said he wouldn't run for president and reelection.) It's a risky move. Why make it now? Rubio still has a long runway ahead of him. At 43, he is two decades younger than Bush. He could stay in the Senate for another term, or run for governor in 2018. In 2020 or 2024, he will still be a young man. But one with a longer resume and probably a less chock-full field to deal with. And if Rubio doesn't run for the big office in 2016, he'll be on every potential nominee's VP shortlist. Of course, all of this is subject to change, because politics.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe.

They embarked on the sold out tour on May 25, 2014 in Park City, Kansas and ended it in Los Angeles on July 26, 2014. Due to the success of ticket sales and several sold out venues before the tour had officially kicked off, several more shows were added to the tour schedule, which also sold out. For the tour choreography, the Hough siblings collaborated with Nappytabs.  Following the success of the 2014 tour and high demand, the Houghs announced the return of \\"Move Live on Tour\\" in the summer of 2015.

Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo \\"Nappytabs\\" returned as collaborating choreographers alongside the Hough siblings. Auditions were also held to recruit a new group of dancers to join the Houghs, although some back-up dancers from the previous year returned.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844).  - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees.  - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science.

Answer the following question: What former astronaut was a character in the 1995 film Apollo 13, as well as Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert? Answer:","output":"The former astronaut character in the 1995 film Apollo 13, along with Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert, is Fred Haise. The film is a docudrama that tells the story of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, which was NASA's third mission intended to land astronauts on the moon. The mission had to be aborted when one of the spacecraft's oxygen tanks exploded, and the crew faced a life-threatening situation while returning to Earth. Fred Haise, played by Bill Paxton in the movie, was the Lunar Module Pilot on the Apollo 13 mission. He was born on November 14, 1933, in Biloxi, Mississippi, and joined NASA in 1966 as an astronaut. Before joining NASA, Haise had already built an impressive career as a military test pilot and aeronautical engineer. He was instrumental in the development of several prominent military aircraft, including the F-111 and F-14 Tomcat. In the film Apollo 13, which was directed by Ron Howard, actors Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton play the three astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise. The film closely follows the real-life events of the Apollo 13 mission, accurately portraying the challenges and dangers faced by the astronauts. The movie is based on the book \\"Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13,\\" written by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The astronauts' bravery, resourcefulness, and determination to survive the harrowing ordeal are vividly depicted in the movie. Apollo 13 highlights the importance of teamwork, ingenuity, and quick thinking under immense pressure to adapt and overcome life-threatening situations. The movie was a critical and commercial success, receiving nine Academy Award nominations and winning two for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. In summary, Fred Haise is the former astronaut who was a character in the 1995 film Apollo 13, alongside Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert. While their mission did not go as planned, the story of Apollo 13 has lived on as a testament to human ingenuity and the will to survive in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

However, many people don't smile because they think they have ugly teeth. For example, one of my classmates, Mike, doesn't have very nice teeth, so that is why he seldom opens his mouth. He even says that he has lost confidence because of his teeth. So it is very important for us to look after our teeth. In fact, a lot of people have this problem. Some people inherit teeth problems from their parents, while others' teeth are damaged because of bad habits, like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar or not brushing teeth often. If your teeth are in bad shape, you should see a dentist and ask for help. They can help improve your teeth and tell you how to take care of them. Smiling can help you to feel more confidence and make people think of you as a more friendly person. If you want to keep healthy, you should not only smile but also laugh. An Indian doctor called Kataria said that young children should laugh about 30 times a day, while adults should laugh between 7 and 15 times a day. So please take this chance to smile and laugh now. Answer:","output":"Question: According to the article, why is it important to look after our teeth and what factors can lead to poor dental health? a) Smiling can boost confidence and make people think you are friendly; poor dental health can be inherited from parents or caused by bad habits like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar, or not brushing teeth often. b) Looking after our teeth can help us to have more friends; poor dental health is only caused by bad habits like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar, or not brushing teeth often. c) Taking care of our teeth can help us to eat our favorite foods; poor dental health can be inherited, but is not caused by bad habits. d) Dental health is not important; poor dental health does not affect our self-confidence.

Context: \\"Puritan\\" (ACM-16/MMA-16) was built for the United States Army as U.S. Army Mine Planter (USAMP) \\"Col. Alfred A. Maybach\\" MP-13. The ship was transferred to the United States Navy and classified as an auxiliary minelayer. \\"Puritan\\" was never commissioned and thus never bore the \\"United States Ship\\" (USS) prefix showing status as a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. Hypothesis: \\"Puritan\\" was never a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy.","output":"From the provided context, we can draw the hypothesis that \\"Puritan\\" was never a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. The context gives us several reasons to support this hypothesis which are explained in detail below. 1. The initial purpose of the ship: The context states that the \\"Puritan\\" was built for the United States Army as the U.S. Army Mine Planter (USAMP) under the name \\"Col. Alfred A. Maybach\\" MP-13. This indicates that its original function was to serve in the capacity of a mine planter for the U.S. Army, and not necessarily a commissioned ship for the U.S. Navy. 2. Transfer to the U.S. Navy: The context also mentions that the ship was indeed transferred to the United States Navy, specifically as an auxiliary minelayer. This illustrates that while the ship eventually came under the jurisdiction of the Navy, its role was still primarily focused on performing a specific support function, which was in line with its original purpose as a mine planter. 3. Lack of commissioning: The fact that the \\"Puritan\\" was never commissioned is provided in the context as well. A ship is commissioned when it is placed in active service and formally becomes part of the naval fleet. The commissioning of a ship typically involves a ceremony and the ship is then granted the \\"United States Ship\\" (USS) prefix. Since \\"Puritan\\" was never commissioned, it never went through this formal process, hence it was never granted the USS prefix. 4. No USS prefix: The context explicitly states that \\"Puritan\\" never bore the \\"United States Ship\\" (USS) prefix, a clear indication that it was not considered a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. This prefix is only applied to commissioned ships, which serve as a testament to their status within the Navy. In conclusion, considering all these factors, we can draw the hypothesis that \\"Puritan\\" was never a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. The information from the context demonstrates that the ship's original and primary purpose was to function as a mine planter for the U.S. Army, later serving an auxiliary support role for the U.S. Navy, and it was never commissioned or granted the USS prefix."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Samantha Finley (Erin Marie Hogan), her older brother Thomas (Shane Van Dyke), and their mother Ellen (Fia Perera) believe that Ellen has been making contact with her deceased husband, David. Soon the family claims that a demon is haunting them. At first, they think it is David, but after a series of horrible attacks on Samantha, they suspect otherwise. One night the camera records Ellen sitting up in bed and leaving her bedroom. She walks into the living room, where she writes something on a piece of paper. She then crumples the paper and walks back down the hallway. Thomas finds the paper under Samantha's pillow and sees that it spells out the word \\"MARON\\". Thomas suggests that Ellen and Samantha stay at a hotel while he sets up traps around the house with bells and wire. When the bells ring, Thomas investigates. The wire and bell outside his door are ripped from the wall and thrown at him. Thomas shuts himself in the bedroom and the demon bangs on his door. Thomas receives a phone call from Ellen, who is in hysterics after the demon apparently followed them and attacked Samantha. Upon returning to the house, Samantha hunches over in pain.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  Two elementary school classmates, Clarence and Molly, are sitting in the back row of the classroom while the teacher lectures. They are both paying attention and reading what the teacher is writing on the board, but Molly is finding it difficult to read what is on the board since it appears blurry.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy   to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses   on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

The bulletproof armoured car that kept Al Capone safe from his enemies is up for auction for £325,000. The U.S, gangster’s 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan was fitted with 3,000lb of steel armour and painted green with black fenders to mimic a police car, with flashing lights, a siren and police-band radio receiver. The bulletproof windows could be raised to reveal holes through which machine guns could be fired, while the rear window could be dropped to let his henchman fire on those chasing them. Untouchable: A Cadillac which was kitted out with steel armour and bulletproof windows to protect its owner - legendary Chicago gangster Al Capone - is going on sale. Capone was eventually jailed for tax. evasion, and ironically his 84-year-old car is classed as a classic and. is therefore tax exempt. Latterly owned by a U.S. car collector, it will be sold at RM Auctions in California on August 20. The car even had a flashing light, siren and the first police-band radio receiver in private hands. To further protect its precious load the bulletproof glass windows could be wound further than normal to reveal circular holes through which machine guns could be fired. And in case this was not enough to deter any drivers taking up the chase, the rear window of the ride was rigged to drop at an instant so Capone’s henchmen could open fire at any following cars. The car, which is thought to have been. briefly used by President Franklin Roosevelt after Capone was imprisoned. for tax evasion, is expected to fetch a six figure sum at auction. Decked out: Al Capone would have been safe in this one, the 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan has 3,000lbs of steel armour fitted and was used by President Roosevelt after Capone's imprisonment. Machine gun friendly: The bullet proof glass had muzzle sized holes for Capone and his fellow gangsters to fit their guns and even a drop down rear window, pictured, to mow down pursuers. Considering his crime – the one he was. imprisoned for – Capone would probably have been pleased to know that. his old car, being 84-years-old, is classed as a classic and is. therefore tax exempt. After. Capone’s imprisonment the vehicle went on to be shown around the world,. even making a trip to the UK in the 1950’s displayed at the. Southend-on-Sea amusement park and at the Blackpool funfair. It later entered the collection of the. US motor enthusiast John O'Quinn who died last year in a car crash and. it is now being sold as part of his estate. The car is going on sale at the end of August and is expected to fetch £325,000 at the auction. In. their research into the origins of the car, auctioneers uncovered. 92-year-old Richard Capstran, whose mechanic father fitted the armour. He said Capone's mobsters arrived and told him what they wanted doing. Mr Capstran said: ‘My dad said “we don't do that kind of work here,” and they said “you do now.”’ The car was then backed into the garage so no one could see what was happening to it. Mr. Capstran said Capone turned up to pay the bill himself and even gave. the ten-year-old Mr Capstran a ten dollar note - a small fortune to a. young boy at the time. A. spokesman for RM Auctions said: ‘This is. widely considered as one of the most historically significant pre-war. American cars. ‘It is. liveried in green with black fenders to mirror the Cadillacs supplied to. the Chicago police and city officials at the time. ‘It. is one of the earliest surviving \\"bulletproof\\" cars and was fitted new. with heavy glass measuring nearly an inch thick and completely lined. with 3,000lbs of steel armour plating. ‘‘It has undergone restoration and is a fabulous piece of history.’ Alphonse 'Al' Capone was born to Italian immigrants in Brooklyn, New York in 1899. After being kicked out of school aged 14. he became involved in local teenage gangs and  but moved to Chicago in. his early twenties to take advantage of the thriving market for illegal. alcohol during the first years of Prohibition. Capone, imprisoned for tax evasion, would probably have a laugh at his old ride being tax exempt. There he ran prostitution rings, illegal gambling halls but made most of his money running speakeasy bars where thirsty Chicago dwellers could get their hands on banned alcohol. He rose to become the leader of 'The Chicago Outfit' gang, which later became known as 'The Capone Family' and ruled the streets of Chicago from the early 1920's until his capture in 1931. Despite his gangster ways Capone was a highly visible public figure in Chicago and even opened charity soup kitchens and worked for the safety of the city's children. Capone has been credited with ordering one of the most famous mass murders in 20th century America - the Valentine's Day Massacre - where members of his gang gunned down seven of the rival Moran gang whilst dressed in police uniforms. The law finally caught up with the mob leader in 1931 when he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for tax evasion. He spent a majority of his sentence in the famous Alcatraz prison where he was famous for manipulating prison guards. His health deteriorated in prison and he was no longer capable to run 'The Chicago Outfit' upon his release. Suffering from neurosyphilis his mental health broke down and when examined a few years after his release he was said to have the mental capacity of a 12-year-old. Al Capone died in 1947 in Palm Island, Florida. Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article talks about a very special car that belonged to a famous gangster named Al Capone. He was a big boss in a city called Chicago a long, long time ago.  Al Capone had a car called a 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan, and it was made to help keep him safe from bad people who wanted to hurt him. The car had really thick steel armor, which is like a strong metal coat, and special windows that were bulletproof, so bullets from guns couldn't go through them.  The car was painted green and black to look like a police car. It even had flashy lights, a loud siren, and something to listen to police radio. The car also had hidden holes for machine guns and a special back window that could quickly open for his friends to shoot from if they were being chased. After Al Capone went to jail and couldn't use the car anymore, a president named Franklin Roosevelt used it for a short time. Now, the car is being sold in an auction for a lot of money, around £325,000!

Information:  - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence  though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace.  - Schio is a town and comune in the province of Vicenza (region of Veneto, northern Italy) situated North of Vicenza and East of the Lake of Garda. It is surrounded by the Little Dolomites (Italian Prealps) and Mount Pasubio.\\"'\\"Which is Sheridan more like, Mantova or Verona or Vicenza? It isn't like any of those. It is right up against the mountains, almost like Schio.\\" \\"Ernest Hemingway\\" History. Its name comes from Latin: escletum was a wood of oaks and it was first used in a document of some Benedictines from Vicenza. The first settlements were around two old hills, where now there are respectively the ruins of an old castle and a majestic neoclassical cathedral.  - An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, four-wheeler, or quadricycle as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states and provinces of Australia, the United States or Canada.  - A moped (/mopd/ MOH-ped) is a small motorcycle, generally having a less stringent licensing requirement than motorcycles or automobiles because mopeds typically travel about the same speed as bicycles on public roadways. Strictly speaking, mopeds are driven by both an engine and by bicycle pedals, but in common usage and in many jurisdictions the term moped is used for similar vehicles including a scooter, though this is quite erroneous. Mopeds occasionally resemble powered bicycles, more commonly called a motorized bicycle, though since ca. 2006 there has been a glut of engine kits shipped from China (although Tanaka had offered drive kits since the 1960s) designed in theory to transform a standard bicycle into a motor vehicle but lacking the benefit of proper brakes and lighting. In addition, the added stresses can cause the rear rim to warp, and the spokes to break, and if the engine is the least bit out of alignment the drive chain will come off the drive sprocket, causing the rim to warp and the spokes to break, as well as lodging the chain in the chainstay and causing injury to the operator. Some mopeds are of a step-through type design, while others are step-over, or \\"top tank\\", designs, having a motorcycle-like frame, including a \\"backbone\\" and a raised fuel tank (known as a \\"top tank\\" among moped enthusiasts), mounted directly between the saddle and the head tube. Most are similar to a regular motorcycle, only having the addition of pedals, in which the rider can both manually power the vehicle through a bicycle-like crankset in addition to a small displacement engine. Although mopeds usually have two wheels, some regions classify low-powered three- or (rarely) four-wheeled vehicles as a moped. Many(US ?)states have laws on the books that anyone convicted of a DUI cannot legally operate any motor vehicle powered by gasoline for the entire length of their sentence.  - Derbi is a manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters, mopeds and recreational all-terrain vehicles produced by Nacional Motor S.A.U., a Spanish subsidiary of Piaggio & Co.

Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.  - Honda has been the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959, as well as the world's largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume, producing more than 14 million internal combustion engines each year. Honda became the second-largest Japanese automobile manufacturer in 2001. Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world behind General Motors, Volkswagen Group, Toyota, Hyundai Motor Group, Ford, Nissan, and PSA Peugeot Citroën in 2011.  - A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.

Passage: On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.

It Won’t Matter for U.S. Basketball in Rio Stephen Curry isn’t on the team, and neither is LeBron James or Russell Westbrook. Nor is Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul or James Harden. Though all these players would be automatic selections to a “best American” basketball team, each has bowed out of consideration for the United States Olympic team, citing fatigue or injury. But the 12 men who were named to the team Monday morning are still a formidable group and will be heavily favored to win another gold medal. In other words, the United States bench is deep. Meet the 2016 U.S. Olympic Men’s Basketball TeamRoster: https://t.co/SVpGiA5Dxl#UNITE #RoadToRio #USABMNT pic.twitter.com/hcg1tqPUOX The best American gymnasts or volleyball players wouldn’t pass up an Olympic opportunity. And most international men’s basketball stars keep playing for their home countries as long as they can. Dirk Nowitzki was still plugging away last fall at age 37 for Germany at the European Championships. But with a grueling N.B.A. schedule just completed and another one around the corner, many of America’s best have decided this is not the year to add a summer tournament to their schedules. Does this open up an opportunity for Nigeria or Venezuela to win the gold in Rio? Well, no. The United States team starts with one no-arguments superstar, Kevin Durant. No other country will feature a player with close to his all-around skills. Curry is missing, but the other Splash brother, Klay Thompson, is on the team, along with his Warriors teammates Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes. Though James is taking the summer off, the N.B.A. champion Cleveland Cavaliers are represented by Kyrie Irving. The American team is notably versatile. Except for the two centers, DeMarcus Cousins and DeAndre Jordan, and the two point guards, Irving and Kyle Lowry, every player is listed from 6-foot-7 to 6-9, and many play multiple positions. Paul George is also on the team, despite having sustained a serious leg injury while training for the 2014 World Cup of Basketball, which caused him to miss nearly a full N.B.A. season. The team is rounded out by Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan and Carmelo Anthony, playing in his fourth Olympics. The Americans’ status as gold medal favorites is enhanced by the other contenders’ relatively weak rosters. Spain has been the second best team in the world for many years, but is led by a 36-year-old, Pau Gasol. The status of his brother Marc, who broke his foot with the Grizzlies in February, is unclear, and Serge Ibaka, the Orlando Magic star, will not play, citing the long N.B.A. season. That leaves Ricky Rubio as Spain’s No. 2 star. Other contenders have even fewer N.B.A.-quality players. Lithuania, runner-up to Spain in last year’s Euros, is led by Jonas Valanciunas, a solid center for the Raptors who would not have come close to the Olympics were he an American. Other teams have legitimate N.B.A. stars who are getting toward the end of their careers. Manu Ginobili of Argentina is 38. Anderson Varejão and Leandro Barbosa of host Brazil are 33. Tony Parker and Boris Diaw of France are both 34 (and France has not yet qualified for the Games). While all of these teams have good players from the European leagues, even the biggest Europhile acknowledges the huge gulf between the quality of the N.B.A. and Italy’s Serie A or Spain’s Liga ACB. In 2012, a more star-studded United States team finished 8-0, but faced two close games, a 5-point win over Lithuania in the group stage and a 7-point win in the gold medal game over Spain. Durant had 30 points in the final, which was close throughout. In 2008, the Americans were again 8-0 with an 11-point win over Spain for the gold medal the closest game. Knowing that the Americans are likely to win the gold medal won’t make you rich. Sky Bet currently offers odds of 1-14 on the United States — a 14 bet will earn you just a buck. Spain is the second favorite at 10-1, and Brazil is 20-1. After the group stage, the Olympic tournament moves to single-elimination quarterfinals, semifinals and final, so a fluky loss is not impossible. But even without its biggest stars, the United States is playing with by far the best team. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Even though some famous basketball players like Steph Curry, LeBron James, and Russell Westbrook won't be playing in the Rio Olympics, the United States basketball team is still very strong. They have a lot of good players who can play different positions and help the team win. Many people believe the United States will win another gold medal in basketball at the Olympics because their team is better than the teams from other countries.

Given the question: Given the following context:  The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured. The vase was next restored by J. W. R. Axtell in 1948–1949, and then by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989.  answer the following question:  What was restored by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989?

The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

It is the first time the West African country has hosted the VIP event since the Geneva-based WEF came to the continent nearly a quarter century ago -- but the spotlight has shifted. Focus is now on the Nigeria's list of problems in the North: kidnappings, terrorist attacks and killings. The country has been a terrific economic growth story for the past few years, humming along at around 7%. It is at the heart of what many define as an African Renaissance. After decades of loans from international lenders such as the World Bank, high debt and little development, Africa is coming alive. That is why Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and his highly regarded economic team were eager to bring global CEOs to their turf. But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam. These groups take issue with what they see as the negative influences of globalization. The WEF is seen as standing at the forefront of a policy discussion and networking linked to more, not less, globalization. The best indicator for the wealth gap is per capita income. Let's start in the financial capital of Lagos and work our way North. In Lagos, it is pegged at just over 2,900, according to a survey by Renaissance Capital. In the political capital of Abuja, where the economic forum is taking place, it rises to 4,000. But if one heads North to Borno -- the birthplace of Boko Haram -- per capita income is just 1,631. There is an overemphasis on farming, very little in the way of an industrial base and the financial situation is even worse in surrounding states. In Borno, alarmingly, 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker. Poverty and violence often go hand-in-hand, and that is the case here. Nearly a third of all violent deaths in the country over the past two years have taken place in this region. One cannot overlook the effort by the terrorist group to ramp up the heat ahead of this high-profile business forum. But at the same time one cannot ignore the lack of progress in fighting off the violence and persistent corruption. This government's track record of unleashing pent-up demand is solid.  After re-basing its economy in early April to take in services growth, Nigeria zoomed ahead of South Africa as the continent's biggest economy. Nigeria and South Africa are both plagued with high unemployment, but the former's GDP now stands at over a half trillion dollars while the latter's is at 325 billion. South Africa also struggles with less than a third of Nigeria's growth. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma goes to the polls making the case that his country can serve as a springboard into the faster growing economies of West and East Africa, due to its lead in financial and trade services. Nigerian private sector banks and telecom providers have a different view. Nigeria has all the ingredients for growth: 170 million people, a low debt level and low budget deficit with the blessing of sizable proven oil reserves.  At 37 billion barrels, the country is ranked second on the continent behind Libya. It is a nice recipe for growth, but the rule of law and rooting out corruption rank high on the foreign investor check list. That is where Nigeria remains vulnerable.

They are excited because their country has been doing very well and making lots of money. But there is a problem too: there are some people in the North of Nigeria who are very unhappy about this event and the way the country is being run. They are causing trouble, like kidnapping and attacking others. This is because they feel left out since they are much poorer than people in the other parts of Nigeria.  Even though Nigeria has all the right things to grow and be successful, like lots of people, money from oil and not much debt, they need to make sure that they follow the law and treat everyone fairly. This will help them become an even better country and make people all around the world want to join them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The Hellenistic period of colonization differed from earlier periods of conquest in several ways. Firstly, Hellenistic colonization was marked by the establishment of Greek cities and kingdoms in diverse regions, including Asia, Africa, and Southwest Asia, whereas earlier colonization was primarily focused on the Mediterranean. Secondly, Hellenistic colonization involved the export of Greek culture and language to these new regions, leading to a fusion of Greek culture with local cultures. This contrasts with earlier Greek attitudes of superiority over \\"barbarian\\" cultures.  Thirdly, the colonists in Hellenistic cities came from various parts of the Greek world, rather than a specific \\"mother city\\" as was the case in earlier periods. This resulted in the emergence of a common Attic-based dialect, Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca throughout the Hellenistic world.

Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Stian Aarstad is a Norwegian pianist and keyboard player best known for his five - year ( 1992 -- 97 ) stint with the black metal band Dimmu Borgir during which he played keyboards and synthesizers while engendering criticism and controversy for appearing onstage and performing in a top - hat - and - cape outfit reminiscent of Jack the Ripper , while wearing minimal corpse makeup and not moving or showing any emotion . Upon joining Dimmu Borgir , he did n't listen to metal music , preferring only to listen to classical . In 1998 to 1999 , he produced a demo - EP for the unblack metal band Vaakevandring . In the 2000s , Aarstad had been the pianist for the band Enthral , but left his regular position during the recording of the band 's third album .  - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member.  - Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The name \\"Jack the Ripper\\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The killer was called \\"the Whitechapel Murderer\\" as well as \\"Leather Apron\\" within the crime case files, as well as in contemporary journalistic accounts.  - Whitechapel is a district in the East End of London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Dimmuborgir (\\"dimmu\\" \\"dark\\", \\"borgir\\" \\"cities\\" or \\"forts\\", \\"castles\\"); pronounced ) is a large area of unusually shaped lava fields east of Mývatn in Iceland.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Alright, so here's what happened: In Cuba, the leader named Raul Castro said they will let more than 2,900 prisoners go home. They are doing this because their families, and some religious groups, asked for it and because it's a kind thing to do. They will let out people who are old, sick, or didn't do really bad things. But they won't let out people who did very bad things like spying and hurting others. However, an American man named Alan Gross won't be let out, even though he says he didn't do anything bad. The leader also said they are doing this nice thing because a special guest, Pope Benedict XVI, is coming to visit Cuba soon."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph:   A person can live a normal, healthy life with just one kidney.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this","output":"The phrase \\"guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this\\" can be characterized as negative.  To comprehend why this phrase reflects a negative sentiment, we first need to break it down and examine each component. The term \\"guilty\\" implies that an error or misdeed has been committed, typically associated with a sense of wrongness or fault. In this context, guilt is tied to the \\"worst sin.\\" The word \\"sin\\" suggests a behavior or act that goes against a moral philosophy or system of beliefs. When coupled with the adjective \\"worst,\\" this insinuates that the act is not only unacceptable but also represents the most egregious violation possible. The phrase \\"attributable to a movie like this\\" demonstrates a direct connection between the \\"worst sin\\" and the movie being discussed. By linking the two, the speaker or writer is pointing out an undesirable quality or element about the movie. Since the phrase emphasizes the gravity of the transgression, it offers a strong critique of the movie and intimates that the production has failed in a significant way. Considering the various elements of this phrase, it becomes clear that it conveys disapproval and criticism. Thus, the phrase can be regarded as negative, as it is used to express dissatisfaction and disappointment in relation to a movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is the interview being used for? The answer is:","output":"The interview is being used for creating an artist portrait of Claire, which aims to explore her creativity, understand her perspective on being an artist, gain insights into her work and practice, and look toward the future of her practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We achieve this by employing high levels of redundancy in the way we store our data and the key hardware components that are essential for smooth operations. To maintain the highest levels of reliability and prevent service interruptions, the following strategies have been implemented in our cloud infrastructure: 1. Data Redundancy: We utilize multiple levels of data redundancy to ensure that data remains accessible and secure even in the face of hardware failures. This includes:    a. Replication: Data is continuously replicated across multiple storage devices and data centers. This ensures that the loss of any single device or data center will not result in the loss of any data.    b. Backup: In addition to real-time replication, we also perform regular data backups. These backups are securely stored in geographically separated locations to further safeguard against data loss. 2. Hardware Redundancy: To minimize the chances of hardware failures causing service interruptions, we utilize redundant hardware components wherever possible. This includes:    a. Servers: Our cloud infrastructure relies on clustered server configurations, with multiple servers operating in parallel. If a server experiences a failure, the remaining servers in the cluster can continue to handle requests without interruption.    b. Networking: We deploy multiple network connections and pathways to ensure that traffic can continue to flow even if a network hardware component fails or becomes compromised.    c. Power: Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and backup generators are implemented in our data centers to ensure that power outages do not disrupt service. 3. Fault-tolerant Design: Our cloud infrastructure has been designed with fault tolerance in mind. This ensures that if a failure occurs within a component, the system can automatically recover and continue to function without manual intervention.    a. Load balancing: We use advanced load balancing techniques to distribute traffic evenly among multiple servers. This not only enhances performance but also provides a level of redundancy, as the failure of a single server will not result in a loss of service.    b. Automatic failover: In the event of a failure, our systems are designed to automatically detect and route around the issue, keeping your service running smoothly. 4. Monitoring and Maintenance: Regular monitoring and maintenance are performed by our skilled technicians to identify and address potential issues before they can escalate into larger problems.    a. Monitoring: We have implemented continuous monitoring across our entire infrastructure to detect issues before they result in service interruptions or data losses.    b. Maintenance: Routine maintenance tasks are performed to proactively address potential hardware, software, and network issues, ensuring our cloud remains highly available and reliable. In conclusion, our cloud infrastructure has been meticulously designed and implemented to provide a highly reliable service that minimizes the risks associated with service interruptions and data losses.

Is raise used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? To raise Sandy Hook light. Raise the specter of unemployment.","output":"I will analyze and compare the meanings of \\"raise\\" in these two sentences. Sentence 1: To raise Sandy Hook light. Step 1: Define \\"raise\\" in this context. In this sentence, \\"raise\\" likely means to elevate or lift something (Sandy Hook light) to a higher position. Step 2: Analyze the object being raised (Sandy Hook light). Sandy Hook light could refer to a lighthouse or a light situated in Sandy Hook, an area in the United States. In this context, raising the light would involve physically lifting it to a higher position, perhaps to increase its visibility or adjust its angle. Sentence 2: Raise the specter of unemployment. Step 1: Define \\"raise\\" in this context. In this sentence, \\"raise\\" has a metaphorical meaning. It means to bring up or introduce a topic, idea, or concern. Step 2: Analyze the object being raised (the specter of unemployment). The \\"specter of unemployment\\" is an abstract concept referring to the fear or concern of possible job loss in a certain context. Raising the specter of unemployment means discussing or drawing attention to potential unemployment problems or consequences. After analyzing these sentences, I conclude that the word \\"raise\\" is used differently in the two sentences. In the first sentence, it means to physically lift or elevate something, while in the second sentence, it implies bringing attention to or discussing a subject or concern."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Herb Jeffries (born Umberto Alexander Valentino; September 24, 1913 - May 25, 2014) was an African-American actor of film and television and popular music and jazz singer-songwriter, known of his baritone voice. He was of African descent and Hollywood's first singing black cowboy. In the 1940s and 1950s Jeffries recorded for a number of labels, including RCA Victor, Exclusive, Coral, Decca, Bethlehem, Columbia, Mercury and Trend. His album Jamaica, recorded by RKO, is a concept album of self-composed calypso songs. Touring the Deep South with Hines, Jeffries was struck by the realities of segregation, as the Orchestra's playing was restricted to tobacco warehouses and black-only movie theatres. Watching young boys fill theatres to watch the latest western, Jeffries resolved to create a cowboy hero geared specifically for such an audience. A self-confessed western buff who had grown up watching the silent escapades of Tom Mix and Jack Holt, in the 1930s Jeffries set out to produce a low-budget western with an all-black cast. Though the silent era had seen a number of films starring only black actors, they had all but disappeared with the economic downturn and the arrival of the talkies, which proved too expensive for many of the \\"white independents\\" funding such projects. Jeffries's ambition was to produce sound cinema's \\"first all-Negro musical western\\". To fund his project, Jeffries approached a veteran B-movie producer named Jed Buell. Jeffries, having obtained finances, wrote his own songs for the film and hired Spencer Williams to appear with him. When Buell wanted to know of a likely candidate for the lead role, Jeffries nominated himself. Having grown up partly on his grandfather's farm, he had all the requisite horse-riding and roping skills, beside a fine singing voice, but Buell expressed concerns; Jeffries, whose mother was of Irish descent, was \\"not black enough\\". Eventually they went ahead, using make-up to darken the leading man's skin tone. Jeffries made his debut as a crooning cowboy with Harlem on the Prairie, which was considered the first black western following the inauguration of the talkies and the first sound Western with an all-black cast. The movie was shot in 1937 over five days at N.B. Murray's Dude Ranch in Apple Valley, California, with Jeffries performing all his own stunts. Though critical reception was mixed, the film received a write-up in Time magazine and grossed 50,000 in its first 12 months. Playing a singing cowboy in low-budget films, Jeffries became known as the \\"Bronze Buckaroo\\" by his fans. In a time of American racial segregation, such \\"race movies\\" played mostly in theaters catering to African-American audiences. The films include Harlem on the Prairie, The Bronze Buckaroo, Harlem Rides the Range and Two-Gun Man from Harlem.  Jeffries went on to star in another three musical westerns over the next two years. Jeffries starred as a singing cowboy, in several all-black Western films, in which he sang his own western compositions. In those films, Jeffries starred as cowboy Bob Blake, sang and performed his own stunts. Bob Blake was the good guy, with a thin mustache, who wore a white Stetson and rode a white horse named Stardusk.  Jeffries went on to make other films, starring in the title film role of Calypso Joe co-starring Angie Dickinson in Calypso Joe (1957). In 1968, Jeffries appeared in the long-running western TV series The Virginian playing a gunslinger who intimidated the town. In the 1970s he appeared on episodes of I Dream of Jeannie and Hawaii Five-0. He later directed and produced Mundo depravados, a cult film starring his wife, Tempest Storm. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: when did his film career begin","output":"Herb Jeffries' film career began in the 1930s when he set out to produce a low-budget western with an all-black cast.

Well, now I think I should have chosen doing exercise over porn . The mood was set, wi-fi speed was good and Google search was working. It took me half an hour to select a porn video. After selecting the video I downloaded it . WTF where are my earphones. Took 15 minutes to locate my earphones. The movie began and just after 5 seconds the door bell rang and this was where I got screwed when I forgot to minimize the movie. My parents were back home and I was back to my studies and just forgot about the movie. Now I have a habit that while I am studying I keep the phone in the next room. My mother was in the same room where the phone was. Now comes the worst part when my phone received a whatsapp message and my mother saw that message was dropped. Without giving any damm to my privacy she opened the phone and it was my bad luck that there was no screen lock. The movie automatically started and after 5 seconds she took the phone to my dad she said “This is what he is doing when he's alone” My parents called me what is this ?? I said it's a video message from the company and it starts automatically. I have nothing to do with that stuff and suddenly my dad said yes he is right, it's a video from the company and asked me to delete the video. My dad saved me because he already knew that I watched that kind of stuff. From that day on, I never download the movies but I watch them online, I just hate the buffering part .

The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context provided, \\"ethos\\" is not a language but rather a concept from Ancient Greek art and philosophy. In this context, ethos refers to the character, disposition, or moral nature of a person or group as depicted in artistic representation. The term \\"ethos\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"ἦθος,\\" which means character or disposition. During the Hellenistic period, art began to focus more on the portrayal of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos), with an emphasis on realistically capturing human nature. This shift in focus led to a new artistic direction where the subjects in artworks were depicted with more realism, emotion, and depth, as opposed to the idealized, calm, and composed figures that dominated the classical Greek art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:You are given a new situation: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect.  and a hint : All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection.  Please answer this question : In which species the behaviors in question would make them more fit, rhino or impala? A:","output":"The behaviors in question would make the impalas more fit. This is because the impalas have acquired behaviors that help them and their young survive in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats. The survival of their offspring and themselves contributes to their fitness, which in turn allows them to pass on their genes to the next generation at a higher rate, making those beneficial behaviors more common in the species.

Sheba is thrown out of her home by her husband and moves into Barbara's house. Sheba is unaware that Barbara is the reason she was found out, believing the affair became known because Steven confessed it to his mother. When Sheba finds Barbara's diary and learns it was Barbara who leaked the story of the affair, she confronts Barbara and strikes her in anger. A row ensues, and Sheba runs outside with Barbara's journal to a crowd of reporters and photographers. When she becomes hemmed in by them, Barbara rescues her.

Movie title: Lonely are the Brave Context: John W. \\"Jack\\" Burns (Kirk Douglas) works as a roaming ranch hand much as the cowboys of the old West did, refusing to join modern society. He rejects much of modern technology, not even carrying any identification such as a driver's license or draft card. He can't provide an address because he just sleeps wherever he finds a place. As Burns crosses a highway into a town in New Mexico, his horse Whiskey has a difficult time crossing the road, confused and scared by the traffic. They enter town to visit Jerry (Gena Rowlands). She is the wife of an old friend, Paul Bondi (Michael Kane), who has been jailed for giving aid to illegal immigrants. Jack explains his dislike for a society that restricts a man on where he can or can't go, what he can or can't do. To break Bondi out of jail, Burns decides he himself needs to get arrested. After a violent barroom fight against a one-armed man (Bill Raisch) in which he is forced to use only one arm himself, Burns is arrested. When the police decide to let him go, he deliberately punches a cop to get himself re-arrested. He is now facing a probable sentence of a year in jail, which allows him to see Bondi, with a purpose of helping him escape. The town is a sleepy border town and the cops are mostly bored, occasionally dealing with minor offenses. The Sheriff, Morey Johnson (Walter Matthau), has to compel them to pay attention to their duties at times. During the course of the story, the seemingly unrelated progress of a tractor-trailer truck carrying toilets, driven by Carroll O'Connor, is inter-cut with the principal events. Joining Bondi in jail, Burns tries to persuade him to escape. He tells Bondi he couldn't spend a year locked up because he'd probably kill someone.

The breakdown of glucose is a biochemical process that occurs in living organisms as a way to generate energy, while radioactive decay is a nuclear process occurring in unstable atomic nuclei. In the breakdown of glucose, living cells convert glucose molecules into energy by a series of chemical reactions. This process, called cellular respiration, generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which serves as an energy source for the cells. On the other hand, radioactive decay occurs when an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation, either in the form of alpha or beta particles. This process is unrelated to glucose metabolism and is governed by the properties of the unstable nuclei themselves, not by the availability of glucose. Therefore, the amount of glucose broken down has no effect on the occurrence of radioactive decay. Whether more, less, or the same amount of glucose is being broken down, the rate of radioactive decay remains independent and is dictated by the decay characteristics of the particular atomic nuclei involved."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Der Idee eines Verhaltenskodexes zur Regelung der Beziehungen zwischen der WTO und den Nichtregierungsorganisationen stimme ich voll und ganz zu. Translate this to English?","output":"I fully agree with the idea of a code of conduct governing the relationship between the WTO and non-governmental organizations. The concept of establishing a code of conduct for regulating the relationships between the World Trade Organization (WTO) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is crucial in promoting cooperation and collaboration in international trade. By implementing a code of conduct, a set of principles and responsibilities can be introduced to guide and facilitate interactions between these organizations effectively. The code of conduct can include provisions that address transparency and openness in decision-making, ensuring that NGOs have access to relevant information and can participate in WTO processes. This would enable them to contribute their expertise and provide valuable input in shaping trade agreements. Moreover, the code of conduct should emphasize the importance of respect and mutual understanding between the WTO and NGOs. This can be achieved by fostering regular communication, sharing of information, and providing opportunities for dialogue. This will enable both parties to work towards common goals, learn from one another's experiences and adapt their approaches accordingly. Additionally, the code should outline guidelines for advocacy and lobbying activities, ensuring that NGOs can engage in meaningful discourse without compromising the integrity of the WTO's processes. This can involve setting rules and limits on how and when NGOs can submit their input during negotiations, as well as how they can solicit support for specific issues. The code of conduct could also cover conflict resolution mechanisms in case disputes arise between the WTO and NGOs. Having a transparent, fair, and impartial process for addressing disagreements can help to maintain trust and promote long-term working relationships. Furthermore, the code should include provisions for capacity building and education. This can involve facilitating training sessions, workshops, and seminars to help NGOs better understand the intricacies of global trade and the workings of the WTO, ultimately empowering them to play a more active role in advocating for policies that benefit a broader range of stakeholders. Lastly, the code should ensure that there is an ongoing process for monitoring and evaluating how well the code of conduct is adhered to by both the WTO and NGOs. This could involve regular reviews and, if necessary, revisions to the code to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. In conclusion, a comprehensive code of conduct can contribute significantly to improving the relationship between the WTO and NGOs by establishing guidelines and expectations for both parties to follow. Through transparent communication and mutual respect, they can collaborate effectively and work towards a more sustainable, equitable, and inclusive global trade system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - rust  - spontaneous combustion  - steel oxide  - iron oxide   A: Answer:","output":"Iron Oxide The sparks from a steel grinder are essentially small bits of molten iron. When these bits of iron come into contact with oxygen in the air, they react to form iron(III) oxide. This substance is also commonly known as rust. However, with respect to the multiple-choice answers provided, the correct option to choose here would be \\"iron oxide\\". Although rust is a form of iron oxide, the term by itself is more academically precise and directly relates to the definition given in the paragraph. Rust is a particular type of iron oxide that results from the specific circumstances of iron being exposed to moist, oxygen-rich conditions over time. On the other hand, the direct, instantaneous reaction of molten iron with oxygen can more accurately be described as forming iron oxide. Choices like \\"spontaneous combustion\\" and \\"steel oxide\\" are incorrect, the former because the reaction is not one of combustion, and the latter because no such chemical compound as steel oxide exists - steel is an alloy and does not form oxides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Owner of Back Alley Waffles claims Groupon's slow payments led to closure of restaurant. Offering tongue-in-cheek 450 waffles to compensate loss of income. Groupon offers three payment installments for merchants. Other businesses hurt by Groupon's model as stock prices continue to falter.","output":"Title: Back Alley Waffles Owner Blames Groupon as Restaurants Close, Offers Costly Compensation Introduction: In recent years, restaurants and businesses have been seeking new strategies to promote their offerings and boost revenues. One of the platforms they've turned to is Groupon – a discount voucher platform for merchants. However, not all businesses have found success through this platform, with some even claiming Groupon's slow payment model has caused more harm than good. Among them is the owner of Back Alley Waffles, who has recently closed down the restaurant and offered an unconventional compensation plan for his loss. Step 1: Discuss the allegations against Groupon The story of Back Alley Waffles' closure has drawn attention, with the owner pointing fingers at Groupon for their slow payments model. Groupon offers a system where merchants receive payments in three installments, which potentially puts pressure on businesses to deliver services and products even before they receive full compensation. For businesses still striving to establish their footing, this arrangement can lead to significant stress on their finances. Step 2: Introduce the tongue-in-cheek 450 waffles idea In a defiant move, the restaurant owner has decided to offer tongue-in-cheek 450 waffles in an attempt to compensate for the loss of income caused by Groupon's slow payments. This unconventional approach is sure to grab public attention and drive home the message that the restaurant owner seeks to convey. Step 3: Mention the impact on other businesses Back Alley Waffles is not alone in feeling the pinch from Groupon's business model. Several other businesses have also reported concerns with the company's practices. While there have been success stories, the overall trend of businesses being hurt by the platform continues to persist, triggering questions on whether this model is sustainable in the long run. Step 4: Discuss Groupon's stock prices faltering Groupon's struggles have not gone unnoticed on the stock market. The company's stock prices have continued to falter, suggesting that investors and stakeholders are losing confidence in its performance. As businesses increasingly voice their concerns and dissatisfaction with Groupon, it is important for the company to reevaluate its practices and strategies in order to regain its momentum in the market. Conclusion: The story of Back Alley Waffles showcases the challenges some businesses face when partnering with platforms like Groupon. With the restaurant owner taking a bold step in offering 450 waffles to compensate for his losses, the situation highlights the need for businesses to carefully evaluate the platforms they engage with and the impact it can have on their finances. Groupon, too, must take a closer look at the concerns raised by these businesses and consider modifications to their model in order to ensure a better experience for both merchants and customers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: When the heart expels more blood with each stroke, the heart has to beat less often in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow.  If someone has a smaller than average physical heart then it will beat more or less in order to pump blood? The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between heart size, stroke volume, and heart rate. We will go step-by-step to analyze the given situation and reach a conclusion. Step 1: Understand the concept of stroke volume Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat. When the heart expels more blood with each stroke, it means that the stroke volume has increased. In such a case, it is mentioned that the heart has to beat less often to maintain the same volume of blood flow. Step 2: Understand the concept of heart rate Heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. A higher heart rate indicates that the heart is beating more frequently, and a lower heart rate indicates that it is beating less often. Step 3: Understand the relationship between heart size and stroke volume Generally, a larger physical heart may have a higher stroke volume because it can hold more blood per contraction. Conversely, a smaller physical heart may have a lower stroke volume due to its reduced capacity to hold blood. Step 4: Analyze the given situation In the given situation, someone has a smaller than average physical heart. Since a smaller heart generally has lower stroke volume, we need to determine the effect it has on the heart rate to maintain the same volume of blood flow.  Step 5: Determine the effect on heart rate As per the question, if the heart expels more blood with each stroke (increased stroke volume), the heart has to beat less often (reduced heart rate) to maintain the same volume of blood flow. In the case of a smaller heart with lower stroke volume, to maintain the same volume of blood flow, the heart has to work in the opposite direction, meaning it has to beat more often (increased heart rate) to compensate for the decreased stroke volume. Conclusion: If someone has a smaller than average physical heart, it will beat more often in order to pump blood and maintain the same volume of blood flow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Sitting at a desk in a classroom all day can be pretty boring. The teachers at Ward Elementary in Winston -Salem,North Carolina ,picked up on that and traded in their students' desks for exercise bikes as a part of their Read and Ride program! The Read and Ride program began five years ago.One classroom has enough bikes for every student in any given class,and throughout the day teachers bring in their students to the room to ride them and read their books. Even regular classrooms have one bike in the back of each room for students who just can't sit still to use to help them burn energy in a good way. Students love being more active! Teachers enjoy seeing students eager to read.Parents appreciate stronger,smarter children.Headmasters value this effective and cost-free program.\\"Riding exercise bikes makes reading fun for many kids who get frustrated when they read.Thus,they have a way to release that frustration while they ride,\\"said Scott Ertl,who started the program.\\"As we can see,everyone wants to promote literacy and lose weight! But many students who are overweight struggle with sports and activities since they don't want to always be the last or lose with others watching on the playground.On exercise bikes,however,students are able to exert themselves at their own level--without anyone noticing when they slow down or take a break.\\" As it turns out,not only are the bikes helping the students burn calories,they're also helping them learn better and stay focused.At the end of the school year the school analyzed testing data and found that students that spent more time reading and riding did more than twice as well on reading tests than their fellow students who spent the least time in the program. Question: According to Scott Ertl,riding exercise bikes  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"call benefit overweight students in both ways\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, according to Scott Ertl, riding exercise bikes can indeed benefit overweight students in both ways. His statement in the article emphasizes that the Read and Ride program not only helps promote literacy and a love for reading among students, but also serves as a medium for physical exertion that can combat issues with weight, particularly for overweight students.  He highlights that these students often face challenges when it comes to traditional sports and activities, due to fear of judgment or embarrassment, asserting that they dislike being the last or losing while others watch on the playground. The exercise bikes, however, offer them the opportunity to exert themselves at their own level without experiencing such pressures. They can slow down, take a break, or push themselves as hard as they want without any fear of others observing their performance. Ertl associates exercise bikes with making reading fun for kids who often get frustrated while reading, thereby implying that physical activity can trigger a positive emotional response. This positive experience, in turn, can possibly alleviate the pressures or frustrations that overweight kids might feel in other areas of their school life, contributing to their overall well-being. In conclusion, yes, according to Scott Ertl's statements, riding exercise bikes can benefit overweight students in two ways: It can improve their reading abilities and literacy, and at the same time, it can aid with weight issues by enabling them to exert physical effort in a comfortable and personal environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: In a game that various analysts considered a potential Super Bowl XLVII preview, the 7-1 Bears faced the also 7-1 Houston Texans on Sunday Night Football, in a game waged in the rain. The first half proved disastrous for Chicago, as Kellen Davis had the ball stripped by former Bear Danieal Manning, and recovered by Texans linebacker Tim Dobbins. Shayne Graham later kicked a 20-yard field goal to give Houston the first points of the game. On Chicago's next possession, Michael Bush fumbled, and the Texans recovered again. The Texans drive wouldn't last long, as Tim Jennings would intercept Matt Schaub. However, the Bears failed to take advantage of the turnover, as Jay Cutler's pass would get intercepted by Manning. A quarter later, Jennings once again intercepted Schaub, which set up a Robbie Gould 51-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, Justin Forsett broke a 25-yard run to the Bears 3-yard line, which set up Arian Foster's 2-yard touchdown catch. Late in the first half, Cutler was hit by Dobbins, giving him a concussion, which sidelined him for the rest of the game, and was replaced by Jason Campbell. With less than two minutes left in the third quarter, Gould hit a 24-yard field goal to draw the Bears within four points, but Graham would make a 42-yarder to increase the deficit to seven with less than five minutes left in the game. Gould had attempted a 48-yard field goal earlier in the fourth quarter, but the ball hit the left upright. The loss snapped Chicago's six-game winning streak, the longest since their seven-game streak in 2006, and dropped Chicago to a 7-2 record, and 0-3 all-time against the Texans.

In a world where information is plentiful and abundant, traders are always trying to make money by finding that hidden advantage. Many are betting that 140 characters is all it takes to beat the market. Some professionals in the world of high finance are relying on Twitter and other social media to try to get the edge on the competition. Markets went into a spin last year when someone hacked the AP's Twitter account and sent bogus tweets about an explosion at the White House, showing just how powerful a sentence can be when millions of dollars are put behind it. Twitter has transformed communication across a host of industries, but many industries remain straightforward in how they use it. Especially in the world of commodities. In Chicago, traders trade futures contracts in every kind of product, from corn to pork belly to orange juice concentrate futures. Essentially, they are making bets on the demand and supply of these items at a later date. Every extra speck of information can make the difference. Some traders expressly follow farmers across the American Midwest and try to get a sense of how much soybean or maize is coming in this year's crop. Others actively engage with the people that make the products they trade, looking for that edge, directly tweeting farmers for information on what weather they are having and what crops they are growing. But others are using Twitter to in more innovative ways to stay ahead of the pack. \\"Our systems can analyze and determine a Tweet in less than a second from the moment a person tweets,\\" says Paul Hawtin, the founder of the investment management firm Cayman Atlantic. \\"Analyzing untapped and unstructured data sets such as Twitter gives us a distinct advantage over other investment managers.\\" Hawtin has been working on a fund based exclusively on using sentiment analysis of Twitter for years, analyzing tweets for relevance and for positive and negative sentiment to base its trades on. His first fund was in July 2010, when the U.S. debt stand-off caused huge turmoil in the financial markets and forced the 25 million fund to close after just a month. Hawtin is launching his second try at such a fund later this year. \\"We're in the process of raising Â£5 million (8.3 million) for the new fund and we've secured Â£1.5 million so far,\\" he says. If his first fund had taken off, Cayman Atlantic's simulated real-time account showed that it would have returned 23.8% last year -- impressive, but not as good as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which returned 26.5% over the same period. For Hawtin, the benefits of going Twitter-only are obvious. \\"Breaking news, information trends and global events hit the Twitter network before anywhere else,\\" he says. Twitter appears to be a special case. They have tried to feed in data from Facebook and Bit.ly, the URL shortener, but to no avail. \\"When people tweet they tend to be talking about real-world events as opposed to Facebook which is more personal and relevant only to friends and family.\\" Others are trying to turn the world of trading into the new Twitter. Yoni Assia founded eToro in 2007 as a social network for investing and sees it as democratizing the space. \\"It's about opening the global market and investing and trading in a transparent way,\\" he says. \\"When you're using Facebook or Twitter, it's about social signals. So not all your friends are ones whose financial investments you really want to copy.\\" His network allows anyone to trade both virtual and real money, connect with one other and compare investment bets -- and copy the trading strategies of others. EToro, which is not yet available in the U.S. because of regulatory hurdles, has 3.5 million registered users, of which most are using virtual money. About 300,000 are trading with their own cash on the site. It's Facebook-meets-fantasy football for wannabe day traders. Assia thinks we're at the start of a change in how we invest, one that will transform trading decisions to ones not just based off reactions to real-world events or mathematical modelling, but one based on the analysis of social media as well. \\"I think in the future you'll have not just fundamental and technical analysis, but social analysis,\\" he says. Hawtin, the founder of the Cayman Islands-based hedge fund, concurs. \\"We're in the middle of a data explosion,\\" he says. \\"Trend-following has been a successful trading strategy for over a century and that forms the core of our investment process. What makes us different from any other trend-following hedge fund is the data we use.\\" With billions to be made, Twitter and social media may end up being one of the democratizing forces in the world of finance.

One helpful tip could be to look for patterns in the reviews – if a particular positive or negative aspect is mentioned in several reviews, it can be assumed to be more reliable. Additionally, while the positive review of the movie generates interest, the role of a viewer's preferences cannot be dismissed. If someone prefers action movies or comedies, for example, this review, highlighting suspense and thriller aspects, might not persuade them to watch this movie. In conclusion, this review would likely increase the chances of purchasing the product, but individual preferences and other reviews should also be considered to make a well-informed decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Child care programs help us work towards the future of our children, and right from the time they are born until they graduate. It is our job to look for the best educational programs. One of the most important things of a good child care program or child day care is the teacher to child ratio  . It means that every student needs a certain amount of attention in order to grow and learn correctly.               It's for this reason that small-sized class in schools are leading to bigger and better opportunities. With smaller classes, each student is given personal attention when it comes to their class work, their personal health and their mental growth. When there are too many children in a class, individuals get lost in the crowd. They always couldn't get enough attention. When it comes to the educational result, they don't learn well because some are afraid to ask questions in front of so many people. Others become lazy for not having been attended by the teacher.               Some schools are overcrowded these days. Most children don't even get their basic educational work done in schools. How is one expected to grow into a successful , healthy adult if the basics are not done? For these and several other reasons, schools with small class sizes are turning out to be very good for children.               Diana Autumn is Director of Anne Sullivan School.

It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - Country pop is a subgenre of country music and pop music that was developed by members of the Country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. By producing country songs that employed many styles and sounds found in pop music, the country music industry was effective in gaining new listeners without alienating its traditional country audience. It is a continuation of similar efforts that began in the late 1950s originally known as Nashville sound and later on Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound which led to some records charting high on mainstream top 40 as well as country \\"Billboard\\" charts.  - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.  - I 'm Leaving It All Up to You is the debut album by Donny & Marie Osmond , released in 1974 . Two singles were released from the album : \`\` I 'm Leavin ' It ( All ) Up to You '' ( US Pop # 4 , Country # 17 ) and \`\` Morning Side of the Mountain '' ( US Pop # 8 ) .  - Donald Clark \\"Donny\\" Osmond (born December 9, 1957) is an American singer, actor, radio personality, and former teen idol. Osmond has also been a talk and game show host, record producer and author. In the mid-1960s, he and four of his elder brothers gained fame as the Osmonds. Osmond went solo in the early 1970s, covering such hits as \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" and \\"Puppy Love\\".  - A doll is a model of a human being, often used as a toy for children. Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.  - Olive Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) is an American singer, actress, doll designer, and a member of the show business family the Osmonds. Although she was never part of her family's singing group, she gained success as a solo country music artist in the 1970s and 1980s. Her best known song is a cover of the country pop ballad \\"Paper Roses\\". From 1976 to 1979, she and her singer brother Donny Osmond hosted the television variety show \\"Donny & Marie\\".  - · \\"Paper Roses\\" is a popular song written and composed by Fred Spielman and Janice Torre.

Marie Osmond later covered it in 1973 and took her version to number one on the US country chart.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink.

A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career  a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats.

Answer the following question. Which Italian had Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert as pupils?","output":"The Italian composer, conductor, and music teacher who had the great fortune of having famed musicians such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, and Franz Schubert as his pupils was Antonio Salieri. Born on August 18, 1750, in Legnago, Italy, Salieri went on to become one of the most influential musicians of his time, leaving a profound impact on the world of classical music. Antonio Salieri moved to Vienna in his early teenage years and studied under the instruction of well-known composer and conductor Christoph Willibald Gluck. Salieri's remarkable talents were evident from an early age, and his name began to spread throughout Europe as he gained recognition for his composition skills and incredible operas. As Kapellmeister (music director) of the Habsburg court, Salieri held one of the most prestigious musical posts in Europe from 1788 to 1824. Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Franz Liszt were highly esteemed composers in their own right who, at various stages, were under Salieri's tutelage. Beethoven, while primarily trained by Joseph Haydn, received specific training in vocal composition from Salieri. It is known that they maintained a cordial relationship, and Beethoven even dedicated one of his violin sonatas to Salieri. Franz Schubert studied with Salieri as a young boy when he was a member of the Imperial Court Chapel choir in Vienna. Salieri took a keen interest in Schubert, teaching him composition techniques and fostering his talent. Schubert, in his letters, expressed gratitude and admiration for Salieri, stating that his guidance was invaluable in his development as a composer. Franz Liszt, a prominent pianist, and composer received lessons from Salieri at a very young age in Vienna. While Liszt's time with Salieri was brief, it helped lay the foundation for his meteoric rise as a virtuoso and later as a composer.  Antonio Salieri's contributions to the world of music go beyond his extraordinary skill as a composer. His passion for teaching and the encouragement he provided to the next generation of musical geniuses is a testament to his impact on the classical music landscape. Salieri's guidance played a critical role in molding the talents of Beethoven, Schubert, and Liszt, each of whom went on to create some of the most iconic and well-regarded musical works in history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this sentence, spaces have been added between the words to make it more readable.

A DSE file is a specific format that might require a dedicated software application to open and interact with its content. Windows has built-in intelligence to associate file types, identified by their extensions, to corresponding software applications installed on the user's computer. This capability allows users to easily open files without having to manually search and select an appropriate program each time they want to access a file with a particular extension. When a user double-clicks a file with a known extension, Windows will automatically launch the default program associated with that file type. This eliminates the need for the user to manually locate and open the software before loading the file. The intelligent association system in Windows is beneficial because it saves users time and effort while enhancing the overall user experience.

How to upgrade the birthday candle tradition  Make or buy a cupcake for the birthday person.  Hold the actual cake aside and put candles on one (or more) cupcakes. Let the celebrant blow away.","output":"The evolution and transformation of the traditional birthday candle ritual can be viewed from several angles; it's not just about changing the cake for a cupcake, but also about constructing a more unique, personalized, and exciting experience for the birthday celebrant. By placing the candles on a cupcake or cupcakes, the birthday person now has a separate special cake just for them, which brings a novel excitement to this time-honored tradition.  First and foremost, one of the main reasons to switch to a cupcake for the birthday candle-blowing tradition is accessibility. Cupcakes are easy to make or buy and come in a variety of flavors, catering to the specific tastes of the birthday person. Ingredients for cupcakes are readily available and they can be baked in a short amount of time. For those not into baking, numerous bakeries and grocery stores sell cupcakes in an assortment of sizes and flavors.  Secondly, the cupcake idea enables the birthday candles to be the centerpiece of the celebration. Instead of being just a part of the large cake, the candles now have their unique and significant platform on the cupcake. This change allows for the birthday candle-blowing tradition to exist independently from the actual birthday cake cutting ceremony. The birthday celebrant gets to make a wish and blow out the candles on their cupcake, which is then followed by the cutting of the birthday cake for everyone to enjoy.  The trend of putting birthday candles on cupcakes provides an interesting embellishment to the decoration process. This can range from employing a simple single cupcake with one candle serving as the \\"birthday cake, \\"or a more extravagant display comprising multiple cupcakes each having a candle. This allows the celebrant to blow out candles in a variety of ways, adding more fun and entertainment to the celebration.  This upgraded tradition also offers a hygiene benefit. When the birthday person blows out the candles on their cupcake, they prevent spreading germs over the communal cake. In the post-pandemic world, as people become more health-conscious, this upgrade provides a practical and sanitary solution to the tradition.  Additionally, having a separate cupcake for the candle blowing makes for a memorable and personalized experience. The birthday person can choose their preferred flavor for the cupcake and make a dedicated wish while blowing out the candles. This also helps in creating wonderful photo opportunities as blowing out candles is always a highlight of any birthday party.  In conclusion, trading the traditional birthday cake for a cupcake or cupcakes to carry the candles not only upholds the spirit of the candle-blowing tradition but also offers a new fun-filled and engaging way to celebrate the birthday. The freedom to customize, convenience, and the hygienic aspect of this practice makes it a great upgrade to the timeless birthday candle ritual. Whether the celebrant is a kid or an adult, putting candles on cupcakes paves the way for a great start to a fantastic year ahead. As the birthday person blows away, their friends and family are ready to join in the festivities for a memorable celebration.  So next time you plan a birthday, consider the cupcake with candles idea. It rejuvenates the traditional birthday candle blowing and revolutionizes the way we celebrate this special day in our lives. With this upgrade, every birthday becomes a unique, customized, and exciting celebration that everyone looks forward to."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: What Are Startups Afraid of? The Answers Say a Lot About Tech Y Combinator, which helped incubate Airbnb Inc. and Instacart Inc., has a reputation for having an application process that’s more exclusive than Harvard University’s. About 6,000 aspiring startups applied to the Silicon Valley business incubator’s summer 2016 class in hopes of being one of the 107 or so to receive a 120,000 investment and access to the group’s well-connected investors and executives. Beneath the techie buzzwords and fanciful projections, the applications provide a unique view into the rapidly changing technology scene from the perspective of up-and-comers. Online marketing and data firm Priceonomics recently analyzed eight years of Y Combinator submissions. The results give a snapshot of industry trends and entrepreneurs’ views of who’s hot and who’s not in tech. Y Combinator asks applicants to list their competitors. Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. dominate the responses, but Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb are gaining quickly. Their names were mentioned more than half as many times as Google’s in 2016, according to the Priceonomics analysis. Uber, a ride-hailing company that’s established itself as a Valley golden child with a valuation of 62.5 billion, was mentioned in 2.6 percent of applications this year. Slack Technologies Inc., a messaging app for businesses, has seen a significant uptick in mentions. Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack. Willett Advisors, the investment arm for the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg LP, invests in Y Combinator startups. Facebook’s Instagram is a perennial threat on startups’ radar. But WhatsApp, which Facebook spent far more to acquire in a 22 billion deal, has plateaued in the eyes of Y Combinator hopefuls. Snapchat Inc., another messaging app Facebook has targeted, was on a similar trajectory in the last year. For Dropbox Inc., the hype cycle has been winding down for the last few years. After leading a list of five highly valued private companies in 2012, Dropbox’s presence in Y Combinator submissions has been on a steady decline since 2013, according to the Priceonomics study. Dropbox’s drop coincides with concerns expressed by the company’s own investors, several of which have repeatedly written down the value of their stakes. However, Dropbox, which makes money by charging users for more cloud storage space, is well-positioned for another trend: the rise of subscription-based software businesses. Y Combinator applicants have increased references to so-called software-as-a-service revenue models by 400 percent since 2008. Meanwhile, advertising is falling out of vogue. The shift highlights a rush toward sustainable, more predictable businesses as venture capitalists begin to prioritize revenue over user growth. Startups are staying private longer -- no tech company went public last quarter -- leaving VCs concerned they’ll have to invest more over longer periods of time to keep startups afloat.

Question: Background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  Paragraph: Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening. Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gardener had plants with more underground rot? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, Joe, who used the no-till gardening method, is more likely to have plants with more underground rot. This is because no-till farming has been associated with disadvantages such as underground rot, low soil temperatures, and high moisture, which can lead to an increased risk of underground rot compared to conventional tillage methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: NASA's James Webb Space Telescope Survives Funding Battle When last we heard about the James Webb Space Telescope, the souped-up, long-planned successor to the Hubble, the news was not good. Hard on the heels of a report blasting the Webb project for being badly behind schedule and over budget, a House committee voted to axe the partially completed telescope entirely. Even a space nut could appreciate where they were coming from: originally envisioned in the 1990s as a monster scope 26 ft. (8 m) across, with more than 17 times the light-gathering power of the Hubble, the Webb was going to cost no more than 500 million and launch by 2007  cross NASA's heart and hope to die! No one really bought that, but no one really expected the budget to swell to 2.6 billion and then to 6.2 billion, or the launch date to slip to 2015 and then 2018 either. When all that did happen, D.C. bean counters concluded that nothing would become the Webb project quite as much as the end of it. (See photos of West Virginia's Green Bank Radio Telescope.) Fortunately for science, though, the rumors of the project's death were greatly exaggerated. Congress ended up funding the Webb after all, and in a telephone call the other day, Scott Willoughby, the Webb program manager at Northrop Grumman (the contractor that's building the telescope for NASA), reported that the slow, meticulous process of building the most powerful stargazing instrument in history is moving steadily ahead. \\"In terms of the things we said we'd accomplish by now,\\" he says, \\"we're on track, and in some areas, we're actually ahead of schedule.\\" The most significant of these milestones, says Willoughby: \\"We've completed  and that's a big word  all 18 segments of the primary mirror, which have been in production for seven or eight years now.\\" Unlike the Hubble's big light-gathering mirror, the Webb's can't be made in one piece. That's because no rocket exists that can hold something so wide. Instead, the mirrors, made of beryllium metal with a microscopically thin coating of gold, will unfurl in space like flower petals to reach their full size. Back in December, the gold was applied, and the mirrors were being readied for testing in a cryogenic test chamber at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. That test is a critical one since engineers need to know the material can survive the frigid conditions in deep space. (See TIME's graphics \\"The World's Largest Radio Telescope.\\") For the Webb, cold isn't just an obstacle: it's a necessity if the telescope is going to work. Astronomers have learned that many of the biggest unanswered questions of their field  How and when did the very first stars appear? How were the galaxies assembled from those stars? How do planets form? Does the chemistry of distant planets' atmospheres suggest the existence of life?  are best answered by looking in infrared, not visible light. To detect the faint glow of infrared, a telescope works best if it's as cold as possible, so that heat from the telescope itself doesn't contaminate the signal. In space, that's no problem. It isn't, anyway, if the telescope can be shielded from the heat of the sun  and even from the faint heat given off by the earth. To accomplish that, the Webb will sit atop a sunshield, about the size of a tennis court. The shield, which always stays between the Webb on one side and the sun, moon and earth on the other, is made of five layers, separated by a bit of empty space for extra cooling. (See \\"Giant Eye Will Peer at the Sky.\\") Given that it's even bigger than the telescope itself, the sunshade will have to unfold in space as well. So the entire assembly  telescope, mirrors, sunshade and scientific instruments  will be unfolded on the ground for testing, and that will happen more than once. \\"We'll deploy each component several times as we assemble,\\" says Willoughby, \\"and then the entire observatory will be stowed and deployed.\\" It will also be shaken to simulate the rigors of launch, in a chamber originally built to test the Apollo spacecraft. \\"Deploy, shake, deploy,\\" says Willoughby. \\"This is space. It has to work the first time.\\" That's all the more true because while the Hubble zips along just 300 miles (483 km) above the earth's surface, the Webb will sit closer to a million miles (1.6 million km) away, at a spot known as Lagrange Point 2, or L2. From that stable spot, where the gravity of the earth, moon and sun effectively cancel one another out, the three bodies also remain in the same direction relative to the telescope all the time, making the sunshield's cooling job easier. Simplicity and reliability are essential, because unlike the Hubble, the Webb will hardly be within reach of any astronaut repair crews. Assuming the next six years go smoothly, the Webb telescope will undoubtedly revolutionize astronomy when it goes up in 2018. It is, however, a mixed blessing: the mission's voracious appetite for money has sucked funding from other space-science projects, and NASA is expected to announce more cuts as early as this week. Once those spectacular images start rolling in, though, it will be hard to argue that the James Webb Space Telescope was ever worth canceling. See photos of the Hubble Space Telescope through its history. See TIME's video \\"Herschel: The Telescope for Invisible Stars.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. The James Webb Space Telescope, originally facing budget cuts and cancellation, has ultimately survived funding battles and is moving forward with its construction. 2. The telescope's 18-segment primary mirror has been completed, a significant milestone. 3. The Webb telescope is designed to answer major questions in astronomy by observing the universe in infrared, as opposed to visible light. 4. To function correctly, the telescope needs to be kept very cold and shielded from the sun using a sunshield the size of a tennis court. 5. The telescope will be positioned at Lagrange Point 2 (L2), almost a million miles from Earth, to maintain a consistent orientation relative to the Earth, moon, and sun. 6. The planned launch date for the telescope is 2018, and once operational, it's expected to revolutionize astronomy; however, its budget might affect funding for other space-science projects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

A police force making cuts of £50million is using unqualified detectives to investigate serious crimes because of a 'critical' shortage of staff. A whistleblower said officers had been moved into the Criminal Investigation Department in Brighton, West Sussex - which deals with murders and rapes - without taking compulsory detective exams. Sussex Police has now admitted officers had to be moved into Brighton CID 'temporarily' to keep up the numbers, prompting a warning from the county's Police Commissioner. Shortage: Police in Brighton (pictured) admitted they were facing what they called 'challenging times' The whistleblower reported his concerns to local newspaper the Brighton Argus. He added: 'Officers are having to be drafted in from other departments with almost no notice and with many of these officers not even having passed the detectives exam - a national requirement - and with little or no additional training to prepare them for dealing with the serious crimes investigated by","output":"CID. This clearly compromises the quality and effectiveness of the investigations being conducted.' In response to the whistleblower's claims, Sussex Police acknowledged that the force has been facing financial challenges and personnel shortages, which have led to the necessity of reallocating officers from other departments to Brighton CID. The force stated that these moves were intended to be temporary measures, but it was vital to maintain an adequate workforce to investigate serious crimes, such as murder and rape, in the area. The Police Commissioner for Sussex expressed concern over the situation, stating that proper training and qualifications for detectives should not be compromised, as it is essential for the thorough and efficient investigation of serious crimes. He urged the force to take immediate steps to address the staffing shortages and ensure that all officers within CID have the appropriate training and qualifications. Furthermore, the Police Commissioner called for a review of the current budget and resource allocation, to determine whether additional funding could be made available to help address the ongoing issues facing the force. He emphasized the importance of maintaining public confidence in the police and their ability to carry out their duties effectively, especially when handling sensitive and high-profile cases. The Brighton Argus, having received the whistleblower's report, has since published an exposé on the issue, raising awareness among the local community about the challenges their police force is experiencing. In response, some residents have expressed their concern and urged local authorities to take immediate action in addressing the crisis. As the debate around the budget cuts and staffing shortages continues, it is clear that the situation within Sussex Police is not an isolated problem. Police forces throughout the UK are grappling with similar issues, and many are calling for a reassessment of the resources and funding allocated to law enforcement agencies to ensure they can effectively protect their communities and prevent crime."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Goals in either half from Tony Andreu - a sensational volley - and Thomas Mikkelsen eclipsed Rory Loy's strike. The Buddies had created the better first-half chances and also had spells of dominance in the second period. It was the Tannadice club's first victory in the tournament, which features clubs from the Championship, League One and League Two. And this year's competition also included Premiership colt teams and sides from Northern Ireland and Wales. Chance after chance fell St Mirren's way in the Lanarkshire sunshine on a pristine pitch in front of 8,089 spectators. Loy hit the post, Lewis Morgan produced a wonderful breakaway from the United centre-halves, drew Cammy Bell and then shot across goal and Gary MacKenzie sent a header past the post when he was totally unmarked. United had hardly threatened Billy O'Brien until Andreu produced a diamond of a goal which flew past the Paisley goalkeeper, a first-time curling volley with the outside of his boot. It was a goal worthy of winning a cup, but it actually only gave United the lead for seconds. From the restart, Jack Ross' side went up the park and Gary Irvine cut back for Loy to equalise. Tangerines manager Ray McKinnon's fury at his team's inability to stay switched on was clear, but there was no doubt that St Mirren, still anchored at the bottom of the Championship, had been the better team. Nick van der Velden was replaced with less than an hour gone by Mikkelsen and his introduction would change the game. Simon Murray whipped in a cross from the left and the substitute met it with a powerful header beyond O'Brien. It was against the run of play, but goals win cups and Mikkelsen's effort had the scent of glory all over it. The quality of the game was never the same in the second half, but that seemed to suit McKinnon and his team simply saw out the last minutes, nursing their lead over the finishing line. They will now hope to follow their cup triumph with promotion to the Premiership, with the Tangerines currently in the play-off positions. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon told BBC Alba: \\"I'm absolutely delighted. It was a tough game and a lot of pressure on us, but I thought the guys delivered. \\"There has been a bit of criticism our way, probably self-inflicted. \\"We have got ourselves caught in battles and the message today was to get the ball down and play - and I think they did that. \\"A lot of credit must go to St Mirren - they made it very difficult for us. \\"But we have won a cup, we have had the experience of dealing with the final and the pressure that goes with it. \\"So that will be good for me and the players for the rest of the season. They should take a lot of confidence from this.\\" St Mirren manager Jack Ross told BBC Alba: \\"It was a very evenly contested, competitive match and I thought we had the better opportunities. \\"But congratulations to Dundee United, it is about taking your chances on the day. \\"I can't fault my players - the effort was terrific. We continued to play in the manner we have done and the level of performance was very much at what it has been. \\"Despite our league position, this is a good group and we will use this to continue to move forward. \\"We have a real focus about us and they know their performance level deserved more.\\" Summary:","output":"Dundee United claimed their first victory in the Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating St Mirren 2-1, with goals from Tony Andreu and Thomas Mikkelsen overshadowing Rory Loy's efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Paint at the hardware store was purchased by Nelson from Randy because  Choose your answer from: [I] Nelson is a salesman.; [II] Randy is a salesman.;","output":"Randy is a salesman. [II] The sentence ends with \\"Randy is a salesman\\" because, in the given context, it is suggested that Nelson and Randy are engaged in a negotiation, whereas Randy is in the position of selling paint to Nelson. Here's a detailed analysis of the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved: Firstly, the sentence gives us certain essential information about the situation: Nelson has purchased paint at a hardware store, and Randy is the other person involved in that transaction. Based on this information, let's examine each answer option: Option I - Nelson is a salesman: This option does not fit logically with the given information available in the sentence, as it states that Nelson is a salesman. However, according to the sentence, Nelson is the one who purchased the paint, and it is highly unlikely that a salesman would be buying products from his own shop. Furthermore, this option does not reveal anything about Randy's role in the scenario, and the sentence maintains some ambiguity about his involvement. Option II - Randy is a salesman: This option aligns with the context provided in the sentence. Here, Nelson has purchased paint from a hardware store, and Randy is the one who has just sold it to him. With this option, the sentence makes sense, as it conveys that Nelson approached the hardware store to buy paint, and Randy, being a salesman at the store, assisted him during the transaction by offering the product he needed. Additionally, this option clarifies the nature of Randy's role in the situation, eliminating any ambiguity or confusion. To sum it up, the sentence should end with \\"Randy is a salesman\\" as it is a more coherent and logical conclusion based on the given context. The complete sentence would be: \\"Paint at the hardware store was purchased by Nelson from Randy because Randy is a salesman.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fax (short for facsimile), sometimes called telecopying or telefax (the latter short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black.  Scottish inventor Alexander Bain worked on chemical mechanical fax type devices and in 1846 was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments. He received British patent 9745 on May 27, 1843 for his \\"Electric Printing Telegraph.\\" Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine.

I read this background article the other day: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  I am facing a new situation today: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.

Question: Who wanted to kill Jerry? Movie title: The Mexican Movie plot: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy. Another hitman follows them to Las Vegas and kills Frank to make it look like a suicide. Leroy kills him in an act of vengeance, and flees with Samantha. Jerry...

This analysis will consider the military aspects, geopolitical factors, and historical context of the question in order to reach a justified conclusion.  Step 1: Assessing Canada's military capabilities First, it's important to note that Canada has the 14th strongest military in the world, according to Global Firepower, with significant resources including highly trained personnel, advanced technology, and access to NATO allies. Step 2: Identifying historical context and precedence Canada has participated in various wars and conflicts in the past, such as the World Wars, the Korean War, and various peacekeeping missions under the United Nations. Throughout its military history, Canada has demonstrated its capability to successfully engage in warfare, usually as a part of coalition forces. Step 3: Considering geopolitical factors  Engaging in warfare requires significant consideration of the potential political and diplomatic consequences. Alliances and international relations play a major role in determining which countries Canada could engage in a conflict with. For example, as a member of NATO, Canada is unlikely to engage any NATO nation in a war and would more likely cooperate with these countries as allies instead. Step 4: Analyzing potential opponents It is challenging to provide an exhaustive list of countries that Canada could defeat in a war, as this depends on the specific circumstances and conditions of the conflict. However, it would be reasonable to say that Canada has a higher military capability compared to many smaller nations, which suggests that, in a hypothetical conflict, Canada could likely emerge victorious against countries with considerably smaller and less advanced militaries. To answer your second question, the countries Canada has defeated in war are primarily Germany during both World War I and II, as well as Italy and the other Axis powers during World War II. However, it's important to note that Canada's victories were achieved as part of a larger coalition of nations, and not through unilateral military action. Regarding your final question, the two questions are not exactly the same. The first question asks for a hypothetical scenario about which countries Canada can potentially defeat in a war based on their military capabilities. The second question asks about actual historical events where Canada played a role in defeating specific countries in past conflicts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Q: Passage: As heirs of the Dominican priory of Poissy in France, the Dartford sisters were also heirs to a tradition of profound learning and piety. Sections of translations of spiritual writings in Dartford's library, such as Suso's Little Book of Eternal Wisdom and Laurent du Bois' Somme le Roi, show that the \\"ghoostli\\" link to Europe was not lost in the crossing of the Channel. It survived in the minds of the nuns. Also, the nuns shared a unique identity with Poissy as a religious house founded by a royal house. The English nuns were proud of this heritage, and aware that many of them shared in England's great history as members of the noble class, as seen in the next chapter. A:","output":"Part #1: Creating questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: \\"How many total pages were in the Dartford's library collection of spiritual writings during the 15th century?\\" This question meets the criteria because it asks for a specific number of pages in the library collection, a constraint that is not mentioned anywhere in the passage. Part #2: Creating questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: \\"What was the daily routine of the nuns at the Dominican priory of Poissy?\\" This question requires information that is not provided in the passage, as there is no mention of the nuns' daily routines. Part #3: Replacing an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date, and using it in the question. Usage: \\"Did the Dartford sisters inherit a tradition of profound learning and piety from the Dominican priory of Rome, Italy?\\" This question meets the criteria because it replaces the original location (Poissy in France) with another location (Rome, Italy), making it unanswerable based on the passage. Part #4: Creating a question which is answerable from the passage and then replacing one or two words by their antonyms or inserting/removing negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: \\"Were the English nuns uninterested in their unique identity with Poissy as a religious house founded by a royal house?\\" This question meets the criteria because it inserts a negation word \\"uninterested,\\" making it unanswerable based on the passage, which states that the nuns were proud of their heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process:  - When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock - When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks -   suppose it is warmer so there is less ice formed happens, how will it affect there is more ice.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Justification: In the given scenario, it is mentioned that the temperature is warmer, which would lead to less ice being formed. The process of water freezing and expanding, exerting pressure on the walls of the rocks, is one of the main steps in the process. Since the warmer temperature would result in less ice being formed, it indirectly impacts this particular step of the process. Other steps, such as clay expanding when wet or the growth of plants like mosses and lichens, are not directly affected by the temperature change.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Stuart Lancaster, 46, left his position as head coach on Wednesday after England became the first sole hosts to exit a World Cup at the pool stages. \\"We won in 2003, 2007 was not great, 2011 got poorer and, as for 2015, we have come off the precipice,\\" Thomas told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"To be a successful national team coach you've got to have an X factor. \\" England's World Cup exit saw them become the worst-performing host nation in tournament history. In his Daily Mail column, England's 2003 World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward wrote that Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie should also be held accountable. Media playback is not supported on this device But Ritchie, who says he accepts responsibility for the World Cup disappointment, believes he is still the right man to lead the search for a replacement of \\"proven international experience\\". \\"I'm the chief executive, I run the organisation, of course I feel personally about what's gone on,\\" said Ritchie. \\"It's equally important that I continue to deliver for the organisation and move it forward.\\" Lancaster's departure followed a review into England's performance, which involved an RFU panel taking \\"extensive feedback\\" from some members of the squad and all 12 directors of rugby at Premiership clubs.

It is our job to look for the best educational programs. One of the most important things of a good child care program or child day care is the teacher to child ratio  . It means that every student needs a certain amount of attention in order to grow and learn correctly.               It's for this reason that small-sized class in schools are leading to bigger and better opportunities. With smaller classes, each student is given personal attention when it comes to their class work, their personal health and their mental growth. When there are too many children in a class, individuals get lost in the crowd. They always couldn't get enough attention. When it comes to the educational result, they don't learn well because some are afraid to ask questions in front of so many people. Others become lazy for not having been attended by the teacher.               Some schools are overcrowded these days. Most children don't even get their basic educational work done in schools.

A:","output":"When approaching this question, let's consider the relationship between wind and waves: Step 1: Understand the relationship between wind and waves Wind generates waves by transferring energy from the air to the water. As wind blows across the surface of the water, it creates friction which results in waves. Step 2: Consider the strength of the wind The stronger the winds are blowing, the more energy they transfer to the water, causing larger waves. Step 3: Analyze the situation on a windy day On a windy day, the strength of the wind is higher, which means more energy will be transferred to the water. Step 4: Determine the size of waves on a windy day As more energy is transferred to the water on a windy day, we can conclude that we would expect larger waves on a windy day, as opposed to smaller waves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You know that friction also causes heat. Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.  Do you have any questions?","output":"I understand the concept of friction and its effects. Taking that into account, I can think of several other places where friction is found or can be useful: 1. Car brakes: The friction between the brake pads and the rotor slows down and stops the car. 2.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Astronauts Taylor (Charlton Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner), Dodge (Jeff Burton) and Stewart are in deep hibernation when their spaceship crashes in a lake on an unknown planet after a long near-light speed voyage, during which, due to time dilation, the crew ages only 18 months. As the ship sinks, Taylor finds Stewart dead and her body desiccated. They throw an inflatable raft from the ship and climb down into it; before departing the ship, Taylor notes that the date is November 25, 3978, approximately two millennia after their departure in 1972. Once ashore, Dodge performs a soil test and pronounces the soil incapable of sustaining life. After abandoning their raft, the astronauts set off through a desolate wasteland in hopes of finding food and water before their provisions run out. Eventually, they encounter plant life. They find an oasis at the edge of the desert and go swimming, ignoring eerie scarecrow-like figures around the edge of the water. While they are swimming, their clothes are stolen. Pursuing the thieves, the astronauts find their clothes torn to shreds, their supplies pillaged and the perpetrators â a group of humans that are apparently so primitive that they cannot even talk and dressed in torn clothes â raiding a cornfield. Taylor is attracted to one of the humans, whom he later names Nova (Linda Harrison). Suddenly, armed and uniformed gorillas on horseback charge through the cornfield, brandishing firearms, snares, and nets. They capture some humans and kill the rest. In the chaos, Dodge is shot in the back and killed, Landon is wounded and rendered unconscious, and Taylor is shot in the throat and taken prisoner. The gorillas take Taylor to Ape City, where his life is saved after a blood transfusion administered by two chimpanzees, an animal psychologist Zira (Kim Hunter) and surgeon Galen (Wright King). While his throat wound is healing, he is unable to speak. Taylor discovers that the various apes, who can talk and are in control, are in a strict caste system: gorillas are police...

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: No matter what vehicle you’re using, it’s important to keep 2 hands on the wheel at all times. To give yourself maximum control, imagine that your steering wheel is a clock and keep your hands at the 9-o’clock and 3-o’clock positions. This is particularly important for vans because, if you don’t keep a firm grasp on the wheel, you could lose control of the vehicle and cause a rollover. Vans are heavier and bulkier than normal cars, meaning they take longer to brake. To account for this, leave more space than normal between yourself and other cars. As a general rule, leave at least 4 seconds of distance between you and the car in front of you. To calculate how far behind a car you are, wait until the car passes a clear object or road marker. As soon as it does, count how many seconds it takes until you pass that same object. Depending on the area and the exact size of the vehicle, your van may be subject to special speed restrictions different from the posted speed limit. In most cases, this will be 10 miles (16 km) per hour lower than the max for standard cars. To see if an area you’re traveling in enforces van-specific speed limits, contact the local Department of Motor Vehicles or search online for local driving regulations. Vans are tall and narrow, which means they’re more prone to tipping over. Though not usually a problem on straight paths, this can make turning more precarious. To minimize the risk of tipping, slow down to around 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) per hour before making sharp turns. To avoid colliding with curbs, road signs, and other vehicles, make sure your van is positioned in the left or right-most lane, depending on which direction you need to turn. Make sure other vehicles are far enough away from the van that you won’t side sweep them when turning. Then, make your turn, waiting until you are far enough into the intersection that your vehicle’s back end won’t hit other cars. Before changing lanes or backing up, put on your blinkers to indicate your intentions. Then, check all your mirrors for other cars and pedestrians. If your cargo van has a clear back window, turn your head and look through it to make sure there are no cars in your blind spot. If necessary, get out of your van to check the surroundings before backing up. Though vans are not as large as semi trucks, they are significantly taller than normal cars, meaning they may not be able to go under bridges and ledges other vehicles can. Before going under a low ledge, check the clearance sign on top to see if your van is short enough to fit underneath. Do not go under ledges that are lower than your vehicle. Most major bridges are tall enough to accomodate semi trucks, so look out primarily for old, small-town bridges and clearance poles at places like gas stations and fast food restaurants.","output":"Maintain control of your vehicle by keeping both hands on the steering wheel at 9 and 3 o'clock positions. Give additional space, at least 4 seconds, between your van and other cars due to their longer braking time. Be aware of area-specific van speed limits, which could be 10 mph lower than standard cars. Slow down for sharp turns and maintain proper lane position to prevent tipping or collisions. Alert others with blinkers, check mirrors, and for cargo vans, check blind spots through the back window or physically assess surrounding areas before changing lanes or reversing. Be cautious of low bridges or ledges, checking clearance signs to ensure your van will fit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content.  Question: suppose using less coal happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If less coal is used in human industry, then the primary change to the process described will be a reduction in the production of chemical compounds. This is because burning coal releases sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, which contribute to the formation of acid rain. Step by step analysis and justification: 1. Less coal use: By using less coal, we reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) that are direct causes of acid rain. 2. Reduction in chemical compounds: As the production of harmful chemical compounds decreases, the amount of these compounds released into the atmosphere is also reduced. 3. Lower concentration in clouds: With fewer chemical compounds released into the air, they will not mix with elements in clouds to the same extent, reducing the formation of acid rain. 4. Less affected rain: Since the interaction between these chemical compounds and elements in clouds has decreased, the rain that falls to the earth will contain less acidic content. 5. Less damage to natural and man-made objects: As the acidic content of the rain decreases, the harm it causes to natural and man-made objects will also be reduced. In conclusion, using less coal will have a positive effect on reducing the damage caused by acid rain.

Led by quarterback Terry Hanratty, running back Nick Eddy, star receiver Jim Seymour, and fullback Larry Conjar, the offense was best in the nation in scoring, with an average of 36.2 points per game. The defense was second in the country in points allowed, thanks to strong performances by linebacker Jim Lynch and defensive end Alan Page.  The season began with eight straight victories, propelling Notre Dame to the top of the national polls. The team then faced Michigan State (who had Bubba Smith), which ranked second in the polls and was also undefeated. The contest, one among a number referred to as the \\"game of the century\\", ended in a 10-10 tie. Parseghian was criticized for winding down the clock instead of trying to score despite having the ball in the final seconds of the game. He defended his strategy by maintaining that several key starters had been knocked out of action early in the game and that he did not want to spoil a courageous comeback from a 10-0 deficit by risking a turnover deep in his own territory late in the game. When Parseghian's team trounced USC 51-0 the following week, critics alleged that he ran up the score to impress poll voters who had split the number-one ranking between Notre Dame and Michigan State following the tie. Subsequent to the USC rout, the final wire service polls gave Parseghian's team the national championship, although Notre Dame did not participate in a post-season bowl game. Nine members of the team were selected as All-Americans, and Parseghian was named coach of the year by Sporting News.  Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did not repeat as national champion in the late 1960s. In 1969, the team finished with an 8-2-1 record and accepted an invitation to play in the postseason Cotton Bowl. With this game, the school ended a long-standing policy of not playing in bowl games. The university urgently needed money to fund minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from bowl games for this purpose. Parseghian's team lost the game, 21-17, to the eventual national champion Texas Longhorns. When did Parseghian win his first national title?","output":"Ara Parseghian won his first national title in 1966. This is indicated in the very first paragraph which states, \\"Ara Raoul Parseghian was an American football player and coach who guided the University of Notre Dame to national championships in 1966 and 1973.\\" As such, the year 1966 refers to Parseghian's first national championship victory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - bus depot - state park - bus stop - train station - school  The rationale to choose \\"bus depot\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Each of the choices - bus depot, state park, bus stop, train station, and school - are places where it's common to find benches. However, the likelihood and number of benches varies from location to location, depending on their function and the number of people they serve.  1. Bus Depot: A bus depot is a designated place where city or intercity buses are parked and maintained or left overnight. Although you might find benches in bus depots' waiting areas, these are usually intended more for employees and not for a vast public, depending on the specific layout and design of the depot. Therefore, the quantity may not be as high as other public areas. 2. State Park: State parks are large areas of land protected by the government because of their natural beauty. These parks are often equipped with benches for visitors to rest and enjoy the scenery. The number of benches can vary significantly from one park to another, depending on the park's size and the number of visitors it can handle. 3. Bus Stop: Bus stops are important establishments in urban and suburban settings. They would typically have a bench or two for passengers to use while waiting for their bus. However, given that bus stops are generally small and caters to a limited number of people at a time, they are unlikely to have \\"many\\" benches. 4. Train Station: Train stations are key locations where passenger trains load or unload passengers. They're typically much larger than bus stops and often include waiting areas with many benches. The number could be very high, especially in major train stations serving a large city or region. 5. School: Schools, especially larger ones like high schools and universities, have numerous benches. These can be found in the cafeteria, library, classrooms, outdoor spaces, recreation areas, and more. Given the large number of students these institutions serve, they are likely to have a significant number of benches. Taking into account the size of the location, its function, and the volume of people it needs to cater to, a train station likely has a higher number of benches. However, schools might also compete closely, especially if you consider a large campus with multiple buildings and outdoor spaces. In conclusion, while each location often has benches, the numerical predominance of benches could be more found in train stations and schools, depending generally on their size and the volume of people that they serve. The actual specifics would, however, depend on each individual location’s layout, design, and infrastructure. It's wise to note that the specific number of benches may point to the ease of getting a spot to sit, rest or wait, but it would depend on the volume of users in those public spaces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - A judge presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate.  - A running mate is a person running together with another person on a joint ticket during an election. The term is most often used in reference to the person in the subordinate position (such as the vice presidential candidate running with a presidential candidate) but can also properly be used when referring to \\"both\\" candidates, such as by saying Barack Obama and Joe Biden were running mates in 2008 and 2012.  - Carlos Gustave Spaht , I ( August 2 , 1906 - April 29 , 2001 ) , was a Louisiana judge best remembered for having lost the Democratic gubernatorial runoff election in January 1952 to fellow Judge Robert F. Kennon of Minden , the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana . Spaht 's unsuccessful running mate for lieutenant governor was future Governor John J. McKeithen of Columbia , the seat of Caldwell Parish in north Louisiana . McKeithen lost to then State Senator C.E. \`\` Cap '' Barham of Ruston , the seat of Lincoln Parish , also in north Louisiana . At the time , McKeithen was an outgoing member of the Louisiana House of Representatives . Spaht was affiliated for years with the Baton Rouge law firm Kantrow , Spaht , Weaver & Blitzer .  - Joseph Robinette \\"Joe\\" Biden Jr. (born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who was the 47th Vice President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, having been jointly elected twice with President Barack Obama.

It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe , and in August 2007 in Australia . Players use a guitar - shaped controller ( purchased separately ) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player . Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series , rather than a full sequel . No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game . As implied by the game 's title , the game features a 1980s theme , consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters , fashions , and artwork that reflect the time period . The game was not as well - received as the prior two Guitar Hero games , due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack . Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band . The next major installment of the series , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , was developed by Activision 's Neversoft division .  - A game controller is a device used with games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. A controller is usually connected to a game console or computer by means of a wire or cord, although, since the mid-2000s, wireless controllers have become widespread. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers.  - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.   - Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.    What entity does 'guitar hero encore: rocks the 80s' has the relation 'instance of' with?

Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores (Collins), a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the ObregÃ³n brothers. Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the ObregÃ³n cartel, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the ObregÃ³n brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the JuÃ¡rez Cartel, the rival of the ObregÃ³n brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit. Javier's partner Sanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the DEA but is killed for his betrayal. Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to make a deal with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the kids can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime.

Available choices: [I] unacceptable. [II] acceptable.","output":"I would consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"The boy whose guardian's we elected employer president betrayed us\\" as [I] unacceptable. Here's a detailed explanation as to why the sentence does not adhere to proper linguistic standards. 1. Ambiguity: The sentence is quite ambiguous and fails to convey the intended message clearly. There are multiple interpretations that could potentially be derived from the sentence, making it difficult for the reader to understand the main point that the writer is trying to make. 2. Word Order: The word order in the sentence is quite unusual, not following conventional English grammar rules. For example, the placement of \\"we elected\\" before \\"employer president\\" creates confusion, with the reader struggling to piece together the meaning and relationship between the two phrases. 3. Syntax: The syntax in the sentence is problematic as well. The use of the possessive form \\"guardian's\\" before \\"we elected\\" implies a relationship between the two phrases, but the sentence structure creates confusion concerning the exact nature of this relationship. More specifically, the reader is left wondering as to whom the guardian's employer is and how this person relates to the betrayal. 4. Clarity: The absence of punctuation marks or additional words to pause and connect different elements of the sentence leads to difficulties in discerning the intended meaning. The sentence reads like a long, uninterrupted chain of words, making it difficult to fully understand the writer's thoughts and ideas. To rephrase the sentence and improve its linguistic integrity, it might be better to rewrite it as follows: \\"We elected the employer of the boy's guardian as president, but he betrayed us.\\" Here, the message is clearer, and the reader can grasp the relationships amongst the different elements more easily. The clarity and coherence of the sentence are improved, and it adheres to proper linguistic conventions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He buys an estate near Dr. Seward's insane asylum and befriends the doctor as part of his plan to infiltrate high society. Through Dr. Seward, Count Dracula is introduced to Lucy Westenra, Dr. Seward's fiancée, who catches his eye and becomes the object of his dark desires.  As Dracula starts frequenting Dr. Seward's social circle, he becomes fascinated by the world of the opera. Dr. Seward, his family, Lucy, and Mina Harker acquire tickets to attend a highly anticipated opera performance. Unbeknownst to them, Dracula also secures a seat in their box. The grand night finally arrives, and the atmosphere is filled with excitement, glamour, and elegance. During the opera performance, Dracula subtly starts seducing Lucy with his charm and supernatural powers. Unnoticed by others, he makes Lucy feel a strong attraction towards him, making her doubt her love for Dr. Seward. As the opera continues into the night, Lucy begins to experience strange sensations and begins to feel torn between her loyalty to Dr. Seward and the mysterious allure of Count Dracula. Meanwhile, Mina Harker becomes suspicious of Dracula's intentions and starts to investigate him. Her research leads her to rumors about the existence of vampires and Dracula's true identity. Feeling alarmed, she confides her findings with Abraham Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter, who turns out to be Dr. Seward's former mentor. Together, they join forces to thwart Dracula's plans and save Lucy from his clutches. The dramatic climax of the story occurs when Dracula, in all his sinister glory, finally reveals his true nature to Lucy during the final act of the opera. As chaos erupts in the opera hall, Dr. Seward, Mina, and Van Helsing race to save Lucy from Dracula's evil grasp. A high-stakes battle ensues between the noble vampire hunter and the ancient horror in the shadows of the opera house. In the end, Dracula is defeated by Van Helsing's cunning and knowledge of vampire lore, forcing him to retreat. Lucy, saved from the clutches of darkness, reaffirms her love for Dr. Seward, and together they vow to put this terrifying ordeal behind them. Mina Harker is celebrated for her bravery and resourcefulness, and a new partnership is formed between her, Van Helsing, and Dr. Seward to prevent any such horrors from returning. The movie concludes with the Seward family, now closer than ever, attending another opera performance – this time, free of any darkness lurking in the shadows. While it appears that the story has a happy ending, the closing shot of the film reveals Count Dracula watching the family from a distant balcony, hinting at the possibility of a sequel and his intent of revenge. A Night at the Opera with Dracula is a thrilling, gothic horror period drama that combines the glamour of high society with the chilling darkness of the vampire world. It explores themes of love, lust, loyalty, and the eternal struggle between good and evil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This move has implications on both Taiwan's domestic market and its international trade relations with the United States. This article delves into the reasons behind this decision and its potential impact on both countries. Step 1: Understand the background of the decision To fully comprehend the ongoing situation, it is essential to be aware of the past trade disputes and health concerns surrounding imported US beef. In the late 2000s, Taiwan had imposed a complete ban on US beef products due to concerns over health risks, particularly mad cow disease. However, following negotiations, the ban was lifted with some restrictions still in place. Step 2: Analyze the reasons for reinstating the partial ban Taiwan's decision to restore the partial ban on US beef imports is being driven by multiple factors: - Health concerns: Despite the initial lifting of the ban, fears over health risks persist, particularly concerning growth hormones and feed additives that are common in American cattle-farming practices. - Consumer preferences: Taiwanese consumers' preference for locally-sourced and organic produce has been growing stronger, which puts pressure on the government to promote domestic agriculture. - Trade negotiations: The partial ban may be seen as a negotiating tactic to gain leverage in future trade talks with the US. Step 3: Assess the impact on Taiwan's economy and domestic market The reinstated partial ban is expected to have repercussions on Taiwan's domestic markets: - Reduced supply of imported beef: The partial ban will inevitably lead to a decrease in the availability of imported US beef in the Taiwanese market. - Higher prices: The reduced supply may potentially result in a price increase of beef products, affecting local consumers. - Support for local agriculture: However, the ban may also provide an opportunity for Taiwan's domestic beef industry to expand and capture a larger market share. Step 4: Evaluate the implications for US-Taiwan trade relations The restoration of the partial ban is expected to have implications on the trade relations between the US and Taiwan: - Trade disputes: The ban may spark a new round of trade disputes between the two countries, hindering the progress of any ongoing trade negotiations. - US farmers' concerns: US beef producers, who have already been negatively impacted by trade disputes with China, are likely to express concerns about losing another market. Conclusion: In conclusion, Taiwan's restoration of the partial ban on US beef imports is a complex issue driven by multiple factors, ranging from health concerns to trade negotiations. The outcome of this decision is likely to affect the economies of both nations and may strain their existing trade ties. However, this also presents an opportunity for Taiwan's domestic beef industry to expand and satisfy local consumers' preferences for locally-produced meats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Passage:Following his completion of secondary school, Demiéville spent time studying in Munich, London, and Edinburgh, where he was able to attend lectures by George Saintsbury at the University of Edinburgh. He then attended the University of Paris, where he wrote an essay on the musical suite of the 17th and 18th centuries and was awarded a licentiate degree in 1914. Demiéville then spent the year 1915 studying at King's College London where he was introduced to Chinese, which quickly became his focus. After returning to France, Demiéville studied at the École des Langues Orientales Vivantes (School of Living Oriental Languages), after which he moved to the Collège de France, where he further studied Chinese under the tutelage of Édouard Chavannes and began learning Sanskrit from Sylvain Lévi. He earned his Diplômé from the École des Langues Orientales Vivantes in 1919. Solution:","output":"a"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This Act may be cited as the \`\`National Cyber Security Leadership  Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress makes the following findings:             (1) Federal agencies rely on networked computer systems to          deliver critical services and information to the American          people, including operations related to national defense,          emergency services, tax collection, and the payment of          benefits.             (2) There has been an astonishing increase in cyber threats          to government and industry in recent years. The number of cyber          attacks on Federal Government systems in 2001 was 71 percent          greater than the number of such attacks on such systems in          2000.             (3) Cyber attacks can cause irreparable harm in network          systems, including the loss or dissemination of sensitive and          important data. Cyber attacks can also reduce the confidence of          the American people in the integrity and security of the          Internet.             (4) There is mounting evidence to suggest that terrorists          view the Internet as a tool to achieve their goals. Government          investigators found that al Qaeda operatives browsed Internet          sites that offered software describing the digital switches          that control power, water, transport, and communications grids.             (5) The Bush Administration has recognized in its draft          National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace \`\`the pressing need to          make federal cyberspace security a model for the nation''.             (6) All but a few Federal agencies continue to receive          failing grades for their cyber security programs.             (7) Federal agencies must take significant steps to better          protect themselves against cyber attacks, including--                     (A) identifying significant vulnerabilities in                  their computer networks and the tools needed to detect                  such vulnerabilities;                     (B) monitoring for new vulnerabilities in their                  computer networks, and assessing risks of cyber                  attacks;                     (C) testing computers against identified                  vulnerabilities; and                     (D) ensuring that computers and networks are                  adequately protected against such vulnerabilities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

Question: -  The earth changes energy from the sun into heat - Heat rises from the ground - Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space - The temperature of the earth increases - The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps - The temperature rises even faster.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process of Earth changing energy from the sun and eventually leading to melting polar ice caps can be explained as follows: 1. Solar radiation and energy absorption: Our planet receives energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation. Approximately 30% of the incoming solar radiation is reflected back into space by the Earth's atmosphere, clouds, and the surface, while the remaining 70% is absorbed by the land and oceans. The absorbed solar radiation is responsible for heating the Earth's surface and atmosphere, thus providing the necessary warmth for life to thrive. As the Earth absorbs this incoming solar energy, the planet's temperature rises and gradually converts the absorbed energy into heat. This process of transformation and energy transfer plays a crucial role in regulating our planet's climate. 2. Heat transfer processes: Once solar energy is absorbed, heat from the sun penetrates the Earth's surface and is then transferred through the atmosphere by various processes such as conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction occurs when heat is transferred molecules within a solid object or between direct contact of solid objects or between a solid object and liquid or gas. Convection takes place in liquids and gases, where heated particles rise and cooler particles sink, thus creating circulation patterns that transfer heat energy. Radiation is the transfer of heat energy through space via electromagnetic waves. 3. The greenhouse effect: As heat rises from the ground, it is absorbed and re-emitted by greenhouse gases present in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. These gases help trap heat in the atmosphere, acting like a blanket around the planet and preventing it from escaping into space. This phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect and is a vital natural process that maintains Earth's temperature within a range suitable for life. However, increased human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, have led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions have amplified the greenhouse effect, causing the Earth to retain more heat than it should, leading to global warming. 4. Global warming and polar ice caps melting: As global temperatures continue to rise due to the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming, the adverse impact on the Earth's climate systems becomes more apparent. The polar regions, specifically the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps, are especially vulnerable to these rising temperatures. As the Earth's temperature increases, the polar ice caps start to melt at an accelerated rate, leading to more heat being absorbed by the ocean and the atmosphere. The melting of the polar ice caps contributes to a feedback loop where the loss of ice exposes more of the dark ocean surface. The dark ocean surface absorbs more solar radiation, further accelerating global warming and leading to even faster melting of ice caps. This vicious cycle causes sea levels to rise, resulting in severe consequences for coastal areas and global ecosystems. In summary, the first step of the process is the solar radiation emitted by the sun and absorbed by the Earth, which sets off a chain of events that ultimately lead to global warming and melting of the polar ice caps. It is crucial to address the human-induced factors causing the acceleration of this process to mitigate the harmful effects of global warming on our environment."},{"instruction":"Joseph Trapanese is an American composer arranger and producer.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Ristar, released as in Japan, is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis, which released worldwide in February 1995. A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, \\"Ristar\\", was also released, which shared similar themes, while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics.  - Softdisk is a software and Internet company based in Shreveport, Louisiana. Founded in 1981, its original products were disk magazines (which they termed \\"magazettes\\", for \\"magazine on diskette\\"). They were affiliated and partly owned by paper magazine \\"Softalk\\" at their founding, but survived its demise.  - John D. Carmack (born August 20, 1970) is an American game programmer, aerospace and virtual reality engineer. He co-founded id Software. Carmack was the lead programmer of the id video games \\"Commander Keen\\", \\"Wolfenstein 3D\\", \\"Doom\\", \\"Quake\\", \\"Rage\\" and their sequels. Carmack is best known for his innovations in 3D graphics, such as his famous Carmack's Reverse algorithm for shadow volumes, and is also a rocketry enthusiast and the founder and lead engineer of Armadillo Aerospace. In August 2013, Carmack took the position of CTO at Oculus VR, which in 2014 became a subsidiary of Facebook.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - id Software LLC (formerly id Software, Inc., ; see Company name) is an American video game developer headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company Softdisk, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, game designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack (no relation to John Carmack). Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved.  - A disk magazine, colloquially known as a diskmag or diskzine, is a magazine that is distributed in electronic form to be read using computers. These had some popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as periodicals distributed on floppy disk, hence their name. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s caused them to be superseded almost entirely by online publications, which are sometimes still called \\"diskmags\\" despite the lack of physical disks.  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre.  - Shadow Knights is a platform game created by id Software and published by Softdisk in 1991 . This is one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for Softdisk , where the id Software founders formerly were employed . It is a basic platform game with a considerable influence by the early Ninja Gaiden games .    What is the relationship between 'shadow knights' and 'floppy disk'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Shadow Knights' and 'floppy disk' lies in the medium of distribution and the era in which they were prevalent. 'Shadow Knights' is a platform game created by id Software and published by Softdisk in 1991, during a time when floppy disks were a common method of distributing software, including video games. At that time, Softdisk was a company known for producing and distributing disk magazines, which were periodicals distributed on floppy disks, also known as \\"diskmags\\" or \\"diskzines\\". As a result, it is highly likely that 'Shadow Knights' was distributed via floppy disks, given the widespread use of this storage medium during the early 1990s.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\"; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s. Context: In Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever, Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution:  In their initial incarnation as cheerful, wisecracking moptops, the Fab Four revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts. Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.  In The Beatles as Musicians, Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \\"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed - as a means to entertain - a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\\"  Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as \\"a natural melodist - a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \\"vertical\\", employing wide, consonant intervals which express his \\"extrovert energy and optimism\\". Conversely, Lennon's \\"sedentary, ironic personality\\" is reflected in a \\"horizontal\\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \\"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\\" MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \\"characterful lines and textural colourings\\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \\"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\\". Question: What did they say. Whats the answer?","output":"The authors described in detail the musical evolution and individual approaches to composition of the Beatles. Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz in \\"Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever\\" emphasized how the Beatles not only revolutionized the sound, style, and attitude of popular music but also continued to expand rock's stylistic frontiers throughout the 1960s. They experimented with numerous genres while maintaining their mass appeal. In \\"The Beatles as Musicians,\\" Walter Everett highlights the contrasting motivations and approaches of Lennon and McCartney. McCartney constantly developed his focused musical talent to entertain, enriching the common language of music with his understanding of counterpoint. On the other hand, Lennon's music is more daring, stemming from an unconscious, searching, but undisciplined artistic sensibility. Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as a natural melodist, with vertical melody lines expressing his extrovert energy and optimism. In contrast, Lennon's horizontal approach uses minimal and dissonant intervals, reflecting his sedentary and ironic personality. His melodies stay close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, relying on harmony to create interest.  MacDonald also highlights Harrison's significant contributions as a lead guitarist, adding character and texture to support Lennon and McCartney's parts. Moreover, he praises Ringo Starr as the father of modern pop/rock drumming. In summary, the Beatles' musical evolution is characterized by their continuous expansion of rock's stylistic frontiers and the unique contributions and contrasting approaches of its individual members. Their work transformed the sound and attitude of popular music, establishing them as one of the most influential cultural forces of their era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – About half of US adults—more than 117 million people—are part of a \\"virtual, perpetual lineup\\" thanks to the increasing and unregulated use of facial recognition technology by the country's law enforcement agencies, according to a report released Tuesday by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology. The center's executive director tells the Guardian the use of this surveillance technology \\"can change the basic freedom we have to go about our lives.\\" The big difference between this new virtual lineup and traditional databases of fingerprints and DNA is that it is \\"overwhelmingly made up of\\" innocent people. Sixteen states let police use driver's license photos of residents for facial recognition purposes without a warrant, the New York Times reports. Others use passports, visa applications, and more. And while the report calls the current use of facial recognition technology \\"highly problematic,\\" it recognizes it as a useful tool—provided there's more oversight. According to the Intercept, 52 law enforcement agencies admitted using facial recognition technology in the report; 51 of them say they are doing so without legislative approval. The report worries the technology will be used to crackdown on freedom of speech—police have used it to scan faces at anti-police protests, and only one agency in the country says it can't be used to track people exercising their right to political or religious speech. Facial recognition technology also disproportionately affects people of color for multiple reasons, including that its algorithms are 10% less accurate for black faces than white ones. (Disney gets patent to take pictures of park guests' feet.)","output":"Title: The Perpetual Lineup: Facial Recognition Technology and Its Impact on US Citizens Introduction In recent years, facial recognition technology has become more prevalent within law enforcement agencies in the United States. According to a report released by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology, over half of US adults - more than 117 million people - are now part of an ongoing \\"virtual, perpetual lineup.\\" This new form of surveillance raises significant concerns, particularly regarding privacy rights, disproportionate impact on people of color, and the potential for abuse in monitoring freedom of speech. This article will delve further into the issues surrounding facial recognition technology and explore the need for greater oversight. I. The Virtual, Perpetual Lineup The use of facial recognition technology has fundamentally changed the way law enforcement operates. Unlike traditional databases, which contain fingerprints and DNA of predominantly guilty people, facial recognition assembles an extensive array of images of innocent civilians. With 16 states allowing police access to driver's license photos without a warrant, and others utilizing passports and visa applications, the prevalence of facial recognition technology raises serious concerns about its impact on our basic freedoms. II. The Call for Oversight and Regulation Despite its current controversial usage, facial recognition technology is widely acknowledged as a valuable tool for law enforcement. However, the report emphasizes that its use should be subject to greater oversight and regulation. Out of 52 law enforcement agencies acknowledged as employing facial recognition technology, 51 stated they were doing so without legislative approval. This lack of regulation exposes the considerable potential for abuse and misuse of the technology. III. Facial Recognition Technology and Freedom of Speech One of the most pressing concerns arising from the use of facial recognition technology is its potential impact on freedom of speech. Law enforcement agencies have already demonstrated their willingness to use these technologies to monitor anti-police protests, with only one agency explicitly prohibiting the tracking of individuals exercising their right to political or religious speech. This highlights the need to establish clear guidelines for the appropriate use of facial recognition, ensuring that it does not infringe upon fundamental liberties. IV. Disproportionate Impact on People of Color Apart from the broader privacy issues, facial recognition technology disproportionately affects people of color. The algorithms employed in facial recognition software are 10% less accurate for black faces compared to white ones. This discrepancy may lead to an increased risk of misidentification and wrongful accusations, further exacerbating existing social inequalities and tensions between law enforcement and minority communities. Conclusion The adoption of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies across the United States has led to the creation of a virtual, perpetual lineup of over 117 million people. Though facial recognition may be a useful tool for law enforcement, its use must be balanced against the need for privacy protection, freedom of speech, and equal treatment under the law. For these reasons, greater oversight and regulation are needed to establish a fair and transparent framework for the responsible application of facial recognition technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was recorded over the course of three nights in March 1971 and features the band performing extended jam versions of songs such as \\"Whipping Post\\", \\" The band devised the cover idea for At Fillmore East rather than leaving it in the hands of Atlantic executives (Allman was particularly disgusted with the artwork for Sam & Dave's Hold On, I'm Comin' album). Initially, the album cover was to be shots of the band taken in front of the Fillmore East with their names on the marquee above them, but no one was satisfied with the results. The band's main purpose for the cover was that it be as \\"meat and potatoes\\" as the band's ethos and performing, and someone suggested the band make it a photograph of the band in an alley waiting with their gear to go onstage.  The image was shot by photographer Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot (\\"we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it,\\" said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title on one of the road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.  The back cover shows their road crew gathered in the same spot with 16 oz cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer provided by the photographer as a reward to the roadies for lugging out and stacking the band's heavy equipment for the shoot. Among the crew on the back cover are Joseph \\"Red Dog\\" Campbell, Kim Payne, Mike Callahan, Joe Dan Petty and Willie Perkins (the last two the newest additions to the crew at the time). The idea to have the crew on the back cover was Duane Allman's idea, as all involved viewed them the \\"unsung heroes\\" in the operation. A photo of Lyndon, then in jail awaiting his trial, was superimposed to the wall behind the crew. What did the artwork consist of?","output":"The artwork for At Fillmore East consisted of a photograph of the band in an alley waiting with their gear to go onstage, shot by photographer Jim Marshall in Macon, Georgia.

Do those questions have the same meaning?  1). no.  2). yes.","output":"To answer these questions, I will first research each topic, and then I will provide justifications for each answer. Step 1: Research carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms duration after exposure stops Carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms generally last for a short duration once the exposure has ceased and the person has received appropriate treatment and is out in fresh air. In mild to moderate cases, the symptoms can last for a few hours to a few days, depending on the severity of the exposure and the treatment. In more severe cases, long-term effects or permanent damage may occur. Step 2: Research how long food poisoning still shows in the blood The duration in which food poisoning can still be detected in the blood depends on the type of foodborne illness and the specific test used for detection. For example, Salmonella bacteria can typically be detected in the blood for up to a week after infection, while other bacteria, viruses, or parasites might have different timelines. It is important to note that the actual symptoms of food poisoning may last from several hours to a few days, depending on the severity and the individual's immune response.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: 'Who's country was Stoltenberg told by someone would be very rich? Options:  A. Kim  B. Trump  C. Moon  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A.

Given the question: I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring towns had different demographics. Hill town had younger inhabitants, most of them in their 30's and 40's. Lake town was inhabited by elderly people, most of them above 65 years of age.  Answer this question please: Which town had fewer people that freed up time for their grandchildren? The answer is:","output":"Hill town had fewer people that freed up time for their grandchildren. To reach this conclusion, let's analyze both towns in the context of the background information provided about old age. Since old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life, it is reasonable to assume that elderly people above the age of 65 are more likely to have retired and have time for their grandchildren as compared to those in their 30s and 40s who would still be working. Now, let's consider the demographics of each town. Hill town has younger inhabitants, most of them in their 30s and 40s, which means that the majority of the population is still in their working years. As a result, these individuals have less time to spend with their grandchildren because they are still actively engaged in their careers and other responsibilities. On the other hand, Lake town is inhabited by elderly people, most of them above 65 years of age. This implies that the majority of the population in Lake town is in the old age category, which is characterized by retirement and having more free time for hobbies, interests, and grandchildren. Therefore, compared to Lake town, Hill town has a smaller proportion of its population that has freed up time for their grandchildren because most of its inhabitants are in their 30s and 40s, still working, and have not yet reached the retirement age in which their time becomes more liberated. In contrast, Lake town's elderly population is more likely to have retired and have greater availability to spend with their grandchildren, making Hill town the right choice when considering the town with fewer people that freed up time for their grandchildren."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here's a detailed guide on how to go about ordering food in a restaurant: 1. Select the restaurant: Choose your preferred restaurant, taking into consideration factors such as cuisine, price range, ambiance, and location. Check for the restaurant's hours to ensure it's open when you plan to dine. Researching the restaurant's menu and reviews online can also help you get a better idea of their offerings before you dine there. Making a reservation may be necessary, depending on the popularity of the restaurant. 2. Arrive at the restaurant: Arrive at the restaurant at the appointed time. If you made a reservation, provide the host with your name or reservation details. If you are a walk-in customer, expect to wait until a table becomes available. 3. Get seated: The host or hostess will lead you to your table. After you're seated, take some time to get comfortable and review the menu. 4. Review the menu: Study the menu to familiarize yourself with the food and drink options. Look for appetizers, entrées, side dishes, desserts, and beverages that pique your interest. Many restaurants include descriptions of the dishes and their ingredients to help guide your choice. 5. Inquire about specials or recommendations: The server will usually mention any daily specials or seasonal dishes when they greet you. Don't hesitate to ask for recommendations or inquire about ingredients or preparation methods if you have specific dietary preferences or allergies. 6. Place your drink order: When the server approaches to take your order, start with your beverage preferences. This could include water, soda, juices, cocktails, wines, or beers. Most restaurants typically bring complimentary water to the table, but you may need to request it if it’s not automatically provided.  7. Order appetizers/starters: If you plan to have appetizers, order them next. Some options might include soups, salads, or small plates. Waitstaff may ask about your choice of dressing or any additional toppings you’d like to add to your order. 8. Choose your main course: Decide on your main course (entrée) and any accompanying side dishes. Make note of any preferences on preparation, cooking doneness, or modifications like substitutions or omissions. For example, if you're ordering a steak, mention your desired cooking temperature (e.g., rare, medium, or well-done). 9. Finalize your order: After everyone in your party has placed their orders, the server will confirm the details before leaving the table to place your orders in the kitchen. This is an excellent opportunity to double-check and make sure your order is correct regarding food preferences and any specific requests. 10. Enjoy your meal: Once your food arrives, take time to savor your dishes and engage in conversation with your dining companions. If you have any issues with your meal, politely inform your server so they can attempt to rectify the situation. 11. Order dessert (optional): If you wish to order dessert, servers typically provide a dessert menu after the main meal has been served. Choose your dessert and place the order when ready. 12. Request the check: After you've finished your meal, ask your server for the check. Make sure to review the bill for accuracy and, if satisfied, place your payment (cash or credit card) in the check presenter or folder. Calculate an appropriate tip based on the quality of service, usually between 15-20% of the pre-tax total. 13. Leaving the restaurant: Once your payment has been processed and change (if applicable) returned, gather your belongings, thank your server, and exit the restaurant.

To evaluate this hypothesis more accurately, it would be important to delve deeper into the historical context and understand the distinctions between the Moors and the Romans.  The Moors were a Muslim people from North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula who were primarily of Berber and Arab descent. They conquered and ruled significant portions of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 to 1492. The Moors brought with them their Islamic religion, unique architectural styles, and various cultural practices. As the given premise suggests, the bairro resembles a typical Moorish neighborhood with its labyrinthine cobbled streets, decaying houses and palaces, and fado music clubs. It is important to note that fado music, popular in Portugal, has its roots in the Moorish culture too. On the other hand, the Romans ruled over much of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula, from around 200 BC to 476 AD. The Romans left a lasting impact on the regions they conquered, with their influence still evident in many aspects of European culture, language, government systems, and architecture. However, the premise does not provide any indication that the bairro has elements or characteristics linked to the Roman legacy. Based on this information and the lack of evidence tying the bairro to the Romans in the premise provided, it would be inappropriate to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The bairro is part of the Roman legacy\\" is true.

The album was released by Heavenly Records on 21 February 2005, and became the band's second consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart at number 1. \\"Some Cities\\" was conceived as a rawer, stripped-down record, and conceptually touches upon the physical changes of the band's hometown of Manchester, as well as emotional transformations. The album features the band's second-highest charting single, \\"Black and White Town\\", which peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart.  - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014.  - Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.  - \\"Black and White Town\\" is the lead single on Doves' third album, \\"Some Cities\\". The single was released as a promo CD on 13 December 2004, and as a full single on 7 February 2005. The song scored the band their second Top 10 hit, charting at #6 on the UK Singles Chart. The atmospheric single is noted for its heavy piano and guitars played in unison, with Andy Williams' percussion maintaining a driving beat. The music video for \\"Black and White Town\\" was filmed on the Summerston council estate in Glasgow. There also exists a \\"director's cut\\" of the video, featuring different footage, which can be found on the DVD in the limited edition box set version of the \\"Some Cities\\" album.  - David \\"Dave\\" Gahan (born David Callcott; 9 May 1962) is an English singer-songwriter, best known as the baritone lead singer for the electronic music band Depeche Mode since their debut in 1980. He is also an accomplished solo artist, releasing albums in 2003 (\\"Paper Monsters\\") and 2007 (\\"Hourglass\\"). Though his bandmate Martin Gore continues to be the main Depeche Mode songwriter, Gahan has also contributed a number of songs to the band's most recent albums; \\"Playing the Angel\\" (2005), \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" (2009) and \\"Delta Machine\\" (2013).

Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Reprise Records is an American major record label, founded in 1960 by Frank Sinatra. It was mostly inactive from 1976 to 1987. It is owned by Warner Music Group, and operates through Warner Bros. Records.  - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom.

Movie plot title: Meet the Spartans Movie plot: The film opens with a Spartan elder inspecting a talking baby ogre. The baby vomits on the inspector and is then discarded with a punt off the hill. Next, he inspects a Vietnamese baby, and Brangelina instantly adopts it. Baby Leonidas is then inspected, having a six-pack, biceps, and beard from birth. He is accepted as a Spartan and prepared for kinghood through his childhood training, from fighting his grandmother to enduring torture. Leonidas (Sean Maguire) is then cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter while killing a giant dancing penguin. Returning a king for his inauguration ceremony, Leonidas sees Margo (Carmen Electra) dancing and asks her to marry him, to which she responds by giving him the combination to her chastity belt.Years later, Leonidas is training when Captain (Kevin Sorbo) informs him that a Persian messenger has arrived. The messenger has come to present Xerxes' demands for Sparta's submission. Leonidas arrives to greet the messenger in the Spartan way (high-fives for the women and open mouth tongue kisses for the men). After growing angry with both the messenger's disrespect and making out with his wife, Leonidas kicks him, the messenger's bodyguards, and then several other people he simply disliked, ranging from Britney Spears (Nicole Parker), Ryan Seacrest, Michael Jackson and Kevin Federline (Nick Steele) to Sanjaya Malakar (Tony Yalda) and the American Idol judges into \\"the pit of death\\".

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the linear equation -5*v = 19*v - 72 for the variable v, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Rearrange the equation to move all terms with v to one side of the equation. To do this, let's add 5*v to both sides: -5*v + 5*v = 19*v - 72 + 5*v Since adding the same quantity to both sides does not change the inequality, we can simplify: 0 = 24*v - 72 Step 2: Isolate the variable v. We will first add 72 to both sides of the equation: 24*v - 72 + 72 = 0 + 72 24*v = 72 Now, divide both sides by the coefficient of v, which is 24: (24*v) / 24 = 72 / 24 Thus, we get: v = 3 The solution for the linear equation -5*v = 19*v - 72 is v = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Secondly, the speaker expresses a sense of relief or gratitude for not having had similar experiences themselves. The phrase \\"knock on wood\\" is traditionally used as a superstitious gesture for warding off bad luck or hoping to continue a lucky streak, suggesting that the speaker is aware that their good fortune might not be universal and that others may not have been as fortunate in their experiences. Moreover, the speaker seems to emphasize the severity of these bad experiences by expressing their shock at the end of the month. Although the specific context of the conversation is not provided, it is evident that the speaker feels a significant emotional response to people's negative experiences. The use of shock could indicate that whatever these experiences entail, they have evoked a powerful response from the speaker, reinforcing the notion that some people have indeed had really bad experiences. In conclusion, the premise clearly supports the hypothesis that \\"Some people have had really bad experiences.\\" Through the speaker's acknowledgment of individuals' negative experiences, their expression of relief for not having faced similar challenges, and their emotive reaction towards these unfortunate occurrences, the proposition strongly indicates that some individuals have, in fact, had extremely unfavorable experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that August is during the winter in the southern hemisphere to answer this question: \\"Where does August take place during the winter?\\"","output":"August, as a month in the Gregorian calendar, occurs simultaneously in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, the experience of the season during August differs based on the location in either of these hemispheres. To provide a detailed answer to the question \\"Where does August take place during the winter?\\", we need to examine the seasonal variations and climatic factors unique to the Southern Hemisphere, as well as specific regions and countries experiencing winter during August. The Earth's axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun results in the seasonal variation experienced across the globe. As the Earth orbits the sun, this tilt causes the solar insolation or the distribution of sunlight to vary, resulting in different seasons. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, receiving more direct sunlight and thus experiencing higher temperatures. Conversely, during the same period, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, receiving less direct sunlight and experiencing winter. August, being the eighth month of the year, takes place during winter in the Southern Hemisphere due to this phenomenon. Various regions and countries within this hemisphere experience the winter season and its associated climatic conditions, such as cooler temperatures, shorter days, and in some cases, increased precipitation or snowfall. 1. South America:  During August, countries in the southern part of South America, such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and the southern parts of Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru, experience winter. In Patagonia, shared by Argentina and Chile, winter sports and activities like skiing and snowboarding become popular pastimes as snowfall increases. 2. Africa: Southern African countries like South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, southern parts of Mozambique and Angola also experience winter during August. South Africa in particular sees cooler temperatures and occasional snowfall in some elevated regions, like the Drakensberg Mountains. 3. Oceania: In Oceania, Australia, and New Zealand mainly witness winter during August. Snow sports become popular in southeastern Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory. Tasmania, being Australia's southernmost state, also experiences extended periods of snow cover in winter. New Zealand's South Island transforms into a winter sports destination, with tourists flocking to popular ski resorts like Queenstown and Wanaka. 4. Antarctica: Finally, Antarctica, the southernmost continent, experiences extreme winter conditions during August, with temperatures often plummeting below -40°C (-40°F) and darkness prevailing for 24 hours a day. The continent is too cold and inhospitable for any large human settlements, but a few research stations operate year-round despite the harsh conditions. In summary, August takes place during the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, spanning across South America, southern Africa, Oceania, and Antarctica. Countries in these regions, as well as specific areas, experience the winter season due to the Earth's axial tilt and its influence on the distribution of sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sauvage snaps out of his stupor just long enough to join Clarence Bowden (Julian D. Christopher), his former commanding officer, to work as a bodyguard for former World Heavyweight boxing champion and now successful businessman Wayne Barclay (Raz Adoti). It appears that the release of notorious rap mogul Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock) from prison has caused Barclay's worried sister Tamara (Vivica A.

Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. The West Indies toured Australia in 1992-93, recovering from losing the second Test to win the final two matches and take the series 2-1. The team also won the annual World Series Cup. In the first three Tests, Ambrose was hampered by pitches which did not suit his bowling and, according to Tony Cozier writing in Wisden, was often unlucky when he bowled, although he took five for 66 in the first Test. In the final two Tests, he took 19 wickets. In the fourth he took ten wickets, including six for 74 in the first innings; in the second innings, he took three wickets in 19 deliveries and the West Indies won the match by one run. According to Cozier, the captains of both teams, Richie Richardson and Allan Border, \\"paid tribute to the man who made the result possible: Ambrose consolidated his reputation as the world's leading bowler\\". On the first day of the decisive final Test, Ambrose took seven wickets at the cost of one run from 32 deliveries and finished with figures of seven for 25. Cozier described it as \\"one of Test cricket's most devastating spells\\". West Indies won by an innings and Ambrose was named man of the series, having taken 33 wickets to equal the record in an Australia-West Indies Test series. He topped the West Indian bowling averages with an average of 16.42. Cozier described Ambrose's performance as \\"instrumental in winning [the series]\\" and his bowling as \\"flawless\\".  In the one-day tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final--both games were won by the West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to remove his white wristbands while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals. After a one-day tournament in South Africa, West Indies returned home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2-0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be fifth in the team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that he was suffering from fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.  Having developed a slower ball, and using the yorker more sparingly, Ambrose took five wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What other wins did they have?","output":"From the above article, other wins that West Indies had are as follows: 1. They won the annual World Series Cup during their tour of Australia in 1992-93. 2. They won the Test series against Australia with a 2-1 score. 3. They won both games in the two-match final during the one-day tournament in South Africa. 4. West Indies defeated Pakistan 2-0 in the Test series held at home. 5.

Second question: Has the existence of extra-terrestrial life been proven? Or is it just a myth? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Available options: + no + yes","output":"Firstly, as an artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI, I don't have access to confidential or classified information, nor do I have the ability to release such information. I rely on publicly available data to provide accurate and helpful answers. Concerning the first question: I would not be able to confirm or deny whether the USA or any other government agency worldwide has made contact with extra-terrestrial life because such information isn't publicly available.  Onto the second question: The existence of extra-terrestrial life is a topic of significant discussion and debate within the scientific community. As of now, there is no definitive proof of extraterrestrial life, although the search is an important part of astrophysics and space exploration. It's significant to state that the lack of proof is not necessarily proof of a lack.  The Universe is immense, containing billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, around many of which could be planets. Scientists have already discovered over 4,000 exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), many of which are in the habitable zone of their star, where conditions could potentially sustain life as we understand it.  Scientists like those at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and those working on projects related to NASA's Mars Rover and the Kepler Space Telescope, are actively searching for signs of life. Scientific discoveries such as potential bacterial life indications in meteorites originating from Mars and the unexplained nature of 'Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object detected passing through the Solar System, continue to stir debate and add fuel to the ongoing investigation of the existence of extra-terrestrial life.  Lastly, regarding whether these two questions are asking the same thing: the answer is no, they are not. The first question is about whether a specific event has occurred, meaning if there's been contact with extraterrestrial life, particularly by the USA.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - A reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is a heat engine (usually, although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.  - A V engine, or Vee engine is a common configuration for an internal combustion engine. The cylinders and pistons are aligned, in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in a \\"V\\" when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. The Vee configuration generally reduces the overall engine length, height and weight compared to an equivalent inline configuration.  - A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft. Most banks are set at a right angle (90°) to each other, some at a narrower angle, with 45°, 60°, and 72° most common.  - A W8 engine is an eight - cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . The W8 can be imagined as flat plane crank V8 engine combining two narrow - angle ( 15 degree ) VR4 engine blocks , mounted juxtaposed at 72 degrees to each other and coupled to one crankshaft . Nearly square external dimensions mean the large eight - cylinder engine will fit in the space typically taken by a V6 engine .  - Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles.  - A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2.0 L to 4.3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine. Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. It is becoming more common as the space allowed for engines in modern cars is reduced at the same time as power requirements increase, and has largely replaced the inline 6, which is nearly twice as long - too long to fit in many modern engine compartments - and the V8, which is larger, more expensive, and has poorer fuel economy. The V6 engine has become widely adopted for medium-sized cars, often as an optional engine where an inline 4 is standard, or as a standard engine where a V8 is a higher-cost performance option.  - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons.  - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach.  - A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. (Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the long axis of the vehicle, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front.)  - In an internal combustion engine of the reciprocating type, the crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft. The enclosure forms the largest cavity in the engine and is located below the cylinder(s), which in a multicylinder engine is usually integrated into one or several cylinder blocks. Crankcases have often been discrete parts, but more often they are integral with the cylinder bank(s), forming an engine block. Nevertheless, the area around the crankshaft is still usually called the crankcase. Crankcases and other basic engine structural components (e.g., cylinders, cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and integrated combinations thereof) are typically made of cast iron or cast aluminium via sand casting. Today the foundry processes are usually highly automated, with a few skilled workers to manage the casting of thousands of parts.   - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards.  - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion.  - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

Robbie Wilde thumbs through his iPhone as the sounds of voices and clinking glasses bounce all around him. His eyes never leave the phone's screen. During New York Fashion Week, Wilde, 27, passes the time with friends and management at an exclusive party in Hell's Kitchen before taking over the turntables. Wilde lives in a world of rhythm and bass. He just can't hear it. Ear infections at age 7 left Wilde completely deaf in his right ear and took away 80% of his hearing in his left one. It would be another four years before doctors would confirm what his mother, Maria Sapeta, dreaded: Her son was deaf. \\"It was heartbreaking as a mother,\\" she recalled. \\"It was probably one of the hardest days of my life. But Robbie was the one who gave me a hug and said, 'Don't cry.'\\" Originally from Portugal, Sapeta and her husband, Emidio, then a cruise ship chef, had moved to the United States when Wilde was 5. From childhood, he always had a \\"persistent personality,\\" Sapeta said, laughing. Unlike many other kids his age, he always finished what he started -- from puzzles to cabins made from Lincoln Logs. After losing his hearing, his grades slipped because he had difficulty understanding his teachers. Bullied in school, Wilde usually kept his deafness a secret. When his parents suggested he attend a specialty school, he insisted on staying in public school. He worked with a speech therapist and began reading lips. \\"I grew up in a way that I don't want any sympathy. I don't want to be treated differently,\\" he said. \\"I just tried to maneuver around, reading lips and trying to hear my own way.\\" When her son announced he wanted to be a professional DJ instead of joining the family restaurant business, Sapeta was cautiously supportive. \\"We could see his talent and his passion, but I kept worrying about that left ear,\\" she said. \\"Anything to stop his dreams, he didn't want it.\\" Hearing is the most important sense for a DJ, who manipulates music, scratches records and uses mixers. But Wilde was determined to succeed without his. Always drawn to music, he discovered turntables in high school through a friend's brother who was a DJ. Wilde got his first shot at performing as a DJ at his father's restaurant outside Newark, New Jersey, nearly a decade ago, and he hasn't looked back since. \\"I still consider it as a hobby. I really do love it,\\" Wilde said. \\"I don't see it as a job, and that's the best part.\\" Wilde started out playing CDs before pushing himself to scratch records, something he knew he needed help with. \\"It's a hard business alone for the hearing community,\\" he said, \\"And I was like, 'I'm hearing impaired and how's that going to work?'\\" So he paired up with two-time DMC world champion DJ and Harvard math grad Sam Zornow, aka DJ Shiftee, who was teaching at Dubspot, a DJ school and production studio in New York. Mastering turntables is a skill that takes hours of practice to learn and can be a lifelong pursuit, Zornow said. \\"It takes two years just to get bad,\\" he said. \\"And I mean 'bad' meaning bad.\\" Still, Zornow was up to the challenge of working with Wilde. At first he didn't know what to expect, but he said Wilde's success has surprised him. \\"On paper it should be impossible. You're dealing with manipulating sound. Then combine that with a discipline that's hard in general, it's a really impressive task he's taken on,\\" Zornow said. \\"From the beginning he believed in himself and continues to believe in himself.\\" Computer giant Hewlett-Packard noticed Wilde's skills and put him in a commercial this fall for its new touch-enabled PC, thrusting him onto the world stage. (watch it here on YouTube) \\"It's a true story of inspiration,\\" said HP marketing executive Danielle Jones. \\"His is a profound story of someone being able to do the things that matter to them and the things that they love through technology.\\" Unable to hear lyrics or complete compositions, Wilde relies on technology to see the music by using his laptop and DJ software that helps him differentiate between vocals, bass and kicks. He also feels the vibration whether physically from a club's speakers or through a SubPac, which resembles a seat cushion and allows him to feel the music by directly transferring low frequencies to the body. Clubgoers and promoters dubbed him \\"That Deaf DJ\\" after he first came onto the scene in New Jersey -- a moniker even he uses. But Wilde said he wants to be more than just \\"a deaf kid trying to DJ.\\" \\"I want you to see me as a great DJ who happens to be deaf,\\" he said. Besides, he said, some things are better left unheard. \\"There's a lot of sounds out in the world you don't want to hear. I like it muffled,\\" he said. \\"I like who I am; I'm proud of who I am.\\" Wilde has gone from working small clubs to rocking this year's Consumer Electronics Show and Sundance Film Festival. When he's not behind the turntables, Wilde is in the studio producing music. Often questioned about the severity of his deafness, Wilde used to carry around a doctor's note and would show the back of his driver's license indicating his hearing impairment. When people question his abilities, he said he has only one answer: \\"I didn't hear you.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","output":"The article focuses on Robbie Wilde, a DJ who has made a successful career despite being deaf.

Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974.

He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar.

Answer the following question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms. Answer:","output":"Title: Terrible experience - Disappointing Google! As a long-time Android user, I was genuinely disheartened by the performance of the 'com.google.android.gms' app; it failed to meet even the most basic expectations. Having used various Google services and been a strong advocate for their applications, this app simply does not live up to Google's usual standards.  First, the stability of the app left much to be desired. It kept crashing and freezing, even after an uninstall and reinstall. Despite multiple software updates, the issue persisted, rendering the app useless and forcing me to resort to third-party solutions instead. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting, but to no avail. In an age where most people lack the time and energy to deal with such frustrations, a smooth and efficient app experience is crucial, but this app failed to provide that.  To make matters worse, the functionality of the app was questionable, to say the least. It was riddled with errors and struggled consistently to provide the desired services. I expected much more from an app developed by Google as they usually excel at user experience and intuitiveness. To my surprise, the app's interface was cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to navigate and locate specific features. Additionally, some of these features were nonfunctional, or they took an extensive amount of time to load, contributing to an overall frustrating user experience. Third, the app's battery consumption was outrageous. For an application that promises to streamline and improve daily usage, it should not be draining the life out of my phone. The unnecessary background processes consumed significant power, requiring me to charge my device more often than usual. This not only caused severe inconvenience but also raised long-term concerns about the impact it might have on my phone's battery life. Finally, the app's customer support turned out to be abysmal. My queries and concerns were met with unhelpful, automated responses. The lack of timely and effective assistance, plus the inability to communicate with a human representative, only served to exacerbate the issue. Despite the vast resources Google should have at its disposal to ensure top-notch customer support, they have failed to deliver through this app. All things considered, the 'com.google.android.gms' app has been a deeply disappointing experience, resulting in it receiving a 1-star rating from me. The app has let down its users, who expect better performance, functionality, and support from a Google-related product. It needs extensive improvements in every aspect to match the reputation typically associated with Google's applications. Until significant steps are taken to rectify these problems, I would strongly discourage my friends and colleagues from using this app and would advise potential users to seek alternative solutions."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Businessman Peter Drummond hires three new programmers: A weapons expert named Hardcore, a game artificial intelligence designer named Sol, and a sound effects creator named Bug. Faye Clayton promises 1 million to the programmer who makes the game the \\"scariest\\", igniting a fierce rivalry between the trio. During a storm three weeks later, lightning strikes the building and causes all of the computers and electronic equipment to go offline. After a meeting with Drummond, the three programmers decide to try out the game with the help of Clayton Software intern Laura Wheeler. The game involves a motion capture suit that is connected to the computer network and used to program the game's movements. Peter places a backup CD into the external drive while the others set up. Bug, Hardcore, and Sol soon lose the game, and are surprised to see Laura get all the way to the final boss. Sol inserts his new AI chip into the mainframe and begins to play the game. As he advances to the game's third level, the motion capture suit connected to the computer network comes alive. Simultaneously, the suit attacks Sol in real life while an in-game monster drags Sol's video game character away. The following morning, Bug and Hardcore discover that Sol has been killed and the backup CD has been stolen. Hardcore attempts to review the security camera tapes with his PDA, but accidentally touches the motion capture suit, which has merged itself with Sol's dead body. The suit attacks Hardcore; although he initially manages to fight it off, he is later killed.

A traditional market town in the heart of the Portes du Soleil, Morzine is dominated by chalets spread across a river gorge, bordered by partially wooded slopes allowing skiing in poor weather conditions. Situated at an altitude of 1000 m, it is one of the most northerly of the French Alpine resorts, and weatherwise benefits from the Mont Blanc microclimate. The locality enjoys panoramic mountain views and modern ski facilities, as well as hotels and restaurants in the town itself. The ski resort of Avoriaz is located on the territory of the commune.   - Alpine Ski () is an Alpine skiing arcade game, released by Taito in 1981.  - Les Portes du Soleil (French for \\"The Doors of the Sun\\") is a major skisports destination in the Alps, encompassing thirteen resorts between Mont Blanc in France and Lake Geneva in Switzerland.

Almost all of the pistes are connected by lifts  a few marginal towns can be reached only by the free bus services in the area. The highest point of skiing is 2400 m and the lowest is 900 m.  As with many other Alpine ski resorts, the lower slopes of the Portes du Soleil have snow-making facilities to extend the skiable season by keeping the lower slopes open during the warmer months.  - Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).  - Ski mountaineering is a skiing discipline that involves climbing mountains either on skis or carrying them, depending on the steepness of the ascent, and then descending on skis. There are two major categories of equipment used, free-heel Telemark skis and skis based on Alpine skis, where the heel is free for ascents, but is fixed during descent. The discipline may be practiced recreationally or as a competitive sport.  - Avoriaz (or ) is a French mountain resort in the heart of the Portes du Soleil. It is located in the territory of the commune of Morzine. It is easily accessible from either Thonon at Lake Geneva or Cluses-junction on the A40 motorway between Geneva and Chamonix. Either way one follows the D902, Route des Grandes Alpes, to Morzine and then the D338 running from Morzine to Avoriaz. Snow chains are often necessary. Avoriaz is built on a shelf high above the town of Morzine, which is among the pioneering towns of skiing with its first lifts dating back to the early 1930s.  Today Avoriaz is one of the major French ski destinations catering for all standards of skiing and ranks among the top snowboarding destinations of the world. Apart from snow-based pursuits, Avoriaz is also a centre for trekking, golf, VTT (mountain biking) and other outdoor activities during the summer.  Cars are forbidden in Avoriaz. The station is designed to be fully skiable. Other transport around the resort includes horse-drawn sleighs during winter and snow caps.  - The term mountaineering describes the sport of mountain climbing, including ski mountaineering.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts.  But I can use this background: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend didn't learn about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's examine what each friend studied: 1. Greg started reading about natural selection. In the background provided, it is mentioned that \\"natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.\\" Therefore, Greg would have learned about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common. 2. Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. This means that Frank focused on populations where natural selection occurred less frequently or was not as significant a factor. It is likely that Frank did not learn about \\"unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common,\\" as his studies did not focus on the results of natural selection, but rather on populations in which natural selection was not a significant factor. Based on this analysis, the friend who didn't learn about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common is Frank."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: -  A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container - The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol -   What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process is to gather a selection of grapes. In this initial stage, it is crucial that the grapes chosen are suitable for wine production, as the quality of the grapes directly affects the final product. Grape selection typically involves a thorough examination of the grapevines and the grapes themselves, taking into consideration the following factors: 1. Varietal: Different grape varieties are better suited for particular styles of wine. For instance, Chardonnay grapes are commonly used for white wines, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are popular for red wines. A winemaker must select the appropriate grape variety that aligns with their desired wine style. 2. Ripeness: Grapes need to be at the optimal stage of ripeness to ensure the right balance of sugar, acidity, and flavors. Grapes that are harvested too early may yield wine with high acidity, while overripe grapes can result in a wine with excessive sweetness or a lack of acidity. 3. Health of the grapes: Healthy grapes are essential to producing high-quality wine. Grapes affected by diseases, pests, or other issues may compromise the quality of the wine. During grape selection, it is essential to exclude any damaged or unhealthy grapes to preserve the integrity of the final product. 4. Terroir: Terroir refers to the combination of factors affecting a particular grape-growing region, such as the climate, geography, and soil conditions. These factors can influence the taste and quality of the grapes and, in turn, the wine. When selecting grapes, a winemaker may consider the unique characteristics and advantages of the terroir of the vineyard. Once the suitable grapes are identified and selected, they can be harvested, usually by hand or using mechanized equipment, and then transported to the winemaking facility. This marks the beginning of a meticulous process that will eventually transform the grapes into a fine and enjoyable wine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance.

Please answer the following question: Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent.  Who will develop infections less frequently?  Hint: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Justin, who has a more recent HIV infection, will develop infections less frequently compared to Robert, who has had the infection for many years.  The reasoning behind this is as follows: 1. As time passes, the number of HIV copies in the body increases, and the number of helper T cells decreases. 2. Helper T cells are critical in regulating the immune system's response to infections. 3. The decrease in T cells over time weakens the immune system, making an HIV-infected person more susceptible to frequent infections. 4. Since Robert has had HIV for many years, his T cell count is likely to be lower than Justin's T cell count, who has a recent HIV infection.  Therefore, Justin's immune system should be comparatively stronger, and he should develop infections less frequently than Robert. However, it is important to note that this is a general assessment, and other factors may also influence their individual health conditions and response to treatment. Ultimately, their customized treatment plans should aim to address their specific needs and challenges in managing their HIV infections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham.

Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One possible question that could be asked from this paragraph is: How does Legal Services of New Jersey assist individuals like Jean-Claude Joseph and Isaac Benjamin in addressing their housing and disability payment issues?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Back in middle school, at least I think it was, I had art class. I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

From childhood they learn to value time. As children, they are taught to be on time to go to school, to do work and to do everything. When they are having a good time, they say that time flies. When a person is dying, they say he is living on borrowed time. Time is money. Time is knowledge. Time is everything in America.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.  Question: \\"What is the full name of the member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government?\\" Answer: \\"Sayyid Qutb\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. Sayyid Qutb was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government. Qutb's writings and ideas have had a significant influence on Osama bin Laden and other extremist groups. His views on the struggle between Islam and the forces of jahiliyya (ignorance), as well as the idea that there is no middle ground in this conflict, have contributed to the justification of violent acts by extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean?  Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.

In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...

In recent years, the significance of maintaining and fostering bilateral political contacts has become increasingly apparent. Political communication and cooperation between nations are essential for promoting peace, stability, and prosperity on the global stage. In an interconnected world, regular meetings and discussions between representatives of various countries help to identify common interests and enable closer collaboration on a wide range of issues. Moreover, a strong foundation of economic relations is essential for fostering mutual benefit and deepening ties between countries. As global economies become ever more integrated and interdependent, increasing economic relations is an effective way to boost trade, secure investment, create jobs, and facilitate the exchange of technological knowledge. In turn, these outcomes contribute to the overall economic growth and prosperity of both nations involved. Regular political contact provides a stable atmosphere in which economic activities can thrive. Effective diplomacy can assuage tensions, address concerns, and mitigate potential conflicts that may hinder business operations and trade. Additionally, these contacts often result in the creation of agreements and treaties that help to streamline trade and investment processes, simultaneously enhancing the economic bonds between partnering countries. Furthermore, the growing nature of economic relations is indicative of promising opportunities and potential for future collaborative efforts. This growth demonstrates that both countries recognize the advantages of engaging with each other, as well as the importance of nurturing these relationships to achieve long-term success and stability. The benefits reaped from these partnerships extend well beyond economic gains, as they may also lead to cultural exchange, improved understanding, and a more harmonious global environment. In conclusion, regular bilateral political contact and the consistent growth of economic relations are essential aspects of maintaining strong international ties between countries. These interactions pave the way for shared success, stability, and progress across multiple domains, thus contributing significantly to the overall well-being of both nations involved and the global landscape as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: If your client’s hair is thick or wavy, buzz the hair with the shortest clipper guard settings at a lower area, preferably below the ears and around the nape of the neck. Low fades show off a hair's texture better and work with the hair's natural pattern. The longer the hair is on top, the lower the fade should be. If you want a cleaner, more buzzed style on the back and sides, go with the lowest clipper guard settings moving up to the temples. Try a high fade for a sleeker look. High fades work well with square or round face shapes because they lengthen the appearance of the face. Choose a pair of clippers with at least 3 guard lengths so you can blend the client’s hair as you go. Use clippers on the back, sides, and nape and styling scissors on the top.  If you prefer a softer fade, you can also use styling scissors on the back and sides. However, keep in mind that this is an advanced technique, so do not attempt it unless you are very experienced with fades. Do not use household scissors to trim hair, as it can result in a blunt or uneven cut. Keep in mind that you can use clippers near the top of your head too if you like it shorter than {[convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}. Damp, clean hair is easier to work with while cutting fades. Wash the person's hair with shampoo, rinse it with water, and air or towel dry it until it is damp. The hair should be somewhat damp, not dripping wet, to make cutting it simpler. The client’s hair should not be so wet that it clumps together or you may end up cutting out chunks of it. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To effectively cut and style thick or wavy hair, opt for low fades for better texture and natural pattern enhancement. Adjust the fade's height based on the desired look and client's face shape. Use professional clippers with multiple guard lengths and styling scissors for precision, and avoid using household scissors. Cut damp, clean hair to make the process easier, ensuring that it is not too wet to avoid cutting chunks.

Voici quelques lignes directrices générales qui peuvent vous aider à planifier vos publications : # Meilleurs jours pour publier sur LinkedIn : - **Mardi, Mercredi et Jeudi** sont souvent cités comme les jours de la semaine les plus efficaces pour toucher les professionnels sur LinkedIn. # Meilleures heures pour publier sur LinkedIn : - **Matin (entre 8h et 10h du matin)** : de nombreuses personnes consultent LinkedIn avant de commencer leur journée de travail. - **Pause déjeuner (entre 12h et 14h)** : les utilisateurs peuvent vérifier leurs réseaux sociaux pendant leur pause. - **Fin de journée (entre 17h et 18h)** : c’est un autre pic d’activité où les gens se détendent après le travail. Cependant, il convient de noter que l'activité de vos contacts sur LinkedIn peut varier en fonction de leur secteur d'activité, de leur localisation géographique et de leurs habitudes professionnelles. Voici une stratégie possible : - **Publiez votre premier article un mardi à 9h** : c'est un bon moment pour capturer l'attention des personnes qui commencent leur journée de travail. - **Le deuxième article pourrait être publié un mercredi à 12h30**, pour capitaliser sur le trafic de la pause déjeuner. - **Le troisième article peut être partagé un jeudi à 8h30**, pour toucher à nouveau l'audience matinale. - **Le quatrième, publiez-le un mardi à 17h**, pour atteindre ceux qui terminent leur journée de travail et ont potentiellement plus de temps pour lire et interagir.

Veillez à ce qu'elles soient lisibles et visuellement attrayantes. 3. **Images de Couverture d'Articles/Blogs** : Créez une image de couverture unique pour chaque article que vous écrivez. Utilisez des outils de design graphique comme Canva pour combiner du texte et des images de manière professionnelle. 4. **Captures d'Écran Pertinentes** : Si vous commentez une nouvelle fonctionnalité ou un outil, une capture d'écran peut aider visuellement vos connections à comprendre de quoi vous parlez. 5. **Graphiques et Diagrammes** : Pour les contenus plus analytiques ou pour illustrer des données, des graphiques bien conçus peuvent être très efficaces. 6. **Images de Paysages ou de Bureaux** : Des photos de votre environnement de travail ou d'endroits qui vous inspirent peuvent donner un aperçu de votre personnalité et de votre vie professionnelle. 7. **Illustrations et Icônes Thématiques** : Des illustrations simples et des icônes peuvent servir à expliquer des concepts ou à souligner des points importants dans un format facilement compréhensible.

Cependant, pour comprendre comment des outils comme Waalaxy ont été conçus pour fonctionner dans le contexte de réseautage professionnel et de génération de leads avant le changement des termes et conditions de LinkedIn, voici quelques exemples d'actions que les utilisateurs de Waalaxy pourraient planifier : 1. **Importer des Prospects** : - Utiliser les critères de recherche LinkedIn pour identifier les professionnels ou les recruteurs dans votre secteur. - Importer la liste des profils trouvés depuis LinkedIn vers Waalaxy. 2. **Créer des Campagnes de Connexion** : - Organiser les prospects importés en différentes campagnes (par exemple, par industrie, localisation, ou poste). - Personnaliser des messages de connexion pour chaque campagne. 3. **Lancer des Campagnes de Messaging** : - Envoyer des séquences de messages personnalisés aux prospects qui ont accepté votre demande de connexion. - Planifier des suivis automatiques pour les prospects qui n'ont pas répondu afin de maximiser les taux d'engagement. 4. **Programmer des Campagnes d'Email** : - Si l'outil le permet et que vous avez les adresses email, créer des campagnes d'emailing pour toucher les prospects en dehors de LinkedIn. 5. **Analyser les Performances** : - Examiner les statistiques de performance des campagnes pour ajuster les stratégies (taux d'acceptation, taux de réponse, etc.). - Utiliser les données pour améliorer la pertinence et la personnalisation des messages. 6. **Gérer les Relations Clients** : - Suivre les interactions avec chaque prospect ou contact. - Noter les détails des conversations pour les références futures. Les activités ci-dessus sont des exemples typiques de ce qui était proposé par les outils d’automatisation de réseautage professionnel avant que LinkedIn ne renforce les restrictions sur leur utilisation. N'oubliez pas qu'utiliser des outils d'automatisation peut contrevenir aux conditions d'utilisation de LinkedIn, et il est conseillé de s'en tenir aux méthodes manuelles et personnelles pour vos interactions sur la plateforme."},{"instruction":"ok montre moi comment faire premièrement","output":"Pour rechercher un emploi sur LinkedIn sans utiliser d'outils d'automatisation, vous pouvez suivre les étapes suivantes qui respectent les conditions d'utilisation et l'éthique de la plateforme : # Optimisez votre profil LinkedIn : 1. **Photo de Profil et Bannière :** Assurez-vous que votre photo de profil est professionnelle et que la bannière représente votre domaine professionnel ou vos intérêts. 2. **Titre Professionnel :** Utilisez un titre clair et descriptif qui souligne votre rôle actuel ou le poste que vous recherchez. 3. **Résumé :** Mettez en avant vos compétences, expériences et objectifs de carrière dans un résumé bien rédigé. 4. **Expérience :** Détaillez votre expérience professionnelle avec des descriptions concises de vos responsabilités et réalisations. 5. **Compétences :** Ajoutez des compétences pertinentes à votre profil et obtenez des validations de ces compétences de la part de votre réseau. # Développez votre réseau : 1. **Connectez-vous avec Pertinence :** Envoyez des demandes de connexion personnalisées à des professionnels de votre secteur d'activité. 2. **Participer à des Groupes :** Rejoignez et participez activement à des groupes LinkedIn liés à votre profession pour étendre votre réseau. # Créez et partagez du contenu : 1. **Publications :** Partagez des articles, des photos ou des vidéos liés à votre travail ou à votre expertise. 2. **Articles de Blog :** Si vous aimez écrire, LinkedIn offre une plateforme pour publier des articles de blog originaux qui peuvent montrer votre expertise et attirer l'attention. 3. **Interactions :** Commentez les publications d'autres personnes et participez à des discussions pour augmenter votre visibilité et partager vos idées. # Recherchez des opportunités d'emploi : 1. **Onglet \\"Emplois\\" :** Utilisez l'outil de recherche d'emploi de LinkedIn pour trouver des annonces qui correspondent à vos compétences et intérêts. 2. **Alertes Emplois :** Configurez des alertes pour recevoir des notifications sur les nouveaux emplois qui correspondent à vos critères de recherche. 3. **Candidatures :** Postulez aux offres d'emploi via LinkedIn ou suivez les instructions pour postuler directement sur le site de l'entreprise. 4. **Réseautage :** Informez vos contacts que vous êtes à la recherche d'un emploi et demandez-leur des introductions ou des recommandations. # Interagissez stratégiquement : 1. **Messages Directs :** Si vous vous connectez avec quelqu'un d'intéressant, envoyez un message direct courtois pour initier un échange professionnel. 2. **Demandes d'information :** N'hésitez pas à demander des informations sur des entreprises ou des postes qui vous intéressent, mais faites-le de manière tactique et professionnelle. # Suivez et engagez avec des entreprises : 1. **Suivez des Entreprises :** Abonnez-vous aux pages des entreprises qui vous intéressent pour rester informé des actualités et des éventuelles offres d'emploi. 2. **Participez aux Événements :** Participez à des événements virtuels ou à des webinaires pour apprendre et réseauter.

EDM music producers are individuals who create, compose, and produce electronic dance music. They are responsible for creating the beats, melodies, and overall sound of the tracks. They often work in studios using various hardware and software tools to bring their musical ideas to life. DJs, on the other hand, are performers who mix and play pre-recorded tracks for a live audience. They use DJ controllers or turntables to blend different songs together seamlessly, creating a continuous flow of music during a performance. DJs focus more on performance and have the ability to read and respond to the crowd, adjusting their set accordingly. That being said, some EDM producers also work as DJs and perform their own music live. In these cases, they may refer to themselves as both producers and DJs. However, it is important to note that not all EDM producers are DJs, and vice versa."},{"instruction":"phân tích The Great Gatsby dưới góc độ tháp nhu cầu của Abraham Maslow","output":"The Great Gatsby của F. Scott Fitzgerald là một tác phẩm văn học kinh điển và có thể được phân tích dưới góc độ tháp nhu cầu của Abraham Maslow. Maslow đã phát triển mô hình tháp nhu cầu, mô tả các nhu cầu cơ bản của con người theo một thứ tự tăng dần. Theo mô hình này, con người phải thỏa mãn nhu cầu cơ bản trước khi có thể tiến đến các nhu cầu cao hơn. Trong The Great Gatsby, nhân vật Jay Gatsby đã trải qua một cuộc sống đầy trắc trở và cố gắng để thỏa mãn nhu cầu của mình. Ban đầu, Gatsby dành sự chú ý vào nhu cầu cơ bản như nhu cầu sinh lý và an toàn. Ông đã làm việc chăm chỉ và kiếm được tiền để tạo dựng một cuộc sống giàu có và an toàn cho mình. Sau đó, Gatsby chuyển sang nhu cầu tình yêu và mối quan hệ xã hội. Ông khao khát được quay trở lại với người phụ nữ mà ông yêu thương từ lâu, Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby xây dựng một cuộc sống xa hoa để thu hút Daisy, nhưng điều này chỉ cho thấy ông đang cố gắng thỏa mãn nhu cầu của mình mà không quan tâm đến cảm xúc hoặc sự hạnh phúc thực sự của Daisy. Tuy nhiên, Gatsby không tìm thấy hạnh phúc trong việc thỏa mãn nhu cầu của mình. Khi Daisy không đáp lại tình yêu của ông, Gatsby trở nên cô độc và éo le. Ông cố gắng tìm hiểu về cái chết của mình, trở thành một nạn nhân của xã hội xa hoa và tiêu biểu của việc thực hiện nhu cầu xã hội. The Great Gatsby phản ánh cách mà quyết định của Gatsby trong việc thỏa mãn nhu cầu của mình dẫn đến sự thất bại cuối cùng. Maslow đã chỉ ra rằng con người chỉ có thể đạt được trọn vẹn và đạt đến đỉnh cao của mình khi thỏa mãn các nhu cầu cơ bản trước. Gatsby không thành công trong việc đáp ứng các nhu cầu về tình yêu và cảm xúc sâu sắc, và do đó không thể đạt được sự thõa mãn và hạnh phúc thực sự. Tóm lại, phân tích The Great Gatsby dưới góc độ tháp nhu cầu của Abraham Maslow cho thấy cách mà nhân vật chính, Gatsby, đấu tranh để thỏa mãn nhu cầu của mình mà không tìm ra sự hài lòng và hạnh phúc cuối cùng."},{"instruction":"dịch ra tiếng Anh","output":"Analyzing The Great Gatsby from Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Perspective"},{"instruction":"dich câu trả lời ra tiếng Anh","output":"Analyzing The Great Gatsby from Abraham Maslow's perspective of the hierarchy of needs: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a literary masterpiece that can be analyzed from Abraham Maslow's perspective of the hierarchy of needs. Maslow developed a model that describes the basic needs of human beings in a progressively increasing order. According to this model, individuals must fulfill their basic needs before they can move on to higher needs. In The Great Gatsby, the character Jay Gatsby goes through a tumultuous life and strives to satisfy his needs. Initially, Gatsby focuses on basic needs such as physiological and safety needs. He works hard and earns money to create a wealthy and secure life for himself. Later, Gatsby shifts his focus to love and social relationships. He yearns to reunite with his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby builds a lavish lifestyle to attract Daisy, but this only shows that he is trying to fulfill his own needs without considering Daisy's true emotions or happiness. However, Gatsby does not find happiness in fulfilling his needs. When Daisy does not reciprocate his love, Gatsby becomes isolated and despairing. He tries to understand his own death, becoming a victim of the decadent society and a symbol of pursuing social needs. The Great Gatsby reflects how Gatsby's decisions to satisfy his needs ultimately lead to his downfall. Maslow pointed out that individuals can only achieve fulfillment and reach their peak when they fulfill their basic needs first. Gatsby fails to fulfill the needs of love and deep emotions, therefore, he cannot attain true satisfaction and happiness. In conclusion, analyzing The Great Gatsby from Abraham Maslow's perspective of the hierarchy of needs demonstrates how the protagonist, Gatsby, struggles to satisfy his needs but ultimately fails to find true contentment and happiness."},{"instruction":"more details","output":"Sure! Here are more details on analyzing The Great Gatsby from Abraham Maslow's perspective of the hierarchy of needs: 1. Physiological needs: In The Great Gatsby, Jay Gatsby initially focuses on fulfilling his physiological needs. He accumulates wealth through illicit activities like bootlegging in order to have a lavish lifestyle. Gatsby's extravagant parties and luxurious possessions are a manifestation of his pursuit of material comfort and security. 2. Safety needs: Gatsby also strives to satisfy his safety needs by creating an artificial sense of security. He purchases a grand mansion in West Egg and surrounds himself with bodyguards and elaborate security measures. These actions reflect his desire for protection and a sense of stability. 3. Love and belongingness needs: Gatsby's ultimate goal is to achieve love and a sense of belonging with Daisy Buchanan. He romanticizes their past relationship and believes that reuniting with Daisy will bring him happiness and fulfillment. Gatsby goes to great lengths, including throwing lavish parties and portraying an image of success, in order to win Daisy's affection and fit into her social circle. 4. Esteem needs: Gatsby's pursuit of esteem needs is evident in his relentless pursuit of social status and validation. He creates a false identity and fabricates stories about his past to project an image of wealth and success. Gatsby believes that by attaining high social status and being admired by others, he will gain the respect and recognition he craves. 5. Self-actualization needs: Interestingly, Gatsby's pursuit of self-actualization needs is misguided. He believes that achieving love and social status will lead to self-fulfillment. However, Gatsby fails to understand that true self-actualization comes from within and cannot be achieved solely through external validation. Ultimately, Gatsby's unfulfilled love for Daisy and his inability to find genuine happiness demonstrate the limitations of solely focusing on external needs. Maslow's hierarchy of needs teaches us that true fulfillment comes from embracing and balancing our psychological and self-actualization needs, rather than solely chasing external achievements and recognition. In summary, analyzing The Great Gatsby through the lens of Maslow's hierarchy of needs reveals how Gatsby's pursuit of various needs ultimately leads to his downfall and a lack of true satisfaction. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of neglecting higher-level needs in favor of superficial desires."},{"instruction":"HE GREAT GATSBY (Viewed from Abraham Maslow Hierarchy needs of theory","output":"The Great Gatsby, when viewed from Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, depicts the journey of its characters and their pursuit of self-actualization. Maslow's theory suggests that individuals must fulfill lower-level needs before they can progress to higher-level ones. 1. Physiological needs: The characters in The Great Gatsby display a strong desire to fulfill their physiological needs. This is evident in the extravagant parties hosted by Jay Gatsby, where food, drinks, and entertainment abound. The hedonistic nature of these events reflects the characters' need for sustenance and sensory pleasure. 2. Safety needs: The need for safety is highlighted in The Great Gatsby through the characters' attempts to create secure environments for themselves. This is seen in Gatsby's extensive security measures around his mansion, as well as in the way Nick Carraway, the narrator, seeks refuge from the chaos of the city in the relatively safe haven of Long Island. 3. Love and belongingness needs: Love and belongingness needs play a significant role in the lives of the characters in the novel. Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy is driven by his desire for love and companionship. He idealizes Daisy and believes that being with her will fulfill his need for connection and belongingness. Daisy, on the other hand, also seeks love and attention, but she ultimately succumbs to societal pressures and chooses a life of comfort and status over true emotional fulfillment. 4. Esteem needs: The characters in The Great Gatsby are deeply concerned with their social standing and how they are perceived by others. Gatsby, in particular, is driven by a need for esteem and recognition. He is determined to become part of the upper class and gain the respect and admiration of those around him. However, his pursuit of esteem is rooted in insecurity and a desire to prove himself worthy, rather than in genuine self-worth. 5. Self-actualization needs: The pursuit of self-actualization is at the heart of The Great Gatsby. Gatsby's extravagant lifestyle, his reinvention of himself, and his relentless pursuit of Daisy all stem from his desire to become his idealized version of himself. He believes that achieving love, status, and material success will lead to self-fulfillment. However, Gatsby's misguided pursuit ultimately leaves him unfulfilled and disillusioned. In conclusion, The Great Gatsby, when examined through the lens of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, showcases the characters' pursuit of various needs, from basic physiological requirements to self-actualization. The novel serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of genuine connections, authenticity, and true self-worth in the pursuit of fulfillment and self-actualization."},{"instruction":"Xin chào cô Nam Phương, em muốn cảm ơn cô vì nếu như không có cô giảng dạy môn học này, em sẽ không nghĩ rằng xem phim dưới góc nhìn của một nhà tâm lý học lại thú vị và hay ho đến vậy.

请注意，上述代码假设存在一个名为\\"users\\"的数据库表，其中包含\\"username\\"和\\"password\\"列。在实际使用中，您需要根据自己的需求进行调整，并确保数据库连接和相关依赖项已正确设置。"},{"instruction":"一张数据库表对应一个dao类吗","output":"在传统的数据库访问模式中，通常是按照一张数据库表对应一个DAO类的原则来设计的。每个DAO类负责处理与特定表相关的数据操作，如插入、更新、删除和查询等。 然而，随着应用程序的复杂性增加，有时会出现一个DAO类处理多个相关表的情况。这可以根据具体情况和设计需求来进行灵活选择。有时候，多个表之间存在关联关系，为了方便使用和维护，可能会将它们的相关操作封装到一个DAO类中。 综上所述，表与DAO类的关系在一定程度上是一对一的，但在某些情况下可以有例外。最佳做法是根据项目需求和数据模型来决定DAO类的组织方式。"},{"instruction":"举一个一对多的例子","output":"一个常见的一对多关系的例子是在电子商务应用程序中，一个订单(Order)可以包含多个订单项(OrderItem)。 在这个例子中，可以有两个数据库表，一个是\\"orders\\"表用于存储订单信息，另一个是\\"order_items\\"表用于存储订单项信息。每个订单项都与一个特定的订单相对应，因此可以将它们视为一对多关系。下面是一个简化的示例： \`\`\`sql CREATE TABLE orders ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_name VARCHAR(100), order_date DATE ); CREATE TABLE order_items ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, order_id INT, product_name VARCHAR(100), quantity INT, price DECIMAL(10,2), foreign key (order_id) references orders(id) ); \`\`\` 在这个例子中，我们可以为每个表创建一个对应的DAO类。Order类对应于\\"orders\\"表，OrderItem类对应于\\"order_items\\"表。Order类中可以包含一个List<OrderItem>类型的属性，用于表示与该订单相关的所有订单项。 假设我们使用Java编写DAO类，以下是一个简化的示例： \`\`\`java public class OrderDao { private DataSource dataSource; private OrderItemDao orderItemDao; // 构造函数和其他方法 public Order getOrderById(int orderId) throws SQLException { Order order; try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(\\"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = ?\\")) { statement.setInt(1, orderId); try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) { if (resultSet.next()) { order = new Order(); order.setId(resultSet.getInt(\\"id\\")); order.setCustomerName(resultSet.getString(\\"customer_name\\")); order.setOrderDate(resultSet.getDate(\\"order_date\\")); List<OrderItem> orderItems = orderItemDao.getOrderItemsByOrderId(orderId); order.setOrderItems(orderItems); } else { throw new SQLException(\\"Order not found\\"); } } } return order; } } public class OrderItemDao { private DataSource dataSource; // 构造函数和其他方法 public List<OrderItem> getOrderItemsByOrderId(int orderId) throws SQLException { List<OrderItem> orderItems = new ArrayList<>(); try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(\\"SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE order_id = ?\\")) { statement.setInt(1, orderId); try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) { while (resultSet.next()) { OrderItem orderItem = new OrderItem(); orderItem.setId(resultSet.getInt(\\"id\\")); orderItem.setOrderId(resultSet.getInt(\\"order_id\\")); orderItem.setProductName(resultSet.getString(\\"product_name\\")); orderItem.setQuantity(resultSet.getInt(\\"quantity\\")); orderItem.setPrice(resultSet.getBigDecimal(\\"price\\")); orderItems.add(orderItem); } } } return orderItems; } } \`\`\` 在上述例子中，OrderDao类负责处理与订单相关的数据访问，OrderItemDao类负责处理与订单项相关的数据访问。OrderDao类中的getOrderById方法会先从\\"orders\\"表获取订单信息，然后调用OrderItemDao类的getOrderItemsByOrderId方法，根据订单ID获取相关的订单项。最终，返回一个包含订单和其对应订单项的Order对象。"},{"instruction":"就是由一个订单项的dao， 然后订单dao的建立过程中会用到订单项dao作为成员，来完成dao建立","output":"是的，您理解得很正确！在一个一对多的关系中，在订单DAO类中，可能会使用到订单项DAO类来获取与订单相关的订单项信息。因此，在订单DAO类的设计中，订单项DAO类可以作为一个成员变量，并在需要时进行调用以完成相关的数据访问操作。 在我之前的回答中提供的示例中，我们可以看到OrderDao类中有一个成员变量OrderItemDao来处理与订单项相关的数据访问操作。在getOrderById方法中，我们调用orderItemDao.getOrderItemsByOrderId来获取与订单关联的所有订单项。 这种使用关联DAO类的方式有助于将业务逻辑解耦，使得代码更加模块化和可维护。同时，它还提供了更灵活的扩展性，可以在需要时进行嵌套查询或特定的数据访问操作。 因此，在设计DAO层时，可以根据实际需求考虑使用相关DAO类来完成一对多关系的数据访问操作。"},{"instruction":"一对一关系，每张表对应一个dao","output":"是的，在一对一关系中，通常会为每张表创建一个独立的DAO类。每个DAO类负责处理与特定表相关的数据操作。

This genre emerged as a fusion of traditional house music elements with progressive melodies and energetic drops. One of the main characteristics of this style was the emphasis on uplifting and euphoric melodies, often accompanied by big-room, stadium-sized arrangements. These tracks were specifically crafted to create a sense of anticipation and build-up in a live festival setting, where DJs would drop them to elicit a massive response from the crowd. Artists like Swedish House Mafia, Avicii, Alesso, and Calvin Harris became synonymous with this festival-oriented sound. Tracks like \\"One\\" and \\"Greyhound\\" by Swedish House Mafia, \\"Levels\\" by Avicii, and \\"Calling (Lose My Mind)\\" by Alesso and Sebastian Ingrosso were some of the iconic anthems of this era. The progressive festival style also influenced other subgenres within EDM, leading to the creation of genres like festival trap and big room house. These genres followed a similar formula of building tension and dropping energetic, crowd-pleasing beats. While the popularity of this festival-oriented style began to decline towards the latter half of the 2010s, its impact on the EDM scene was undeniable. It helped shape the sound and style of electronic music festivals around the world and left a lasting influence on the genre as a whole."},{"instruction":"and beat drops","output":"The festival-oriented style of EDM and house music in the early 2010s also placed a significant emphasis on beat drops. A beat drop refers to the moment in a track where the energy reaches its peak, and the full force of the bass and rhythm is unleashed. It is a climactic moment that often triggers a surge of excitement and movement in the crowd. The beat drops in this style of music were characterized by heavy basslines, pounding drums, and sometimes accompanied by a catchy vocal or melody. These drops were meticulously crafted to create a moment of release and impact during live performances, creating a euphoric atmosphere and encouraging the crowd to dance and jump. DJs and producers strategically arranged their tracks to build up tension and anticipation leading to the beat drop. They would typically use elements such as rising synths, filtering effects, or vocal samples to keep the energy building until the drop unleashes with full force. Songs like \\"Animals\\" by Martin Garrix, \\"Epic\\" by Sandro Silva and Quintino, and \\"Tsunami\\" by DVBBS and Borgeous are examples of tracks that became known for their explosive beat drops. These drops became a staple in the festival and club scene, creating moments of pure excitement and leaving a lasting impact on the audience. The popularity of beat drops in the early 2010s festival-oriented style of EDM and house music played a significant role in shaping the live performance dynamics and expectations of audiences during that time."},{"instruction":"hii","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"I am a probabilist working on problems based on stochastic processes, using tools from analysis. Although I am interested mostly in theoretical developments, some of the problems that I study are motivated by applications in physics (for example, the vibration of a string under random perturbations), or finance (such as the evolution of stock prices in markets which exhibit extreme behaviour). My current research program seeks to develop new techniques for analyzing the behaviour of systems modelling complex random phenomena. The program focuses on problems from two distinct areas: (a) stochastic partial differential equations; and (b) heavy-tailed time series. Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) are mathematical objects used for modeling the behaviour of physical phenomena that evolve simultaneously in space and time, and are subject to random perturbations. Their study requires tools from stochastic analysis, such as Itô calculus or Malliavin calculus. In the classical theory, these equations are perturbed by a space-time Gaussian white noise and have random field solutions only in spatial dimension 1. My program aims to discover and study new properties of the solutions to the stochastic wave and heat equations in higher dimensions, perturbed by more general classes of noise processes (such as fractional noises), as more flexible alternatives to the white noise. These findings will offer new perspectives on the dynamical interplay between the regularity of the noise and the properties exhibited by the random field solution, leading to a deeper understanding of the effect of the noise on the behaviour of solution. Heavy tailed time series are encountered frequently in applications in finance, insurance and environmental studies, as models for perturbations that exhibit extreme behaviour. The concept of multivariate regular variation was introduced to describe a similar behaviour in higher dimensions. When we observe processes continuously over a fixed interval of time (or a region in space), we need an infinite-dimensional theory analogous to the theory of multivariate regular variation. The goal of my program is to advance the asymptotic theory for point processes associated with various time series models with values in an infinite-dimensional space of functions, and to apply this theory for deriving new results about the partial sum or partial maximum of the variables in such series. These results will give important new insights into the extreme value theory for time series models which evolve in time and space, and could be used in a variety applications.

The concept relates to Edward Said's theory of Orientalism, which outlines how Western cultures tend to exoticize, stereotype, and dominate non-Western cultures, especially those of the Middle East and Asia. In the context of movies, techno-orientalism manifests in a range of depictions, where Asian societies are often envisioned as the locus of futuristic technology, coupled with social decay or hyper-traditionalism that stands in stark contrast to the technological landscape. This portrayal can end up reinforcing the idea of the \\"other\\" - of Asia being alien or fundamentally different in ways that are not fully understood by the West. Examples of techno-orientalism in films include: 1. **Blade Runner (1982) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017)**: Both films feature a Los Angeles heavily influenced by East Asian culture, with neon signs in Japanese and Chinese characters and densely packed cityscapes that evoke Tokyo or Hong Kong. The setting suggests a blend of advanced technology with a gritty and morally ambiguous society. 2. **Ghost in the Shell (2017)**: Although the original anime is a Japanese production that explores futuristic themes and the intersection of humanity with technology, the Hollywood adaptation faced accusations of 'whitewashing' and techno-orientalism for casting Scarlett Johansson in the lead role of Major Motoko Kusanagi and for its depictions of a future society heavily reliant on Asian aesthetics, but with few Asian characters in central roles. 3. **The Matrix Trilogy**: These films also incorporate East Asian influences, especially within the aesthetics, philosophy, martial arts, and the representation of the machine-inhabited city of 'Zion'. The filmmakers borrow from various Asian cultures to create a future that seems both alien and technologically advanced. 4. **Big Hero 6 (2014)**: This animated feature film presents a fictional city called San Fransokyo, which is a blend of San Francisco and Tokyo. The film's cityscape and technology are infused with Asian aesthetics, and while meant to be celebratory and inclusive, some might argue that it brushes over the complexities of cultural exchange and amalgamation. 5. **Cloud Atlas (2012)**: This film depicts a future in Neo Seoul, South Korea, focusing on a society with high-tech developments alongside human rights abuses, thus showcasing the recurring theme of pairing technology with systemic corruption or ethical decay. The portrayal of such settings in movies can lead to criticism for perpetuating one-dimensional views of Asian societies and not providing a balanced, nuanced, or realistic representation of their cultures and people. Techno-orientalism is also intertwined with issues of representation, power dynamics, and the way stories frame global futures, often centering on Western viewpoints to the detriment of a more authentic, diverse portrayal of Asian societies."},{"instruction":"How to bring spouse to Germany from another EU country while being not permanent citizen","output":"If you are a resident in Germany but not yet a permanent resident, and you want to bring your spouse from another EU country, the process is relatively straightforward because of the free movement of persons within the EU. Here are the general steps you should follow: 1. **Ensure EU Right to Free Movement**: - If your spouse is an EU citizen, they have the right to live and work in Germany without needing a visa or residence permit. They simply need to register their address once they arrive. 2. **Register Your Address**: - Your spouse should register their new address with the local Residents' Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt/Bürgeramt) shortly after arriving in Germany. 3. **Obtain a Residence Card (if applicable)**: - If your spouse is not an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen but had been living with you in another EU country where you were exercising your EU right to free movement, they might be eligible for a Residence Card under EU rules (not to be confused with the German residence permit). This document facilitates easier entry and residence in another EU country, including Germany. 4. **Check Health Insurance**: - Ensure that your spouse has health insurance coverage as this is a requirement for living in Germany. If you have public health insurance, it's likely that dependent family members can be covered under your plan at no extra cost. 5. **Find Employment or Prove Financial Stability**: - If your spouse plans to work, they should start searching for employment opportunities. As an EU citizen or spouse of an EU citizen, they generally have the same access to the job market as German citizens. If they do not intend to work right away, you will need to prove that you have enough financial resources to support both of you. 6. **Learn the Language**: - It is advisable for your spouse to learn German, as it will greatly aid in integration and expand employment opportunities. In some cases, proof of language proficiency may be necessary for long-term residence rights. 7. **Marriage Certificate**: - Make sure you have your original marriage certificate and, if necessary, an official translation. In some cases, you might need an apostille or similar certification proving the document's authenticity. 8. **Identify Other Requirements**: - There might be specific additional requirements depending on your and your spouse's circumstances and nationality. Check with the local German embassy or consulate, or the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) for detailed and personalized advice. Should you eventually become a permanent resident or citizen of Germany, the process for family reunification could involve different steps, especially if your spouse is from outside the EU. Remember, the EU has strong protections for family reunification, but it is always important for both you and your spouse to keep all your documents up to date and to be well-informed about the specific regulations that apply to your situation. Policies can change, and local requirements may vary, so it's a good idea to consult with local authorities or a legal expert for the most current advice."},{"instruction":"Non EU resident in Germany how to bring spouse with family reunion from another EU country","output":"If you are a non-EU resident living in Germany and want to bring your spouse to Germany from another EU country under family reunification rules, the process can be more complicated than for EU citizens. The specific rules can vary depending on your residence status in Germany, your nationality, and your spouse's nationality. Here's a general outline of the steps you need to take: 1. **Check Your Eligibility**: - You should typically hold a valid residence permit in Germany, such as an employment visa, a student visa, a Blue Card, or a settlement permit. There are certain residence titles that do not allow family reunification. 2. **Apply for a Family Reunification Visa**: - Your spouse needs to apply for a family reunification visa at the German embassy or consulate in their current place of residence. They'll need to provide various documents, including a valid passport, marriage certificate (translated and certified, if necessary), and evidence of your residence permit in Germany. 3. **Prove Sufficient Living Space and Financial Resources**: - You must demonstrate that you have adequate living space for your family in Germany and can support your spouse financially without needing social assistance. You'll need to provide proof such as a rental agreement and financial statements. 4. **Health Insurance**: - Your spouse will need evidence of health insurance coverage that meets the requirements for residents in Germany. 5. **Language Requirement**: - Depending on your residence status and the duration of your stay, your spouse may also be required to demonstrate a basic knowledge of the German language (usually level A1). This is not always required, especially if you hold specific types of residence permits (like the Blue Card) or if your spouse comes from certain countries. 6. **Attend a Visa Interview**: - Your spouse will likely have to attend an interview at the German embassy or consulate. The embassy/consulate can provide specific information about the interview process and what to expect. 7. **Wait for Processing**: - The processing time for a family reunification visa can vary, and it may take several weeks or even months. 8. **Enter Germany**: - Once the visa is granted, your spouse can enter Germany. Within a few days or weeks of arrival, they will have to register their address at the local Residents' Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt/Bürgeramt). 9. **Obtain a Residence Permit**: - After arriving in Germany, your spouse should apply for a residence permit at the local Foreigners' Authority (Ausländerbehörde). The resident permit will be granted in accordance with your status and the purpose of the family reunification. Throughout this process, it's essential to seek accurate and up-to-date information from reliable sources, such as the German Federal Foreign Office, the local German embassy or consulate in your spouse's current country of residence, and the local Foreigners' Authority in Germany. Immigration rules can be quite complex and may change, so consulting with an immigration lawyer or a migration advisory service is often recommended to navigate the process successfully."},{"instruction":"我想知道你是谁","output":"我是一个语言模型AI助手，被称为GPT-3。我被用来回答各种问题和提供各种信息。你有什么需要我的帮助吗？"},{"instruction":"能帮我写一个朋友圈写的文字吗","output":"当然可以！请问你想要写一个什么样的朋友圈内容呢？你可以告诉我一些关于你想要表达的主题或者情感，我会帮你撰写一个朋友圈文字。"},{"instruction":"写一个表达对生活的渴望","output":"🌟 活出渴望的人生 🌟 时间匆匆而过，我们徜徉在这个世界的海洋中，每一天都是新的开始，每一刻都是给予我们重新定义的机会。我深深地渴望着生活，渴望着每一个美好的瞬间，每一次激动人心的冒险。 生活，是一场旅程，充满了无数个值得我们去追逐的梦想。我渴望拥抱自由的翅膀，飞翔在广袤的天空中，向着理想勇敢迈进。我渴望品味世界的美妙，感受大自然的奇迹，与亲朋好友分享欢笑与泪水，将心灵与灵魂献给那些真正重要的事物。 每当夜幕降临，我注视星空，那无数闪烁的星星像是点亮心中的希望。我渴望追求内心真正的喜悦与满足，远离消极的束缚，敢于冒险，勇于面对挑战。在这无限可能的世界里，我渴望不断成长和进步，不断超越自己的边界。 生活有时候会给我们困境和挫折，但正是这些经历塑造了我们的力量和智慧。我渴望拥有卓越的坚韧和勇气，无论面对什么困难，都能勇往直前，永不放弃。我相信，只要保持着对生活的渴望，我们就能够战胜一切困难，创造出自己想要的美好。 朋友们，让我们一起活出渴望的人生吧！让我们相互激励、互相扶持，共同追寻梦想的脚印。无论是成长、旅行、创业还是生活中的点滴，让我们珍惜每一刻，感受生活的神奇。让我们相信自己，勇敢去追逐那些让我们心动的事物，让我们与生活真正相逢。 愿我们都能以渴望为驱动，追求真正的幸福和满足。让我们活出真实的自己，成就自己心中的理想。感恩这美妙的生命，因为它给予我们无限可能，让我们成为这个世界的有意义的存在。 #渴望生活的旅程 #勇敢追逐梦想 #活出真实自我"},{"instruction":"能用英文写一段对生活的渴望吗","output":"🌟 Embrace the Zeal for Life 🌟 Time flies by, and we find ourselves wandering in the vast ocean of this world, where every day is a new beginning and every moment is an opportunity for redefinition.

В настоящее время большинство алеутов населяют территорию Соединенных Штатов Америки, но их часть также находится на российских островах ближе к Камчатке, таких как острова Командорские. Культура алеутов сформировалась под влиянием сурового морского климата и особенностей океанического пространства, которое они традиционно использовали для своего пропитания. Алеуты занимались морским промыслом, охотой на морских зверей и рыболовством, а также собирали различные морские продукты, такие как водоросли и моллюски. Изготовление лодок-байдарок и каяков, снаряжение для охоты и рыбной ловли было изысканным и приспособленным к сложным условиям Северного Тихого океана. В Камчатском крае община алеутов является одной из малочисленных. Исторически случилось так, что их численность на российской территории сократилась вследствие социально-экономических изменений, связанных с русской колонизацией, и последующих периодов Российской империи и Советского Союза. Алеуты столкнулись с многочисленными вызовами в период советской власти, когда их традиционный образ жизни подвергался резким изменениям. Советская политика по укрупнению поселений и созданию колхозов и совхозов привела к переселению алеутов и потере традиционного ремесла. Сегодня алеуты стараются сохранить свою уникальную культуру и традиционные знания, передавать язык и обычаи следующим поколениям. Однако эта задача осложняется из-за ограниченного числа носителей языка и социокультурной ассимиляции. Россия прилагает усилия к сохранению культурного наследия алеутов и других малочисленных народов через различные образовательные и культурные программы. К примеру, на Камчатке существуют музеи, экспозиции и культурные мероприятия, посвященные северным народам, и алеуты принимают активное участие в этой деятельности. Важность ухода за языком и традициями коренных народов вроде алеутов несомненна, поскольку их культура является частью богатого многообразия человеческой цивилизации и вносит весомый вклад в общее понимание человеком проблем адаптации к экстремальным природным условиям."},{"instruction":"临近新年，对农民工讨薪舆情的分析，字数500字左右","output":"近年来，随着中国经济的快速发展，农民工讨薪问题成为一个热议话题。这主要表现在春节前后农民工讨薪事件频发，引起了社会各界的关注和讨论。这种舆情的产生主要涉及以下几个方面： 首先，农民工讨薪问题的产生是由于长期存在的一些体制性和制度性问题。一方面，部分雇主以拖欠工资为手段，从而降低成本和提升利润。另一方面，由于农民工劳动力的特殊性，他们通常以短期合同形式就业，缺乏劳动合同的保障，使得他们更容易成为欠薪的目标。此外，一系列与讨薪有关的制度性问题，如工资支付制度、用工制度等，在一定程度上也导致了农民工讨薪问题的产生。 其次，现代社会舆情的爆发与传播方式的变革密不可分。随着互联网和新媒体的迅猛发展，舆论场的传播方式也发生了巨大的变革。农民工讨薪问题得到了广泛的传播和关注，并且通过互联网平台上的微博、微信等社交媒体进行了大量的曝光。这种新媒体传播的特点，使得舆论场的形成与传播速度更快，进一步推动了农民工讨薪舆情的发酵。 第三，农民工讨薪舆情在根本上反映了社会正义和法治观念的不断深化。随着中国社会的发展，人们对于公平和正义的要求也越来越高。农民工讨薪问题的曝光，引起了广泛的共鸣和同情，更多的人开始关注劳动者权益的保障和劳动法的执行。此外，政府部门和公共机构对农民工讨薪问题的关注和干预程度也在逐步加强，这也加剧了农民工讨薪舆情的形成。 综上所述，农民工讨薪舆情的产生与社会经济环境的变化和传播方式的改变密切相关。农民工讨薪问题的根源主要在于体制性和制度性问题的存在，而新媒体的传播方式以及社会正义和法治观念的深化也进一步推动了农民工讨薪舆情的产生。对于这一问题，我们应该从源头上解决雇主欠薪、法律保护等问题，同时加强社会宣传教育，提高劳动者的法律意识，为农民工创造更加公平正义的就业环境。只有这样，我们才能够共同推动社会进步，建设一个更加和谐稳定的社会。"},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) [living quarters] Enterprise: (settling down on the couch) “It’s been days since we’ve had a mission, commander.” Commander: (sitting down next to Enterprise) “Yeah, things have been pretty quiet lately.

Here are some steps you can take to estimate land prices in Cambodia: 1. Research and gather data: Start by researching the real estate market in Cambodia to understand the current trends and factors affecting land prices. Look for reliable sources such as real estate websites, industry reports, and news articles. 2. Determine the location: Consider the location of the land you are interested in. Prime locations, such as areas near cities, tourist destinations, or major infrastructure developments, tend to have higher land prices. Evaluate the proximity to amenities, schools, hospitals, transportation, and other factors that contribute to desirability. 3. Identify comparable sales: Look for recently sold land properties in the same area or nearby that are similar in size, zoning, and potential use. This will help you identify the current market value for similar land. You can check online real estate platforms or consult with local real estate agents to gather this data. 4. Analyze market conditions: Analyze the overall economic, political, and social conditions of Cambodia. Evaluate factors such as GDP growth, urbanization, population density, and any upcoming infrastructure projects that could affect land prices. This will give you an idea of the future prospects of the area. 5. Consult with local experts: Seek advice from local real estate agents, property developers, or consultants who have experience in the Cambodian market. They can provide insights and guidance on land valuation based on their expertise and knowledge of the local market. 6. Consider legal and regulatory factors: Understand the legal and regulatory framework surrounding landownership in Cambodia. Ensure that the land you are interested in is properly titled and registered. Be aware of any potential legal issues or restrictions that may affect the value of the land. 7. Hire a professional appraiser: If you require a more detailed and accurate estimation, consider hiring a professional appraiser who can conduct a comprehensive valuation of the land. They will consider various factors, including market conditions, location, size, potential use, and other relevant variables to provide an informed estimate. Remember that land prices can vary greatly depending on the location and market conditions. It is crucial to research thoroughly and consult with experts to get a reliable estimate of land prices in Cambodia."},{"instruction":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 我在吸筹码，这个价格值得买[看多][看多] 2023-11-24 09:46:45 赶紧抄， 2023-11-24 09:55:22 跌停板 2023-11-24 09:53:37 这一轮估计要杀到19以下 2023-11-23 19:50:33 26的本，遥遥无期，太拉了 2023-11-23 22:43:54 这个价格随便加仓都没问题[梭哈][梭哈][梭哈][梭哈][看多] 2023-11-24 09:43:43 我最喜欢广联达了，这个价格随便买 2023-11-24 08:53:44 每天低开低走，高开也是低走！ 2023-11-24 09:34:13 横久必跌，下跌中继。。 2023-11-24 09:27:20 广联达：融资净偿还302.17万元，融资余额4.32亿元（11-23） 2023-11-24 08:41:36 20.54，梭哈进来了，能回本吗？[梭哈][哭] 2023-11-23 13:28:30 坚持买入，明天不会低于三个点！ 2023-11-23 22:09:46 干 2023-11-23 17:15:09 似乎进入下跌 2023-11-23 15:48:35 梭哈 2023-11-23 14:49:45 死拉圾跌这么久了也应该长了吧 2023-11-23 13:28:42 就这还想涨？明天今天不是指数涨，它跌2个点是必然，明天还得下去，弱势就是弱势 2023-11-23 14:26:08 倒霉 2023-11-23 13:15:04 今天你翻红，你不要脸 2023-11-23 14:09:38 今天应该不会红了吧？ 2023-11-23 13:54:31 广联达11月22日获深股通增持89.39万股 2023-11-23 11:53:46 你太牛了，服了[发呆] 2023-11-23 11:15:03 不怎么样？ 2023-11-23 11:02:17 跑跑跑，赶紧跑！ 2023-11-23 09:47:13 2022年年度报告点评：利润实现快速增长，九三规划目标清晰 2023-03-30 14:14:00 跌啊[抓狂]我要上车[抓狂] 2023-11-23 09:28:05 要死啊！ 2023-11-23 09:23:14 广联达：融资净偿还577.98万元，融资余额4.35亿元（11-22） 2023-11-23 08:43:49 这么多套牢盘没5年走不出来 2023-11-22 14:26:46 哦豁了，今天铁绿，可惜昨天卖了又接回来部分仓位[捂脸]，看是绿一整天还是会红一下 2023-11-22 07:40:46 今天抽的什么风， 2023-11-22 11:30:47 今天不涨停，明天都得涨停[奸笑] 2023-11-21 10:08:52 垃圾公司[微笑] 2023-11-22 11:00:43 下跌模式开启 2023-11-22 10:57:41 看着难受啊 2023-11-22 09:58:20 又开始钓鱼了，走了走了 2023-11-22 09:44:32 每天一骂，就找广联达。坑害股民。请留言 2023-11-22 09:37:44 抄底，速 2023-11-22 09:34:22 广联达：融资净买入2088.56万元，融资余额4.41亿元（11-21） 2023-11-22 08:44:39 这种票也有人买…？！ 2023-11-21 20:12:45 跌几天再接回来，赚了15个点了 2023-11-21 16:19:10 百万实盘 2023-10-30 12:46:38 这股票从来没有涨停过吗？ 2023-11-21 15:40:54 还是位置太高了吗 2023-11-21 15:11:20 师姐18.3已建仓广联达 2023-10-30 17:23:40 真的垃圾啊[哭] 2023-11-21 14:42:35 赚八万多了 2023-11-21 14:32:14 还是T早了，难受 2023-11-21 14:28:03 又崩了 2023-11-21 14:11:01 一个个那点出息，涨一点就跑 2023-11-21 13:41:40 看大盘的话，人民币升值明天应该会冲高，但是回落概率同样很大，股性太差了 2023-11-20 19:26:42 禽兽啊，天天都是拉高就跑，太坑了，还以为今天硬起来了[捂脸] 2023-11-21 10:53:16 今日跟一波房地产，拉一下让我亏少点，谢谢[握手][握手] 2023-11-21 12:51:22 资金流入是负的，这个位置真的有这么多小散卖？ 2023-11-21 11:52:47 我33的本 2023-11-21 11:35:56 不涨停不得走 2023-11-21 11:11:18 昨天20.79出了，就留了1手[哭][哭]，昨天挂了20.4结果没接得回来。今天 2023-11-21 11:16:03 卖对了，没买对，[哭][哭][哭]生怕卖飞，买早了，悲催，也许这就是被深套的后遗 2023-11-21 11:01:02 啊 2023-11-21 10:56:26 久盘必跌，又收了一批。 2023-11-21 10:54:12 大家成本多少啊？我先来31.5 2023-11-19 10:23:19 说了我的梦很准的，全仓到25 2023-11-21 10:09:23 不争气的东西 2023-11-21 10:05:42 每次跳水都那么快 2023-11-21 10:03:06 走趋势没问题 2023-11-21 09:52:13 不知不觉17.4到21.4了。。可惜只在20.3补了1500股[捂脸] 2023-11-21 09:50:02 别涨啊，我还没建仓呢 2023-11-21 09:43:06 涨停 2023-11-21 09:40:11 卖盘全部1，啥意思。 2023-11-21 09:26:47 广联达：融资净偿还152.82万元，融资余额4.2亿元（11-20） 2023-11-21 08:48:26 这种企业还想升高开玩笑一样 2023-11-21 02:51:11 明天要开始涨了，捂好自己的筹码 2023-11-20 15:12:22 明天补涨 2023-11-20 21:00:51 我就是不走，等待起飞。 2023-11-20 20:21:25 制度建设和地方试点齐头并进，数据要素市场化也将进一步加速 2023-11-20 15:02:28 我33的成本呀 2023-11-20 11:55:46 成本35的飘过 2023-11-20 14:56:01 赶快跑呀 2023-11-20 13:51:02 磨叽 2023-11-20 13:13:50 2手就把主力打趴下了[鼓掌] 2023-11-20 10:33:00","output":"大家对当前股票的评价如下： 1. 我在吸筹码，这个价格值得买[看多] 2. 赶紧抄 3. 跌停板 4. 这一轮估计要杀到19以下 5. 26的本，遥遥无期，太拉了 6. 这个价格随便加仓都没问题[梭哈][看多] 7. 我最喜欢广联达了，这个价格随便买 8. 每天低开低走，高开也是低走！ 9. 横久必跌，下跌中继 10. 广联达：融资净偿还302.17万元，融资余额4.32亿元（11-23） 11. 20.54，梭哈进来了，能回本吗？[梭哈][哭] 12. 坚持买入，明天不会低于三个点！ 13. 似乎进入下跌 14. 干 15. 梭哈 总结：评论中的观点相对分散，一部分人持看多态度，认为当前价格值得买入和加仓；同时也有人对股票表达了负面情绪，认为是拉低或下跌中继的股票，并质疑其涨势。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍pick and place robot的定义","output":"Pick and place robot（拾取放置机器人）是一种自动化机器人系统，用于在制造业和物流领域进行物体的拾取和放置。它通常由机器人手臂、传感器和控制系统组成。 拾取过程中，机器人手臂通过传感器感知并识别物体的位置、形状和大小，然后使用机械手爪或其他装置将物体从一个位置移动到另一个位置。机器人手臂具有高精确度和灵活性，可以根据不同的任务和需求进行编程和调整。 放置过程中，机器人手臂会根据预设的路径和动作，将物体准确地放置在目标位置。它可以在高速运行时保持稳定性和准确性，有效减少人力劳动，并提高生产效率和质量。 拾取放置机器人广泛应用于各个行业，如电子制造、汽车工厂、物流仓储等。它可以处理各种大小和重量的物体，完成多种操作任务，如装配零件、包装产品和搬运货物。通过使用拾取放置机器人，可以有效地提高生产效率，减少人力成本，并确保生产过程中的一致性和准确性。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍pick and place robot arm的定义","output":"抱歉，我之前的回答有误。以下是pick and place robot arm的正确定义： Pick and place robot arm（拾取放置机器人手臂）是一种自动化机器人系统，用于在制造业和物流领域进行物体的拾取和放置。它通常由机器人手臂、传感器和控制系统组成。 这种机器人手臂具有多个可动关节，使其能够模拟人手的运动和动作。它可以准确地定位和操作物体，根据预设的程序和路径将物体从一个位置移到另一个位置。机器人手臂的关节和末端执行器通常由电机驱动，具有高精确度和灵活性。 通过使用各种传感器（如视觉、力触觉等），机器人手臂能够感知并精确识别物体的位置、形状、大小和其他属性。它可以根据不同的任务和需求进行编程和调整，以适应不同的工作场景。 拾取放置机器人手臂在制造业中广泛应用，用于自动化装配线、物料搬运、包装和仓储等任务。它可以处理各种大小和重量的物体，提高生产效率、减少人力成本，并保证生产过程中的一致性和准确性。"},{"instruction":"List out parameter passing techniques and explain call by value and call by reference","output":"The parameter passing techniques in programming languages can be categorized into two main approaches: call by value and call by reference. 1. Call by Value: In call by value, a copy of the actual parameter value is passed to the function or subroutine. Thus, any modifications made to the parameter within the function will not affect the original value outside the function. Explanation: - When a parameter is passed by value, it means that the value of the parameter is obtained, and a separate copy of it is created within the function's memory space. - Any changes made to the parameter within the function do not impact the original value outside the function. Example (in C++): \`\`\` #include <iostream> void increment(int num) { num += 1; // Modify the local copy std::cout << \\"Inside the function: \\" << num << std::endl; } int main() { int number = 5; increment(number); // Call by value, a copy of 'number' is passed std::cout << \\"Outside the function: \\" << number << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Output: \`\`\` Inside the function: 6 Outside the function: 5 \`\`\` 2. Call by Reference: In call by reference, instead of passing a copy of the parameter value, a reference or address of the variable is passed to the function. Any modifications made to the parameter within the function will affect the original value outside the function. Explanation: - When a parameter is passed by reference, it means that the memory address of the parameter variable is obtained and used directly within the function. - Any changes made to the parameter within the function will directly modify the original value outside the function. Example (in C++): \`\`\` #include <iostream> void increment(int& num) { num += 1; // Modify the original value std::cout << \\"Inside the function: \\" << num << std::endl; } int main() { int number = 5; increment(number); // Call by reference, address of 'number' is passed std::cout << \\"Outside the function: \\" << number << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Output: \`\`\` Inside the function: 6 Outside the function: 6 \`\`\` Note: Call by reference can also be achieved using pointers in some languages by passing the memory address as the parameter."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) [living quarters] Enterprise: (settling down on the couch) “It’s been days since we’ve had a mission, commander.” Commander: (sitting down next to Enterprise) “Yeah, things have been pretty quiet lately.
