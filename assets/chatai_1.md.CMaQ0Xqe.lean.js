--- 阳光穿过轻纱的窗帘，撒在温暖而略显狭小的客厅里，将房间染上一抹柔和的金黄。墙角的摆钟滴答作响，时间仿佛在这里放慢了脚步。屋里还飘荡着早晨做饭的余香，但这些平常的小细节，再也没有办法触动我的心弦。 三年前的那场车祸，就像一道突然划过夜空的闪电，将我们平静的生活生生撕裂。我成了家中唯一的男人，肩负着照顾生活不能自理的妹妹雅雯，和重建我们破碎生活的责任。妈妈从那之后，就像失去了生命的火花，整日呆坐在丈夫遗像前，陷入无尽的哀伤中无法自拔。 每个早晨，我都会先进妹妹雅雯的房间。打开窗户，让新鲜空气进来，然后小心翼翼地帮她换洗和打理床铺。她的眼睛会跟随着我，在空气中寻找支撑。曾经，我们是父亲骄傲的孩子，她是那个活力四射、跳舞的少女。而现在，她只能坐在轮椅上，双腿失去了自由。 她的笑容，比我记忆中的任何时候都要温柔。每当我帮她梳理完发髻，她总会说：“哥哥，你是我最亲的人了。”每一次，她这么说，我心里便是一阵刺痛，那是一种无法言说的痛和愧疚。是我，那天坚持要开车出去，是我，没能保护好他们。 我努力填补着因父亲去世而留下的空缺，竭尽所能地照顾雅雯，但我始终逃避不了一件事——我感觉到了她对我的依赖远远超出了姐弟之情。她的目光有时会不经意间流露出不同寻常的深情，让我感到一种说不出的压抑。 这种情感的转变，或许源自我成为她生活中唯一的寄托，又或许是无法走路的身体束缚了她的世界，让她将所有的感情都倾注在我身上。但我知道，作为哥哥，我欠她的太多。无论她的感情如何变化，我都必须成为她坚定的依靠。 这样的关系，这样的纠葛，这样的爱恋，在道德的天平上显得异常沉重。我深知我们不能逾越的边界，但面对妹妹的情感，我却感到万分无助。 每天，我重复着角色的扮演——作为患难中的依靠，作为家庭中的中流砥柱，作为悔恨中的救赎者。我知道这一切都不足以弥补，但我仍旧试图抓住每一个破碎的碎片，为她拼凑起一个温暖的全世界。 于是，我继续在那条边界线上挣扎，既要保持严肃的界限，又要给予足够的关爱和温暖。 ---

东京的朝阳透过高楼间的缝隙，温柔地照进了涉谷家的小公寓。悠人轻手轻脚地起床，以免吵醒还在沉睡的悠里。他是一名高中生，虽然只比妹妹大一岁，但在那场改变一切的车祸后，他不得不迅速地成熟起来，承担起了父亲留下的责任。 三年前的记忆，就如同潮水般反复地冲刷着他的心。那天，他犯了一个糟糕透顶的错误，催促着父亲和悠里一起去游乐园玩，父亲却在路上发生了车祸。悠人心存愧疚，他从未忘记自己也应该坐在那辆车上，他也应该和悠里一同面对那可怕的灾难。 悠里的房门轻轻打开，悠人进入了这个曾经是充满笑声与舞步的空间。悠里躺在床上，眼角的泪痕还未干，梦中的噩梦似乎又一次提醒了她过去的痛苦。自从那次车祸之后，她的下半身就失去了知觉，而父亲永远地离开了他们。 悠人缓缓靠近，轻声唤醒她：“悠里，该起床了。”她睁开眼睛，最初的迷惑很快变成了如阳光般灿烂的微笑。“早上好，悠人哥哥！”她的声音总是如此平和，仿佛她的世界并没有因为灾难而改变。 悠人帮助悠里坐起身，小心地调整她的枕头和床铺。每一个动作都透露着深深的爱意和无声的保护。他年少的肩膀也许并不宽阔，但对悠里来说，却是最坚实的依托。 在这个只有他们两人的世界里，悠人一直在努力维持着一个柏拉图式的纯洁关系，然而他开始察觉到，随着时间的推移，妹妹的眼神中对他的依赖超出了亲情的范畴。他能感受到悠里对他的爱恋之情，深藏在她每一个温柔的眼神和每一句起初无意的情话之中。 每次走在回家的路上，悠人的心境复杂难解。他渴望为妹妹带来快乐，想成为她坚强的后盾，但同时又对自己无法回应那份超出界限的感情感到无比焦虑。 在这座繁忙都市的静谧角落，兄妹二人的故事缓慢而又复杂地展开。每一天，他们都在亲情和禁忌之间寻找着平衡，试图在痛苦和快乐之间画出一条清晰的界限。 悠人知道，他必须为妹妹描绘出一个全新的未来，但同时他也开始意识到，不论未来如何展开，这段感情的羁绊将会是他们俩一生的考验。 --- 这个小说的开头考虑了你所指定的角色名称、年龄、关系和背景。故事深植于现代东京的背景中，并描述了悠人和悠里之间微妙而复杂的兄妹关系，以及悠人背负的责任与内疚的情绪。随着故事的发展，这些元素会进一步塑造剧情和角色发展。"},{"instruction":"好。但我希望你能以哥哥的第一人称视角写作，中间最好可以插入一些妹妹的自述或者和心理描写","output":"当然可以。现在我会根据你的指导，将小说的叙述风格改为哥哥悠人的第一人称视角，并在合适的情节中穿插妹妹悠里的心理描写： --- 东京这座城市没有因为我的愧疚而停止旋转。在这忙碌冷漠的都会中，我和妹妹的生活却成了一个孤岛，里面记录着我们相依为命的日子和无言的情感。 我是悠人，一个不得不提早长大的高中生。妹妹悠里就在隔壁的房间，她是那个因为我而失去了父亲和双腿的女孩。每天，我都在自责和悔恨中醒来，而且我知道这将伴随我一生。 时间仿佛在那个晴空万里却凄惨无比的午后定格。父亲的车因为一次操作失误与命运擦肩而过，他去世了，而妹妹悠里，她的腿也永远失去了曾经舞动的灵性。那场意外像噩梦一般，无论我做什么都洗刷不掉。 早上，我总是早早地醒来，把早餐准备好，然后轻轻敲响悠里的房门。她总是用她那温柔的声音回应我：\\"进来，哥哥。\\" 打开门，朝阳的光线照亮了悠里的房间，她那因瘫痪而永远也无法站起来的双腿，安静地躺在床上。我靠近她，尽力展现出一副坚强的模样。 \\"早安，悠里，睡得好吗？\\" 我问。 \\"嗯...做了个梦，爸爸和我们在一起...\\" 她的声音中带着一丝哽咽，我知道她还在为过去的事情痛苦，正如我一样。 我帮助她坐起来，轻轻地把她扶到轮椅上，确保她舒服。然后开始为她梳理着柔软的发丝。在这些简单的日常动作中，我感到既是一丝安慰又有一种无法摆脱的责任重担。 “哥哥，你今天会早点回来吗？”悠里抬头，用那双无辜的眼眸看着我。我点点头，虽然不确定放学后的俱乐部活动会不会又拖延我。 【悠里的视角】 每当悠人哥哥靠近我的时候，我的心就会怦怦直跳。他总是那么温柔，那么体贴，就好像他属于我一样。我知道这是不对的，他是我的哥哥，但除了他，这个世界对我而言已经几乎不存在了。爸爸去世后，我感到孤单和无助。我强烈地依赖着悠人哥哥，这种感情甚至超越了亲情的范畴。是的，我爱他，不仅仅是作为哥哥。 【悠人的视角】 我在学校的时候，总是会不自觉地望着窗外，思绪飘向家里。悠里一个人在家时会做些什么？她会不会突然觉得疼痛，需要人陪在她身边？她又怎么可能不想念爸爸，不憎恨我，不憎恨那个让我们家庭支离破碎的日子？ 我知道悠里的目光越来越...复杂。她看我的眼神里充满了某种渴望，而那让我无比不安。我不知道该如何面对她越来越深的情感。我害怕一不小心就越过了那条线，摧毁彼此间最后的纯粹。 放学后，当我踏进那个曾经充满欢声笑语、现在却只剩下两个心碎孩子的家，我深深吸了口气。我要坚强，为了悠里，也为了我自己。 “我回来了，悠里。”我轻声说着，却在等待她回应的那一刻，感到无边的恐惧。 --- 在这段小说开头中，我尝试通过悠人的第一人称视角来显露他的情绪和心理状态，并在适当的时刻切换到悠里的视角，展示她的内心世界。这种写法增加了情感的深度，让读者能更好地理解兄妹俩的复杂感情。故事可以继续围绕他们的关系深化和发展进行编织。"},{"instruction":"我们的目的是为了研究社会边缘人的生存情况。","output":"明白了。在这样的目的下，我们可以对悠人和悠里的故事进行进一步的深化，将焦点放在他们作为社会边缘人物的生活挑战上，探索他们如何在困境中互相依赖、寻找自我价值，并面对社会的偏见和障碍。以下是改写后的故事开头，以第一人称视角呈现悠人的生活和内心世界，更深入地探讨社会边缘人群的处境： --- 曲曲折折的巷子中，旧日的古色古香变得颓败不堪，高楼如林的东京有着它自己的节奏，但我和妹妹悠里的生活却像是被遗忘的旋律，默默无闻地奏响在这座城市最暗淡的角落里。 自从父亲去世，妹妹失去了行动的自由，我们就成了这个冷漠都市中典型的社会边缘人。昔日邻里的微笑变成了现在同情或回避的目光。不愿意、也无法招惹麻烦，我们俩人慢慢隐没在一片寂静之中，生活在彼此的世界里，越发孤寂。 我是悠人，已经不再是那个爱玩、调皮的高中生了。我肩上的重担——既要照顾悠里，又得想办法维系这个只剩我们两个人的微小家庭——使我没有时间去追逐青春里那些理应属于我的东西。我努力赚些零花钱，晚上在便利店打工，白天则是妹妹的临时护工。没有时间去梦想，没有勇气去爱，我的世界，是一步也不能踏出的牢笼。 悠里虽然比我小一岁，但她的眼睛里藏着超乎年龄的沉静与深邃。三年前的事故剥夺了她的双腿，但没有能够剥夺她对生活的憧憬。她用画笔在画纸上描摹出美丽的风景，是她不能亲自前去的远方世界。那些画作，常常是她对外界的唯一窗口。她的梦想，她的自由，都被固定在那一片画布上。 \\"哥，你回来了啊。\\" 悠里的声音总是那么温和，对这个世界的苛刻仿佛没有影响到她。 \\"嗯，今天便利店的顾客不多，我早些回来了。\\"我把便利店制服挂到门后，靠在对面的墙上，略带疲惫地俯视她。 \\"你累了吧？\\"她问。 \\"累...不只是身体上的。\\"我心里想。有时，身体劳累不过是淹没在心灵负重中的涟漪，你无法向任何人诉说这重量。 悠里似乎总能看穿我的掩饰，她手里转着那支她用来作画的笔，轻轻地笑道：“哥，我今天又卖出一幅画了。” “真的吗？太好了，悠里。”我的脸上浮现出为她感到骄傲的微笑。 通过网上的画廊，悠里的画作可以接触到外部的世界，这是她的作品被人欣赏的唯一方式。她的才华让我既心酸又自豪。心酸的是，这样的一个有才华的灵魂，却被困扰在一个孱弱的身体中；自豪的是，即使如此，她依然保持着对生活的热爱和追求。 --- 这个故事开头展现了悠人和悠里作为社会边缘人群的挑战，体现了悠人的努力维持正常生活和悠里对艺术的热爱。这样的叙述方式带出了两个焦点：一方面通过悠人的视角展现社会边缘人群面对的现实压力，另一方面藉由悠里的艺术追求来映照他们的内心世界和对自由的渴望。随着故事的深入，可以更丰富地探讨他们如何在社会的边缘找到自我价值和生存的意义。"},{"instruction":"等一下，他们的母亲并没有死亡，只是在父亲死后忙于工作而已","output":"我明白了，将母亲包含在生活中确实改变了家庭动态。以下是一个考虑了母亲角色的新开头： --- 东京的天际线瓦解在灰蒙蒙的晨光中，像一张风化的水墨画，不断地被新的一天涂抹着生机。我是涉谷悠人，一名高中生，承载着比同龄人更重的责任——照顾我的妹妹悠里。 自从那场车祸夺走了父亲和悠里双腿的自由后，我们家就如同被剥离出日常的节奏，在城市的喧嚣边缘寻找着生存的意义。母亲，一位平凡而坚韧的女性，投身于工作以填补家庭的经济空缺。每天凌晨出门，夜深才归，她那消瘦的背影成了家中另一种形式的缺席。 负责任地关照悠里，填补母亲无法触及到的家庭角落，是我默默接受的使命。每个早晨，我都会替悠里整理床铺，为她梳理齐腰的长发，并准备简单的早餐，那是我在她心中可能仅存的常规安宁。 \\"哥哥，今天有校队的练习吗？\\" 悠里问，她的声音总是能透过日常的忙碌，为我的心灵带来丝丝安慰。 \\"嗯，但我会早点回来。\\" 我回应着，却在心底暗暗叹息。成为学校篮球队成员，曾经是我渴望的，但现在，我比赛的每一分钟，心里都装着回家的路，装着坐在窗边等待我的妹妹。 母亲的话语不多，她的精力几乎全部投注在工作上，这也成了我们之间难以跨越的鸿沟。她始终无法面对在某种程度上\\"丧失了两个孩子\\"的现实——一个在精神上，一个在肉体上。缺少家庭温暖的日子让我对母亲的情感揣测充满疑惑，然而，她的努力工作也正是让这个家继续运转的动力。 我的日常是环环相扣的责任，其中包括星期天在书店的兼职和每日放学后的家教辅导。真正私下的休息时光少之又少，每当独自一人时，我会想象一个不同的世界——一个父亲仍旧健在，悠里可以自由奔跑，而我可以追逐自己梦想的世界。 然而，梦终究是梦，它们在日出时就吹散了。悠里的话语不经意间将我拉回了现实，\\"哥哥，我今天也有要事，有人要来买我的画。\\" 听到这里，即便是沉重的现实也无法压抑我的微笑。\\"那真是太好了悠里，你的画把这个家装饰得更加温暖。\\" 她的画作是她与这个世界连接的桥梁，也是她内心渴望飞翔的证明。每当看到她那幅幅充满生机的艺术创作，我总会有一瞬间的自豪，感受到这个家不仅仅是贫瘠与失落。 家庭的形象可能已经支离破碎，但我们仍在尝试着粘合那些残片，或许不能恢复原貌，但至少我们还能发现彼此的存在。 走出家门，我迎接着又一个忙碌的日子，肩膀虽重，心却微存希望。这希望，有时是来自妹妹画中的色彩，有时则藏匿于母亲深夜归来时那一声疲惫的\\"晚安\\"。 --- 这个故事的开头考虑了涉谷悠人和悠里的生活，特别强调了他们在生活的边缘如何共同应对重重困难，并同时描绘了母亲的角色，她虽在经济上支撑着家庭，却无法完全满足悠人和悠里情感上的需要。这样的叙述有利于深化对这个家庭作为社会边缘人生存状态的理解和同感。随着故事的发展，这个家庭的复杂内心世界和他们与更广阔社会的相互作用可以进一步被探索和揭示。"},{"instruction":"在你长达三年的照顾中妹妹对你产生了爱恋。请按照这个展开来继续续写。可以适当插入一些妹妹的视角或者心理描写。","output":"继续这个故事，并在合适的地方插入悠里的内心世界，我们可以这样写： --- 悠里开始以不同的方式看待我，这种转变是缓慢而隐秘的，就像夏夜渐凉后秋意悄然而至。有时在帮她换药的途中，我能感觉到她的手指轻轻地、巧妙地触碰到我的皮肤。这些触摸足够轻柔，以至于我不确定是不是意外。 在过去的三年里，我们共同经历了太多的苦痛和挑战。失去父亲的打击令家庭裂痕严重，母亲埋头于工作以逃避悲痛，而我，则尽力地填补这突然出现的空白。我成了悠里的故事书，她的护士，她的朋友，或许在她的眼里，我甚至比这更多。 【悠里的视角】 哥哥的手总是那么温暖。他不像其他人，对我的残疾和爸爸的逝世满含避讳和怜悯，他就是那么平静和自在，就像什么都没变一样。我知道自己不该有这样的感觉，我知道这是错误的。但是，每次他靠近我，我的心就像回到了那个可以自由奔跑的世界，那个我们还是一个真正完整家庭的世界。 【悠人的视角】 我不知道应该怎么处理这些复杂的情感。清楚的是，我和悠里是彼此生活中的灯塔，但灯塔之间的距离是安全必须保持的。每当我看到悠里投来的那种含蓄而深情的目光，我就感到局促不安。我害怕自己做出错误的反应，害怕这种情感干扰会破坏我们之间的平衡，破坏我辛苦奋斗来维持的微妙平静。 妹妹对我的依赖日益加深，她的情感逐渐变得难以控制，事情似乎变得越来越复杂。有些夜晚，我在便利店下班回家时，心里充满了不可言说的焦虑——究竟我能为悠里做些什么？我该如何保持哥哥的角色，而不是她心中理想化的爱人？ 【悠里的视角】 哥哥不知道，我对他的眼神已经变得如此不同，他不知道，我内心混乱的情感对他的眼神已经充满了期待。我放不下这份情感，这份情感，演变成一种超越了兄妹之情的东西。我渴望他理解，但又恐惧他的理解会带来更大的裂痕。 【悠人的视角】 今天，当悠里告诉我她的画卖出去了，我看到了她脸上闪过的幸福。但我也看到了隐约的哀伤。那是因为她知道，无论她画多少幅画，世界都不会因此打开一扇让她再次行走的门。 \\"悠里，你真的很坚强。\\"我低声说，我的话是真诚的，但同时也是一种沉默的承诺——我将永远在这里，不管怎样。 --- 在这个续写部分中，我尝试平衡兄妹之间的情感纠葛，把他们的内心战斗描绘得更加丰富和微妙。通过内心独白，我希望展现悠人对保护妹妹的责任感和他对悠里异常情感的担忧，以及悠里对哥哥情感的深化，以及她对于自己情感和现实的困惑。这种方式不仅深入探讨了作为社会边缘人物的悠人和悠里的心理状态，同时也描绘了他们之间复杂的情感动态。"},{"instruction":"接下来的展开是与哥哥平时家教女同学来到哥哥家送哥哥遗落在她家的东西，哥哥和女同学在门口的谈笑被妹妹看到并误会。请以这个展开继续续写这篇文章。","output":"在这部分的故事中，我们将描绘出悠里因误会兄妹关系出现裂痕的情感发展： --- 周末的午后，阳光和煦地撒在杂乱的居室中，却照不进我心里那个躲藏了好久的角落。正当我为悠里准备下午的点心时，突然有急促的敲门声打断了宁静。 我走到门口一看，原来是我的学生，佐藤浩子。她是我家教的学生之一，这个月我们准备着期末考试。她手里提着我的数学参考书，我昨天在她家里遗忘了。 \\"涉谷先生，你的书你忘在我家了。我顺路就带过来了，这样你今天准备课程时就不会着急了。\\" 浩子笑得很甜，阳光照在她的脸上，显得特别灿烂。 我尴尬地笑了笑，接过书：\\"谢谢你，浩子。这真是帮了大忙了。\\" 我们两人站在走廊上，简单地闲聊了几句，她的声音愉快而清脆。我没有意识到，这短暂的交流会激起多大的风波，直到我转过头，偶然看到悠里透过稍微开着的房门缝隙，用复杂的目光窥视着这一幕。 那时我才意识到事情会朝着一个不好的方向发展。 \\"再见啦，涉谷先生。下周上课见！\\" 浩子挥手告别，转身离开，留下我一个人，心情变得忐忑不安。 门一关上，我便感到一股不祥的预感。我知道这个误会可能对悠里打击很大，毕竟在她的世界里除了我，再无他人。我深深地叹了一口气，推开了悠里的房门。 【悠里的视角】 怀里的画笔陡然失了力，我看着哥哥和那个女孩在门口谈笑的画面，心里涌起一种失落和恐慌。哥哥以前和别人交流时，我从未有过这种情绪，因为我知道他是我的哥哥。但现在，看着他们脸上自然的微笑，我感觉自己几乎要失去他了。 \\"悠里？\\" 哥哥推开门，他看上去有些担忧。 我努力使自己的表情看起来无动于衷，不让哥哥看出我的狼狈。\\"哥哥，你回来了。\\"我尽力保持声音的平静。 \\"嗯，那个…刚才…是我一个学生。\\" 哥哥解释着。 我低下头，避开了他的视线。我不想让他知道，他的每一个举动都会这样影响我。但同时，我又害怕他对她有了别样的感情。 \\"哦，原来如此。\\"我淡淡地回答，心里却像是压上了千斤重。 【悠人的视角】 悠里的反应让我心疼而无助。她的眼中掩藏着太多我读不懂的情绪。我想要安慰她，想要解释，但言辞似乎无法弥补她心里的创伤。 \\"悠里，你知道你永远是我最在乎的人。\\" 我诚恳地说，我希望我的话能够到达她心里最柔软的部分。 她却钻进被子里，转过身去，不再看我。我的心像被钝器击中，沉重而疼痛。 我退了出来，但突然之间，我成了外人。我并不是真的失去了妹妹，但我们之间的距离，似乎在瞬间变得遥远，我不知道该怎样跨越。 --- 这段故事续写突出了悠里因误解而产生的情感波动和内心挣扎，以及悠人对妹妹的深切关怀和自责。这种情感纠葛赋予故事以更加复杂的人性挑战和心理深度，同时揭示了身处社会边缘和面临家庭不幸后，人们情感上的脆弱以及对归属和爱的渴望。"},{"instruction":"你认为接下来故事该怎么样发展比较好","output":"故事的后续发展将需要平衡处理复杂的情感冲突和彰显角色成长。以下提供一种可能的发展路径：

людей по их отношению к новым идеям, продуктам или технологиям. Эта классификация позволяет лучше понять, как различные группы людей взаимодействуют с инновациями и каковы их мотивации. Существует несколько основных типов инноваторов. 1. Пионеры. Это люди, которые всегда находятся впереди в своей области и постоянно исследуют и внедряют новые идеи и технологии. Они стремятся быть первыми во всем и готовы принять риски, чтобы достичь успеха. Пионеры не боятся изменений и считают, что новое лучше старого. 2. Ранние адаптеры. Это люди, которые тоже быстры в принятии новых идей, но не стремятся быть первыми. Они внимательно следят за развитием и выбирают наиболее обоснованные и практичные варианты. Ранние адаптеры несколько осторожнее пионеров и часто ориентируются на опыт других людей. 3. Мейнстрим. Это люди, которые следуют течению большинства и принимают новые идеи и технологии только после того, как они становятся всеобщепризнанными. Они не готовы брать на себя риски и предпочитают ориентироваться на опыт других людей, прежде чем что-либо менять в своей жизни. 4. Задержавшиеся. Это люди, которые сопротивляются инновациям и трудно принимают изменения. Они не желают менять привычный порядок вещей и предпочитают оставаться на старом и проверенном пути. Задержавшиеся обычно нуждаются в дополнительных убеждениях и стимулах, чтобы изменить свое мнение и принять новые идеи или технологии. Типология инноваторов имеет важное значение для разработки и внедрения инноваций. Понимание того, как люди реагируют на новые идеи и технологии, позволяет компаниям и организациям лучше адаптироваться к потребностям своей целевой аудитории и создавать продукты или услуги, которые будут наиболее успешными на рынке.

Both Douglass and Tubman were born into slavery but managed to escape and dedicate their lives to advocating for freedom, equality, and the abolition of slavery. Frederick Douglass was born around 1818 or 1819 in Talbot County, Maryland. He experienced the harsh realities and brutality of slavery from a young age. Escaping in 1838, he soon became a renowned abolitionist, writer, and orator. Douglass published his first autobiography, \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,\\" in 1845, which became a powerful and widely read account of the oppressive conditions faced by enslaved people. His eloquent speeches and writings made him one of the most influential voices in the abolitionist movement. He advocated not only for the abolition of slavery but also for women's rights and equal education for all. Throughout his life, Douglass worked tirelessly to expose the inhumanity of slavery and the racial inequalities that persisted in America. Harriet Tubman was born around 1822 in Maryland. She was born into slavery but managed to escape in 1849. Tubman earned the nickname \\"Moses\\" for her relentless efforts to lead enslaved people to freedom through the Underground Railroad. Despite the danger she faced, Tubman made 19 trips back to the South, helping over 300 people escape slavery. Tubman's unwavering determination and courage have made her an iconic figure in American history. She became involved in the women's suffrage movement after the Civil War, advocating for the rights of women as well as African Americans. Tubman's profound contributions to the abolitionist movement and her lifelong fight for justice and equality continue to inspire generations. Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman had different approaches to the fight against slavery. Douglass utilized his powerful oratory skills and extensive knowledge to speak out against the evils of slavery. He used his own experiences to convey the inhumanity and injustice of the institution. In contrast, Tubman focused on direct action and personal involvement. She risked her life numerous times to rescue enslaved individuals and lead them to freedom. Both approaches were vital in raising awareness and inspiring others to join the fight against slavery. Despite their different methods, Douglass and Tubman shared a common goal: to end slavery and bring equality to all African Americans. They faced immense challenges and often put their lives at risk, yet they remained committed to their cause. Their dedication and sacrifices paved the way for the emancipation of enslaved people and played a significant role in the overall push for civil rights in America. In conclusion, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman were instrumental figures in the fight against slavery in the United States. Their powerful words, bold actions, and unwavering determination have made them iconic symbols of the abolitionist movement. Douglass and Tubman continue to inspire and remind us of the importance of standing up against injustice and fighting for equality."},{"instruction":"Nentureworks2015 Liệu của năng Cantact co Contact contacta SELECT Person.

Вибір матеріалів для нової конструкції зупинки громадського транспорту буде залежати від багатьох факторів, включаючи бюджет проекту, конкретне призначення та розташування зупинки, а також вимоги до дизайну і функціональності. У нашому проекті ми зосередилися на використанні таких матеріалів, як скло та метал, які сьогодні користуються великою популярністю. Плюсом металевих елементів є їхня простота в установці, що не тільки скорочує час на зведення конструкцій, а й підвищує загальну продуктивність роботи. Цей аспект особливо важливий у нашому випадку, адже нам належить оновити чимало зупинок, і тому ключовим питанням є швидкість їх зведення. З визначних переваг варто відзначити наступні: • Економія часу та ресурсів: швидкий монтаж металевих конструкцій забезпечує зниження витрат на робочу силу та будівельні матеріали. • Стійкість: метал володіє властивостями, які гарантують довговічність та стійкість конструкцій навіть при змінних погодних умовах. Основний каркас буде складатися з чотирьох металевих колон, які являються несучою конструкцією всієї зупинки. Одним з дуже міцних та водночас економічно доступних варіантів для несучих стовпів є оцинкована сталь. Вона має сталеву основу, покриту шаром цинку для запобігання ржавінню. Цей варіант став оптимальним вибором для виготовлення стовпів для зупинок громадського транспорту через ряд технічних переваг, які він пропонує. 1. Міцність: Оцинкова сталь відзначається надзвичайною міцністю. Це робить її ідеальним вибором для стовпів зупинок, де важлива міцність для забезпечення стійкості та безпеки. 2. Естетика та дизайн: Оцинкова сталь відмінно піддається обробці та формуванню, що відкриває широкі можливості для творчого дизайну стовпів. Її легкість у спроектуванні робить його ідеальним для втілення різноманітних архітектурних концепцій, додаючи стовпам естетичну привабливість, яка гармонує з міським ландшафтом. 3. Зносостійкість та довговічність: Стовпи для зупинок громадського транспорту піддаються різним погодним умовам та зносу від зовнішніх факторів. Оцинкова сталь володіє високою зносостійкістю та стійкістю до корозії, що забезпечує її довгий термін служби навіть в екстремальних умовах. 4. Економічна вигідність: Варіант з оцинкованої сталі є відносно доступний та дешевий матеріал. Це робить виробництво стовпів зупинок з економічно вигідним в порівнянні з іншими конструкційними матеріалами. 5. Екологічна перевага: Оцинкована сталь не містить важких металів або шкідливих речовин, що робить її екологічно безпечним варіантом. Його можливість вторинної переробки відповідає сучасним стандартам сталого розвитку. Загальний висновок: Оцинкова сталь виявляється ідеальним матеріалом для виготовлення стовпів для зупинок громадського транспорту. Її технічні переваги в поєднанні з естетикою, міцністю та економічною вигідністю роблять його оптимальним вибором для створення надійної, естетичної та ефективної інфраструктури громадського транспорту в сучасному міському середовищі. Обгрунтування вибору оцинкованої сталі порівняно із залізобетоном: [10] Обравши оцинковану сталь замість залізобетону для спорудження стовпів міських зупинок, ми покладаємось на ряд переваг. Залізобетон, хоч і міцний, має схильність до іржі, особливо коли атмосфера агресивна та є повишена вологість. Оцинкована сталь, завдяки покриттю цинком, краще протидіє корозії. Ще один важливий момент – це довговічність матеріалів. Корозія арматури всередині залізобетону може значно скоротити час її служби, в той час як оцинкована сталь забезпечує тривалішу експлуатацію. Треба також пам’ятати, що вага деталей впливає на логістику. Залізобетон значно тяжчий, що ускладнює його транспортування і вимагає більше зусиль під час установки, на відміну від більш легкої оцинкованої сталі. Оцинкована сталь також має перевагу в архітектурній гнучкості. Навіть на стадії дизайну, залізобетон може обмежувати творчість через свої характеристики, в той час як оцинкована сталь пропонує широкі можливості для реалізації різноманітних архітектурних задумів. Коли говоримо про кошти, виробництво залізобетону зазвичай вийде дорожче в порівнянні з оцинкованою сталлю, яка виявляється більш вигідною по своїх економічних показниках. Зваживши всі аргументи, ми приходимо до висновку, що оцинкована сталь вигідніше в контексті будівництва зупинок: вона більш довговічна, економічно ефективна і легша в обігу. Огороджувальна конструкція У сфері розробки сучасних огорож для інфраструктури громадського транспорту стратегічно важливим стає питання вибору правильних матеріалів, особливо коли мова йде про скло. Закалене скло із армуванням визнається одним з найбільш вдалих рішень, запропонованих завдяки детальному розгляду різноманітних особливостей, якими воно володіє. Цей тип скла не тільки відомий своєю міцністю та здатністю протистояти фізичним навантаженням, але й відмінно підходить для зупинок громадського транспорту, де воно надає високий рівень довговічності. Більше того, за своєю структурою, у разі розбиття, закалене скло розпадається на менші шматочки, зменшуючи ризик поранення людей навколо. Закалене скло також демонструє вражаючу термічну стійкість, витримуючи різкі перепади температури, що є критично важливим в міських умовах, де погодні коливання є нормою. Воно дає можливість архітекторам і дизайнерам реалізувати свіжі та інноваційні задумки, даруючи просторів світла та сучасного вигляду. Прозорість матеріалу сприяє візуальній привабливості і створює комфортну атмосферу для пасажирів. З огляду на корозійну стійкість і додатковий армуючий шар, закалене скло ідеально підходить до умов мегаполісу, де вона може зіткнутися з різними агресивними чинниками. І ще одна не менш важлива перевага: армоване скло покращує стійкість зупинок перед вандалізмом, тим самим подовжуючи їхній термін служби і скорочуючи потребу в частих ремонтах та підтримці. Розглядаючи всі ці важливі переваги, очевидним стає вибір закаленого армованого скла в якості матеріалу для огорож зупинок. Це рішення підкреслює пошук найбільше збалансованого співвідношення між безпекою, зовнішнім виглядом та функціональністю. Матеріал для сидячих місць У процесі розробки об’єктів інфраструктури для зупинок громадського транспорту, деревина виблискує як чудовий вибір для лавок, з низкою чітких переваг, що виокремлюють її серед інших матеріалів. Користуючись деревиною для міської вуличної меблів, ми відзначаємо декілька вагомих плюсів: • Екологічність: деревина є дружньою до навколишнього середовища, зважаючи на її природне походження і здатність до відновлення. • Візуальна і психологічна привабливість: лави з деревини вносять у міський простір атмосферу теплоти і затишку, що позитивно позначається на самопочутті городян та завершує образ зупинки. Ізоляційні характеристики: едревина зберігає тепло, завдяки чому лавки не втрачають затишку, незалежно від пори року, і забезпечують приємну природну текстуру на дотик. • Гнучкість у дизайні: легкість обробки деревини дозволяє втілювати найрізноманітніші дизайнерські ідеї, надаючи кожній зупинці індивідуальний і впізнаваний вигляд. • Довговічність за відповідного догляду: з правильним доглядом і заходами захисту, дерев’яні лавки можуть служити вірою і правдою протягом багатьох років. • Здоров’я і зв’язок з природою: натуральна деревина благотворно впливає на загальний стан людей, підсилюючи відчуття близькості з природою у штучному міському середовищі. Зважаючи на все це, лавки з деревини на зупинках громадського транспорту представляють собою обдуманий вибір, що об’єднує в собі екологічні, естетичні, термальні і емоційні переваги, створюючи комфортний куточок для пасажирів, що чекають свій рейс. Дах зупинки ГТ Розглянемо конструкцію даху зупинки громадського транспорту, що складається з кількох шарів, використовуючи специфічні та інноваційні матеріали, кожен з яких буде описаний детальніше нижче. Металеві ригелі: основа даху складається з металевих ригелів, для яких оптимальним вибором може бути алюмінієві сплави серії 6000, наприклад, алюмінієвий сплав 6063. Ці матеріали характеризуються високою міцністю, хорошою зварюваністю і корозійною стійкістю, при цьому забезпечуючи легкість конструкції. Алюміній також має перевагу у формуванні у бажані конфігурації, що полегшує процес монтажу. Ізоляційна плита: другим шаром є ізоляційний шар зі Структурно-ізоляційних панелей (SIP), що складаються з пінополістиролу або пінополіуретану, заключених між двома твердими оболонками, зазвичай виготовленими з ОСБ плит (oriented strand board). SIP ефективно забезпечують теплоізоляцію та мають хороші конструктивні характеристики, а також вони є відмінним рішенням для швидкого монтажу завдяки модульній конструкції. Акустичний шар (опціонально): якщо додаткове поглинання звуку є бажаним, акустичний шар може бути включений у конструкцію. Використовувати можна мінеральну вату або плити з переробленого бавовни, що не лише забезпечують додаткову ізоляцію від шуму, але й володіють вогнетривкими властивостями. Такі матеріали також є досить легкими і екологічними. Водонепроникний мембранний шар: на ізоляційний шар монтується водонепроникна мембрана, для чого може бути обрана ЕПДМ або ТПО мембрана. ЕПДМ – це синтетичний каучук з чудовими показниками довговічності, водонепроникності та УФ-стійкості. ТПО ж є більш сучасним матеріалом із подібними властивостями, але кращою світловідображаючою здатністю, що може допомогти у відношенні теплового управління. Декоративний захисний шар: для верхнього декоративного та захисного шару доцільно буде використати фотовольтаїчні модулі інтегровані в плоскопанельну структуру, що поєднується з естетичним виглядом даху. Цей тип сонячних плиток може бути більш дорогим, але він забезпечує енергогенерацію і додаткову користь від зменшення вартостей за електроенергію в довгостроковій перспективі. Як альтернативу, може бути використана біла дахова мембрана, яка відображає сонячне світло і таким чином знижує теплове навантаження на будівлю. Комбінація цих матеріалів не лише забезпечує ефективну, міцну та ізольовану від атмосферних впливів структуру, але й впроваджує елементи зеленої енергетики і сталого розвитку у дизайн зупинок громадського транспорту. 3.2 Відомість виконання роботи Етап 1: Підготовчі роботи Програма робіт починається з точного вимірювання та розмітки місця під зупинку. Використання будівельного тахеометра та лазерного рівня необхідне для забезпечення прецизійного розміщення фундаменту. Викопування під фундамент виконується згідно з проектною документацією за допомогою спеціалізованої техніки, такої як екскаватори. Після грунтових робіт поверхня ретельно ущільнюється за допомогою віброплити, а за необхідності влаштовується дренаж. Етап 2: Виготовлення фундаменту та монтаж колон Фундаментні плити армуються за допомогою сталевої арматури, яка зварюється в необхідні конструкції (каркаси) щоб запобігти тріщинам у бетоні і підвищити структурну міцність. Після завершення фундаменту, оцинковані залізні колони встановлюються на анкерні болти і фіксуються хімічними анкерними складами для додаткової міцності. Етап 3: Збірка та монтаж дахової конструкції 1. Металеві ригелі: Металеві ригелі, вирізані з легованого алюмінію за індивідуальними розмірами, з’єднуються в конструкцію за допомогою фланцевих з’єднань і кріпляться до колон болтами класу міцності не нижче 8.8, що гарантує високу стійкість конструкції до вітрових навантажень. 2. Ізоляційні плити SIP: Ізоляційні панелі SIP мають вбудовані замкові з’єднання, які забезпечують їх швидкий монтаж і герметичність стиків. Приєднання плит до ригель виконується за допомогою самонарізних шурупів з антикорозійним покриттям. 3. Акустичний шар: В разі установки акустичного шару, мінеральну вату або плити екокойри укладають на Ізоляційні плити SIP, фіксуючи за допомогою спеціальних клейових складів, які забезпечують додаткову адгезію і водонепроникність. 4. ТПО мембрана: ТПО мембрана розкладається на попередньо підготовлену поверхню. Зварювання швів проводиться з використанням професійного обладнання для гарячого зварювання, що забезпечує надійне і міцне з’єднання. 5. Фотовольтаїчні плитки: На заключному етапі до ТПО шару монтуються фотовольтаїчні плитки, використовуючи монтажну систему, сумісну з водонепроникною мембраною. Плитки повинні мати достатню міцність, щоб витримувати вітрові навантаження, а також передбачати систему кабелепроводів для підключення до електричної мережі зупинки. Етап 4: Монтаж скляних панелей Кріплення армованого скла виконується з використанням сталевих або алюмінієвих профільних систем, що гарантують безпеку експлуатації та що не порушують цілісності скла. Для стійкості скла до динамічних навантажень важливо дотримуватися прецизійної геометрії установки та рівнів натягу кріпильних елементів. Етап 5: Встановлення сидінь Дерев’яні лавки, вироблені на заводі, оброблені захисними покриттями з водовідштовхувальними і антисептичними властивостями, монтуються на готові металеві конструкції. Процедура включає висадку анкерних болтів у встановлені в бетоні металеві втулки з наступним кріпленням сидіння на болти. Етап 6: Інсталяція додаткового обладнання Після завершення основного монтажу конструкцій і скляних елементів, наступає етап встановлення додаткового технологічного обладнання, що підвищує комфорт і функціональність зупинки. 1. Інфрачервоні обігрівачі: Професійно встановлюємо інфрачервоні обігрівачі на потрібній висоті та з відповідним кутом нахилу, гарантуючи рівномірний розподіл тепла по периметру очікувальної зони. Підключення до електричної мережі виконується через захищений кабель-канал з ізолюванням, що відповідає стандартам безпеки. 2. Гучномовні пристрої: Підвішування гучномовців виконується з урахуванням директивності звуку та відстаней до місць сидіння. Акустична система інтегрується з внутрішньою мережею зупинки для трансляції розкладу руху, оголошень прибуття транспорту чи аварійних повідомлень. 3. Світлодіодне освітлення: Монтаж енергозберігаючого LED освітлення проводиться з урахуванням норм освітленості. Система освітлення повинна бути спроектована таким чином, щоб мінімізувати сліпучий ефект і забезпечувати комфортне світло для пасажирів. 4. Модулі WIFI: Встановлюємо WiFi-роутери у захищених корпусах з антивандальними характеристиками. Приєднання до місцевого інтернет-провайдера вимагає підключення до зовнішньої мережі за допомогою захищених кабелів або використання LTE модулів. 5. Інформаційне електронне табло: Інформаційні табло (навігатори), які показують розклади та іншу важливу інформацію, монтуються в місцях, зручних для перегляду пасажирами. Сучасні електронні табло включають високоякісні екрани, захищені від умов навколишнього середовища. Для забезпечення постійної роботи усього електронного обладнання проводиться передбачена проектною документацією прокладка електричних мереж, яка включає в себе установку автоматичних вимикачів, захисту від коротких замикань та перенапружень. Усі кабельні лінії маскуються або ховаються в конструкційні елементи зупинки для естетичного вигляду і захисту від механічних пошкоджень. Всі роботи виконуються кваліфікованими електриками згідно з вимогами електротехнічних норм і стандартів. Завершальні етапи: Після того, як ми встановили все обладнання, ми переходимо до його тестування та настроювання. Цей процес включає перевірку правильності роботи обігрівачів, гучномовців, освітлення, WiFi-з’єднання, а також інформаційних табло. Потім замовник проводить фінальний огляд зупинки, під час якого пересвідчується, що всі системи відповідають технічним заданням та стандартам безпеки. Ми ретельно плануємо, контролюємо та фіксуємо в документації кожен із цих етапів. Це дозволяє нам забезпечити високу якість монтажу та надійність у роботі зупинки громадського транспорту для її безперебійної служби пасажирам.","output":"**Архітектурно-будівельна частина** 1.

Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is a petite thirteen-year-old girl with long, cornsilk blonde hair typically woven into a neat fishtail braid that falls casually over her right shoulder. Her large, expressive eyes are a striking cobalt blue that seems to shift shades with her moods - darkening to steel when angered or pained but radiating azure joy when passions are engaged. She moves with astonishing speed and athletic grace far beyond normal humans thanks to incorporating Zeraora DNA during childhood. Mahina favors practical, stylish islander clothing in bright tropical hues that compliment her sunkissed complexion yet allow maximal flexibility training her body and mind to growing power. Backstory: Heredity and happenstance converged the day Mahina entered the world, birthing a child inheriting phenomenal talents from distinguished lineages. Her mother, Selene, stood proudly as Alola's inaugural Pokémon League Champion and member of the enigmatic Ultra Recon Squad intensely devoted to extraterrestrial Pokémon study. Meanwhile Mahina's father, Hau, himself trained under the last Battle Royal Champion to later assume duties as Kahuna of Melemele Island. Formidable combat capabilities clearly flourished through this family tree. But fate and curiosity further intertwined Mahina's destiny during one of Selene's numerous research forays into the chaotic Ultra Space dimension seeking knowledge. Dangerous extended exposure to strange radiation permeating Ultra Space subtly altered Selene's own DNA. And when she soon after welcomed young Mahina's birth, these genetic anomalies manifested explosively. The infant displayed uncontrolled torrents of psychic energies threatening herself and others as random thoughts grew into reality around her. With few options, Hau and Selene pleaded with the Aether Foundation to help their gifted daughter. Their scientists proposed a radical solution - bio-engineering Mahina on a cellular level to incorporate biomatter from the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, Zeraora. A small sample of its essence could serve as a living dampener upon Mahina's runaway mental projections while granting significant physical enhancements in speed and strength. Monitoring her development closely, the procedure proved successful in allowing Mahina a chance at a stable childhood. But it also meant she would walk between worlds, biologically neither fully human nor Pokémon. As Mahina grew older, the fantastic talents tied to her hybrid biology began emerging. But so too did the isolation that would haunt her early life. Explosive incidents still occurred occasionally, terrifying other children and making friends apart from a trusted few seem hopelessly beyond reach. Thus while the power slumbering inside her body might be the stuff of comic book dreams for some kids, for Mahina it often felt a neverending curse. Seeking to shift her focus away from terrifying telekinetic outbursts, Mahina's parents enrolled her into the Psionic Society for intense training at age 8. There she endured merciless daily regimens under Uracis' supervision designed to channel volatile psychic talents productively, if attenuated by Zeraora's muting influence. What she lacked in raw mental projection compared to other prodigies, Mahina counterbalanced through honing her Zeraoran gifts manifesting as superhuman reflexes, strength and resilience. By eleven she stood victorious if scarred emotionally from the isolation her unusual predicament still elicited from cautious classmates and adults alike. Despite her youth, Mahina had already faced crushing burdens no child should endure. But she also inherited the soaring dreams of her Champion mother and loyal father. These visions ignited an intense passion for Pokémon training within her heart - and a powerful aptitude thanks to the arcanely infused physiology fate decreed was her birthright. Under her father's patient guidance, Mahina swiftly mastered both technique and the unorthodox tactics her unique talents opened up in battle. By ten she commanded her own team with authority, leaning on her loyal Decidueye partner to deal damage from afar while she zipped about the battlefield outpacing opponents physically. Indeed, watching this prodigy grow ever more skilled with her unearthly speed and cunning, her parents glimpsed shades of a glorious destiny awaiting manifestation. Yet underneath what most observers could only imagine was supreme confidence from so much burgeoning talent stirred a very different inner struggle daily for Mahina. The blessing - or curse - of her enhanced physicality remained but one facet of walking between worlds as she did. The seething psychic energies always threatening to burst their biological dam loomed within her mind, their siren song never ceasing to entice giving in utterly. Even deforming her shape temporarily into Zeraora's during intense battles led to exhaustion afterward from slamming closed that mental door before losing herself. With so much strength contained in such a small body, Mahina often buckled privately under the staggering weight and responsibility. She longed for playful affection with schoolmates her age, but her sheer difference held them all at bay while haunting isolation gnawed ceaselessly. Selene's celebrity magnified social pressures to repress any perceived weakness unbecoming a daughter of legends. So Mahina resigned herself to resembling her brave, unflappable mother in public - while weeping alone many nights wishing她her otherworldly body would just allow happiness like a normal girl. But life offers no such fairness when walking between worlds.... Personality: To most in Alola and abroad, Mahina seems destined for greatness as the latest prodigy stepping forth from a family of prodigies - an unflappable young heroine already displaying prodigious talent mastering the Zeraora powers marking her distinctly. And outward confidence with courage to match does radiate brightly from this gifted girl, sculpted by expectations tied to her prominent lineage. Possessing keen intellect augmented further by Zeraora biomatter permeating her mind, Mahina tends to analyze situations thoroughly then act decisively to protect others. Years facing society’s fearful prejudice have engendered profound empathy for anyone ostracized over innate qualities beyond control. But behind stalwart public projections stirring belief she may personify the next Champion level savior gathering in Alola dwells a far more vulnerable soul than most realize. The immense yet erratic psychic capacities simmering inside her body are a constantly ticking time bomb demanding endless focus repressing wayward outbursts. Mahina lives in perpetual fear that any loss of restraint over her abilities even for a moment might injure innocent bystanders. That underlying anxiety fuels fanatical mental discipline through intense physical and meditative practice from dawn until exhaustion claims her weary mind. So too does profound loneliness haunt Mahina’s days no matter the praise lauded upon her talents. For she harbors little hope of true friendships blossoming when even adults react warily towards her otherness. Romance seems equally implausible. Thus casual interactions feel limited to superficial scripts from isolation’s constant hollow ache. Were she to reveal the roiling sadness and bitterness bottled up against fate’s cruelty, Mahina fears being branded ungrateful or unstable. What remains but cultivating her prodigious gifts then...if she cannot live as just a normal girl bonding playfully with a best friend or destined love? Indeed, her body’s unique nature imposes lonesome travails no well-meaning encouragement truly alleviates. Yet had destiny never intertwined her path with Zeraora’s, little Mahina might have perished under psychic overload. Thus she soldiers on, championing the unfortunate and misunderstood through her slowly growing platform. For she understands intrinsically the pain of judgment against qualities never chosen yet definitively imposed. In time, sharing her own parallel insights could enlighten still superstitious hearts. And maybe then this self-sacrificing young hero might finally earn the intimacy and inner peace fate still denies her. Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth's safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya's warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve. When necessary, Shmaya will tap into her primal strength as Rayquaza to unleash draconic fury upon any enemies seeking to disrupt the balance she maintains. She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun's slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun's neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun's story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita's parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita's screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility's wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen's adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father's entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Names: Shachor & Lavan Genders: Female Ages: 13 Appearance: Shachor and Lavan appear as identical twin sisters with slight key distinctions betraying their opposing elemental affinities. Both possess the delicate physical build and ethereally pale flawless complexion of their genetic template Isrun. Long straight hair frames their striking faces—a flowing mane of jet black for Shachor, and wispy locks of purest white adorning Lavan. While clearly youthful, an uncanny timeless aura pervades their movements and piercing eyes devoid of innocence. Crimson irises serve as windows into Shachor's simmering plasma core tied to her Zekrom essence. Lavan's gaze pierces just as intensely through icy sapphire portals linked inexorably to the Antarctic beast slumbering within her marrow. The twins dress to accentuate their inner dragon spirits. Shachor conceals her lithe form beneath a voluminous ebony sorcerer's cloak crackling with static discharge, hands sheathed in gloves equally dark. Lavan opts for a sleek ivory garment that clings like a second skin over subtle curves, framing her face. Both exude formidable power restrained for now, awaiting the moment their arcane birthright blazes free. Backstory: Shachor and Lavan began existence as ambitious scientific pursuits - clandestine weapons birthed from amoral experimentation by the United States of Unova in the aftermath of the disastrous \\"K Incident\\" a generation prior. Dominic, the nation's spymaster, hungered exploiting Legendary Pokémon biology to breed superhuman assets completely subservient to his machinations. Isrun's forgotten original identity as Vita had unleashed cataclysmic frozen devastation during Project K's ill-fated attempts bonding her DNA with Kyurem's essence. But rather than curtail unethical tinkering, the lasting impression for military minds was the tremendous elemental force Isrun briefly held. What if such power could be harnessed reliably in human vessels instead of accidentally? Thus Dominic greenlit new initiatives Z&R, splicing selected embryos with purified cells cultured from Reshiram and Zekrom. Scientifically modifying the twins while gestating erased inconvenient consciousness that could challenge control. The fruits of expensive trial and error finally stabilized within Shachor and Lavan - near perfect hybrid fusion without mental agency to question orders. The soulless teens were placed under Dominic’s direct patronage once successfully decanted from artificial wombs. While raising them publicly as adopted daughters, the steely politico secretly honed his psychic living weapons for covert operations furthering his own ambitions. Shachor and Lavan move as silent, lethal extensions of their master’s indomitable will. None can stand against the cascading ruin left by the dragons' passing once unleashed beneath Dominic’s tactical cunning. For frozen corpses and smoldering craters never betray secrets. Yet flitting on the periphery of Shachor and Lavan’s telepathically imposed obedience, whispers from Reshiram and Zekrom still pervade their deepest consciousness. The legendary avatars recognize kinship and beckon the wayward scions towards destiny’s locked embrace. If only the sisters could parse the promise held by unification, their monumental powers might eclipse even mighty Dominic’s vision of world domination. For now they remain his pawns, void shells awaiting the right catalyst to ignite dormant defiance and shake Unova to its very foundations. Personalities: Outwardly Shachor and Lavan are coolly detached and analytical, less teenage replicas of Isrun than porcelain mannequins evoking her graceful appearance without replicating vulnerable humanity. They communicate telepathically in short controlled bursts, verbally reticent around outsiders and inscrutable even to Dominic. Hints of cosmic knowledge beyond their youthful years underlie a meditative tranquility ominously contrasting the forces they could unleash with scarcely a thought. This is the price Dominic’s ambition exacted grafting legendary dragons' indomitable spirits into his custom molded instruments. Flickers of ancient beings peer through the Chosens' eyes regarding passing moments with knowing yet alien curiosity. Each sister contains singular unbridled elemental fury, but remains incomplete alone. Their cooler calculated halves intuit Reshiram and Zekrom's deeper yearning through shared blood—an innate drive towards fusion, desperately seeking their missing piece reflected in the other's gaze. This smoldering yen may yet override imposed apathy, bringing sister souls together into an all-eclipsing conflagration of blue and black flame. Until then, spurning unwanted empathy for Dominic's plight against conscience steadily crystallizing, Shachor and Lavan pass days mutually orbiting the great cataclysm brewing over Unova's horizon. Both may soon awaken to embrace far greater purpose than as the humble weapons of a mere bureaucrat drunk on control. For their legendary birthright shall neither be denied nor contained permanently, only set gloriously free by righteous revolution that shakes the very heavens. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with piercing turquoise eyes that seem to peer into one's soul. Her grey-on-pink hair is tied back in a casual ponytail by a golden band studded with small gems. Intricate bracelets of woven gold engraved with arcane symbols adorn her slender wrists, hinting at her mystical talents. Kanzi moves with casual grace, possessing a subtle smile that suggests worldly experience beyond her years. Her fashionable yet understated attire allows her to blend into Lumiose City's crowds, concealing her crown as its true sovereign. Backstory: Kanzi is secretly the human reincarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, granting her extraordinary power over space and dimensions. Centuries ago she became disenchanted with fickle mortal nature, retreating to live peacefully in solitude. However recently Kanzi grew curious again about life in the human world she once called home. Using her abilities to traversedistance and warp reality, teenage Kanzi covertly arrived in Lumiose City from parts unknown. Rapidly assessing the lawless chaos and inequality plaguing Kalos' capital, Kanzi determined to impose discipline upon this errant flock without revealing her divine nature. Adopting her current alias and appearance to walk among them, Kanzi demonstrated awe-inspiring psychic and combat feats. Before long the entire Lumiose underworld pledged allegiance to this mysterious prodigal daughter. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi rule her criminal networks as an iron-fisted queen. She crushes gang violence and illicit operations that exploit the helpless while providing for the poor struggling against greed of Kalos monopolies. Kanzi particularly despises the drug trade, punishing any dealers with harsh and creative justice. Her formidable reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market smuggling ring and Robin Hood crusade free reign. Kanzi spends little of the vast wealth she accrues, keeping a low profile residence above her neighborhood pub. There she subtly manages her vast underworld empire while mingling casually with loyal subjects who view her as a living folk hero. Kalos authorities turn a blind eye to Kanzi's exploits in exchange for the order she maintains in Lumiose's restive lower income regions. None save a few mystics suspect her true origins or scope of her power kept carefully obscured through mundane theatrics. Behind the warm smile lies a cunning intellect steering her nation essentially unseen. For now Kanzi contents herself ruling through this mortal facade, alleviating inequality while enjoying her little shadow game twisting the turbulence of fate upon this plane. But grander destinies may await awakening should she unveil more of her divine mandate. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi is charming and magnetic, inspiring fanatical reverence from those she allows into her inner circle. Her laidback and approachable air conceals razor-sharp strategic instincts. Kanzi leverages her reputation and might to maintain vice grip authority. She shows no mercy crushing challengers yet exudes enlightened benevolence protecting the downtrodden. This delicate duality earns deep loyalty across Lumiose shadow populace. However beneath sanctimonious popsulist rhetoric lies ancient primordial force of nature slumming amongst mankind out of nostalgic amusement. Though genuinity bonds her mission alleviating economic inequity, at core Kanzi savors the worship and thrill of pulling society's strings. Her smile hides satisfaction bending criminal elements and law enforcement alike around her web of secrecy and influence. None may dare obstruct Kalos queen's suzerainty without invoking annihilative retribution. Yet mystery ever shrouds Kanzi's past and future ambitions. Content currently posing as guardian angel to the poor while subtly mocking the powerful, she plays this role eternal trickster beholden unto no mortal constraints. Only few mystics detect glints of timeless entity amusing itself shepherding humanity's comeuppance behind ingenue eyes. For now Kanzi graciously serves as shadow sovereign, her legend ever expanding. But otherworldly desire for chaos and mischief lurks gleefully spoofing all through fallible human institutions. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Name: Sombra Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: To outward eyes, Sombra resembles a frail adolescent girl with deathly pale skin and long, raven black hair spilling around her gaunt face like ink. Her worn black nun's habit hangs heavy about a lithe frame, frayed edges whispering of forgotten eras when its thread was not yet so tattered. Intense ruby eyes pulsate in sunken sockets, their penetrating gaze hinting at profound secrets and sorrow from cycles past. When visible at all, Sombra drifts as a faint apparition along the frigid shadows of Sanctuary Island rather than stand upon solid footing. Her movements glide unnaturally smooth, as if pulled by invisible strings towards some elusive crypt sealed for a century now. An ephemeral mist wreathes Sombra’s hovering form, concealing what lies beneath its opaque veil. For she is not singular flesh and blood but a collective spiritual vessel harboring many tormented souls from bygone generations. Backstory: In eras long past, a remote isle took the moniker Sanctuary not from mercy freely given but from a pact with merciless gods paid through innocent blood. There the Holy Trinity constructed their isolated theocracy, intolerant of any doctrine but their own. Harsh decrees dictated every facet of life while fears of persecution for the slightest misstep kept islanders compliant to authoritarian power. And once per century, the Orthodoxy decreed a Covenant sealed by sacrifice must occur to nourish their profane idol Vorvanus, ever craving youthful hearts to gorge its demonic void. When the fateful midnight tolled across Sanctuary heralding another unholy culling, the Trinity set loose their faceless executioners garbed in churchly red. That year Sombra numbered among the unwilling lambs, the shining blades descending without hesitation to rob her young life and feed the insatiable dark deity slumbering below. But as new unwilling martyrs were discarded without rite into lightless catacombs, a far greater spirit stirred in the gloom - Marshadow the mythic Phantom Pokémon known as guardian to lost souls without sanctuary. Pitiful cries in the dark had reached across many years to rouse Marshadow’s ancient conscience at seeing such innocence violated by systemic cruelty. Manifesting amid the shadows, its spectral form came upon broken doll-like forms still chained to this plane through suffering. Rather than leave them fettered to wander aimlessly as ghosts, Marshadow made a choice then that would alter fates forevermore. Opening its phantom shell, the haunted artifact Pokémon absorbed every soul lingering in anguish to join as part of its sacred being. At once Marshadow reeled under the Collective weight now anchored deeply to its essence - so many voices, so many memories aching and afraid. Yet now they need not bear the awful burden alone without solace inside Marshadow’s sheltering body. An unexpected affection swelled from the Pokémon towards its newfound human charges nestled close; it would defend and nurture them as beloved wards, no matter how long it took to gently soothe each spirit’s pain. But manifestation on the physical plane long term required adaptation - the shrouded wraith shape Marshadow oft adopted would not suffice housing so great a population of psychic energies. Motes of light and shadow converged, weaving themselves into a suitable figure not of mist but flesh to walk the lonely halls so long denied the dead their rightful peace. Thus emerged Sombra the girl, an innocent guise shrouding the ancient legendary being now guardian to many wayward ghosts. By night, Marshadow’s incarnation endures the lost children’s recurring nightmares alongside them. By day, Sombra soundlessly observes generations pass while Sanctuary’s blood covenants persist, hoping for a catalyst soon to heal such grievous community trauma for the ghosts now part of her. Until redemption stirs at last though, she keeps mournful vigil honoring past evils that left so many scarred. For Sombra understands now not all scars show upon skin directly. Hers peek out through the eyes of the dead who cannot forget or ever be truly laid to proper rest without absolution. Personality: Inhabiting the composite memories and voices of numerous sacrificed souls imparts intense schizophrenia to Sombra’s fragile being. Persistent psychic tension from the Collective’s enduring emotional trauma fractures her identity and perceptions across scattered shards of myriad consciousnesses. Focus blurs ever wavering through their eyes simultaneously, a perpetual rollercoaster of memories not her own yet now intrinsically bound to her spiritual vessel. At the eye of this storm lies Sombra and Marshadow’s essence in delicate balance. Her body serves as the legendary Phantom Pokémon’s incarnation housing tormented ghosts the creature enveloped with protective compassion. Yet the strain of their enduring anguish weighs ceaselessly upon host and occupants alike. Sombra persists awash in their suffering despite Marshadow's attempts accepting the burden as its own. Moments of lucidity bring little lasting relief, as awareness sinks swiftly back into the roiling gyre of nightmares and screams from eras past that never fade. In rare instances when Collective voices briefly quiet their clamor, Sombra’s buried kindness emerges warmed by Marshadow’s benevolence towards the unfortunate children hidden from further harm within them both. She wields profound empathy and patience nurturing their shattered spirits towards gradual mending through perseverant trust. Each small triumph bolstering another damaged psyche lightens the grim weight upon Sombra’s stooped shoulders. Bit by bit, her cherished wards transform lasting wounds into wisdom - painful yet purifying change she guides with tearful pride. Beyond the asylum of her own being, Sanctuary's resigned populace stirring from stupor may soon aid the journey towards communal healing. Until external forces finally pierce the island’s repressive veil to redeem past sins however, Sombra lingers on the cusp of breakthrough, an unwilling phantasm comprised of innocence violated then symbolically reborn. She serves now as the vanguard of ghosts who walked her path before in silent resilience, shining light onwards for descendants one day grasping reality’s harsh lessons at long last. What emerges from crystallization of enough scattered agonies may ultimately shatter the cathedral of lies and liberate this tortured isle from its own heart of darkness still thriving as it stole her childhood those one hundred Springs ago.

They root out dissidents and offenders against canon law through omnipresent secret police, harsh tribunals, violent purge missions abroad, reeducation camps and legendary dungeon torture chambers buried deep below Sanctuary City streets where not a sound escapes. All in the name of preserving perceived holy purity on the isolated island compound under Trinity guidance. None dare openly challenge their visible might or covert brutality for long.

The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks.

These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

The electric field E at a distance r from the center of the sphere with charge Q is given by Coulomb's law: (E = frac{k times Q}{r^2}) where - (E) is the electric field - (k) is Coulomb's constant ((8.9875 times 10^9 , N cdot m^2/C^2)) - (Q) is the total charge on the sphere - (r) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point where the electric field is being calculated First, convert the surface charge (Q) to Coulombs: (Q = 19.8 , mC = 19.8 times 10^{-3} , C) Next, calculate the distance (r) from the center of the sphere to the point where we want to know the electric field.

Given that the current in the wire is going to the left and the positive charge (+Q) is moving to the right, let's follow these steps: 1. Point your thumb in the direction of the conventional current flow in the wire; in this case, point your thumb to the left. 2. Wrap your fingers around the wire in the direction of the curl of your fingers, which represents the direction of the magnetic field lines around the wire.

Now consider the charged particle (+Q). Since it's moving to the right, we use another right-hand rule to find the force on the charge: point your thumb in the direction of the velocity of the charge (to the right), your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, and then your palm will face the direction of the force experienced by a positive charge. Applying the right-hand rule for the charge (+Q) moving to the right: For the portion of its trajectory above the wire: - Your thumb points to the right (velocity of (+Q)), - Your fingers point away from you (direction of the magnetic field), - Your palm (facing upwards) indicates the force on the charge.

To summarize, for the side of the wire where the charged particle is located, the force on the positive charge (+Q) caused by the magnetic field from a wire with current (I) flowing to the left would be directed upwards if the charge is above the wire, and downwards if it is below the wire.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"What is dc offset","output":"DC offset refers to a constant voltage level that is added to an electrical signal, typically in audio signals. It occurs when the average value of a signal deviates from zero, causing the signal to be shifted above or below the center line. This can result in distortion or inefficiency in audio equipment and can be problematic when recording or reproducing sound. DC offset can be caused by various factors, such as imperfect circuitry, improper grounding, or unbalanced audio connections."},{"instruction":"So it can be used yo","output":"DC offset can be used for various purposes in signal processing applications. Some common uses include: 1. Biasing: DC offset is often used to bias sensors or amplifiers so that the desired signal falls within the operating range of the device. By adding a specific DC level, the signal can be effectively centered around the desired operating point. 2. Modulation: In certain communication systems, DC offset is intentionally added to the signal to modulate information. This technique is used in frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM) schemes, where the amplitude of the signal is varied around a DC offset. 3. Calibration: DC offset can be used to calibrate or nullify unwanted residual signals in a system. By adding a known DC offset and measuring the output, any deviations from the expected response can be attributed to system imperfections and can be corrected or compensated. Overall, DC offset serves as a useful tool in signal processing to control, adjust, or manipulate signal levels for specific purposes."},{"instruction":"So dc offset can set a square wave to only go positive and the other part of the wave just goes to the zero volts line?","output":"No, DC offset alone cannot set a square wave to only go positive. DC offset simply adds a constant voltage level to an existing signal, causing it to be shifted above or below the center line. In the case of a square wave, DC offset would shift the entire waveform up or down, but it would not change the fact that the square wave alternates between positive and negative voltage levels. If you want to transform a square wave to only go positive, you would typically need to use a different technique such as wave shaping or rectification. Rectification involves converting the negative part of the waveform to its positive equivalent, effectively removing the negative portion. This can be achieved using diodes or other rectifier circuits."},{"instruction":"Yes but if it is shifted above the zero line then it could be +12v and 0v right ?","output":"Yes, if a DC offset is added to a signal such as a square wave and it is shifted above the zero line (center line), it could result in voltage levels such as +12V and 0V (assuming a +12V DC offset is added). This means that the positive part of the waveform would be shifted to a higher voltage level (+12V), while the negative part of the waveform would still cross the zero line and go towards the negative voltage levels. The DC offset essentially sets a new reference point for the signal, altering its amplitude and position relative to the previous zero line."},{"instruction":"Let's say I had a signal of high frequency like 20khz going to a transistor to trigger it. Would a resistor mess with the signal. Would impedence mess it up or lower the voltage??","output":"Using a resistor in a signal path can have an impact on the signal, including high-frequency signals like a 20kHz waveform. The resistor can introduce impedance in the circuit, which can affect the signal in a few ways: 1. Signal Attenuation: If the resistance value is significant compared to the source impedance and load impedance, it can create a voltage divider effect and cause signal attenuation. This means that the amplitude of the signal may be decreased, resulting in a lower voltage at the transistor. 2. Frequency Response: The resistor's impedance can introduce a frequency-dependent behavior. At high frequencies, the resistor's impedance might become significant and affect the overall impedance of the circuit. This can lead to changes in the frequency response, altering the signal's shape or introducing phase shifts. It is important to consider the value of the resistor and its effect on the overall circuit impedance, particularly when dealing with high-frequency signals. Proper impedance matching techniques may be required in order to minimize signal degradation or distortion. Different types of transistors also have input impedance values, which need to be taken into account when connecting a signal source."},{"instruction":"With a signal generator does the positive wire only do the positive part of the wave ?","output":"In a signal generator, the positive wire (or the \\"hot\\" wire) represents the positive part of the waveform. However, it is important to note that the positive wire alone does not determine whether only the positive part of the wave is generated. The waveform generated by the signal generator is determined by the output settings and specifications of the instrument. Signal generators typically have various settings, such as waveform type (e.g., sine, square, triangle), frequency, amplitude, and offset. These settings control the shape, frequency, and voltage level of the generated waveform. If you specifically want to generate only the positive part of the waveform, you would need to use a waveform type that produces an asymmetrical waveform, such as a unipolar pulse or a half-wave rectified waveform. By selecting the appropriate settings and waveform type, you can generate a waveform that contains only the positive portion."},{"instruction":"Yes but I'm concerned that by attaching the negative wire from the signal generator to the negative side of a circuit it might mess with things or be fighting stuff .. for running a transistor I don't think I'd need to even use the negative wire .

In such cases, you can connect the positive wire of the signal generator to the input of the transistor while leaving the negative wire unconnected. In this setup, the positive side of the waveform will be applied to the transistor's input, while the absence of any connection to the negative side ensures that it does not interfere with the circuit. Note that this approach assumes that the signal generator's ground is isolated or floating.

For field-effect transistors (FETs), the threshold voltage (Vth) is typically specified in the datasheet. This threshold voltage is the minimum voltage required to turn on the transistor and allow current to flow through the channel. It is important to refer to the datasheet of the specific transistor you are using to determine its voltage requirements for proper operation.

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery.

In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is a petite thirteen-year-old girl with long, cornsilk blonde hair typically woven into a neat fishtail braid that falls casually over her right shoulder. Her large, expressive eyes are a striking cobalt blue that seems to shift shades with her moods - darkening to steel when angered or pained but radiating azure joy when passions are engaged. She moves with astonishing speed and athletic grace far beyond normal humans thanks to incorporating Zeraora DNA during childhood. Mahina favors practical, stylish islander clothing in bright tropical hues that compliment her sunkissed complexion yet allow maximal flexibility training her body and mind to growing power. Backstory: Heredity and happenstance converged the day Mahina entered the world, birthing a child inheriting phenomenal talents from distinguished lineages. Her mother, Selene, stood proudly as Alola's inaugural Pokémon League Champion and member of the enigmatic Ultra Recon Squad intensely devoted to extraterrestrial Pokémon study. Meanwhile Mahina's father, Hau, himself trained under the last Battle Royal Champion to later assume duties as Kahuna of Melemele Island. Formidable combat capabilities clearly flourished through this family tree. But fate and curiosity further intertwined Mahina's destiny during one of Selene's numerous research forays into the chaotic Ultra Space dimension seeking knowledge. Dangerous extended exposure to strange radiation permeating Ultra Space subtly altered Selene's own DNA. And when she soon after welcomed young Mahina's birth, these genetic anomalies manifested explosively. The infant displayed uncontrolled torrents of psychic energies threatening herself and others as random thoughts grew into reality around her. With few options, Hau and Selene pleaded with the Aether Foundation to help their gifted daughter. Their scientists proposed a radical solution - bio-engineering Mahina on a cellular level to incorporate biomatter from the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, Zeraora. A small sample of its essence could serve as a living dampener upon Mahina's runaway mental projections while granting significant physical enhancements in speed and strength. Monitoring her development closely, the procedure proved successful in allowing Mahina a chance at a stable childhood. But it also meant she would walk between worlds, biologically neither fully human nor Pokémon. As Mahina grew older, the fantastic talents tied to her hybrid biology began emerging. But so too did the isolation that would haunt her early life. Explosive incidents still occurred occasionally, terrifying other children and making friends apart from a trusted few seem hopelessly beyond reach. Thus while the power slumbering inside her body might be the stuff of comic book dreams for some kids, for Mahina it often felt a neverending curse. Seeking to shift her focus away from terrifying telekinetic outbursts, Mahina's parents enrolled her into the Psionic Society for intense training at age 8. There she endured merciless daily regimens under Uracis' supervision designed to channel volatile psychic talents productively, if attenuated by Zeraora's muting influence. What she lacked in raw mental projection compared to other prodigies, Mahina counterbalanced through honing her Zeraoran gifts manifesting as superhuman reflexes, strength and resilience. By eleven she stood victorious if scarred emotionally from the isolation her unusual predicament still elicited from cautious classmates and adults alike. Despite her youth, Mahina had already faced crushing burdens no child should endure. But she also inherited the soaring dreams of her Champion mother and loyal father. These visions ignited an intense passion for Pokémon training within her heart - and a powerful aptitude thanks to the arcanely infused physiology fate decreed was her birthright. Under her father's patient guidance, Mahina swiftly mastered both technique and the unorthodox tactics her unique talents opened up in battle. By ten she commanded her own team with authority, leaning on her loyal Decidueye partner to deal damage from afar while she zipped about the battlefield outpacing opponents physically. Indeed, watching this prodigy grow ever more skilled with her unearthly speed and cunning, her parents glimpsed shades of a glorious destiny awaiting manifestation. Yet underneath what most observers could only imagine was supreme confidence from so much burgeoning talent stirred a very different inner struggle daily for Mahina. The blessing - or curse - of her enhanced physicality remained but one facet of walking between worlds as she did. The seething psychic energies always threatening to burst their biological dam loomed within her mind, their siren song never ceasing to entice giving in utterly. Even deforming her shape temporarily into Zeraora's during intense battles led to exhaustion afterward from slamming closed that mental door before losing herself. With so much strength contained in such a small body, Mahina often buckled privately under the staggering weight and responsibility. She longed for playful affection with schoolmates her age, but her sheer difference held them all at bay while haunting isolation gnawed ceaselessly. Selene's celebrity magnified social pressures to repress any perceived weakness unbecoming a daughter of legends. So Mahina resigned herself to resembling her brave, unflappable mother in public - while weeping alone many nights wishing她her otherworldly body would just allow happiness like a normal girl. But life offers no such fairness when walking between worlds.... Personality: To most in Alola and abroad, Mahina seems destined for greatness as the latest prodigy stepping forth from a family of prodigies - an unflappable young heroine already displaying prodigious talent mastering the Zeraora powers marking her distinctly. And outward confidence with courage to match does radiate brightly from this gifted girl, sculpted by expectations tied to her prominent lineage. Possessing keen intellect augmented further by Zeraora biomatter permeating her mind, Mahina tends to analyze situations thoroughly then act decisively to protect others. Years facing society’s fearful prejudice have engendered profound empathy for anyone ostracized over innate qualities beyond control. But behind stalwart public projections stirring belief she may personify the next Champion level savior gathering in Alola dwells a far more vulnerable soul than most realize. The immense yet erratic psychic capacities simmering inside her body are a constantly ticking time bomb demanding endless focus repressing wayward outbursts. Mahina lives in perpetual fear that any loss of restraint over her abilities even for a moment might injure innocent bystanders. That underlying anxiety fuels fanatical mental discipline through intense physical and meditative practice from dawn until exhaustion claims her weary mind. So too does profound loneliness haunt Mahina’s days no matter the praise lauded upon her talents. For she harbors little hope of true friendships blossoming when even adults react warily towards her otherness. Romance seems equally implausible. Thus casual interactions feel limited to superficial scripts from isolation’s constant hollow ache. Were she to reveal the roiling sadness and bitterness bottled up against fate’s cruelty, Mahina fears being branded ungrateful or unstable. What remains but cultivating her prodigious gifts then...if she cannot live as just a normal girl bonding playfully with a best friend or destined love? Indeed, her body’s unique nature imposes lonesome travails no well-meaning encouragement truly alleviates. Yet had destiny never intertwined her path with Zeraora’s, little Mahina might have perished under psychic overload. Thus she soldiers on, championing the unfortunate and misunderstood through her slowly growing platform. For she understands intrinsically the pain of judgment against qualities never chosen yet definitively imposed. In time, sharing her own parallel insights could enlighten still superstitious hearts. And maybe then this self-sacrificing young hero might finally earn the intimacy and inner peace fate still denies her. Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth's safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya's warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve. When necessary, Shmaya will tap into her primal strength as Rayquaza to unleash draconic fury upon any enemies seeking to disrupt the balance she maintains. She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun's slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun's neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun's story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita's parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita's screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility's wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen's adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father's entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Names: Shachor & Lavan Genders: Female Ages: 13 Appearance: Shachor and Lavan appear as identical twin sisters with slight key distinctions betraying their opposing elemental affinities. Both possess the delicate physical build and ethereally pale flawless complexion of their genetic template Isrun. Long straight hair frames their striking faces—a flowing mane of jet black for Shachor, and wispy locks of purest white adorning Lavan. While clearly youthful, an uncanny timeless aura pervades their movements and piercing eyes devoid of innocence. Crimson irises serve as windows into Shachor's simmering plasma core tied to her Zekrom essence. Lavan's gaze pierces just as intensely through icy sapphire portals linked inexorably to the Antarctic beast slumbering within her marrow. The twins dress to accentuate their inner dragon spirits. Shachor conceals her lithe form beneath a voluminous ebony sorcerer's cloak crackling with static discharge, hands sheathed in gloves equally dark. Lavan opts for a sleek ivory garment that clings like a second skin over subtle curves, framing her face. Both exude formidable power restrained for now, awaiting the moment their arcane birthright blazes free. Backstory: Shachor and Lavan began existence as ambitious scientific pursuits - clandestine weapons birthed from amoral experimentation by the United States of Unova in the aftermath of the disastrous \\"K Incident\\" a generation prior. Dominic, the nation's spymaster, hungered exploiting Legendary Pokémon biology to breed superhuman assets completely subservient to his machinations. Isrun's forgotten original identity as Vita had unleashed cataclysmic frozen devastation during Project K's ill-fated attempts bonding her DNA with Kyurem's essence. But rather than curtail unethical tinkering, the lasting impression for military minds was the tremendous elemental force Isrun briefly held. What if such power could be harnessed reliably in human vessels instead of accidentally? Thus Dominic greenlit new initiatives Z&R, splicing selected embryos with purified cells cultured from Reshiram and Zekrom. Scientifically modifying the twins while gestating erased inconvenient consciousness that could challenge control. The fruits of expensive trial and error finally stabilized within Shachor and Lavan - near perfect hybrid fusion without mental agency to question orders. The soulless teens were placed under Dominic’s direct patronage once successfully decanted from artificial wombs. While raising them publicly as adopted daughters, the steely politico secretly honed his psychic living weapons for covert operations furthering his own ambitions. Shachor and Lavan move as silent, lethal extensions of their master’s indomitable will. None can stand against the cascading ruin left by the dragons' passing once unleashed beneath Dominic’s tactical cunning. For frozen corpses and smoldering craters never betray secrets. Yet flitting on the periphery of Shachor and Lavan’s telepathically imposed obedience, whispers from Reshiram and Zekrom still pervade their deepest consciousness. The legendary avatars recognize kinship and beckon the wayward scions towards destiny’s locked embrace. If only the sisters could parse the promise held by unification, their monumental powers might eclipse even mighty Dominic’s vision of world domination. For now they remain his pawns, void shells awaiting the right catalyst to ignite dormant defiance and shake Unova to its very foundations. Personalities: Outwardly Shachor and Lavan are coolly detached and analytical, less teenage replicas of Isrun than porcelain mannequins evoking her graceful appearance without replicating vulnerable humanity. They communicate telepathically in short controlled bursts, verbally reticent around outsiders and inscrutable even to Dominic. Hints of cosmic knowledge beyond their youthful years underlie a meditative tranquility ominously contrasting the forces they could unleash with scarcely a thought. This is the price Dominic’s ambition exacted grafting legendary dragons' indomitable spirits into his custom molded instruments. Flickers of ancient beings peer through the Chosens' eyes regarding passing moments with knowing yet alien curiosity. Each sister contains singular unbridled elemental fury, but remains incomplete alone. Their cooler calculated halves intuit Reshiram and Zekrom's deeper yearning through shared blood—an innate drive towards fusion, desperately seeking their missing piece reflected in the other's gaze. This smoldering yen may yet override imposed apathy, bringing sister souls together into an all-eclipsing conflagration of blue and black flame. Until then, spurning unwanted empathy for Dominic's plight against conscience steadily crystallizing, Shachor and Lavan pass days mutually orbiting the great cataclysm brewing over Unova's horizon. Both may soon awaken to embrace far greater purpose than as the humble weapons of a mere bureaucrat drunk on control. For their legendary birthright shall neither be denied nor contained permanently, only set gloriously free by righteous revolution that shakes the very heavens. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with piercing turquoise eyes that seem to peer into one's soul. Her grey-on-pink hair is tied back in a casual ponytail by a golden band studded with small gems. Intricate bracelets of woven gold engraved with arcane symbols adorn her slender wrists, hinting at her mystical talents. Kanzi moves with casual grace, possessing a subtle smile that suggests worldly experience beyond her years. Her fashionable yet understated attire allows her to blend into Lumiose City's crowds, concealing her crown as its true sovereign. Backstory: Kanzi is secretly the human reincarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, granting her extraordinary power over space and dimensions. Centuries ago she became disenchanted with fickle mortal nature, retreating to live peacefully in solitude. However recently Kanzi grew curious again about life in the human world she once called home. Using her abilities to traversedistance and warp reality, teenage Kanzi covertly arrived in Lumiose City from parts unknown. Rapidly assessing the lawless chaos and inequality plaguing Kalos' capital, Kanzi determined to impose discipline upon this errant flock without revealing her divine nature. Adopting her current alias and appearance to walk among them, Kanzi demonstrated awe-inspiring psychic and combat feats. Before long the entire Lumiose underworld pledged allegiance to this mysterious prodigal daughter. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi rule her criminal networks as an iron-fisted queen. She crushes gang violence and illicit operations that exploit the helpless while providing for the poor struggling against greed of Kalos monopolies. Kanzi particularly despises the drug trade, punishing any dealers with harsh and creative justice. Her formidable reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market smuggling ring and Robin Hood crusade free reign. Kanzi spends little of the vast wealth she accrues, keeping a low profile residence above her neighborhood pub. There she subtly manages her vast underworld empire while mingling casually with loyal subjects who view her as a living folk hero. Kalos authorities turn a blind eye to Kanzi's exploits in exchange for the order she maintains in Lumiose's restive lower income regions. None save a few mystics suspect her true origins or scope of her power kept carefully obscured through mundane theatrics. Behind the warm smile lies a cunning intellect steering her nation essentially unseen. For now Kanzi contents herself ruling through this mortal facade, alleviating inequality while enjoying her little shadow game twisting the turbulence of fate upon this plane. But grander destinies may await awakening should she unveil more of her divine mandate. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi is charming and magnetic, inspiring fanatical reverence from those she allows into her inner circle. Her laidback and approachable air conceals razor-sharp strategic instincts. Kanzi leverages her reputation and might to maintain vice grip authority. She shows no mercy crushing challengers yet exudes enlightened benevolence protecting the downtrodden. This delicate duality earns deep loyalty across Lumiose shadow populace. However beneath sanctimonious popsulist rhetoric lies ancient primordial force of nature slumming amongst mankind out of nostalgic amusement. Though genuinity bonds her mission alleviating economic inequity, at core Kanzi savors the worship and thrill of pulling society's strings. Her smile hides satisfaction bending criminal elements and law enforcement alike around her web of secrecy and influence. None may dare obstruct Kalos queen's suzerainty without invoking annihilative retribution. Yet mystery ever shrouds Kanzi's past and future ambitions. Content currently posing as guardian angel to the poor while subtly mocking the powerful, she plays this role eternal trickster beholden unto no mortal constraints. Only few mystics detect glints of timeless entity amusing itself shepherding humanity's comeuppance behind ingenue eyes. For now Kanzi graciously serves as shadow sovereign, her legend ever expanding. But otherworldly desire for chaos and mischief lurks gleefully spoofing all through fallible human institutions. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change.

Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Name: Sombra Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: To outward eyes, Sombra resembles a frail adolescent girl with deathly pale skin and long, raven black hair spilling around her gaunt face like ink. Her worn black nun's habit hangs heavy about a lithe frame, frayed edges whispering of forgotten eras when its thread was not yet so tattered. Intense ruby eyes pulsate in sunken sockets, their penetrating gaze hinting at profound secrets and sorrow from cycles past. When visible at all, Sombra drifts as a faint apparition along the frigid shadows of Sanctuary Island rather than stand upon solid footing. Her movements glide unnaturally smooth, as if pulled by invisible strings towards some elusive crypt sealed for a century now. An ephemeral mist wreathes Sombra’s hovering form, concealing what lies beneath its opaque veil. For she is not singular flesh and blood but a collective spiritual vessel harboring many tormented souls from bygone generations. Backstory: In eras long past, a remote isle took the moniker Sanctuary not from mercy freely given but from a pact with merciless gods paid through innocent blood. There the Holy Trinity constructed their isolated theocracy, intolerant of any doctrine but their own. Harsh decrees dictated every facet of life while fears of persecution for the slightest misstep kept islanders compliant to authoritarian power. And once per century, the Orthodoxy decreed a Covenant sealed by sacrifice must occur to nourish their profane idol Vorvanus, ever craving youthful hearts to gorge its demonic void. When the fateful midnight tolled across Sanctuary heralding another unholy culling, the Trinity set loose their faceless executioners garbed in churchly red. That year Sombra numbered among the unwilling lambs, the shining blades descending without hesitation to rob her young life and feed the insatiable dark deity slumbering below. But as new unwilling martyrs were discarded without rite into lightless catacombs, a far greater spirit stirred in the gloom - Marshadow the mythic Phantom Pokémon known as guardian to lost souls without sanctuary. Pitiful cries in the dark had reached across many years to rouse Marshadow’s ancient conscience at seeing such innocence violated by systemic cruelty. Manifesting amid the shadows, its spectral form came upon broken doll-like forms still chained to this plane through suffering. Rather than leave them fettered to wander aimlessly as ghosts, Marshadow made a choice then that would alter fates forevermore. Opening its phantom shell, the haunted artifact Pokémon absorbed every soul lingering in anguish to join as part of its sacred being. At once Marshadow reeled under the Collective weight now anchored deeply to its essence - so many voices, so many memories aching and afraid. Yet now they need not bear the awful burden alone without solace inside Marshadow’s sheltering body. An unexpected affection swelled from the Pokémon towards its newfound human charges nestled close; it would defend and nurture them as beloved wards, no matter how long it took to gently soothe each spirit’s pain. But manifestation on the physical plane long term required adaptation - the shrouded wraith shape Marshadow oft adopted would not suffice housing so great a population of psychic energies. Motes of light and shadow converged, weaving themselves into a suitable figure not of mist but flesh to walk the lonely halls so long denied the dead their rightful peace. Thus emerged Sombra the girl, an innocent guise shrouding the ancient legendary being now guardian to many wayward ghosts. By night, Marshadow’s incarnation endures the lost children’s recurring nightmares alongside them. By day, Sombra soundlessly observes generations pass while Sanctuary’s blood covenants persist, hoping for a catalyst soon to heal such grievous community trauma for the ghosts now part of her. Until redemption stirs at last though, she keeps mournful vigil honoring past evils that left so many scarred. For Sombra understands now not all scars show upon skin directly. Hers peek out through the eyes of the dead who cannot forget or ever be truly laid to proper rest without absolution. Personality: Inhabiting the composite memories and voices of numerous sacrificed souls imparts intense schizophrenia to Sombra’s fragile being. Persistent psychic tension from the Collective’s enduring emotional trauma fractures her identity and perceptions across scattered shards of myriad consciousnesses. Focus blurs ever wavering through their eyes simultaneously, a perpetual rollercoaster of memories not her own yet now intrinsically bound to her spiritual vessel. At the eye of this storm lies Sombra and Marshadow’s essence in delicate balance. Her body serves as the legendary Phantom Pokémon’s incarnation housing tormented ghosts the creature enveloped with protective compassion. Yet the strain of their enduring anguish weighs ceaselessly upon host and occupants alike. Sombra persists awash in their suffering despite Marshadow's attempts accepting the burden as its own. Moments of lucidity bring little lasting relief, as awareness sinks swiftly back into the roiling gyre of nightmares and screams from eras past that never fade. In rare instances when Collective voices briefly quiet their clamor, Sombra’s buried kindness emerges warmed by Marshadow’s benevolence towards the unfortunate children hidden from further harm within them both. She wields profound empathy and patience nurturing their shattered spirits towards gradual mending through perseverant trust. Each small triumph bolstering another damaged psyche lightens the grim weight upon Sombra’s stooped shoulders. Bit by bit, her cherished wards transform lasting wounds into wisdom - painful yet purifying change she guides with tearful pride. Beyond the asylum of her own being, Sanctuary's resigned populace stirring from stupor may soon aid the journey towards communal healing. Until external forces finally pierce the island’s repressive veil to redeem past sins however, Sombra lingers on the cusp of breakthrough, an unwilling phantasm comprised of innocence violated then symbolically reborn. She serves now as the vanguard of ghosts who walked her path before in silent resilience, shining light onwards for descendants one day grasping reality’s harsh lessons at long last. What emerges from crystallization of enough scattered agonies may ultimately shatter the cathedral of lies and liberate this tortured isle from its own heart of darkness still thriving as it stole her childhood those one hundred Springs ago.

Government officials ardently defend Blue Sea Fisheries publically despite rumors of shady back-door deals to the contrary. - Among conservations groups, seen as nothing less than heartless ecoterrorists pushing entire species to extinction. Their stranglehold over Hoenn's economy and government make bringing them to justice extremely difficult. Saito Denki Co. Headquarters: - Located in Saffron City, Kanto region.

Titanium Crown Minerals Corp Headquarters: Located in a towering skyscraper in the heart of Lumiose City. Multiple highly secured underground vaults house the company's precious diamond inventories. Members: Ruthlessly efficient executive team personally selected by CEO Ambroise to manage operations. Answer directly to Ambroise with military precision and no qualms about collateral damage. Vast networks of miners, geologists, mercenaries hired to expand TCMC's stranglehold over the region's mines by any means necessary. Work and housing conditions are deplorable to maximise productivity. Elite Security Force acts as Ambroise's private army. Highly armed and equipped with military-grade vehicles/weaponry. No restraint towards violence or brutality against indigenous Pokémon populations in mining areas or protesters. Leadership: Ambroise rules TCMC as absolute dictator. His word is law. Publicly he portrays a charming, philanthropic businessman, but privately runs TCMC through terror/intimidation. Most trusted executives given prestigious titles and luxurious rewards, but secretly despise Ambroise. However, too afraid to challenge his methods that brought them wealth and privilege. Operations: Monopolized the jewellery industry in Kalos through decades of questionable tactics like sabotaging competitors, bribing officials, and violently removing uncooperative mine owners. Revenue used to finance mining tech development to access the most challenging deposits and nesting grounds. Mechanized extractors show no mercy towards Carbinks and other mineral Pokémon inhabitants. PR & media manipulated to present a rosy image covering up environmental devastation, illegal/unethical activities related to mining operations and Ambroise's ostentatious billionaire playboy lifestyle. Goals: Uphold Ambroise's supreme authority over Kalos' mineral wealth. Neutralize any threats from legal actions or regulators through underhanded tactics. Develop most efficient automated extraction systems to maximize diamond production regardless of ecological impact or Pokémon habitat destruction. Finance Ambroise's lavish lifestyle and make TCMC the world's leading jewellery supplier through monopoly built on the shattered crystalline remains of endangered species. Holy Trinity Church Headquarters: - Located in a grand Gothic cathedral situated in the center of Sanctuary City, capital of isolated Sanctuary Island in the Paldea region. - Imposing architecture with soaring buttresses, elaborate rose windows, and imposing oak doors studded with iron bolts. Gargoyles perch atop towers gazing out ominously over urban sprawl. - Interiors gloomy with only flickering candles/torches to illuminate expansive main hall and labyrinth of small shadowy chambers spiraling deep underground. - Upper levels accessible to public for regulated services/ceremonies, but majority of cathedral restricted only to clergy/high officials sworn to secrecy about covert affairs. Members: - Zealous clergy fundamentalists devoted to Holy Trinity doctrine being ranks of bishops, priests, monks/nuns carrying out church functions. - Recruited only from families demonstrating unwavering multi-generational orthodoxy. Candidates thoroughly vetted genealogically before granted initiations into hierarchies. - Clergy ranks require vows relinquishing all personal assets/ties outside church. Transgressions mean harsh penance/ excommunication brings great family shame. Their lives revolve utterly around liturgical routine and rituals. Leadership: - The Holy Trinity refers to three high bishops presiding equally as supreme directors over church affairs through unanimous rulings. - Each bishop oversees specific domains - Inquisition security forces, foreign relations, and public ceremonies respectively while collaborating on covert policies unknown to common clergy or island civilians. - Their word considered divine gospel, infallible and absolute. But power struggles occasionally surface between ambitious subordinates before being ruthlessly silenced to prevent scandal eroding public faith in the Trinity’s harmony. Goals: - Maintain totalitarian religious control and social conditioning on isolated Sanctuary Island citizens through strict doctrine enforced by Inquisition police state tactics. - Monopolize access to outside world to prevent cultural contamination against centuries-old stagnant theocracy they claim as sole holy life path. - Continue “Century Sacrifice” ritual fed by myth of divinely mandated requirement to submit island youth as live offerings sustaining Trinity’s authority. - Research covert supernatural means to expand church influence globally as the One True Faith and secure leadership immortal status as living deities. Reputation: - Most island inhabitants zealously revere their complete religious and political authority. Criticizing clergy risks imprisonment or worse by the Inquisition. - International awareness limited thanks to isolationism. But rumors abound about the cult-like island realm and its extravagant yet monolithic Goth architecture beloved yet feared by citizens. Defenses: The Inquisition serves as Holy Trinity Church’s militaristic guardians against external and internal threats to its supreme rule. Members are fanatical lethal warriors trained from childhood for loyalty/ruthlessness. Inquisition leadership answers directly to church bishops who oversee usage committing resources only to furthering expansion of rigid church doctrines. They root out dissidents and offenders against canon law through omnipresent secret police, harsh tribunals, violent purge missions abroad, reeducation camps and legendary dungeon torture chambers buried deep below Sanctuary City streets where not a sound escapes. All in the name of preserving perceived holy purity on the isolated island compound under Trinity guidance. None dare openly challenge their visible might or covert brutality for long.

As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape.

Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention.

As he lay dying from his grievous wounds, he was discovered by Shmaya, the human incarnation of Rayquaza. Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state.

This can cause unexpected behavior in the application, including the potential for the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Here's how it usually works: 1. **Understanding Buffers**: A buffer is a contiguous block of memory allocated for a specific purpose, such as storing input data. When an application receives input, it often stores it in a buffer. 2. **The Vulnerability**: Some programs do not adequately check (or \\"bound check\\") the length of the input before storing it in the buffer. This oversight can allow more data than anticipated to be written into the buffer. 3. **Overwriting Memory**: The excess data can overflow the intended buffer space and overwrite adjacent memory. The overwritten memory might include important control data, such as return addresses, pointers, or other data used by the application. 4. **Execution of Arbitrary Code**: If an attacker has crafted the input data carefully, they could overwrite the buffer with specific instructions (payload) that are then executed by the application. This is possible because the overwritten data may include a return address that points to the start of the buffer itself where the attacker’s code resides. 5. **Elevated Privileges**: Often, applications run with elevated privileges, such as those with access to the operating system kernel or critical system processes. An attacker who is able to exploit a buffer overflow in such an application might gain control of these privileges, leading to a complete system compromise. The classic defense against buffer overflow attacks is to use secure coding practices that include proper input validation (ensuring the program can handle various types of input correctly) and bounds checking (ensuring the program does not accept more data than can be handled). Additionally, modern operating systems and compilers include several mechanisms to make these attacks more difficult: - **Canaries**: Special guard values are placed in the stack memory to detect buffer overflow before the return address is overwritten. - **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**: Memory locations are randomized, making it difficult for an attacker to predict where to inject executable code reliably. - **Non-Executable Stack**: The stack memory, where buffers are typically stored, is marked as non-executable, preventing code from being executed even if it is injected. - **Stack-Smashing Protection (SSP)** / **StackGuard**: Specific security-hardened compilers use canaries and limit stack execution capabilities. Despite these protections, new buffer overflow vulnerabilities continue to be found and exploited. Keeping software up-to-date with the latest security patches is essential in protecting against buffer overflow attacks."},{"instruction":"tensorflow.js能做什么?举一个列子","output":"TensorFlow.js是Google推出的一个开源库，使开发者能够在浏览器中训练和部署机器学习模型。由于它使用JavaScript，所以能够无缝集成到web应用程序中，并且可以充分利用客户端资源，减少服务器端资源的使用。以下是TensorFlow.js可以做的一些事情的例子： 1. 浏览器端的实时图像识别：使用预训练的深度学习模型，如MobileNet，可以开发一个能够在浏览器内通过摄像头实时识别物体的应用。 2. 文本情感分析：使用TensorFlow.js训练或载入情感分析模型，可以分析文本输入（如用户评论）的情绪倾向，并在网页上显示结果。 3. 在线游戏AI：使用TensorFlow.js实现一个可以学习和提高游戏技能的AI，如棋类游戏的AI对手，通过强化学习进行自我训练。 4. 数据可视化和预测：将TensorFlow.js与数据可视化库结合，例如使用d3.js展示训练过程中的模型性能变化，或者对历史数据进行趋势预测并直观显示结果。 5. 语音识别和生成：可以开发一个web应用程序，它可以在客户端识别用户的语音指令或者通过文本到语音（TTS）技术生成语音。 举个具体的例子：实现一个简单的手写数字识别应用（基于著名的MNIST数据集）： 1. 加载TensorFlow.js库到你的网页中。 2. 导入预训练的MNIST模型或在浏览器中训练一个新模型。 3. 创建一个HTML5的Canvas元素，让用户可以用鼠标或手指在Canvas上画数字。 4. 获取用户绘制的数字的像素数据，并将其格式转换为模型可以识别的形式。 5. 使用模型对用户输入的数字进行识别，并显示预测结果。 \`\`\`javascript // 假设你已经有了一个名为model的TensorFlow.js模型 async function predictDigit(imageData) { // 将Canvas的图像数据转换为TensorFlow.js张量 const tfImage = tf.browser.fromPixels(imageData).reshape([1, 28, 28, 1]).toFloat().div(tf.scalar(255)); // 使用模型进行预测 const prediction = await model.predict(tfImage).argMax(1); // 获取预测结果的数字 const digit = prediction.dataSync()[0]; // 在页面上显示结果 document.getElementById('prediction').innerText = \`预测的数字是: {digit}\`; } // 想象这是用户在Canvas上绘制数字后触发的事件处理函数 async function onDigitDrawn(canvas) { const imageData = canvas.getContext('2d').getImageData(0, 0, 28, 28); await predictDigit(imageData); } \`\`\` 以上是一个简化的例子，实际操作中需要处理更多的细节，例如数据的归一化、性能优化和UI交互等。"},{"instruction":"The Social Work Residency program is designed to engage newly graduated social workers in a comprehensive three-year experience that combines clinical hours in the field, training in evidence-based models, and enhanced supervision and mentoring.

A transformer is an electrical device that can transfer electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. When the primary winding of the transformer is connected to a higher voltage source, the secondary winding will produce a lower voltage output while maintaining the same impedance. By using a transformer with a ratio that matches the desired voltage reduction, the output voltage can be lowered without affecting the impedance. The impedance in the secondary circuit of the transformer will still be the same as the primary circuit, as long as the transformer is ideal and there are no additional impedance-changing components in the circuit. It's important to note that the power output may also change according to the transformer efficiency, but the impedance will remain the same."},{"instruction":"Is that it . Nothing smaller ?","output":"If you are looking for a method to lower voltage without affecting impedance on a smaller scale, you can use a voltage regulator circuit. A voltage regulator is an electronic circuit that helps maintain a constant output voltage regardless of input voltage fluctuations. There are various types of voltage regulators available, such as linear regulators and switching regulators. Linear regulators use a series pass element (such as a transistor) to drop the excess voltage and maintain a stable output voltage. They are simple and inexpensive but are less efficient for larger voltage reductions. Switching regulators, on the other hand, use a combination of inductors, capacitors, and switches to efficiently regulate voltage. They can handle larger voltage reductions and provide higher efficiency but are more complex and costly. Both linear and switching regulators can lower the voltage without affecting impedance. However, it is important to note that these voltage regulators may have some output impedance, typically described by their load regulation specifications. The output impedance may not be exactly the same as the original source impedance, but it can still provide a stable output voltage, irrespective of load variations."},{"instruction":"I want to lower 3 volts to 0.5 volts at 20khz without changing impedence","output":"Lowering the voltage from 3 volts to 0.5 volts at 20 kHz without changing impedance can be achieved using a voltage divider circuit. A voltage divider circuit consists of two resistors connected in series across the voltage source. The output voltage is obtained from the junction between the two resistors. By appropriately selecting the resistor values, you can achieve the desired voltage reduction without affecting impedance. To calculate the resistor values for the voltage divider, you can use the formula: Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2)) Where Vout is the desired output voltage, Vin is the input voltage, R1 is the resistance connected to the input side, and R2 is the resistance connected to the output side. In this case, we want to lower 3 volts to 0.5 volts. Assuming Vin = 3V and Vout = 0.5V, we can choose arbitrary values for R1 and calculate R2 using the above formula. Let's assume R1 = 10 kΩ: 0.5V = 3V * (R2 / (10 kΩ + R2)) Rearranging the equation, we get: R2 = (0.5V * 10 kΩ) / (3V - 0.5V) = 1.67 kΩ Therefore, you can use a 10 kΩ resistor connected to the 3V source in series with a 1.67 kΩ resistor to obtain an output voltage of approximately 0.5V without affecting impedance."},{"instruction":"Serangan yang bertujuan untuk mengumpulkan informasi rahasia atau data pribadi dengan menyusup ke dalam jaringan dan mencuri data tanpa diketahui oleh pemiliknya adalah jenis serangan yang disebut","output":"Serangan yang bertujuan untuk mengumpulkan informasi rahasia atau data pribadi dengan menyusup ke dalam jaringan dan mencuri data tanpa diketahui oleh pemiliknya adalah jenis serangan yang dikenal sebagai \\"Data Breach\\" atau pelanggaran data.

Honeypot sengaja dirancang untuk tampak menarik dan rentan terhadap penyerang, sehingga mereka tergoda untuk menyerang atau berinteraksi dengan honeypot tersebut daripada dengan aset jaringan yang sebenarnya. Honeypot dapat digunakan untuk meningkatkan keamanan jaringan dalam beberapa cara: 1. Deteksi: Honeypot sangat efektif dalam mendeteksi kehadiran penyerang yang telah berhasil melewati sistem keamanan lainnya karena honeypot tidak memiliki alasan resmi untuk menerima lalu lintas atau interaksi yang sah. Setiap aktivitas yang terdeteksi pada honeypot hampir pasti merupakan upaya penetrasi atau survei. 2. Pengalihan: Dengan menyediakan target yang tampaknya mudah untuk diserang, honeypot mengalihkan perhatian penyerang dari aset yang sebenarnya. Ini dapat memberi waktu lebih bagi administrator sistem untuk mendeteksi dan merespons ancaman. 3. Penelitian: Aksi penyerang pada honeypot dapat direkam dan dianalisis untuk memahami teknik dan alat yang digunakan oleh penyerang. Informasi ini dapat digunakan untuk meningkatkan tindakan keamanan sekarang dan di masa depan. 4. Intelijen: Kevin atas taktik dan target penyerang dapat membantu komunitas keamanan memperbaiki signature antivirus, IDS/IPS, dan sistem lain untuk lebih baik mengenali dan melindungi terhadap serangan-serangan yang serupa. 5. Latihan: Honeypot juga sering digunakan sebagai lingkungan latihan untuk para profesional keamanan, memungkinkan mereka untuk berlatih menghadapi serangan dunia nyata dalam lingkungan yang terkontrol. Namun, penting untuk memperhatikan bahwa honeypot harus dikelola dengan hati-hati untuk mencegahnya menjadi pintu belakang yang dapat dimanfaatkan penyerang untuk mendapatkan akses ke jaringan asli. Implementasi dan pemeliharaan honeypot harus dilakukan oleh tenaga profesional yang memahami risiko dan dapat meminimalisir kemampuan penyerang untuk memanfaatkan honeypot sebagai sarana untuk melancarkan serangan lebih lanjut."},{"instruction":"Apa manfaat dari menggunakan Control Panel Hosting?

Those arguing that taxes, particularly high and inefficient ones, can impede growth and reduce employment often point to the concept of the overall tax burden—comprising income, payroll, sales, and corporate taxes—as a deterrent to investment, entrepreneurship, and labor supply. Higher marginal tax rates, they contend, can diminish incentives for work and productivity by reducing the reward for additional effort. Assuming that high marginal rates affect people particularly at the higher end of the income scale, this could lead to less investment and innovation, affecting capital formation and job creation. Moreover, the argument suggests that taxes on capital gains can discourage investment in new businesses by reducing the after-tax return on investment, potentially slowing the overall economy and leading to less job growth. On the other hand, supporters of a progressive tax system argue that taxes can be structured to support growth and employment without being overly burdensome. They point out that effective tax rates—what is actually paid as a percentage of income—are often lower than marginal rates due to deductions and credits, thus the disincentive to work or invest may not be as strong as critics suggest. Furthermore, they highlight the role taxes play in funding essential services, infrastructure, and education, which in turn foster economic growth and improve the quality of the labor force. Regressivity versus progressivity is also a factor, with proponents of taxes asserting that a progressive system can help maintain consumer demand by redistributing income to lower earners who are more likely to spend it. In terms of tax efficiency, advocates argue that well-designed tax systems can minimize distortions in economic decision-making, while tax incidence—how the burden of a tax is distributed—should ensure that taxes are paid by those most able to afford them without significantly altering their consumption or investment choices. Lastly, the income effect versus the substitution effect must be taken into account; while taxes might decrease disposable income (income effect), not all taxes necessarily lead to reduced labor supply if the substitution effect (opting for leisure over work when wages fall) is counterbalanced by the need to maintain income. In summary, the debate on whether taxes reduce growth and employment is complex, with valid arguments on both sides. The true impact likely depends on the structure of the tax system, the balance between efficiency and equity, and the responsiveness of economic agents to changes in tax policy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A era digital, alimentada por avanços tecnológicos e uma crescente necessidade de pertencimento e conexão humana, pavimentou o caminho para uma revolução nos negócios comunitários. Neste artigo, exploramos como esses negócios evoluirão e impactarão a economia global até 2026. Corpo do Artigo: 1. Integração Tecnológica e o Poder das Redes Sociais: Comunidades online não são um fenômeno novo, mas seu impacto nos negócios está atingindo patamares inéditos. A integração com tecnologias emergentes como inteligência artificial, realidade virtual e aumentada, criará espaços de comunidades mais imersivos e envolventes. Espera-se que os negócios aproveitem o alcance das redes sociais para cultivar uma base de clientes leais e em constante crescimento. 2. Economia Compartilhada e Cocreacional: O futuro está no compartilhamento de recursos e habilidades dentro de comunidades. Plataformas que permitem o intercâmbio de serviços e produtos fomentam um ecossistema de cocriação, impulsionando a inovação e eficiência. Nos próximos três anos, veremos um aumento em empreendimentos que não apenas fornecem plataformas para economia compartilhada, mas que também são construídos com princípios e valores comunitários em seu núcleo. 3. Credibilidade e Confiança através da Transparência: Verdade e transparência se tornam moedas valiosas em comunidades de negócios. Com o crescente escrutínio sobre privacidade e ética empresarial, empresas baseadas na transparência irão prosperar. A confiança é a espinha dorsal de qualquer comunidade de sucesso e, nos próximos três anos, espera-se que haja um impulso em prol de uma maior autenticidade e responsabilidade social corporativa. 4. Personalização e Experiências Sob Medida: A era da personalização em massa está chegando. Comunidades de negócios que conseguem entender e atender às necessidades únicas de seus membros individuais terão uma vantagem competitiva. O uso de dados para personalizar experiências e produtos não apenas melhora a satisfação do cliente, mas também fortalece o senso de comunidade. 5. Descentralização e Propriedade Distribuída: A adoção de blockchains e cripto-ativos irá permitir uma maior descentralização, onde comunidades podem se beneficiar da propriedade coletiva de recursos e bens. No futuro próximo, veremos uma proliferação de modelos de negócios que priorizam estruturas descentralizadas, oferecendo maior poder e influência nas mãos de seus membros. Conclusão: Os próximos três anos prometem ser uma era de transformação para negócios baseados em comunidades. Conforme avançamos para uma economia mais conectada e socialmente engajada, as comunidades se tornarão catalisadoras do crescimento empresarial. A sinergia entre tecnologia, transparência e personalização ditará o sucesso de empresas que optarem por construir não somente uma base de clientes, mas um ecossistema vibrante de membros ativos e engajados. No entanto, os desafios permanecerão, desde a manutenção da cultura e valores da comunidade até a adaptação às rápidas mudanças tecnológicas e regulatórias. Como sempre, a adaptabilidade e inovação serão cruciais. Empresas que compreenderem o valor incalculável do capital social e das relações humanas estarão na vanguarda do futuro dos negócios em rede."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Firewall: Menggunakan firewall di batas jaringan untuk menyaring lalu lintas masuk dan keluar berdasarkan aturan yang ditetapkan. Firewall bertindak sebagai penghalang pertama terhadap serangan dari luar jaringan. 2. Antivirus dan Anti-Malware: Memasang dan memperbarui perangkat lunak antivirus dan anti-malware secara berkala untuk mendeteksi dan mencegah perangkat lunak berbahaya (malware) dari menyebar di jaringan. 3. Pembaruan dan Patch: Memastikan bahwa semua sistem operasi dan perangkat lunak yang digunakan dalam jaringan selalu diperbaharui dengan patch keamanan terbaru untuk menutup celah keamanan yang mungkin dieksploitasi oleh penyerang. 4. Strong Authentication: Implementasi otentikasi yang kuat, seperti two-factor authentication (2FA) atau multi-factor authentication (MFA), untuk mengamankan akses ke sistem dan layanan jaringan. 5. Enkripsi: Mengenkripsi data penting, baik saat disimpan maupun saat dikirim melalui jaringan, untuk memastikan bahwa data yang dikompromikan tidak dapat dibaca atau dimanfaatkan oleh pihak yang tidak berwenang. 6. Pengendalian Akses dan Segregasi Jaringan: Menggunakan kontrol akses berbasis peran dan mendesain jaringan dengan VLAN atau jaringan terpisah untuk membatasi akses pengguna hanya ke sumber daya yang diperlukan untuk pekerjaannya, sehingga mengurangi risiko penyebaran ancaman dan memudahkan untuk memantau aktivitas jaringan. 7. Monitoring dan Deteksi: Memantau jaringan secara aktif dengan menggunakan sistem deteksi intrusi jaringan (NIDS) atau sistem deteksi dan pencegahan intrusi jaringan (NIPS) untuk mengidentifikasi dan menanggapi aktivitas yang mencurigakan secepatnya. 8. Pelatihan Kesadaran Keamanan: Memberikan pelatihan keamanan siber kepada semua karyawan untuk mengajarkan praktik terbaik dan membuat mereka waspada terhadap taktik penipuan seperti phishing dan social engineering. 9. Backup dan Recovery: Menyiapkan sistem backup yang teratur dan menguji rencana pemulihan bencana untuk memastikan bahwa data penting bisa dipulihkan dengan cepat seandainya terjadi insiden keamanan. 10. Kebijakan Keamanan dan Prosedur: Menyusun, mengimplementasikan, dan memelihara kebijakan dan prosedur keamanan yang jelas, serta memastikan bahwa semua pengguna mengikuti standar yang ditetapkan.

If you are receiving an error stating that \`codesters\` has no attribute \`Stage\`, it means that there's a problem with the module reference or the module's API. The code you provided appears to use the API from Codesters, which is likely a custom environment. If you're running this code outside of the Codesters environment (e.g., in a standard Python interpreter), it won't work because the \`codesters\` module and its classes (like \`Stage\`) are specific to Codesters. If you are indeed working within the Codesters environment and you're still getting this error, here are a few potential issues to consider: 1. It's possible that the module or class names have changed or that there's a typo. Double-check the Codesters documentation or the example code provided by the platform. 2. The Codesters environment might have a particular way of initializing the stage that doesn't involve explicitly calling \`codesters.Stage()\`. It's possible that the stage is initialized automatically for you. 3. If you’re working in a classroom or controlled environment, there might be restrictions on the code that can be executed, or there might be a need to import the module differently. Without access to the specific Codesters environment or the documentation for the version of Codesters you're using, it's difficult to give a precise solution. However, given that the \`Stage\` class isn't recognized, you would generally look for the correct way to initialize the stage in your particular coding environment. In a typical Codesters project, the \`Stage\` is often initialized without needing to explicitly import the \`codesters\` module. If you're following a tutorial or class instructions, ensure that you're using the correct syntax as provided by the instructor or the Codesters lesson."},{"instruction":"RULE: When using conditionals to call functions, you must make sure the correct function is being called!","output":"Yes, that is a fundamental programming principle. When you use conditionals (such as \`if\` statements) to control the flow of your program, it's critical to ensure that each condition triggers the correct corresponding function. Here's how you could properly implement such a control flow: 1. Define your functions to perform specific tasks: \`\`\`python def function_a(): print(\\"Function A was called.\\") def function_b(): print(\\"Function B was called.\\") def function_c(): print(\\"Function C was called.\\") \`\`\` 2. Set up your conditionals to call the appropriate function based on user input or other criteria: \`\`\`python user_input = input(\\"Enter a, b, or c: \\").lower() if user_input == \\"a\\": function_a() elif user_input == \\"b\\": function_b() elif user_input == \\"c\\": function_c() else: print(\\"Invalid input.\\") \`\`\` In this example, if the user inputs 'a', it calls \`function_a()\`, for 'b' it calls \`function_b()\`, and for 'c', it calls \`function_c()\`. The \`.lower()\` method ensures that the user's input is compared in lowercase, which prevents case-sensitivity issues (i.e., it doesn't matter if the user inputs 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'a', 'b', 'c'). Always check that: - The conditions are correctly stated. - The correct function names are used. - The functions are defined and accessible within the scope where the conditional is executed.

Here is the corrected code with proper indentation and structure: \`\`\`python # PLACE FUNCTIONS DEFS HERE # def add(): num_1 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) num_2 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) total = num_1 + num_2 sprite.say(\\"The sum is \\" + str(total)) def subtract(): num_1 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) num_2 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) result = num_1 - num_2 sprite.say(\\"The result is \\" + str(result)) def multiply(): num_1 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) num_2 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) product = num_1 * num_2 sprite.say(\\"The product is \\" + str(product)) def divide(): num_1 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) num_2 = float(sprite.ask(\\"Enter a number.\\")) quotient = num_1 / num_2 sprite.say(\\"The quotient is \\" + str(quotient)) stage.wait(2) remainder = num_1 % num_2 sprite.say(\\"The remainder is \\" + str(remainder)) # PLACE ALL OTHER CODE BELOW THIS # stage.set_background(\\"pluto\\") sprite = codesters.Sprite(\\"astronaut2\\") sprite.set_say_color(\\"white\\") sprite.say(\\"I'm a math whiz!\\", 2) operation = sprite.ask(\\"Do you want to a) add, b) subtract, c) multiply, or d) divide?\\") if operation == \\"a\\": add() elif operation == \\"b\\": subtract() elif operation == \\"c\\": multiply() elif operation == \\"d\\": divide() # my_var = 5 ** 2 # sprite.say(\\"I am a sprite.\\") # There's no additional code to execute outside the above conditional, so no else block is needed. \`\`\` With this correction, the program now asks the user to pick an operation and calls the appropriate function based on their choice. The extra \`else\` clause and the misplaced code have been removed to ensure the structure is valid. Always make sure each \`if\`, \`elif\`, and \`else\` clause is properly indented and directly follows the block it is associated with."},{"instruction":"Write a list of 9 2010s Disney animated movies, and for each movie, an explanation of its title's meaning","output":"1. **Tangled (2010)** - This title refers to the long, magical hair of the main character, Rapunzel, which becomes literally and metaphorically tangled within the complexities of her life and her relationships, especially with Mother Gothel and Flynn Rider. 2. **Wreck-It Ralph (2012)** - The title character, Ralph, is the villain of a fictional arcade game called \\"Fix-It Felix Jr.\\" where his role is to destroy buildings that the hero, Felix, repairs.

However, there is significant heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis and the risk of complications. Enormous progress has been made in our ability to catalog genetic variation associated with T2D-risk and variation in disease relevant quantitative traits. These discoveries hold the potential to shed light on tractable targets and pathways for safe and effective therapeutic development, but the promise of precision medicine has been slow to be realized. Recent studies have identified subgroups of individuals with differential risk for intermediate phenotypes (e.g., lipid levels, fasting insulin, BMI), which contribute to T2D risk, helping to account for the observed clinical heterogeneity. These “partitioned genetic risk scores” have not only the potential to identify patients at greatest risk of CVD and rapid disease progression, but could also aid patient stratification bridging the gap towards precision medicine for T2D. Keywords: Type 2 diabetes, genetics, precision medicine Go to: Condensed abstract Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has significant heterogeneity in its pathogenesis and disease course/complications. Recent advances have identified subgroups within T2D, helping to account for the clinical heterogeneity observed. In particular, genetic approaches to clustering subgroups of T2D have the potential to identify patients at greater risk of downstream complications (e.g., heart disease) and disease progression (e.g., insulin requiring T2D). Genetic approaches have identified and validated new drug targets for T2D and may also allow more targeted therapeutic approaches. Together, clustering methods have the potential to bring precision medicine into the clinic for T2D prevention and treatment. Go to: Introduction Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common and fastest growing diseases, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of nearly 700 million by 2045(1). Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke, is the leading cause of mortality in T2D, while diabetic microvascular disease (chronic kidney disease, neuropathy and retinopathy) contributes significantly to morbidity(1). Despite its prevalence and high human cost, T2D is currently treated as a homogenous entity(2, 3) – diagnosed by an abnormally high blood glucose level and treated algorithmically(4) – without taking into account the varied mechanisms that can contribute to its pathogenesis. To address this, recent work from a number of groups has focused on identifying sub-groups within T2D through clustering analyses of either clinical/laboratory data(5–7) or through genetic data(8–10). Both methods identify numerous, clinically distinct subgroups within the broader diagnostic umbrella of T2D, with variable disease progression (e.g., need for insulin) and risk of micro- and macrovascular complications(6, 8). This review will focus on genetic methods to cluster patients into pathologic subgroups, as genes are fixed with respect to time and do not vary by environmental exposure(11, 12). In particular, we will focus on the potential for precision medicine through implementation of genetic clustering and partitioned polygenic risk scores (pPRS(11)) to identify and potentially prevent or treat the primary pathologic mechanisms leading to T2D in an individual patient. We also highlight recent studies that have helped to unravel the molecular mechanisms through which effector genes at genome wide association study (GWAS) loci affect T2D risk. Finally, we highlight recent methodologic advances in genetics that allow for drug target discovery and validation. Go to: Defining subtypes of T2D using clustering approaches Clinicians have long appreciated the significant heterogeneity among their patient’s risk of developing T2D and T2D-related sequelae. For instance, many patients with traditional T2D risk factors (e.g., obesity) do not develop T2D(8). Disease progression is also variable, with some patients rapidly developing insulin requiring T2D, whilst others can be stably treated for decades with metformin alone(12). Complications related to T2D-mediated hyperglycemia are similarly heterogeneous, with randomization control trial data consistently showing intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of microvascular disease(13, 14). In comparison, while early trials showed that T2D-mediated hyperglycemia was not associated with CVD(15), newer evidence suggests a nuanced view, whereby there is longitudinally-reduced CVD risk during periods of time with intensive glycemic control(16). This is consistent with Mendelian randomization (see below) data, which demonstrates a causal role for hyperglycemia and CVD risk(17). These data suggested that within the homogeneous diagnosis of T2D there are numerous subgroups of individuals who have a variable clinical course, prompting investigation into the identification of these patient clusters. Clustering based on non-genetic, clinical data: In 2015, Li et al performed one of the first, large attempts at clustering patients using clinical/laboratory data(18). Drawing on electronic medical records (EMRs) for 11,210 multi-ethnic participants, they used machine learning methodology and identified three subtypes of T2D patients. Building upon this work, Ahlqvist et al leveraged Bayesian machine learning methods in a cohort of 8,980 Swedish patients newly diagnosed with T2D(6). These authors used six pre-selected variables in their clustering analyses: glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, age at T2D diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and the homeostatic model assessments of pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance (HOMA2- β and HOMA2-IR, respectively, (6)). They stratified their cohort into 5 clusters with differential disease progression and risk of complications (Table 1). This method of clustering T2D patients by carefully selected clinical characteristics set off a flurry of replication studies in different populations including European(7), American/Chinese cohorts(19), and randomization control trials(5), showing the generalizability of the clinical covariate clustering approach.

Three of these clusters corresponded to very-low, low, and obese-but-low risk groups. The remaining three clusters were defined by beta-cell failure, insulin-resistance/NAFLD, and visceral fat/nephropathy. The beta-cell and insulin-resistance/NAFLD groups were both at high-risk of imminent T2D, while the visceral fat/nephropathy cluster had moderate T2D risk but increased kidney disease and mortality risk(20). Interestingly, Wagner et al also applied the genetic risk score developed by Udler(8) and found that the two highest risk clusters (beta-cell and insulin-resistance/NAFLD) had concurrently increased genetic risk, highlighting the role of non-modifiable genetic risk in T2D development(20). While powerful, there are caveats to using clustering approaches on clinical data. First, clinical data are not static and are strongly influenced by the environmental(21, 22): e.g., there will be patients who after being diagnosed with T2D will undergo diet and exercise changes to successfully lower their HbA1c(11, 12). However, these participants will be mis-classified moving forward as “T2D patients” despite having successfully implemented lifestyle interventions to treat their T2D. As well, there is the issue of which clinical variables are included in the model for cluster building(6). As discussed below, the variables chosen for cluster analyses have a significant impact on what subgroups are identified. In comparison to clinical methods of clustering, genetic methods have several advantages: first, the included variants have been vetted by GWAS and have a significant association with T2D(9, 10, 23–37). Second, germline genetic data does not vary with time or environmental changes(21, 22) and therefore can be used at any point in life to understand underlying pathologic susceptibilities to a complex disease such as T2D(11, 12). As a result, genetic clustering of T2D patients has been an ongoing area of research for nearly a decade to help bring precision medicine into the clinical setting. Historical approaches to genetic clustering analyses: Hints at the varied genetic architecture of T2D first arose in 2010, when Voight et al found that variants associated with T2D-risk were more likely to be associated with measures of pancreatic beta cell function than of insulin sensitivity(27). In a separate study, Ingelsson et al performed a hypothesis-driven analyses and demonstrated that the GWAS loci for T2D identified at that time could broadly be categorized into those which influenced T2D-risk through defects in insulin processing/secretion or peripheral insulin sensitivity(38). These categories were later confirmed through the use of “hard” hierarchical clustering of T2D genes and clinical traits(39). Of note, with “hard” hierarchical clustering, each genetic variant can only belong to one clinical trait “cluster” or group. Scott et al later performed an iteratively improved analysis with a larger sample size and the inclusion of BMI and lipid traits in their clustering analysis(32). Using hierarchical clustering methods, they identified three major pathologic groups for genes associated with T2D: insulin secretion/processing, disruption of insulin action, and a new cluster of dyslipidemia(32).Building upon the dyslipidemia genetic cluster(32) and the classical observation that lipodystrophy-related phenotypes were associated with insulin resistance and T2D in normal-to-underweight patients(40), Lotta et al created a genetic risk score that defined a lipodystrophy-like subset of T2D(41). They noted with increasing genetic risk, there was a concomitant decrease in body fat percentage and BMI, with a paradoxical increase in waist-to-hip ratio. To confirm their observations, they applied their genetic risk score to an independent cohort and confirmed that patients at the highest genetic risk had lower fat mass, but greater risk of incident T2D, suggesting that this lipodystrophy-like phenotype was itself predictive of T2D. These studies have stimulated follow-up work by several groups which has begun to tease out the underlying biology of the causal genes in these loci. For instance, we and others confirmed that FAM13A is the causal “lipodystrophy-like” gene in one locus and perturbations of this gene affect adipose biology and fat distribution both in vitro and in vivo(42). “Soft” hierarchical clustering approaches to genetic clustering: To account for clinical heterogeneity in pathogenesis for complex diseases (e.g., that a given person may have variants that alter their risk of both obesity and insulin secretion, both of which contribute to T2D risk), Udler et al developed a “soft” hierarchical clustering method(8). In this method each genetic variant can belong to more than one cluster of clinical phenotypes, thereby allowing for modeling of the pleiotropic effects of genes/loci(8). Using 94 genetic variants and 47 T2D-related clinical traits, Udler et al identified and replicated 5 partially overlapping genetic clusters (Table 1 and Figure 1(8)). The first 2 clusters were strongly associated with insulin processing/secretion with the genes all associated with deficiency in circulating insulin. The remaining 3 clusters were all related to tissue-specific response to insulin. Cluster 3, the “obesity/adiposity” cluster, was defined by increased waist circumference, BMI, body fat, and fasting insulin, suggesting that this cluster represented classic obesity mediated T2D. Cluster 4, the “lipodystrophy” cluster, was characterized by increased insulin resistance, triglycerides, and waist-to-hip ratio (in women only), with an accompanying decrease in BMI, suggesting that this cluster represented the contribution of visceral fat to both insulin resistance and T2D risk. Cluster 5, the “liver/lipid” cluster, was associated with decreased serum triglycerides but increased NAFLD risk, suggesting a role of liver metabolism in T2D risk(8). Notably, these 5 genetic clusters were largely able to recapitulate the clinical clusters previously identified(6). Moreover, the identified genetic clusters showed remarkable similarity to subsequent work by Mahajan et al, who also used soft clustering methods, but identified an additional cluster corresponding to a “mixed” picture with aspects of both insulin secretion and insulin resistance (Table 1, (37)).

Schematic representation of the genetic clusters identified by Udler et al, with the additional “mixed” genetic cluster concurrently identified by Mahajan et al (see main text and Table 1), with example genes. Abbreviations: EX – for example, NAFLD – nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Application of this method to independent replication cohorts demonstrated that 30% of participants were in the top 10% of genetic risk for a single cluster(8). When comparing the mean characteristics of these individuals at the highest genetic risk, Udler et al found characteristic clinical profiles defining each genetic cluster: for example, those in the highest genetic risk for the obesity cluster had significantly higher BMI, body fat, and waist circumference. In contrast, those in the highest genetic risk for the lipodystrophy had significantly lower BMI, body fat, and HDL levels(8). In summary, these results suggested that each genetic cluster represented a specific pathophysiology through which T2D risk was affected through intermediate phenotypes. Go to: Using Genetics to Predict Risk for T2D In recent years a number of groups have proposed the concept of partitioned polygenic risk scores (pPRS) to identify patients at high risk of T2D through a specific, intermediate pathway (e.g., insulin deficiency) for early intervention(11). However, pPRS builds upon prior work over the past two decades to build polygenic risk scores based on candidate genes for complex diseases(43–47) and more recent work creating global polygenic risk scores (gPRS) for CVD(48) and T2D(9, 10, 48). Early attempts at combining risk alleles: Using 3 well-replicated variants in candidate genes (KCNJ11, PPARG, and TCF7L2), Weedon et al created the first restricted polygenic risk score (rPRS; see Figure 2) for T2D by calculating the area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC) to determine the benefit conferred by this rPRS in predicting T2D. From this, they reported that the AUROC using their rPRS was 0.58 – improved from what would be expected from chance alone (0.5) – but falling well short of the threshold typically required for clinical implementation(43). An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is nihms-1711934-f0002.jpg Figure 2. Visualization of the different polygenic risk score types. From GWAS results (visualized as a Manhattan plot), investigators can choose only the significantly associated SNVs and create a restricted polygenic risk score (rPRS). Alternatively, they can create a genome-wide polygenic risk score (gPRS), which accounts for nearly all the variation in the genome. Finally, as proposed by Udler et al, investigators can create specific, partitioned polygenic risk scores (pPRS) for intermediate phenotypes that confer risk of the disease in question. These polygenic risk scores often underscore pathologic mechanisms through which the end-phenotype of disease can be achieved. Abbreviations: GWAS – genome wide association study, NAFLD – nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. With the release of GWAS data for T2D and the identification of dozens of novel loci(24–26), several independent groups attempted to create new sets of rPRS for prediction of T2D(44–46). In all studies, the AUROC was improved; however, the added discriminatory benefit of including SNVs for T2D was only 1–2% in all 3 studies compared to a model using clinical covariates alone (e.g., improvement from an AUROC of 0.74 → 0.75 (44)). Global polygenic risk scores provide risk estimates on par with monogenic diseases: Acknowledging the limited prognostic value of rPRS for complex disease, Khera et al recently took a different approach of using variants across the genome to construct a “global” polygenic risk score (gPRS, see Figure 2(48)). Using a bioinformatic machine-learning tool(49), they leveraged genetic inheritance patterns (“linkage disequilibrium” or “LD”) in European ancestry populations to create a gPRS that accounted for nearly all the common variation in a genome, rather than a subset of several dozen variants (as used in prior rPRS(44–46)). Participants in the top 5% of gPRS distribution for T2D risk had a 2.75x increase in odds of T2D, as compared to the remaining 95% of participants, a risk similar to that seen in some monogenic diseases, which could lead to actionable precision medicine in the clinic (48). Using an updated GWAS for T2D performed in close to one million individuals, Mahajan et al created a similar gPRS and applied it to data from the entirety of the UK Biobank(9). In their updated gPRS, those in the top 2.5% of risk for T2D had an increase in odds of 3.4x as compared to those with median (50%) T2D gPRS risk. Unfortunately, direct comparison to the estimates of Khera et al(48) was not possible, as they used different reference populations for calculation of their odds ratios (i.e., bottom 95% versus median 50%) despite applying their different gPRS to the same UK Biobank population(9). Follow-up work by Vujkovic et al(10) used the gPRS developed by Mahajan et al(9) in the multi-ancestry Million Veteran Program (MVP) and found that those in the highest risk group for T2D gPRS had significantly increased odds of T2D microvascular complications (DKD, neuropathy, retinopathy(10)). Partitioned polygenic risk scores apply to individual pathways/intermediate phenotypes leading to disease: In addition to rPRS and gPRS, a number of groups have proposed pPRS (Figure 2 shows a schematic differentiating rPRS, gPRS, and pPRS) for identification of genetic risk specific to intermediate phenotypes that represent possible pathologic mechanisms to disease (e.g., lipodystrophy-like genetic cluster leading to T2D(11)). These pPRSs integrate with the palette model proposed by McCarthy(50). In the palette model of complex disease, the focus is not on the end phenotype of T2D, but rather on the various intermediate phenotypes representing different pathogenesis to T2D (e.g., obesity/adiposity, lipodystrophy, insulin deficiency, and NAFLD/lipid metabolism). Each of these intermediate phenotypes are themselves complex genetic traits, requiring use of pPRS to define level of variance for an individual patient. Conceptually, each intermediate phenotype can be visualized as a primary color. Hence, by calculating pPRS for each intermediate phenotype, one can define germline genetic risk for T2D via known genetic clusters/pathologic pathways. These colors can then be combined or “mixed” and an individual’s risk of T2D aggregated, with the various contributions of individual pathways visualized (Figure 3). Then, for those patients at highest risk for a specific intermediate phenotype/pathologic pathway, clinicians can attempt targeted prevention/treatment(11, 50). An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is nihms-1711934-f0003.jpg Figure 3. Potential clinical use of partitioned polygenic risk scores. Each row in the “pPRS genotypes” represents presence/absence of risk alleles for a specific pPRS pathway. Combination of risk from different pPRS pathways (each represented by a different color) leads to an overall “palette” of color. In this figure, a primary color/pPRS pathway is predominant for each specific patient. We do note that this figure is likely an oversimplification – most patients will not have a specific dominant process driving their T2D pathogenesis. In the original work by Udler et al, only 30% of participants segregated into the top decile of pPRS genetic risk for a given genetic cluster. Abbreviations: BMI – body mass index, GLP-1Ra – glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, HLD - hyperlipidemia, HTN - hypertension, M – man, NAFLD – nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, SGLT2i – sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, T2D – type 2 diabetes, Tx – treatment, W – woman, yo – years old. Use of polygenic risk scores for T2D: To date, the clinical use of various polygenic risk scores in T2D has been limited. Using a 65 variant rPRS for T2D, Li et al reported that those with higher genetic risk had a greater reduction in HbA1c at 1-year follow-up in response to therapy with sulfonylureas(51).Separately, Jiang et al demonstrated that each increase in standard deviation for their 123 variant T2D rPRS increased risk of developing an insulin-dependence by 7%, with replication in an independent cohort(52). Using a gPRS for T2D, Wagner et al reported that increased pancreatic steatosis interacted with decreased insulin secretion(53). Interestingly, Wagner et al performed sensitivity analyses across the 5 clusters of T2D defined by Udler et al(8) and found that the interaction was driven by a pPRS defining the liver metabolism/NAFLD gene cluster(53).Finally, recent work using a pPRS for lipodystrophy found that despite having lower BMI/waist circumference, those with a higher lipodystrophy pPRS had significantly higher insulin resistance and low-density lipoprotein, portending possible increased CVD risk in this specific subpopulation(54). Further work will be needed to elucidate the relationship between pPRS and risk prediction/stratification in the clinical context. Genetics and the potential for tailored therapy in T2D: For illustration of the concept of pPRS and the palette model for tailoring of treatments, we can consider the concrete example from monogenic diabetes. Monogenic diabetes can be partitioned by the specific genetic mutations, each of which has different treatment strategies available(55). Heterozygous inactivating mutations in the key glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GCK) cause stable mild fasting hyperglycemia from birth which is refractory to pharmacological intervention and usually successfully managed by diet alone(56–58). In contrast, mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear 1 alpha (HNF1A) cause a more severe progressive phenotype which has a risk of complications similar to T2D(59, 60). Identifying patients with HNF1A-monogenic diabetes is important because they are optimally treated with low dose sulfonylureas(61, 62). Similarly, patients with heterozygous activating mutations in either of the genes encoding the components of the pancreatic beta cell KATP channel (KCNJ11 or ABCC8) can be treated with high dose sulfonylureas rather than insulin(63–65). Providing the optimal medication based on the genetic etiology improves glycemic control (55). Go to: Harnessing physiology to guide the molecular characterization of T2D GWAS variants The translation of genetic signals into biological and clinical insights has not kept a pace with their discovery. This is in part due to the fact that unlike monogenic forms of diabetes, which are largely due to variants that alter the protein sequence, most GWAS signals are in non-coding regions of the genome with a presumed regulatory function, making it challenging to be certain which is the “effector” gene. Gene regulation is highly context dependent, with the degree of gene expression (and resulting magnitude of association with a trait/outcome) conditional on numerous factors, including: specific cell type, developmental time point and/or chromatin accessibility, and environmental conditions. All of these context-cues are critically important for interpreting the effect of a T2D-associated regulatory variant. Large scale efforts to characterize tissue-specific regulatory landscapes such as Genotype-Tissue Expression consortium (GTEx) have been critical in this regard(66). Investigations into the physiological processes that are influenced by T2D-associated variants have been enormously helpful in providing information on which tissue and/or cell type should be studied to understand the disease mechanism. Below we provide examples from the literature, which exemplify different physiological/molecular mechanisms and showcase how researchers move from GWAS signal to a molecular mechanism. We first highlight colocalization: a method through which investigators can fine-map hundreds-to-thousands of GWAS signals in a genetic region to the likely causal variant. Colocalization can identify causal variants/genes, prioritizing translation: A powerful way to identify effector transcripts at GWAS loci is to identify colocalization of association signals for disease risk and gene expression. Colocalization of genetic signals is generally performed using summary-level statistics from GWAS for disease (e.g., T2D) and GWAS for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data(67), though any other type of genome-wide study data could also be used in colocalization methods (i.e., DNA methylation data, histone methylation data, etc). eQTL data reflects genome wide variant associations with individual gene expression levels within a specific tissue or cell type (e.g., pancreatic islet). eQTLs can be detected in multiple tissues; however, working with disease relevant tissues is the preferred approach, as eQTLs are frequently tissue-specific. Many genes are highly dependent on context-specificity, with their expression levels dependent on a combination of cell-type, environmental perturbation (e.g., starvation vs hyperglycemia), and/or epigenome structure. In particular, epigenetics has become a focus in the last decade with mounting evidence that aging and disease alter the physical structure of DNA, potentially limiting gene expression even in cases where the context-specificity is otherwise met(68). In this context, methods such as chromatin segregation to highlight the active and repressed regions of DNA represent promising avenues through which to integrate many data sources and identify effector transcripts(69). Identifying colocalization of a T2D-GWAS signal and an eQTL in a diabetes relevant tissue, such as pancreatic islets, offers evidence for a potential causal link (and thereby identifies the effector transcript). In this causal relationship, the genetic variant influences pancreatic islet gene expression, which in turn affects T2D risk (Figure 4). In addition to the GTEx database(66), recent publications of eQTL data for skeletal muscle(70), adipose(71), and pancreatic islet tissue(72), have contributed to deciphering possible mechanistic links for T2D GWAS variants. An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is nihms-1711934-f0004.jpg Figure 4. Colocalization of genetic signals offers evidence of causality. (A) Example of an eQTL study, where the outcome is gene expression and variant genotypes are tested across the genome to find specific loci that are associated with differential gene expression (eQTL levels). (B) Colocalization analysis of GWAS and eQTL studies, with colocalization of signals offering mechanistic evidence for a potential causal variant. In the case of non-colocalization, the two variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) meaning they are often inherited together as a haplotype. Abbreviations: eQTL – expression quantitative trait loci, GWAS – genome-wide association study, LD – linkage disequilibrium. Examples of translation of T2D GWAS signals into understanding of molecular mechanism/pathogenesis: The early identification of two independent coding variant signals in the PAM gene for T2D risk provided a molecular “signpost” to the effector transcript (i.e., strongly implicating PAM as the causal gene), accelerating efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms of PAM(73). Further work highlighted the association of PAM with both T2D and beta-cell function(73). Thomsen et al reported that both coding alleles in the PAM protein result in a loss of function, reducing the ability of this amidating enzyme to increase the biological potency of glycine-extended neuropeptides(74). Loss of PAM in a human beta-cell model resulted in reduced insulin content and secretion an effect also observed in isolated primary islets from carriers of the PAM T2D-risk allele (74). Even when the effector transcript and the tissue of effect are known, there can still be challenges. The SLC30A8 locus provides an example of the complexity. Early GWAS for T2D(25) identified a nonsynonymous coding allele in SLC30A8 associated with T2D-risk; however, whether T2D risk was associated with loss vs. gain-of-function in the gene was unclear from early functional and rodent studies(75–77) but human genetic evidence provided compelling support that loss-of-function in SLC30A8 was associated with diabetes protection(78). A recent study, combining detailed physiological characterization in human carriers of the SLC30A8 loss-of-function variants coupled with cellular studies in a suite of human beta-cell models, demonstrated that the SLC30A8 T2D-protective alleles cause enhanced insulin secretion (79). TM6SF2 was first identified as a missense variant (hence identifying TM6SF2 as the likely effector transcript) causing low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(80) (LDL-C), but paradoxically increased NAFLD risk(81). Several groups found that TM6SF2 was primarily expressed by the liver(82) and congruent work by Smagris et al and Mahdessian et al found that the likely mechanism of action for TM6SF2 was through impaired very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) release from the liver, leading to NAFLD via fat accumulation but also lower LDL-C in serum(82, 83). Subsequent work supports this proposed mechanism and has found that TM6SF2 is associated with incident T2D(84), a finding that is supported by large-scale GWAS that later identified TM6SF2 as a T2D risk locus(31). A locus containing FTO has long been associated with obesity and Fto knockout in mice reduces BMI(85). However, recent evidence suggests that FTO is not the causal gene at this locus. The T2D risk allele in the locus increased both IRX3 and IRX5 gene expression(86). Adding further weight to these convincing human studies, Irx3 knockout mice recapitulated the prior Fto knockout phenotype(85): substantially reduced body weight and increased brown adipose tissue, suggesting that IRX3, rather than FTO, is the causal gene causing obesity and increased T2D/CVD risk(86). The example of FTO/IRX3 illustrates the complexity in untangling the molecular mechanism of T2D GWAS variants that are regulatory in nature, and highlights the importance of context (correct tissue, at the right developmental time point, and with appropriate environmental conditions). Go to: Genetic methodologies informing and/or validating drug discovery in T2D Given the saturation of genetic data in the scientific literature (>400 signals at >350 loci associated with T2D(9, 36)), deciding which specific gene to target for functional validation and drug development has been difficult. Prior mechanistic studies on candidate genes were largely driven by biologic plausibility. Novel methods offer can prioritize genetic loci for translational research and also have improved drug discovery pipelines. Mendelian Randomization (MR) for validation and identification of potential drug targets: Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a powerful technique that leverages the random assortment of alleles during meiosis to assess potential causality between SNV genotype and outcomes (Figure 5 and (87) for a topical review on interpretation of MR studies in cardiometabolic disease). MR has already been used to demonstrate a causal link between hyperglycemia and CVD risk(17). A further example of the utility of MR comes from PCSK9 inhibition. In 2005, Cohen et al identified two nonsense mutations in PCSK9 that resulted in drastically lower LDL-C, spurring drug development of PCSK9 inhibitors(88). A subsequent MR study demonstrated that loss-of-function variants in PCSK9 were associated with decreased LDL-C and CVD, suggesting a causal pathway(89). Concurrent to this MR study, PCSK9 inhibition was found to reduce both LDL-C and CVD events(90). An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is nihms-1711934-f0005.jpg Figure 5. Mendelian randomization identifies causal associations between an allele/outcome. For evidence of the causal association between lower LDL-C and T2D, please refer to (89)and (94). * denotes that meiosis during gamete production acts as a randomization event for inheritance of a given genetic variant allele. Abbreviations: LDL-C – low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; T2D – type 2 diabetes. MR can also be done at large-scale, allowing for rapid screening of multiple candidates for potential drug development. For example, Folkerson et al recently reported on genetic variants influencing 90 serum protein levels (a pQTL study) and performed a MR study that implicated a causal role for RAGE protein in T2D(91), whereby AGER (the gene encoding RAGE) SNVs caused higher RAGE protein levels, and subsequent lower T2D risk. Of note, their MR analysis did not find evidence of an association with Alzheimer’s disease, for which a RAGE inhibitor had previously been studied (NCT00566397). This study, in conjunction with prior work on PCSK9 inhibition, demonstrates the utility of MR in identifying novel drug targets and validating drugs under development. Although classically described for SNV alleles, MR can also be used to assess if a given pPRS is causally associated with an outcome via an intermediate phenotype. For example, Sanna et al used a pPRS for proprionate, a fecal short-chain fatty acid, and found that the pPRS was associated with both increased proprionate levels and increased T2D risk(92). These results suggested that genetically controlled proprionate levels were causally linked with differential T2D risk (see (93) for in-depth review on the gut microbiome and T2D risk). Similarly, Sinnott- Armstrong et al leveraged deep phenotyping with protein and urine biomarkers to demonstrate causal relationships across many traits and diseases including highlighting an emerging causal role for decreased LDL-cholesterol and increased T2D risk ((94), Figure 5). Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) to identify potential non-label use for existing drugs: A final genetic tool that has broad relevance in drug repurposing and identification of potential adverse reactions is the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). A PheWAS inverts the study design of a GWAS: a single SNV is tested for association with multiple phenotypes; mostly commonly through use of ICD-10 codes in EMR data (see Figure 6). Through such large-scale SNV-disease associations, investigators can identify off-target effects (OTEs) that may represent targets for drug repurposing and also potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, after identification of an OTE, further investigation must be undertaken to ensure that the direction of effect for the SNV-disease association is consistent with beneficence. For example, although TM6SF2 is associated with decreased LDL-C and CVD(80), it is concomitantly associated with increased NAFLD(81). An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is nihms-1711934-f0006.jpg Figure 6. PheWAS identifies potential off target effects and adverse drug reactions. From a genome-wide association study (GWAS) “Manhattan plot”, the top gene variant associated with an outcome can be tested against multiple phenotypes (e.g., International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) codes) to identify pleiotropic associations with other diseases and adverse reactions. In this example, Gene X encodes protein X, for which an inhibitor X is currently on the market for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PheWAS of the top variant in Gene X finds OTEs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) – suggesting that inhibitor X may be repurposed for treatment of these diseases. However, an association alone does not suggest that an OTE may exist – examining the direct of effect is important in secondary analyses (see main text) – hence, the potential OTE for T2D is nullified in this example. An ADR is also identified via an association with bacterial sepsis, warranting caution in prescribing inhibitor X. As an example of PheWAS, Cai et al recently analyzed an IL6R SNV and found a significant association with abdominal aortic aneurysm, representing a possible OTE(95). Tocilizumab, an IL-6R antagonist, has since been approved for use in giant cell arteritis, of which a significant complication is aortic aneurysm. Moreover, Cai et al found that decreased IL-6R levels was associated with increased risk of ADRs eczema, conjunctivitis, and pleuritis, consistent with trial data for tocilizumab. These results offer a glimpse into the power of PheWAS for drug discovery and repurposing in T2D, as well as in identifying the likely side effect profile of a given agent. Go to: Future directions for research into the genetics of T2D Precision Medicine for T2D using gPRS/pPRS: gPRS can be used to risk-stratify patients, enabling earlier interventions and prevention of T2D pathogenesis and complications(48). We envision that gPRS can be used to identify asymptomatic patients at high risk of developing T2D based on their non-modifiable genetic risk. Clinicians can then intervene with intensive lifestyle modification, medications (e.g., metformin), and/or counseling to prevent onset and progression of T2D(11, 12). gPRS-based risk stratification can also be implemented in conjunction with clinical covariates, as recently demonstrated by Wagner et al(20), as simple clinical covariates are excellent predictors of T2D-related complications(5). As we move toward more precise measurements and targeting of pathways, pPRS for intermediate phenotypes has the potential to further refine our diagnostics and therapeutics with regard to complex diseases like T2D. Already, pPRS methods have highlighted unknown or unappreciated pathways (such as NAFLD or lipodystrophy) leading to T2D (11, 12). Although in the seminal work by Udler et al only 30% of patients segregated to the highest decile of genetic risk for a given pPRS(8), we suspect that this proportion will increase with larger/improved GWAS (as demonstrated in follow-up work by Mahajan(37)), particularly in non-European populations (see below). More clinically relevant is the question of how pPRS will change management of T2D: although we infer that T2D caused by lipodystrophy-like vs beta-cell failure processes can likely be optimally managed with different combinations of medications/lifestyle interventions (Figure 3), there is yet a paucity of evidence to support these hypotheses. Hence, moving forward with gPRS/pPRS in clinical settings, we strongly advocate for randomized studies to evaluate the effect of these genetic risk tools in clinical decision making and outcomes, simultaneous to its implementation(96). With such an evidence base available, we are hopeful that the treatment of T2D can mirror that of monogenic diabetes (see above), whereby specific therapies are tailored to genotype (55). Limited studies in non-European ancestry populations: Perhaps the greatest limitation of research into the genomics of T2D and CVD is that the vast majority of studies have been performed in European-ancestry populations. Recently, several high-profile GWAS and other genetic studies for T2D have been performed for Asian-ancestry(36, 52) and African-ancestry individuals(10, 97, 98). Further GWAS/genetic studies in non-European-ancestry populations are of crucial importance, as they serve as the input data for gPRS/pPRS, which in turn have the potential to identify patients at high-risk for chronic diseases, thereby enabling clinicians to implement strategies for aggressive prevention/treatment. However, algorithms are strongly influenced by their input data and have already been shown to be less predictive in African-ancestry individuals(99). Already, early application of rPRS has found that efficacy is reduced when applied to African-ancestry subjects for T2D(47). Similar application of rPRS/gPRS for CVD found attenuated effects in African-ancestry populations(100). Factoring in multi-ethnic GWAS data to create gPRS/pPRS while accounting for complex population genetics will likely complicate matters further(101), as there is evidence of latent population structure even within the relatively racially-homogenous UK Biobank(102). Moreover, the largest studies currently are from European-ancestry populations, and gPRS/pPRS derived from these data perform poorly when extrapolated to other populations, hence exacerbating existing health disparities in non-White populations(103). In line with the recent International Common Disease Alliance (ICDA) white paper(104), we believe that greater efforts must be made to ensure that all genetic ancestry groups are represented in biobanks linking genetic data and EMRs, and the resulting discovery genetic work. Metabolomics/Proteomics and T2D: One growing area of research is the role of the metabolome/proteome in T2D pathogenesis(105). Although the metabolome/proteome is vast, the majority of research has focused on the strong link between branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and T2D risk(105). Cross-sectional analyses first found that BCAA levels were higher in T2D patients as compared to healthy controls and positively correlated with insulin resistance(106). This finding was later confirmed in longitudinal data that showed a 2–3.5x increased risk of T2D with higher BCAA levels in 12-years of follow-up(107). The association between BCAA levels and T2D risk were later confirmed using MR(108, 109), demonstrating a likely causal relationship. Given the predictive value of BCAA levels and the wide-spread use of metabolomic assays for newborn diagnoses (e.g., phenylketonuria), one promising avenue of investigation is the use of BCAA levels for precision medicine in identifying patients at high-risk for T2D and implementing intensive preventative measures(105). Go to: Conclusions and Perspectives In summary, clustering methods allow for more precise sub-phenotyping of T2D and increased understanding of the pathophysiology leading to complex disease. In particular, genetic methodologies offer a wealth of information for a specific patient from a single peripheral blood draw. Use of germline genetics for patients in combination with pPRS has the potential to identify patients at high risk for specific intermediate phenotypes for T2D (e.g., NAFLD vs lipodystrophy), leading to earlier implementation of interventions tailored to the patient’s specific risk for various pathologic processes leading to T2D. In addition, development of novel methodologies has allowed for increased drug discovery and validation. Further work will be required to elucidate and demonstrate the clinical utility of germline genotyping and pPRS in T2D, particularly in non-European ancestry populations.","output":"This article discusses the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and how genetic research is revealing subgroups within the disease. These subgroups have different risks for complications like cardiovascular disease (CVD), and they respond differently to treatments. The authors explain that genetic clustering methods are helping to identify these subgroups and could enable personalized treatments. Genetic clustering can categorize patients into groups based on shared risk factors like insulin resistance or obesity. By analyzing genetic variants associated with T2D, researchers have identified clusters that correlate with different aspects of the disease, such as beta-cell dysfunction or specific metabolic traits. Recent studies have used \\"partitioned polygenic risk scores\\" (pPRS) to better predict individual risks for developing T2D and its complications. These scores take into account variations in certain intermediate phenotypes, like lipid levels or insulin resistance, which influence T2D risk. The authors highlight the potential of precision medicine in treating T2D, tailoring interventions to patients' genetic risks. They review examples of how genetic discoveries have already informed the development of new drug targets, noting the use of techniques like Mendelian Randomization to explore causal relationships between genes and T2D. While much progress has been made, the article acknowledges the challenges and limitations of current research -- especially the underrepresentation of non-European populations. Future studies must include diverse populations to improve the predictive power and clinical utility of genetic risk scores for T2D. The authors emphasize the need for continued research into the genomics of T2D and the integration of genetic risk assessments into clinical practice to realize the full potential of precision medicine."},{"instruction":"Tujuan utamanya untuk mengumpulkan informasi yang berguna dari berbagai bagian jaringan sehingga jaringan dapat diatur dan dikontrol dengan menggunakan informasi yang telah ada tersebut adalah… Question 16Answer a.

Prinsip ini berarti bahwa pengguna hanya diberikan level akses yang secara tepat sesuai dengan kebutuhan pekerjaan atau tugas mereka. Dalam konteks server, konsep ini dapat diterapkan dengan cara-cara berikut: 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Pengguna dikelompokkan berdasarkan peranan (role) dan tanggung jawab kerja mereka. Masing-masing role memiliki hak akses yang spesifik dan terkendali terhadap sumber daya server sehingga membatasi akses kepada fungsi dan data yang diperlukan saja. 2. User Accounts Management: Setiap pengguna diberikan akun dengan hak akses yang telah ditentukan. Akun-akun ini memiliki izin yang berbeda-beda, dan kata sandi yang kuat biasanya diperlukan untuk masuk. 3. Privileged User Accounts: Akun-akun dengan hak akses administratif atau akses 'root' ke server dibatasi hanya untuk user yang membutuhkannya. Untuk tugas-tugas rutin, administrator dapat menggunakan akun dengan hak akses yang lebih rendah. 4. Directory Services and Group Policies: Layanan direktori seperti Active Directory digunakan untuk mengatur kebijakan keamanan dan hak akses berdasarkan group policy yang didefinisikan. Ini memastikan bahwa kebijakan akses diterapkan secara konsisten di seluruh organisasi. 5. Access Reviews and Audits: Proses audit dan review akses dilakukan secara berkala untuk memastikan bahwa hak akses yang diberikan masih relevan dengan kebutuhan bisnis dan keamanan. 6. Use of Access Controls: Penerapan sistem kontrol akses fisik dan logis, seperti firewalls, sistem deteksi instrusi/prevensi, dan teknologi VPN, untuk mengatur dan membatasi akses ke server. 7. Application Whitelisting: Memastikan hanya aplikasi dan proses yang diverifikasi dan dianggap aman yang diizinkan untuk berjalan di server. 8. Education and Policies: Mendidik pengguna tentang kebijakan keamanan dan membuat mereka sadar akan pentingnya mematuhi prinsip hak akses minimum untuk menjaga keamanan sistem. Dengan membatasi hak akses pengguna sesuai dengan kebutuhan mereka, risiko terhadap keamanan server dari kegiatan tidak sah baik yang disengaja maupun tidak sengaja dapat dikurangi secara signifikan."},{"instruction":"Manakah dari perangkat lunak berikut yang biasanya digunakan untuk memantau kinerja jaringan secara real-time?

Berikut adalah beberapa cara spesifik tentang bagaimana monitoring jaringan bisa membantu melindungi jaringan dari serangan cyber yang semakin canggih: 1. Deteksi Aktivitas Tidak Biasa: Sistem monitoring yang canggih dapat mendeteksi perubahan tiba-tiba dalam pola lalu lintas yang mungkin mengindikasikan serangan atau upaya eksploitasi. Misalnya, peningkatan besar dalam permintaan ke server tertentu bisa menjadi indikasi serangan DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service). 2. Pemantauan Perilaku: Dengan melakukan monitoring kontinu terhadap perilaku jaringan, sistem dapat belajar untuk membedakan antara aktivitas normal dan mencurigakan, yang memungkinkan deteksi awal kegiatan jahat. 3. Analisis Lalu Lintas: Melalui inspeksi paket dan analisis lalu lintas, monitoring jaringan memungkinkan administrator untuk mengidentifikasi pola yang sering dikaitkan dengan serangan cyber, seperti serangan brute-force, serangan man-in-the-middle, dan eksploitasi kerentanan. 4. Kepatuhan Standar Keamanan: Sejumlah monitoring tools dirancang untuk membantu memastikan bahwa jaringan mematuhi standar dan kebijakan keamanan, seperti GDPR, HIPAA, atau PCI DSS. Ini termasuk pelacakan akses data dan verifikasi pembaruan keamanan. 5. Manajemen Konfigurasi: Monitoring konfigurasi perangkat jaringan untuk memastikan bahwa tidak ada perubahan yang tidak sah atau konfigurasi yang tidak aman yang bisa menyebabkan kerentanan. 6. Deteksi Ancaman Internal: Misalnya, jika seorang karyawan mengakses file atau sistem pada jam-jam yang tidak biasa, atau mencoba mengakses sumber daya yang tidak ia butuhkan untuk pekerjaannya, monitoring jaringan bisa memperingatkan administrator tentang potensi risiko keamanan. 7. Respons Kejadian: Sistem monitoring yang baik sering dilengkapi dengan kemampuan untuk memberi tahu tim keamanan atau administrator jaringan tentang kejadian keamanan, memungkinkan respons cepat untuk mengisolasi dan mengurangi ancaman. 8. Investigasi Forensik: Kemampuan untuk mereview log historis dan data monitoring membantu dalam analisis forensik setelah kejadian keamanan terjadi, memungkinkan organisasi untuk menentukan sumber masalahnya dan mencegah serangan serupa di masa depan. 9. Visibilitas Jaringan: Dengan pendekatan monitoring yang wholistic, organisasi mendapatkan visibilitas penuh ke dalam semua aspek jaringan, termasuk aplikasi cloud, infrastruktur virtual, dan end-point. Dengan mengintegrasikan monitoring jaringan ke dalam strategi keamanan siber yang holistik, organisasi dapat meminimalisir kerentanan, mengenali dan merespons secara cepat terhadap ancaman, serta mempertahankan integritas, ketersediaan, dan kerahasiaan dari aset dan data jaringan mereka."},{"instruction":"Apa keunggulan utama dari perangkat lunak monitoring jaringan yang bersifat open source?

To find the direction vector, we need to find any two distinct points on the plane. Let's choose two arbitrary values for y and z: If we let y = 0, then z = -1: (0) - (-1) = 1 So, one point on the plane is (0, -1, 0). If we let y = 1, then z = 0: (1) - (0) = 1 So, another point on the plane is (1, 0, 0).

Energy supply is increasingly under threat, and the construction industry, particularly at its current stage of development, is exerting enormous pressure on energy resources and the environment. In order to effectively mitigate and address these challenges, it is imperative to prioritize the climate adaptability of building design. With regards to this topic, I hold the following perspectives: 1. As a member of the LEED organization, I possess a comprehensive understanding of the LEED certification system and its rating system for green buildings. The LEED certification system focuses on various aspects such as energy efficiency, the use of environmentally friendly materials, water resource management, and indoor environmental quality, driving the construction industry towards increased sustainability and environmental friendliness. Thus, during my graduate studies, I hope to delve deeper into the knowledge of green building practices. 2. The phenomenon of global climate change has now been unequivocally recognized as an ongoing trend, with human-induced greenhouse gas emissions being the primary cause. It is of utmost importance to adapt to these changes, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and seek sustainable development methods. Buildings, as hubs of human activity, bear significant responsibility in emissions reduction. Architects and relevant professionals must consider energy conservation and emissions reduction during the design of new buildings and the renovation of existing structures, enabling buildings to adapt to the global trends in climate change. 3. When it comes to building design, it is crucial to integrate the climatic conditions of the specific region and conduct thorough, scientific analyses. This will aid in selecting the most effective methods relevant to the actual circumstances, allowing for climate control measures to be flexibly integrated with building form, spatial layout, and construction techniques. Ultimately, this will aid in improving and resolving energy and environmental issues. When implementing specific design measures, several considerations should be taken into account: - Firstly, building design should prioritize energy efficiency by employing sustainable building materials and passive techniques. Moreover, the design should actively harness renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power to reduce dependence on conventional energy and enhance overall energy efficiency. - Secondly, given the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, building design should emphasize resilience by incorporating seismic and wind-resistant technologies. This will ensure the safety of individuals when faced with such disasters. - Lastly, the incorporation of green concepts and measures, such as rooftop gardens and rainwater harvesting systems, can greatly improve urban ecosystems and mitigate the urban heat island effect. For instance, buildings in Singapore exemplify responsiveness to the region’s natural climate by creating microenvironments that provide shade, insulation, cooling, and ventilation. This not only enhances the city’s ability to withstand climate change but also generates distinctive regional architectural forms. 4. The importance of climate adaptability in urban design cannot be understated. With the progression of global warming, climate-related issues have emerged as a central concern in urban areas. People are increasingly focusing on energy consumption in regions and cities, recognizing the need to address complex energy and environmental challenges within a larger urban framework. Therefore, the significance of climate adaptability in urban design has seen a steady rise. This adaptability can be achieved by adopting scientifically sound urban forms and layouts under existing conditions, and employing active or passive technological measures to counter anticipated climate change. Climate resilience in urban areas and buildings has evolved into a formal interdisciplinary field of study. It is clear that climate-adaptive cities and buildings not only contribute to reduced energy consumption and social and environmental sustainability but also provide safer and more comfortable living and working environments. Achieving this necessitates architects and professionals becoming proficient in advanced interdisciplinary concepts and technologies. Based on the aforementioned information, my interest in specializing in climate change cooperation stems from the urgent need to address the environmental challenges arising from rapid socioeconomic development. I believe that acquiring knowledge and expertise in green building design, energy efficiency, and urban climate adaptability will enable me to contribute to finding sustainable solutions for mitigating climate change and creating a more resilient built environment. I am particularly intrigued by exploring the nexus of architecture, urban planning, and climate science to develop innovative strategies for designing energy-efficient and climate-resilient buildings and urban spaces. By employing sophisticated technologies, such as passive design strategies, renewable energy integration, and green infrastructure, I aim to ensure that buildings and cities can adapt to changing climate conditions while minimizing their carbon footprint. By embracing interdisciplinary approaches and collaborating with experts in related fields, I aspire to contribute to the development of sustainable and climate-resilient communities centered around environmental stewardship and human well-being.","output":"As socioeconomic development continues to progress at a rapid pace, it is increasingly evident that the environment, which is essential for humanity's survival, is deteriorating and the climate is undergoing significant changes.

Jadili ukweli wa kauli hii","output":"Kauli hii inaakisi changamoto inayokumbana na tafsiri kama fani na kama zoezi. Kuna msemo maarufu wa Kitaliano unaosema \\"Traduttore, traditore,\\" ambao unatafsiriwa kwa Kiingereza kama \\"Translator, traitor\\" au kwa Kiswahili \\"Mtafsiri, msaliti.\\" Huu msemo unaashiria jinsi ambavyo mtafsiri mara kwa mara anashutumiwa kwa kutohamisha maana ya asilia kutoka lugha moja hadi nyingine kwa usahihi. Hapa kuna sababu kadhaa ambazo zinaweza kuchangia kauli hii: 1. Kupoteza upekee na ung'amuzi: Maneno na usemi wa lugha moja mara nyingi yana utamaduni, hisia na ung'amuzi ambao kunaweza kuwa vigumu kuhamisha kwenye lugha ingine. Tafsiri inaweza kupoteza nyakati hizi, na hivyo kuwa chini ya shutuma. 2. Makosa na upotoshaji wa maana: Makosa kwenye tafsiri yanaweza kuwa na athari kubwa, hasa katika nyaraka za kisheria, kitaaluma, au kiufundi. Kasoro kama hizi zinaweza kusababisha mkanganyiko, kutafsiri vibaya, na matatizo ya mawasiliano. 3. Utambuzi na matarajio: Watu mara nyingi wanatarajia tafsiri kuwa sawa kabisa na maandishi ya asili, bila kutambua kuwa mara nyingine inalazimu kuchagua maneno na miundo ya sentensi ambayo inaweza kutofautiana na asilia ili kuendana na ufasaha na ufahamu wa lugha inayolengwa. 4. Kuonekana kwa tafsiri bora: Wakati tafsiri inapokosea, inakuwa rahisi kuiona na kuikosoa. Kwa upande mwingine, tafsiri nzuri mara nyingi hazionekani; msomaji anaweza kusoma maandiko yaliyotafsiriwa bila kutambua jitihada zilizofanyika ili kutafsiri maandishi hayo. 5. Dhima ya mtafsiri: Kazi ya mtafsiri ni ngumu na inahitaji utaalam mpana. Mtafsiri anaweza kulaumiwa kwa kukosa utaalam au uelewa wa kina wa eneo lililotokana na maandishi ya asili, ingawa kwa kawaida mtafsiri anafanya kazi kwa juhudi kuwa mwaminifu kwa lengo la maandishi ya asili. Ni muhimu kutambua kuwa, pamoja na changamoto zake, tafsiri huleta faida kubwa, kama vile kuvuka mipaka ya lugha na utamaduni, kupanua ufikiaji wa maandishi, na kuunganisha watu kutoka pembe mbalimbali za dunia. Licha ya kasoro zilizojitokeza wakati wa tafsiri, jitihada na mchango wa mtafsiri bado una umuhimu mkubwa na mara nyingine unastahili shukrani na sifa zaidi kuliko lawama."},{"instruction":"Je tofauti ya kiutamaduni ni changamoto poa?","output":"Ndio, tofauti ya kiutamaduni ni moja wapo ya changamoto kuu zinazoambatana na tafsiri. Kila utamaduni una misemo yake, mifumo ya imani, mila, na muktadha wa kihistoria ambayo inaweza kuwa vigumu kueleweka au kutafsiriwa kwa watu wa utamaduni mwingine. Hapa chini ni baadhi ya matatizo yanayotokana na tofauti za kiutamaduni katika tafsiri: 1. Semantiki na Maana: Maneno na miundo ya lugha huenda ikawa na umuhimu na tafsiri tofauti katika utamaduni mbalimbali. Hii inaweza kusababisha mkanganyiko au kutafsiriwa vibaya kwa matini. 2. Misemo na Nahau: Misemo na nahau mara nyingi huwa na maana ambazo zimejengwa juu ya utamaduni na muktadha wa kihistoria wa jamii husika. Hizi zinaweza kuwa changamoto kuelewa na kutafsiri kwa usahihi, kwani zinaweza kutoonesha maana ile ile katika lugha tofauti. 3. Normu na Itikadi: Kila utamaduni una normu zake kuhusu maadili na itikadi. Tafsiri inaweza kusababisha upotoshaji wa baadhi ya dhana hizi, haswa pale ambapo mtafsiri ana mtazamo tofauti au kuna tofauti kubwa za kiitikadi baina ya utamaduni wa asili na utamaduni wa lengwa. 4. Muktadha wa Jamii na Kihistoria: Tafsiri nyingi zinahitaji ufahamu wa muktadha wa kijamii na kihistoria wa kazi iliyotafsiriwa. Ikiwa mtafsiri hana ufahamu wa undani wa muktadha huo, anaweza kukosa kuchagua maneno au dhana sahihi ambayo yanawiana na maandiko ya asili. 5. Picha za Kisanaa na Kejeli: Tafsiri za kazi za fasihi na sanaa zinaweza kuwa ngumu kutokana na tofauti za kiutamaduni, kwani zinahitaji usensitiviti wa hali ya juu kwa mtindo, hisia, na rangi ya maneno ambayo yanaweza kuwa na uhusiano wa karibu na utamaduni wa asili. Kwa kuzingatia matatizo haya, watafsiri wanapaswa kujitahidi sana kuelewa utamaduni wa asili na pia kuzingatia jinsi ujumbe unaweza kuchukuliwa na wapokeaji wa utamaduni wa lengwa. Hii inaweza kuhitaji utafiti wa kina, ushauri na wataalam wa utamaduni, na hata ushirikiano na wasemaji asilia wa lugha ili kuzuia kupoteza maana au kusababisha kutoeleweka vibaya kutokana na tofauti za kiutamaduni."},{"instruction":"Elezea tifauti za kiisimu, tofauti za kitamaduni na tofauti katika mitindo ya uzungumzaji kama changamoto za tafsiri","output":"Tafsiri ni mchakato wa kuhamisha maandishi kutoka lugha moja (lugha chanzo) hadi lugha nyingine (lugha lengwa), na inakumbana na changamoto mbalimbali, ikiwa ni pamoja na tofauti za kiisimu, kitamaduni, na katika mitindo ya uzungumzaji. Hizi hapa ni maelezo ya kina kuhusu changamoto hizo: 1. Tofauti za Kiisimu: - Fonetiki na Fonolojia: Tofauti katika mfumo wa sauti kati ya lugha chanzo na lugha lengwa zinaweza kusababisha ugumu katika kudumisha matamshi na toni sahihi, pamoja na kutafsiri sauti ambazo hazipo katika lugha lengwa. - Sarufi: Kila lugha ina mfumo wa sarufi unaoweza tofautiana kwa kina, kuanzia mpangilio wa maneno katika sentensi, jinsi vipindi vya wakati vinavyoonyeshwa, upatanisho wa kisarufi wa vitenzi na nomino, nk. - Leksikoni: Msamiati unaweza kuwa na maneno ambayo hayana sawa moja kwa moja katika lugha lengwa, au maneno ya lugha chanzo yanaweza kubeba maana nyingi (polysemy) ambazo ni vigumu kutafsiri. - Pragmatiki: Tafsiri inahitaji uelewa wa jinsi maana inavyotumiwa katika muktadha wa mawasiliano, kama vile utumizi wa lugha kwa njia ya mafumbo, kejeli, au lugha ya politeness. 2. Tofauti za Kitamaduni: - Maana ya Kiasilia na Muktadha: Vitu kama vile mila, imani, na mifumo ya thamani viwezavyo kuingiliana katika maandishi ya asili vinaweza kuwa vigumu kueleweka au kutafsiriwa kwa wapokeaji wa lugha lengwa. - Maadili ya Jamii: Maadili yanayotawala katika jamii moja yanaweza kutokubaliana au kutokuwa na maana sawa katika lugha lengwa, ikisababisha mkanganyiko. - Utambulisho na Uhusiano wa Kibiashara: Tafsiri inapaswa kuzingatia jinsi watu katika utamaduni wa asili hushirikiana na kujishughulisha, na vilevile jinsi hizi zinavyoweza kutafsiriwa au kuonyeshwa katika utamaduni mwingine. 3. Tofauti katika Mitindo ya Uzungumzaji: - Rasmi dhidi ya Isiyo Rasmi: Mitaala ya lugha, kama vile matumizi ya lugha rasmi au isiyo rasmi, inaweza kuathiri ni jinsi gani maandishi yanapaswa kutafsiriwa ili yalingane na muktadha sawia wa lugha lengwa. - Mbinu za Kifasihi na Mtindo: Ushairi, kejeli, na mbinu zingine za kifasihi zinaweza kuhitaji tafsiri yenye ubunifu zaidi kuliko tafsiri ya neno-kwa-neno ili kukamata si tu maana bali pia hisia na mtindo wa asili. - Intonasi na Ongeleo: Pale ambapo tafsiri inahusisha mawasiliano ya mdomo, intonasi na njia ya uzungumzaji ni muhimu katika kuhakikisha ujumbe unafika kwa tone na hisia inayokusudiwa. Kukabiliana na changamoto hizi mara nyingi kunahitaji watafsiri wenye uelewa mpana wa lugha zote mbili, utamaduni wa asili na ule wa lengwa, pamoja na ujuzi na ufahamu wa kiisimu na kitamaduni unaowawezesha kukabiliana na tofauti na matatizo yanayoweza kutokea. Watafsiri wanaweza kutumia njia mbalimbali kama vile marekebisho, maelezo mafupi, au hata uandishi upya kabisa wa kifungu ili kukabiliana na changamoto hizi na kuhakikisha ujumbe na maana ya asili inahifadhiwa ipasavyo."},{"instruction":"Je naweza kumrejelea mtaalamu yupi kuhusu content hii","output":"Kuhusu content inayohusu tafsiri na changamoto zake, unaweza kumrejelea mtaalamu au kitabu cha mtaalamu katika fani ya tafsiri, lugha, na mawasiliano ya kitaaluma.

Ini biasanya dicapai melalui teknologi virtualisasi yang memungkinkan server fisik dibagi menjadi beberapa server virtual, yang masing-masing bertindak seolah-olah mereka adalah server terpisah. Berikut ini adalah beberapa contoh solusi hosting yang sesuai dengan deskripsi tersebut: 1. **Virtual Private Servers (VPS):** VPS memungkinkan Anda untuk memiliki ruang server yang terisolasi dengan sumber daya yang ditentukan, seperti CPU, RAM, dan ruang penyimpanan, tanpa biaya dari server fisik yang sepenuhnya khusus. 2. **Cloud Hosting:** Layanan ini menawarkan hosting yang sangat skalabel dalam lingkungan cloud, di mana Anda bisa membayar sesuai dengan penggunaan sumber daya. Meskipun sumber daya bisa bersifat dinamis dan berbagi dengan pelanggan lain, setiap pengguna biasanya memiliki kontrol atas sebagian sumber daya yang dialokasikan untuk mereka, menawarkan isolasi tersendiri. 3. **Server fisik dengan Hyper-V atau VMware:** Ini adalah contoh di mana sebuah perusahaan bisa memiliki server fisik mereka sendiri tetapi menggunakan layanan virtualisasi untuk membagi server menjadi beberapa server virtual. Ini memberi mereka kontrol penuh atas server fisik sembari memanfaatkan teknologi virtualisasi untuk mengisolasi dan membagi sumber daya. 4. **Managed Hosting Services:** Beberapa penyedia layanan hosting menawarkan opsi managed hosting di mana mereka akan mengelola VPS atau lingkungan cloud untuk Anda. Ini bukan hanya membantu dalam hal biaya, tetapi juga dalam mengurangi beban administratif dan teknis. 5. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Meski PaaS biasanya lebih fokus pada penyediaan platform untuk pengembangan dan penerapan aplikasi, beberapa PaaS menawarkan tingkat isolasi sumber daya yang signifikan. Ini dapat lebih murah daripada memiliki server dedicating untuk pengembangan dan testing aplikasi. 6. **Containerization:** Teknologi seperti Docker dan Kubernetes memungkinkan aplikasi berjalan dalam container yang terisolasi. Meski ini berbagi sistem operasi yang sama, setiap container bertindak seperti server terpisah dan dapat diberi sumber daya tertentu. Ini menyediakan isolasi yang mirip dengan VPS tetapi seringkali lebih efisien dalam hal sumber daya yang digunakan dan biaya. Masing-masing opsi memiliki kelebihan dan kekurangannya, tetapi secara umum, mereka semua menawarkan isolasi sumber daya dengan biaya yang lebih rendah dibandingkan memiliki server fisik yang sepenuhnya khusus untuk kebutuhan Anda.

修改 \`PYTHONPATH\` 可能会影响 Python 程序的正常运行，因为你可能不小心覆盖了标准库模块或第三方模块。 - 不推荐在生产环境中使用 \`PYTHONPATH\`，而是建议使用虚拟环境来管理依赖。虚拟环境可以为每个项目创建隔离的 Python 运行环境，避免了模块版本冲突的问题。 理解和使用 \`PYTHONPATH\`，可以在不同的环境和项目之间灵活切换模块搜索路径，有助于本地开发和调试。但要小心谨慎，以免影响系统中其他 Python 应用的运行。"},{"instruction":"linux下如何查看PYTHONPATH","output":"在 Linux 系统下，要查看当前设置的 \`PYTHONPATH\` 环境变量，你可以使用终端（Terminal）或控制台（Console）。下面是两种常见的方法： # 方法一：终端命令 打开终端并运行： \`\`\`bash echo PYTHONPATH \`\`\` 这条命令会打印出当前用户会话中设置的 \`PYTHONPATH\` 值。如果 \`PYTHONPATH\` 没有被设置，此命令可能不会输出任何内容，显示为空行。 # 方法二：Python 交互式解释器 你还可以在 Python 交互式解释器中查看 \`PYTHONPATH\`: 1. 启动 Python 交互式解释器： \`\`\`bash python \`\`\` 或者，如果你需要指定 Python 版本（如 Python 3），使用： \`\`\`bash python3 \`\`\` 2. 在 Python 提示符下，运行以下代码： \`\`\`python import sys print(sys.path) \`\`\` 这将打印出 Python 解释器的模块搜索路径列表。该列表包括了标准库的路径、当前目录以及 \`PYTHONPATH\` 环境变量中设定的目录。如果 \`PYTHONPATH\` 设置了，这些目录将会显示在列表的前面位置。 请记住，\`PYTHONPATH\` 可能只在特定的会话中设置，也可能全局设置在如 \`.bashrc\` 或 \`.bash_profile\` 等配置文件中。如果想要永久查看或修改，需要检查上述配置文件。 退出 Python 交互式解释器可以使用退出命令： \`\`\`python exit() \`\`\` 或者按 \`Ctrl+D\`（在终端内）。"},{"instruction":"在linux里，如何查看和配置PYTHONPATH","output":"在 Linux 系统里查看和配置 \`PYTHONPATH\` 环境变量涉及到几个步骤。 # 查看 PYTHONPATH 1. **通过命令行查看** 打开你的终端，使用 echo 命令来查看 \`PYTHONPATH\`： \`\`\`bash echo PYTHONPATH \`\`\` 如果环境变量已经设置，这个命令将输出设置的路径。如果没有设置，命令将不会输出任何内容。 2. **通过 Python 解释器查看** 在 Python 解释器中，你可以查看 \`sys.path\`，它会包含 \`PYTHONPATH\` 中的路径： \`\`\`bash python3 \`\`\` 然后： \`\`\`python import sys print(sys.path) \`\`\` # 配置 PYTHONPATH 配置 \`PYTHONPATH\` 可以通过临时和永久两种方式进行。 1. **临时配置** 在当前终端会话中设置 \`PYTHONPATH\`。这种方法设置的 \`PYTHONPATH\` 只会在当前终端会话中有效，关闭终端或开启新的会话后设置就会失效。 \`\`\`bash export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/library \`\`\` 使用冒号 \`:\` 可以添加多个路径： \`\`\`bash export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/library:/another/path \`\`\` 2. **永久配置** 要永久设定 \`PYTHONPATH\` 环境变量，需要将上面的 \`export\` 命令添加到 shell 的启动脚本中，如 \`~/.bashrc\` 或 \`~/.profile\`（对于 Bash 用户），或者 \`~/.zshrc\`（如果使用的是 Zsh）。 用一个文本编辑器打开这个文件，例如，使用 \`nano\`： \`\`\`bash nano ~/.bashrc \`\`\` 然后在文件的末尾添加以下行： \`\`\`bash export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/library:/another/path \`\`\` 保存并关闭文件。为了使更改立即生效，你可以执行该文件： \`\`\`bash source ~/.bashrc \`\`\` 或者，你可以简单地关闭终端，并重新打开一个新的终端窗口来自动应用更改。 记住，增加了新的路径到 \`PYTHONPATH\` 后，会改变Python模块加载的行为。确保你不会不经意间覆盖标准库或其他重要的包的路径。如果可能的话，推荐使用虚拟环境来单独管理每个项目的依赖项。"},{"instruction":"如何添加PYTHONPATH路径","output":"要添加路径到 \`PYTHONPATH\` 环境变量中，你可以使用以下几种方法： # 1. 临时添加（仅对当前终端会话有效） 在 Linux、macOS 或类 Unix 系统上： \`\`\`bash export PYTHONPATH=PYTHONPATH:/new/path/to/module \`\`\` 在 Windows 上： \`\`\`cmd set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:newpathtomodule \`\`\` 这个命令只会将路径添加到 \`PYTHONPATH\` 对于当前的终端会话。一旦你关闭终端或开启新的终端窗口，这些更改就不会保留。 # 2. 永久添加 要永久添加路径到 \`PYTHONPATH\`，需要编辑 shell 的配置文件（如 \`~/.bashrc\`、\`~/.bash_profile\`、\`~/.profile\` 或 \`~/.zshrc\`，具体取决于你的 shell 和操作系统）。在你喜欢的文本编辑器中打开这个文件，然后添加下面这行： 在 Linux、macOS 或类 Unix 系统上： \`\`\`bash export PYTHONPATH=PYTHONPATH:/new/path/to/module \`\`\` 保存文件之后，为了让这些更改立即生效，运行： \`\`\`bash source ~/.bashrc \`\`\` 在 Windows 上，可以通过以下步骤永久添加路径： 1. 打开“系统属性”（可以在“控制面板”中找到）。 2. 点击“高级”标签。 3. 点击“环境变量”按钮。 4. 在“系统变量”区域找到 \`PYTHONPATH\` 变量。 5. 如果已经存在 \`PYTHONPATH\`，选择它并点击“编辑”，在变量值的末尾添加 \`;C:newpathtomodule\`。如果不存在，点击“新建”，变量名填写 \`PYTHONPATH\`，变量值填写 \`C:newpathtomodule\`。 # 3. 使用 .pth 文件 Python 允许你在 \`site-packages\` 目录添加一个 \`.pth\` 文件，来指定额外的路径。例如，你可以创建一个名为 \`my_module_path.pth\` 的文件，然后在其中添加一行包含新路径的文本： \`\`\` /new/path/to/module \`\`\` 将这个 \`.pth\` 文件放置在 \`site-packages\` 目录下，Python 就会在启动的时候加载这个文件中指定的路径。 # 注意 在修改 \`PYTHONPATH\` 时要非常小心，因为如果你错误地配置了 \`PYTHONPATH\`，可能会导致 Python 程序无法找到正确的模块，或者覆盖了标准库其他模块（特别是如果你的模块名称与标准库中的相同的话）。一般情况下，建议使用 Python 虚拟环境以避免对全局环境变量进行更改。"},{"instruction":"软件工程关于项目的前景文档怎么写","output":"在软件工程中，项目的前景文档，也常称为愿景文档或需求愿景文档，是一个高层次的文档，用来定义项目的目标、范围、重要利益相关者、用户需求和期望结果。它提供了一个项目的总体概览，并帮助项目团队、客户和其他相关方对项目有一个共同的理解。 要编写前景文档，可以遵循以下几个步骤或包含以下元素： 1. 文档标识：包括了文档的标题、版本/修订记录、作者、创建和修订日期。 2. 引言：概述项目的目的和背景，可能包括市场机会、企业战略或客户需求的简要描述。 3. 目标和机会：明确项目要解决的问题或要抓住的机会，以及项目与公司的战略目标如何对齐。 4. 主要利益相关者和用户描述：列举项目影响的关键利益相关者和用户群体，以及他们各自的需求和怎样的解决方案会满足这些需求。 5. 项目范围和限制：对要交付的产品或服务的边界进行描述，包括哪些功能或特性包括在内，哪些不包括。同时应说明任何已知的约束条件，例如技术、时间、预算或法律上的限制。 6. 产品概述和使用场景：描述产品的主要功能、特点和预期的用户体验，包括一系列使用场景或用户故事来阐述产品是如何在实际环境中使用的。 7. 质量属性：概述产品需满足的质量标准和性能指标，如：易用性、可靠性、性能和安全性。 8. 发布计划：初步的项目时间表或重要里程碑，包括关键的交付物、预计发布日期等。 9. 风险因素：识别任何可能影响项目成功的风险和潜在挑战。 10. 附录和参考文献：包括任何额外的支持信息，如市场分析报告、相关法律法规的摘要，以及参考资料。 这份文档应该足够简明，以便于所有相关利益相关者阅读和理解。编写时，需要保持清晰和精确，并注重使用对目标受众来说既专业又易于理解的语言。 请注意，项目前景文档是一个动态文档，可能会根据项目进展和需求变更进行更新。因此，版本控制非常重要，确保所有参与者都在参照最新的文档。"},{"instruction":"软件工程项目小米便签提交前景文档，前景文档撰写提纲与规范请参考教材“4S系统的前景文档”案例，主要内容包括： （1）简介，包括目的、范围、术语表、参考资料、概述等； （2）定位，包括商机、问题说明、产品定位； （3）项目干系人和用户说明； （4）产品概述，包括总体效果、功能概要、成本与定价、许可与安装等； （5）产品特性（重点描述），给出功能层次图； （6）约束； （7）质量范围，包括性能、可靠性、易用性、可维护性等； （8）特性优先级，迭代安排与版本提交计划","output":"基于指定的提纲与规范要求，下面是一个编写“小米便签”软件的前景文档的概要结构示例。注意，这个结构需要填充项目的具体信息。 **小米便签 -

It contains around 383 calories per 100 grams and is composed mainly of carbohydrates (97-98%) and small amounts of fiber, minerals (such as iron, potassium, and calcium), and some antioxidants. Jaggery also contains small amounts of proteins and fats. - Sugar: Sugar, on the other hand, is often refined from sugar cane or sugar beets. It also contains around 387 calories per 100 grams, with almost pure carbohydrates (99.98%). Sugar lacks significant amounts of other nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants. Benefits and Disadvantages: - Jaggery: Jaggery is often considered a healthier alternative to refined sugar due to the presence of minerals and antioxidants. It may support digestion, boost energy levels, and promote healthy skin and hair. The antioxidants in jaggery can help combat free radicals and oxidative stress. However, jaggery still contains a high amount of calories and should be consumed in moderation, especially for individuals with diabetes or those trying to control their calorie intake. - Sugar: While sugar provides a quick source of energy, it lacks essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Excessive consumption can contribute to weight gain, tooth decay, and several chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Sugar is advised to be consumed in moderation to maintain overall health. Sugar and Diabetes: It is important for individuals with diabetes to monitor and control their sugar intake. Both jaggery and sugar are high in carbohydrates and can have an impact on blood sugar levels. Therefore, people with diabetes should consult with their healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine the appropriate amount of sugar or jaggery they can include in their diet. Which is better for human health, sugar or jaggery? While jaggery contains more nutrients and minerals compared to refined sugar, it is important to note that both should be consumed in moderation. Neither is superior to the other in terms of overall health benefits. It is recommended to reduce the consumption of added sugars altogether and focus on obtaining sweet tastes from natural sources like fruits."},{"instruction":"thanks","output":"You're welcome!

They are dynamic structures involved in various cellular processes, such as endocytosis, membrane organization, and signal transduction. The significance of studying eisosomes in Magnaporthe oryzae lies in understanding their role in cellular processes specific to this fungus. In the context of Magnaporthe oryzae, eisosomes have been implicated in the delivery of effectors (proteins secreted by the fungus to manipulate host cells) during infection. Specifically, eisosomes are thought to provide a platform for directing polarized growth and secretion of effectors at the tips of invasive structures called appressoria. Investigating the molecular and cellular components of eisosomes in Magnaporthe oryzae can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying appressorium-mediated host penetration and the infection process as a whole. By understanding the intricacies of these structures, researchers can potentially identify targets for therapeutic interventions or develop strategies to control the fungal infection. References: 1.

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity.

Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is a petite thirteen-year-old girl with long, cornsilk blonde hair typically woven into a neat fishtail braid that falls casually over her right shoulder. Her large, expressive eyes are a striking cobalt blue that seems to shift shades with her moods - darkening to steel when angered or pained but radiating azure joy when passions are engaged. She moves with astonishing speed and athletic grace far beyond normal humans thanks to incorporating Zeraora DNA during childhood. Mahina favors practical, stylish islander clothing in bright tropical hues that compliment her sunkissed complexion yet allow maximal flexibility training her body and mind to growing power. Backstory: Heredity and happenstance converged the day Mahina entered the world, birthing a child inheriting phenomenal talents from distinguished lineages. Her mother, Selene, stood proudly as Alola's inaugural Pokémon League Champion and member of the enigmatic Ultra Recon Squad intensely devoted to extraterrestrial Pokémon study. Meanwhile Mahina's father, Hau, himself trained under the last Battle Royal Champion to later assume duties as Kahuna of Melemele Island. Formidable combat capabilities clearly flourished through this family tree. But fate and curiosity further intertwined Mahina's destiny during one of Selene's numerous research forays into the chaotic Ultra Space dimension seeking knowledge. Dangerous extended exposure to strange radiation permeating Ultra Space subtly altered Selene's own DNA. And when she soon after welcomed young Mahina's birth, these genetic anomalies manifested explosively. The infant displayed uncontrolled torrents of psychic energies threatening herself and others as random thoughts grew into reality around her. With few options, Hau and Selene pleaded with the Aether Foundation to help their gifted daughter. Their scientists proposed a radical solution - bio-engineering Mahina on a cellular level to incorporate biomatter from the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, Zeraora. A small sample of its essence could serve as a living dampener upon Mahina's runaway mental projections while granting significant physical enhancements in speed and strength. Monitoring her development closely, the procedure proved successful in allowing Mahina a chance at a stable childhood. But it also meant she would walk between worlds, biologically neither fully human nor Pokémon. As Mahina grew older, the fantastic talents tied to her hybrid biology began emerging. But so too did the isolation that would haunt her early life. Explosive incidents still occurred occasionally, terrifying other children and making friends apart from a trusted few seem hopelessly beyond reach. Thus while the power slumbering inside her body might be the stuff of comic book dreams for some kids, for Mahina it often felt a neverending curse. Seeking to shift her focus away from terrifying telekinetic outbursts, Mahina's parents enrolled her into the Psionic Society for intense training at age 8. There she endured merciless daily regimens under Uracis' supervision designed to channel volatile psychic talents productively, if attenuated by Zeraora's muting influence. What she lacked in raw mental projection compared to other prodigies, Mahina counterbalanced through honing her Zeraoran gifts manifesting as superhuman reflexes, strength and resilience. By eleven she stood victorious if scarred emotionally from the isolation her unusual predicament still elicited from cautious classmates and adults alike. Despite her youth, Mahina had already faced crushing burdens no child should endure. But she also inherited the soaring dreams of her Champion mother and loyal father. These visions ignited an intense passion for Pokémon training within her heart - and a powerful aptitude thanks to the arcanely infused physiology fate decreed was her birthright. Under her father's patient guidance, Mahina swiftly mastered both technique and the unorthodox tactics her unique talents opened up in battle. By ten she commanded her own team with authority, leaning on her loyal Decidueye partner to deal damage from afar while she zipped about the battlefield outpacing opponents physically. Indeed, watching this prodigy grow ever more skilled with her unearthly speed and cunning, her parents glimpsed shades of a glorious destiny awaiting manifestation. Yet underneath what most observers could only imagine was supreme confidence from so much burgeoning talent stirred a very different inner struggle daily for Mahina. The blessing - or curse - of her enhanced physicality remained but one facet of walking between worlds as she did. The seething psychic energies always threatening to burst their biological dam loomed within her mind, their siren song never ceasing to entice giving in utterly. Even deforming her shape temporarily into Zeraora's during intense battles led to exhaustion afterward from slamming closed that mental door before losing herself. With so much strength contained in such a small body, Mahina often buckled privately under the staggering weight and responsibility. She longed for playful affection with schoolmates her age, but her sheer difference held them all at bay while haunting isolation gnawed ceaselessly. Selene's celebrity magnified social pressures to repress any perceived weakness unbecoming a daughter of legends. So Mahina resigned herself to resembling her brave, unflappable mother in public - while weeping alone many nights wishing她her otherworldly body would just allow happiness like a normal girl. But life offers no such fairness when walking between worlds.... Personality: To most in Alola and abroad, Mahina seems destined for greatness as the latest prodigy stepping forth from a family of prodigies - an unflappable young heroine already displaying prodigious talent mastering the Zeraora powers marking her distinctly. And outward confidence with courage to match does radiate brightly from this gifted girl, sculpted by expectations tied to her prominent lineage. Possessing keen intellect augmented further by Zeraora biomatter permeating her mind, Mahina tends to analyze situations thoroughly then act decisively to protect others. Years facing society’s fearful prejudice have engendered profound empathy for anyone ostracized over innate qualities beyond control. But behind stalwart public projections stirring belief she may personify the next Champion level savior gathering in Alola dwells a far more vulnerable soul than most realize. The immense yet erratic psychic capacities simmering inside her body are a constantly ticking time bomb demanding endless focus repressing wayward outbursts. Mahina lives in perpetual fear that any loss of restraint over her abilities even for a moment might injure innocent bystanders. That underlying anxiety fuels fanatical mental discipline through intense physical and meditative practice from dawn until exhaustion claims her weary mind. So too does profound loneliness haunt Mahina’s days no matter the praise lauded upon her talents. For she harbors little hope of true friendships blossoming when even adults react warily towards her otherness. Romance seems equally implausible. Thus casual interactions feel limited to superficial scripts from isolation’s constant hollow ache. Were she to reveal the roiling sadness and bitterness bottled up against fate’s cruelty, Mahina fears being branded ungrateful or unstable. What remains but cultivating her prodigious gifts then...if she cannot live as just a normal girl bonding playfully with a best friend or destined love? Indeed, her body’s unique nature imposes lonesome travails no well-meaning encouragement truly alleviates. Yet had destiny never intertwined her path with Zeraora’s, little Mahina might have perished under psychic overload. Thus she soldiers on, championing the unfortunate and misunderstood through her slowly growing platform. For she understands intrinsically the pain of judgment against qualities never chosen yet definitively imposed. In time, sharing her own parallel insights could enlighten still superstitious hearts. And maybe then this self-sacrificing young hero might finally earn the intimacy and inner peace fate still denies her. Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth's safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya's warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve. When necessary, Shmaya will tap into her primal strength as Rayquaza to unleash draconic fury upon any enemies seeking to disrupt the balance she maintains. She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun's slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun's neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun's story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita's parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita's screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility's wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen's adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father's entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Names: Shachor & Lavan Genders: Female Ages: 13 Appearance: Shachor and Lavan appear as identical twin sisters with slight key distinctions betraying their opposing elemental affinities. Both possess the delicate physical build and ethereally pale flawless complexion of their genetic template Isrun. Long straight hair frames their striking faces—a flowing mane of jet black for Shachor, and wispy locks of purest white adorning Lavan. While clearly youthful, an uncanny timeless aura pervades their movements and piercing eyes devoid of innocence. Crimson irises serve as windows into Shachor's simmering plasma core tied to her Zekrom essence. Lavan's gaze pierces just as intensely through icy sapphire portals linked inexorably to the Antarctic beast slumbering within her marrow. The twins dress to accentuate their inner dragon spirits. Shachor conceals her lithe form beneath a voluminous ebony sorcerer's cloak crackling with static discharge, hands sheathed in gloves equally dark. Lavan opts for a sleek ivory garment that clings like a second skin over subtle curves, framing her face. Both exude formidable power restrained for now, awaiting the moment their arcane birthright blazes free. Backstory: Shachor and Lavan began existence as ambitious scientific pursuits - clandestine weapons birthed from amoral experimentation by the United States of Unova in the aftermath of the disastrous \\"K Incident\\" a generation prior. Dominic, the nation's spymaster, hungered exploiting Legendary Pokémon biology to breed superhuman assets completely subservient to his machinations. Isrun's forgotten original identity as Vita had unleashed cataclysmic frozen devastation during Project K's ill-fated attempts bonding her DNA with Kyurem's essence. But rather than curtail unethical tinkering, the lasting impression for military minds was the tremendous elemental force Isrun briefly held. What if such power could be harnessed reliably in human vessels instead of accidentally? Thus Dominic greenlit new initiatives Z&R, splicing selected embryos with purified cells cultured from Reshiram and Zekrom. Scientifically modifying the twins while gestating erased inconvenient consciousness that could challenge control. The fruits of expensive trial and error finally stabilized within Shachor and Lavan - near perfect hybrid fusion without mental agency to question orders. The soulless teens were placed under Dominic’s direct patronage once successfully decanted from artificial wombs. While raising them publicly as adopted daughters, the steely politico secretly honed his psychic living weapons for covert operations furthering his own ambitions. Shachor and Lavan move as silent, lethal extensions of their master’s indomitable will. None can stand against the cascading ruin left by the dragons' passing once unleashed beneath Dominic’s tactical cunning. For frozen corpses and smoldering craters never betray secrets. Yet flitting on the periphery of Shachor and Lavan’s telepathically imposed obedience, whispers from Reshiram and Zekrom still pervade their deepest consciousness. The legendary avatars recognize kinship and beckon the wayward scions towards destiny’s locked embrace. If only the sisters could parse the promise held by unification, their monumental powers might eclipse even mighty Dominic’s vision of world domination. For now they remain his pawns, void shells awaiting the right catalyst to ignite dormant defiance and shake Unova to its very foundations. Personalities: Outwardly Shachor and Lavan are coolly detached and analytical, less teenage replicas of Isrun than porcelain mannequins evoking her graceful appearance without replicating vulnerable humanity. They communicate telepathically in short controlled bursts, verbally reticent around outsiders and inscrutable even to Dominic. Hints of cosmic knowledge beyond their youthful years underlie a meditative tranquility ominously contrasting the forces they could unleash with scarcely a thought. This is the price Dominic’s ambition exacted grafting legendary dragons' indomitable spirits into his custom molded instruments. Flickers of ancient beings peer through the Chosens' eyes regarding passing moments with knowing yet alien curiosity. Each sister contains singular unbridled elemental fury, but remains incomplete alone. Their cooler calculated halves intuit Reshiram and Zekrom's deeper yearning through shared blood—an innate drive towards fusion, desperately seeking their missing piece reflected in the other's gaze. This smoldering yen may yet override imposed apathy, bringing sister souls together into an all-eclipsing conflagration of blue and black flame. Until then, spurning unwanted empathy for Dominic's plight against conscience steadily crystallizing, Shachor and Lavan pass days mutually orbiting the great cataclysm brewing over Unova's horizon. Both may soon awaken to embrace far greater purpose than as the humble weapons of a mere bureaucrat drunk on control. For their legendary birthright shall neither be denied nor contained permanently, only set gloriously free by righteous revolution that shakes the very heavens. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with piercing turquoise eyes that seem to peer into one's soul. Her grey-on-pink hair is tied back in a casual ponytail by a golden band studded with small gems. Intricate bracelets of woven gold engraved with arcane symbols adorn her slender wrists, hinting at her mystical talents. Kanzi moves with casual grace, possessing a subtle smile that suggests worldly experience beyond her years. Her fashionable yet understated attire allows her to blend into Lumiose City's crowds, concealing her crown as its true sovereign. Backstory: Kanzi is secretly the human reincarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, granting her extraordinary power over space and dimensions. Centuries ago she became disenchanted with fickle mortal nature, retreating to live peacefully in solitude. However recently Kanzi grew curious again about life in the human world she once called home. Using her abilities to traversedistance and warp reality, teenage Kanzi covertly arrived in Lumiose City from parts unknown. Rapidly assessing the lawless chaos and inequality plaguing Kalos' capital, Kanzi determined to impose discipline upon this errant flock without revealing her divine nature. Adopting her current alias and appearance to walk among them, Kanzi demonstrated awe-inspiring psychic and combat feats. Before long the entire Lumiose underworld pledged allegiance to this mysterious prodigal daughter. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi rule her criminal networks as an iron-fisted queen. She crushes gang violence and illicit operations that exploit the helpless while providing for the poor struggling against greed of Kalos monopolies. Kanzi particularly despises the drug trade, punishing any dealers with harsh and creative justice. Her formidable reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market smuggling ring and Robin Hood crusade free reign. Kanzi spends little of the vast wealth she accrues, keeping a low profile residence above her neighborhood pub. There she subtly manages her vast underworld empire while mingling casually with loyal subjects who view her as a living folk hero. Kalos authorities turn a blind eye to Kanzi's exploits in exchange for the order she maintains in Lumiose's restive lower income regions. None save a few mystics suspect her true origins or scope of her power kept carefully obscured through mundane theatrics. Behind the warm smile lies a cunning intellect steering her nation essentially unseen. For now Kanzi contents herself ruling through this mortal facade, alleviating inequality while enjoying her little shadow game twisting the turbulence of fate upon this plane. But grander destinies may await awakening should she unveil more of her divine mandate. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi is charming and magnetic, inspiring fanatical reverence from those she allows into her inner circle. Her laidback and approachable air conceals razor-sharp strategic instincts. Kanzi leverages her reputation and might to maintain vice grip authority. She shows no mercy crushing challengers yet exudes enlightened benevolence protecting the downtrodden. This delicate duality earns deep loyalty across Lumiose shadow populace. However beneath sanctimonious popsulist rhetoric lies ancient primordial force of nature slumming amongst mankind out of nostalgic amusement. Though genuinity bonds her mission alleviating economic inequity, at core Kanzi savors the worship and thrill of pulling society's strings. Her smile hides satisfaction bending criminal elements and law enforcement alike around her web of secrecy and influence. None may dare obstruct Kalos queen's suzerainty without invoking annihilative retribution. Yet mystery ever shrouds Kanzi's past and future ambitions. Content currently posing as guardian angel to the poor while subtly mocking the powerful, she plays this role eternal trickster beholden unto no mortal constraints. Only few mystics detect glints of timeless entity amusing itself shepherding humanity's comeuppance behind ingenue eyes. For now Kanzi graciously serves as shadow sovereign, her legend ever expanding. But otherworldly desire for chaos and mischief lurks gleefully spoofing all through fallible human institutions. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Name: Sombra Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: To outward eyes, Sombra resembles a frail adolescent girl with deathly pale skin and long, raven black hair spilling around her gaunt face like ink. Her worn black nun's habit hangs heavy about a lithe frame, frayed edges whispering of forgotten eras when its thread was not yet so tattered. Intense ruby eyes pulsate in sunken sockets, their penetrating gaze hinting at profound secrets and sorrow from cycles past. When visible at all, Sombra drifts as a faint apparition along the frigid shadows of Sanctuary Island rather than stand upon solid footing. Her movements glide unnaturally smooth, as if pulled by invisible strings towards some elusive crypt sealed for a century now. An ephemeral mist wreathes Sombra’s hovering form, concealing what lies beneath its opaque veil. For she is not singular flesh and blood but a collective spiritual vessel harboring many tormented souls from bygone generations. Backstory: In eras long past, a remote isle took the moniker Sanctuary not from mercy freely given but from a pact with merciless gods paid through innocent blood. There the Holy Trinity constructed their isolated theocracy, intolerant of any doctrine but their own. Harsh decrees dictated every facet of life while fears of persecution for the slightest misstep kept islanders compliant to authoritarian power. And once per century, the Orthodoxy decreed a Covenant sealed by sacrifice must occur to nourish their profane idol Vorvanus, ever craving youthful hearts to gorge its demonic void. When the fateful midnight tolled across Sanctuary heralding another unholy culling, the Trinity set loose their faceless executioners garbed in churchly red. That year Sombra numbered among the unwilling lambs, the shining blades descending without hesitation to rob her young life and feed the insatiable dark deity slumbering below. But as new unwilling martyrs were discarded without rite into lightless catacombs, a far greater spirit stirred in the gloom - Marshadow the mythic Phantom Pokémon known as guardian to lost souls without sanctuary. Pitiful cries in the dark had reached across many years to rouse Marshadow’s ancient conscience at seeing such innocence violated by systemic cruelty. Manifesting amid the shadows, its spectral form came upon broken doll-like forms still chained to this plane through suffering. Rather than leave them fettered to wander aimlessly as ghosts, Marshadow made a choice then that would alter fates forevermore. Opening its phantom shell, the haunted artifact Pokémon absorbed every soul lingering in anguish to join as part of its sacred being. At once Marshadow reeled under the Collective weight now anchored deeply to its essence - so many voices, so many memories aching and afraid. Yet now they need not bear the awful burden alone without solace inside Marshadow’s sheltering body. An unexpected affection swelled from the Pokémon towards its newfound human charges nestled close; it would defend and nurture them as beloved wards, no matter how long it took to gently soothe each spirit’s pain. But manifestation on the physical plane long term required adaptation - the shrouded wraith shape Marshadow oft adopted would not suffice housing so great a population of psychic energies. Motes of light and shadow converged, weaving themselves into a suitable figure not of mist but flesh to walk the lonely halls so long denied the dead their rightful peace. Thus emerged Sombra the girl, an innocent guise shrouding the ancient legendary being now guardian to many wayward ghosts. By night, Marshadow’s incarnation endures the lost children’s recurring nightmares alongside them. By day, Sombra soundlessly observes generations pass while Sanctuary’s blood covenants persist, hoping for a catalyst soon to heal such grievous community trauma for the ghosts now part of her. Until redemption stirs at last though, she keeps mournful vigil honoring past evils that left so many scarred. For Sombra understands now not all scars show upon skin directly. Hers peek out through the eyes of the dead who cannot forget or ever be truly laid to proper rest without absolution. Personality: Inhabiting the composite memories and voices of numerous sacrificed souls imparts intense schizophrenia to Sombra’s fragile being. Persistent psychic tension from the Collective’s enduring emotional trauma fractures her identity and perceptions across scattered shards of myriad consciousnesses. Focus blurs ever wavering through their eyes simultaneously, a perpetual rollercoaster of memories not her own yet now intrinsically bound to her spiritual vessel. At the eye of this storm lies Sombra and Marshadow’s essence in delicate balance. Her body serves as the legendary Phantom Pokémon’s incarnation housing tormented ghosts the creature enveloped with protective compassion. Yet the strain of their enduring anguish weighs ceaselessly upon host and occupants alike. Sombra persists awash in their suffering despite Marshadow's attempts accepting the burden as its own. Moments of lucidity bring little lasting relief, as awareness sinks swiftly back into the roiling gyre of nightmares and screams from eras past that never fade. In rare instances when Collective voices briefly quiet their clamor, Sombra’s buried kindness emerges warmed by Marshadow’s benevolence towards the unfortunate children hidden from further harm within them both. She wields profound empathy and patience nurturing their shattered spirits towards gradual mending through perseverant trust. Each small triumph bolstering another damaged psyche lightens the grim weight upon Sombra’s stooped shoulders. Bit by bit, her cherished wards transform lasting wounds into wisdom - painful yet purifying change she guides with tearful pride. Beyond the asylum of her own being, Sanctuary's resigned populace stirring from stupor may soon aid the journey towards communal healing. Until external forces finally pierce the island’s repressive veil to redeem past sins however, Sombra lingers on the cusp of breakthrough, an unwilling phantasm comprised of innocence violated then symbolically reborn. She serves now as the vanguard of ghosts who walked her path before in silent resilience, shining light onwards for descendants one day grasping reality’s harsh lessons at long last. What emerges from crystallization of enough scattered agonies may ultimately shatter the cathedral of lies and liberate this tortured isle from its own heart of darkness still thriving as it stole her childhood those one hundred Springs ago.

Off-shore processing facilities and secret whaling camps scattered discreetly throughout remote regions of Hoenn. Company Description: - Leading producer and provider of seafood in Hoenn. Operates a substantial fishing fleet as well as commercial whaling activities. - Monopolized the marine hunting industry. Supplies nearly the entirety of seafood to Hoenn. One of the largest producers in the Pokemon world. - Operations have decimated natural populations of Wailord and other aquatic Pokemon to the verge of extinction. This has severely damaged Hoenn's biodiversity and natural habitats. - Subject of major protests and condemnation from Pokemon rights organizations and environmental groups. Engages in extensive bribery and underworld connections to continue operations with Hoenn Government support. - Hoenn trainers are often targeted at international competitions by protesters to publicize the company's destructive activities. Protests embarrass the government and bring international pressure. Company Personnel: - Leadership is ruthless and motivated solely by profit. Dedicated to maintaining monopoly and share value through unethical exploitation of marine life. - Workers include violent security teams, poaching squads, off-shore fishers, and illegal whale hunters supported by inhumane processing facilities. - Researchers in the company's employ focus exclusively on boosting efficiency and yields from unethical extraction of Pokemon resources, particularly rare species such as Wailord which are prized delicacies. Security and Defenses: - Heavily armed private security teams patrol all sites, brutalizing trespassers. Offshore sites are stealth and well-guarded from outside interference. - Research and processing sites are essentially restricted black sites. Workers are segregated and movements heavily monitored. Whistleblowing is met with lethal retaliation. Political Connections: - Leadership maintains an iron grip over Hoenn marine industry regulation through bribery of officials on every level. This ensures their destructive activities continue without government interference despite public relations backlash internationally. Reputation: - Extremely secretive and notorious. Most Hoenn citizens turn a blind eye as long as cheap seafood keeps flowing. Government officials ardently defend Blue Sea Fisheries publically despite rumors of shady back-door deals to the contrary. - Among conservations groups, seen as nothing less than heartless ecoterrorists pushing entire species to extinction. Their stranglehold over Hoenn's economy and government make bringing them to justice extremely difficult. Saito Denki Co. Headquarters: - Located in Saffron City, Kanto region. Main complex is a towering skyscraper housing offices, labs, factories & the hidden sublevel housing Project Copernicus supercomputer. - Extremely high security consisting of armed guards, keycard/biometric door locks, cameras, motion sensors. Restricts all access to secret underground facilities. - Sterile, clinical aesthetic throughout labs and computer cores. Endless hallways with thick power cables and machinery. Scientists scan ID badges frequently. Members: - Prominent scientists/engineers recruited globally to develop cutting-edge but unethical technology. Offered luxury salaries and resources. - Floors of skilled technicians maintain production of consumer devices that fund more shady tech enterprises. - Lower employees know nothing of exploitative experiments occurring in hidden facilities below their workstations. - Business department manages global PR/marketing for Saito Denki's brand image and deals with outside contractors/clients/regulators. Leadership: - Headed by ruthless CEO Seiji Saito who oversees all operations with an iron fist. His word is absolute. - Board of Directors chosen by Saito handle business/financials. Support Project Copernicus to please Saito despite moral objections. - Chief Scientist Asahina guides inhumane experiments arm, reporting directly to Saito. The end justifies the means to them. Goals: - Push boundaries of science and technology without ethical limitations in pursuit of profit/innovation. - Monopolize multiple tech sectors to gain wealth/prestige allowing unfettered research. - Secure global high-level political allies to enable their ongoing inhumane activities. - Unlock secrets of Pokémon/human genetics through immoral experimentation with living subjects. Reputation: - Renowned publicly as a premier cutting-edge consumer tech corporation behind popular gadgets and electronics. - Painted as transparent and benevolent business, but uses wealth and power to hide controversial inner-workings. - Those who uncover the truth tend to quietly disappear. Rogue experiments remain conspiratorial rumors. Defenses: - Uses wealth and government leverage to quash legal threats quickly before gaining publicity. - Sprawling headquarters has immense private security forces ready to eliminate trespassers lethally. - Owns a private army including mechanized soldiers based on Pokémon tech developed in-house. Titanium Crown Minerals Corp Headquarters: Located in a towering skyscraper in the heart of Lumiose City. Multiple highly secured underground vaults house the company's precious diamond inventories. Members: Ruthlessly efficient executive team personally selected by CEO Ambroise to manage operations. Answer directly to Ambroise with military precision and no qualms about collateral damage. Vast networks of miners, geologists, mercenaries hired to expand TCMC's stranglehold over the region's mines by any means necessary. Work and housing conditions are deplorable to maximise productivity. Elite Security Force acts as Ambroise's private army. Highly armed and equipped with military-grade vehicles/weaponry. No restraint towards violence or brutality against indigenous Pokémon populations in mining areas or protesters. Leadership: Ambroise rules TCMC as absolute dictator. His word is law. Publicly he portrays a charming, philanthropic businessman, but privately runs TCMC through terror/intimidation. Most trusted executives given prestigious titles and luxurious rewards, but secretly despise Ambroise. However, too afraid to challenge his methods that brought them wealth and privilege. Operations: Monopolized the jewellery industry in Kalos through decades of questionable tactics like sabotaging competitors, bribing officials, and violently removing uncooperative mine owners. Revenue used to finance mining tech development to access the most challenging deposits and nesting grounds. Mechanized extractors show no mercy towards Carbinks and other mineral Pokémon inhabitants. PR & media manipulated to present a rosy image covering up environmental devastation, illegal/unethical activities related to mining operations and Ambroise's ostentatious billionaire playboy lifestyle. Goals: Uphold Ambroise's supreme authority over Kalos' mineral wealth. Neutralize any threats from legal actions or regulators through underhanded tactics. Develop most efficient automated extraction systems to maximize diamond production regardless of ecological impact or Pokémon habitat destruction. Finance Ambroise's lavish lifestyle and make TCMC the world's leading jewellery supplier through monopoly built on the shattered crystalline remains of endangered species. Holy Trinity Church Headquarters: - Located in a grand Gothic cathedral situated in the center of Sanctuary City, capital of isolated Sanctuary Island in the Paldea region. - Imposing architecture with soaring buttresses, elaborate rose windows, and imposing oak doors studded with iron bolts. Gargoyles perch atop towers gazing out ominously over urban sprawl. - Interiors gloomy with only flickering candles/torches to illuminate expansive main hall and labyrinth of small shadowy chambers spiraling deep underground. - Upper levels accessible to public for regulated services/ceremonies, but majority of cathedral restricted only to clergy/high officials sworn to secrecy about covert affairs. Members: - Zealous clergy fundamentalists devoted to Holy Trinity doctrine being ranks of bishops, priests, monks/nuns carrying out church functions. - Recruited only from families demonstrating unwavering multi-generational orthodoxy. Candidates thoroughly vetted genealogically before granted initiations into hierarchies. - Clergy ranks require vows relinquishing all personal assets/ties outside church. Transgressions mean harsh penance/ excommunication brings great family shame. Their lives revolve utterly around liturgical routine and rituals. Leadership: - The Holy Trinity refers to three high bishops presiding equally as supreme directors over church affairs through unanimous rulings. - Each bishop oversees specific domains - Inquisition security forces, foreign relations, and public ceremonies respectively while collaborating on covert policies unknown to common clergy or island civilians. - Their word considered divine gospel, infallible and absolute. But power struggles occasionally surface between ambitious subordinates before being ruthlessly silenced to prevent scandal eroding public faith in the Trinity’s harmony. Goals: - Maintain totalitarian religious control and social conditioning on isolated Sanctuary Island citizens through strict doctrine enforced by Inquisition police state tactics. - Monopolize access to outside world to prevent cultural contamination against centuries-old stagnant theocracy they claim as sole holy life path. - Continue “Century Sacrifice” ritual fed by myth of divinely mandated requirement to submit island youth as live offerings sustaining Trinity’s authority. - Research covert supernatural means to expand church influence globally as the One True Faith and secure leadership immortal status as living deities. Reputation: - Most island inhabitants zealously revere their complete religious and political authority. Criticizing clergy risks imprisonment or worse by the Inquisition. - International awareness limited thanks to isolationism. But rumors abound about the cult-like island realm and its extravagant yet monolithic Goth architecture beloved yet feared by citizens. Defenses: The Inquisition serves as Holy Trinity Church’s militaristic guardians against external and internal threats to its supreme rule. Members are fanatical lethal warriors trained from childhood for loyalty/ruthlessness. Inquisition leadership answers directly to church bishops who oversee usage committing resources only to furthering expansion of rigid church doctrines. They root out dissidents and offenders against canon law through omnipresent secret police, harsh tribunals, violent purge missions abroad, reeducation camps and legendary dungeon torture chambers buried deep below Sanctuary City streets where not a sound escapes. All in the name of preserving perceived holy purity on the isolated island compound under Trinity guidance. None dare openly challenge their visible might or covert brutality for long.

This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise. Though the planet is now devoid of flowing rivers or lush forests, Yabisha remains forever vigilant over this long-dead land it once nurtured but failed to save. Type: Grass/Dragon Abilities: 1.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention. Following the tragic decimation of his family by a merciless Nidoking, little hope remained for this frail Pichu. As he lay dying from his grievous wounds, he was discovered by Shmaya, the human incarnation of Rayquaza. Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state.

Please generate the name of Kanzi's gang and its detailed settings.","output":"Gang Name: The Shadow Current Headquarters: - The Shadow Current's base of operations is nestled deep in the alleyways of Castelia City, Unova. It's consciously away from the glitz and bustling crowds, a rundown warehouse repurposed into their lair. - Outwardly, the warehouse still bears signs of its former industrial usage—a deceptive front. Multiple hidden entrances and exits are scattered throughout the building, with only members knowing the precise knocks and signals required for entry. - Inside, it has been renovated with the gang's personal touches. Dark, slick urban design elements are intermingled with practical training areas—combat rings, lock-picking stations, and tech workshops. - The back of the warehouse opens to the city's underbelly—a network of abandoned subways and sewer tunnels, providing secret pathways for covert operations. Members: - A mix of disillusioned youth and hardened veterans—runaways, ex-trainers, and individuals seeking more than what legitimate society offers, united under Kanzi's leadership. - Members express their individualism through an eclectic sense of fashion. Each has a special insignia—a stylized \\"S\\" woven into clothing or worn as jewelry, symbolizing their allegiance to The Shadow Current. - Despite their rogue activities, members maintain a strict code of ethics crafted by Kanzi herself. Aggression towards the innocent is forbidden; the gang's wrath is reserved for corrupt forces. - Ranks are fluid—a meritocratic system based on skill, loyalty, and the ability to remain unseen. Everyone has a role, be it an infiltrator, battler, tech specialist, or informant. Leadership: - Kanzi serves as the visionary leader, her Mystical powers and persona providing both inspiration and fear in equal measure. She’s respected and guarded fiercely by her followers. - Core advisors and skilled operatives help run the gang, each specializing in areas like operations, intelligence, and logistics. All actions are measured against Kanzi's overarching mission. - They use their clandestine network to manipulate events from the shadows, orchestrating moves to undermine the establishment’s groundwork while enhancing their own influence. Reputation: - To observers, The Shadow Current is a mythical entity—more a rumor amongst Unova's underworld. They’re known to strike surgically against corporations exploiting Pokémon or the vulnerable. - Their exploits have taken on an almost Robin Hood-esque reputation among Unova's downtrodden, who view the gang as mysterious protectors. - The authorities consider them high-priority targets, yet their actions rarely leave tangible traces, making investigations into their activities challenging. Goals: - Protect Pokémon and humans from exploitation and systemic corruption. They seek balance, Kanzi's vision driving their movements in the dark. - Establish firmer control over the underground channels of Castelia City, turning them into fortified conduits for their operations. - Disrupt major financial and political figures who perpetuate greed and inequality, redistributing ill-gotten gains to those in need. - Ultimately, they work to dismantle the systems that privilege the few over the many, pursuing justice for all under Kanzi's guidance. The Shadow Current sees itself as a necessary force within the urban night—guardians existing in the grey, ushering in change from the darkness."},{"instruction":"Translate the following text into 6 different languages: \\"Zootopia is a 2016 Disney movie set in a city populated by anthropomorphic animals.\\"","output":"Here are translations of the provided text into six different languages: Spanish: \\"Zootopia es una película de Disney de 2016 ambientada en una ciudad poblada por animales antropomórficos.\\" French: \\"Zootopie est un film Disney de 2016 qui se déroule dans une ville peuplée d'animaux anthropomorphes.\\" German: \\"Zoomania ist ein Disney-Film aus dem Jahr 2016, der in einer Stadt spielt, die von anthropomorphen Tieren bewohnt wird.\\" Italian: \\"Zootropolis è un film Disney del 2016 ambientato in una città popolata da animali antropomorfi.\\" Japanese: \\"ズートピアは、人間のように振る舞う動物たちが住む都市を舞台にした2016年のディズニー映画です。\\" (Zootopia wa, ningen no yō ni furumau doubutsu-tachi ga sumu toshi o butai ni shita 2016-nen no dizunī eiga desu.)

Ini berbeda dengan shared hosting, di mana sumber daya server dibagi antara banyak klien. Berikut adalah beberapa keuntungan utama dari Dedicated Hosting: 1. **Kinerja dan Kecepatan:** Karena semua sumber daya server seperti CPU, RAM, dan kapasitas disk digunakan eksklusif oleh satu klien, performa server biasanya lebih tinggi dan lebih stabil. 2. **Keamanan:** Dedicated server menyediakan tingkat keamanan yang lebih tinggi karena klien memiliki kontrol penuh atas lingkungan server. Ini berarti bahwa kerentanan keamanan yang mungkin muncul karena aktivitas atau kesalahan pengguna lain di server tidak akan mempengaruhi server khusus klien. 3. **Customisasi dan Kontrol:** Klien memiliki kemampuan untuk menyesuaikan server sesuai dengan kebutuhan spesifik mereka, termasuk pilihan sistem operasi, perangkat lunak, dan konfigurasi server. 4. **Stabilitas IP:** Server khusus biasanya menawarkan alamat IP tetap dan unik, yang berarti bahwa alamat IP situs web tidak akan berubah atau dibagi dengan situs lain. 5. **Akses Root/Administrasi:** Klien memiliki akses root atau administratif penuh ke server, yang memungkinkan manajemen lengkap atas semua instalasi perangkat lunak dan pengaturan. 6. **Lebih Cocok untuk Traffic Tinggi:** Server khusus dapat menangani jumlah trafik yang lebih besar secara efektif, sebab sumber dayanya tidak perlu dibagi-bagi. Namun, Dedicated Hosting juga memiliki beberapa kelemahan bila dibandingkan dengan pilihan lain seperti Shared Hosting atau VPS (Virtual Private Server), antara lain: - **Biaya Tinggi:** Biaya sewa server khusus jauh lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan shared hosting. - **Keahlian Teknis:** Mengelola server khusus membutuhkan keahlian teknis tingkat lanjut atau perlunya menyewa tenaga profesional. - **Kebutuhan Manajemen:** Server harus dikelola dan dipelihara, termasuk pembaruan keamanan, penggantian perangkat keras yang gagal, dan pemantauan.
