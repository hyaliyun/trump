If we have a TV set in the family, we are not necessary to go to the cinema or theatre to enjoy programme with expensive tickets. All that they have to do is press a button with a finger, and they can watch all the programmes they like, such as TV talk shows , movies, opera and so on. But some people think of it as a danger. When we watch TV, we don't need to do anything . We do not even have to leave our sofa because we have a remote control in our hand. We don't need to make any judgment or statement about it. We are totally passive and don't use our head to think hard about some matters.    As we all know, television keeps us informed about world events--including all the events in society, science and politics .We can get a good idea of the most remote countries and the strangest customs in their country. Of course the radio performs this service too, but the effect of the programme is not better than on the television. Everything we enjoy on the television is much more vivid and realistic. However, in turn there is a great danger. Usually we cannot resist the television screen, because it has a great harm for us. We have been so accustomed to enjoying the screen, so dependent on its pictures. But when our TV sets are out of order, we are surprised to find that we have much more time to do things. And at this time we actually begin to have a talk to each other again. It is really worth thinking.    Of course the arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of television are on the go.We can not simply say television itself is good or bad.

Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H.

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday backed away from his endorsement of a bipartisan Senate proposal to stabilize health insurance markets, throwing the legislative effort into doubt even as the chief architect of the deal predicted that it would become law before the end of the year.      The latest actions by the White House confused Republicans on Capitol Hill and irked Democrats — but in the end, their effect was not clear. The effort to calm roiled insurance markets appears destined for a showdown in December, when supporters of the compromise, drafted by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, will have the most leverage.      The mixed signals began Tuesday, when Mr. Trump appeared to give his blessing to the deal to restore subsidies to health insurers that he said days before he would cut off. Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray agreed on legislation that would continue federal payments to insurance companies through 2019 to reimburse them for discounts that they are required to provide to millions of low-income people who have coverage under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.      On Wednesday, the White House sent a different message. ||||| President Trump became the subject of an unusual public lobbying campaign over the fate of the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Senate Democrats and a key Republican sought to salvage a bipartisan health deal while conservatives pressured the president to disavow the agreement.      In a morning tweet, Trump appeared to distance himself from the compromise, which would authorize payments to insurers that help offset millions of lower-income Americans' health costs in exchange for granting states greater flexibility to regulate coverage. But the president later told reporters that he was not closing the door on a deal altogether, and proponents of the plan authored by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) sought to keep him on board.      The convoluted campaign, in which Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) insisted that a deal remained in reach even as he blasted the president's \\"zigging and zagging,\\" underscored the unpredictable nature of dealmaking in Trump's Washington. With constantly shifting alliances, the city's key political players are jockeying to win the president's support one issue at a time.      For Senate Democrats, trying to sway Trump to back the plan carries both potential risks and rewards. Working with a president despised by their base and prone to changing his mind could drag them into a political quagmire with unpredictable outcomes.      For conservatives who are pressing for a different deal or oppose the idea of propping up the Affordable Care Act, the moment presents a test of how much influence they have with the president, who has suggested a greater willingness to hash out deals with Democrats and become more and more frustrated with his own party.      [Another last-ditch effort to tackle Obamacare stalls within hours of its release]      For both sides, the president's conflicting signals have created a chaotic situation where even some of Trump's aides have found themselves scrambling to keep up with the latest developments.      He began the morning by warning that the new agreement might be tantamount to an insurance giveaway. \\"I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care,\\" Trump wrote on Twitter.      But shortly afterward, Alexander — who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and was encouraged by the president to pursue a deal — said in an interview that Trump expressed an openness to preserving it in a phone call Wednesday morning.      \\"He told me that he wanted to encourage me but that he will review it, as I would expect a president to do,\\" Alexander said. \\"He may want to add something to it. It may come up as part of the end-of-the-year negotiations. We'll see.\\"      Speaking later to reporters in the Cabinet Room, Trump praised Alexander's efforts, saying, \\"If something can happen, that's fine, but I won't do anything to enrich the insurance companies.            Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) attend a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the morning after they reached a deal to resume federal payments to health insurers that President Trump had halted. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)      \\"They've been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody's ever seen before,\\" the president added.      Although Trump has repeatedly described cost-sharing payments as a \\"bailout\\" to insurers, the money directly covers the discounts that low-income Americans on Affordable Care Act plans receive for deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. This group includes about 7 million Americans earning up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level.      Insurers are obligated to provide the discounts, which totaled about 7 billion this year and are estimated to reach 10 billion next year, even if the federal payments are cut off. According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Trump's decision last week to end the subsidies will cost insurance carriers more than 1 billion this year.      Facing the prospect for months that the Trump administration would cut off the payments, most insurers have opted to factor this shortfall into their 2018 premium rates for their customers. The cutoff in cost-sharing payments has translated into premium increases of 12 percent to 20 percent, according to several analyses.      Alexander suggested that he may tweak the language of the proposal to address Trump's concerns that insurers would benefit from the cost-sharing reduction payments. He added that during their Wednesday call, he told Trump that he was about to tell reporters, \\"They're underestimating your leadership on health care, because what you've done is you've created a bipartisan option for the Senate and for the country.\\"      Alexander said that the compromise already has language to ensure that the subsidy \\"benefits go to consumers, not to insurance companies,\\" but he was open to making it stronger.      Schumer, for his part, alternated between attacking Trump's inconsistent policy positions and arguing for why the president and the deal's proponents agreed on a short-term health-care fix.      Trump ended the cost-sharing reduction payments, known as CSRs, last week, arguing that they were illegal because they were not explicitly authorized under the Affordable Care Act. He left it to Congress to decide whether to fund them.      [Senators strike deal to save Obamacare payments as insurers push to raise rates]      Schumer, who discussed the prospect of a bipartisan deal with Trump less than two weeks ago when the president called him in the Senate gym, said in a floor speech that the allegations of an insurance bailout show that \\"the president doesn't know what he's talking about.\\"      \\"It helps people who are sick and need health care. It keeps their premiums low,\\" Schumer said of the funding, adding that there is language in the agreement that bars insurers from pocketing the money.      During the negotiations, Democrats had proposed delaying the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act plans, which is set to begin Nov. 1, for a month after the bill's enactment to ensure that firms could lower their 2018 premium rates to reflect the fact that the government would keep funding the subsidies. White House Domestic Policy Council Director Andrew Bremberg opposed that provision, Schumer said, but he added that Democrats are willing to insert stronger language to guarantee that insurers pass on the payments to their customers.      \\"We're all of the same mind,\\" Schumer said of Trump, Senate Democrats and Alexander. \\"And we can do that.\\"      In a brief interview Wednesday afternoon, Murray brushed aside the president's hostile rhetoric.      \\"This is not about the president. This is about just doing the right thing so the American people's rates don't go up, and that's where we're focused,\\" she said.      Asked whether she was willing to alter the terms of the agreement, Murray replied: \\"No. We have a deal; we're moving it forward.\\"      Some Democrats said they have no reservations about trying to solve a problem that, in their view, was created by Trump and for which his party will be blamed if Congress takes no action.      \\"We know doing this will be good for the country,\\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). \\"I hope that people here aren't that cynical, that, 'Why would you do it just because it's good for the country?' \\"      But conservatives were already mobilizing to block the measure, which would authorize CSR payments for two years. The framework would also allow insurers to offer catastrophic insurance plans to consumers 30 and older on Affordable Care Act exchanges while maintaining a single risk pool. It would shorten the period for federal review of state waiver applications; expedite reviews for states in emergency circumstances and those with waiver proposals that have already been approved for other states; and allow governors to approve state waiver applications rather than require state legislative approval.      Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, whose political action committee backs antiabortion candidates, described the proposal Wednesday as \\"an inadequate, shortsighted approach which fails to address the abortion funding problems created by the health-care overhaul.\\"      \\"Right now nearly 900 health-care plans subsidized by taxpayer dollars cover abortion, forcing taxpayers to be complicit in the destruction of human life,\\" she said. \\"In no way does the Alexander-Murray bill fulfill Republicans' campaign promise to repeal and replace the ACA.\\"      A handful of Senate Republicans have expressed support for the plan, including Mike Rounds (S.D.), John McCain (Ariz.) and Bill Cassidy (La.). But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has not committed to bringing it up for a floor vote, and some GOP senators questioned Wednesday why they should keep funding the subsidies.      \\"Well, I don't want to just vote to put paint on rotten wood,\\" Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters. \\"I just want to understand what the benefits are. I understand the money going out the door.\\"      Several key House Republicans said they don't see how the bill would win passage in their chamber.      Many senior White House officials oppose the bill, according to administration officials and Republicans who have been briefed on the matter. At times, Trump's aides have been sidelined as he has conferred with Alexander, according to one Republican, fueling confusion about the state of negotiations.      The bipartisan plan does enjoy support among patient rights groups, although they have raised concerns about whether the flexibility it offered could raise health-care costs. On Wednesday, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network endorsed it.      \\"This deal offers important, immediate action to stabilize the individual insurance market,\\" said the group's president, Chris Hansen. \\"Restoring 106 million per year in outreach and education programming would help to reduce public confusion over the law and ensure more people who need health coverage get it.\\"      Even as elected officials and interest groups debated in Washington how to handle cost-sharing payments, attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would require the administration to continue making the payments to insurers. The attorneys general argued that the court order was needed \\"to prevent immediate and irreparable harm to the Plaintiff states and the millions of Americans who benefit from affordable health coverage under the ACA.\\"      While Schumer made no predictions as to whether the bipartisan agreement would actually make it to Trump's desk, he held out hope that the president could serve as an ally in the end.      \\"This president keeps zigging and zagging,\\" Schumer said on the floor. \\"Our only hope is maybe tomorrow, he'll be for this bill.\\"      John Wagner, Jordan Frasier and Paul Kane contributed to this report.

Lamar Alexander tweeted that he would work with President Donald Trump on improving the bill to \\"make it even stronger\\" and ensure that it benefits consumers, not insurance companies. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Obamacare fix could end up in year-end package Republican sources say it's only a matter of time before Congress must find some way of addressing the reeling insurance markets.      A bipartisan deal to shore up Obamacare collapsed Wednesday after President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Senate proposal a bailout for insurance companies.      But GOP sources on both sides of the Capitol say this is not the end of the debate.      Story Continued Below      GOP lawmakers acknowledged they’ll eventually have to contend with shaky insurance markets and an estimated 1 billion hole Trump carved into the health care law last week when he eliminated remaining payments due this year. The money to fund a key insurance subsidy program could be resurrected as part of a year-end spending agreement.      Even if the deal struck by Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray goes nowhere, Republican sources say it's only a matter of time before Congress must find some way of addressing the reeling insurance markets — a vote the GOP sources know will infuriate lawmakers and their base. Put simply, the fight over Obamacare is nowhere near an end.      Alexander plans to introduce the bill Thursday along with a “significant” number of Republican and Democratic cosponsors. He predicted Wednesday that “by the end of the year chances are very good this agreement or something like it is law.”      POLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning — in your inbox.

The most likely scenario is to push the matter off and fold a yet-to-be-determined solution into a year-end package they hope will include some GOP concessions as well as Democratic perks. Such a strategy, they argue, would be less painful than voting on a stand-alone bill that conservatives view as a \\"bailout\\" for insurance companies — and a vote to \\"prop up\\" a law they've tried to dismantle for years.      \\"We do know there's a problem with the high premiums and high deductibles because of the failures of Obamacare,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). \\"And until we can come up with a long-term solution, I think stabilizing the marketplace and keeping premiums affordable is not a bad idea.”      Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that he was \\"supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O’care.\\"      Ryan later suggested the House wouldn't take up the bill as written.      \\"The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,\\" Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.      Alexander on Wednesday lobbied his GOP colleagues to get on board, arguing that funding the cost-sharing program doesn't amount to a bailout because it has to go directly to cover consumers’ out-of-pocket health costs. He also indicated that he’s open to changing the bill to address Trump’s concerns.      Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is also working on a bill that would fund the cost-sharing payments and make concessions for conservatives.      The Alexander-Murray deal would provide two years of funding for Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies. It would also give states more flexibility to oversee their insurance markets, expand the availability of low-cost health plans and restore some of the funding for enrollment outreach efforts the Trump administration slashed this summer.      But Alexander’s effort largely fell on deaf ears.      “I want to get to the long-term solution as quickly as possible. I’m just not a fan of bailing out insurance companies,” said Steve Daines (R-Mont.).      Trump’s opposition sealed the bill’s fate, at least in the short term. It would be all but impossible for Republicans lawmakers to support the deal — let alone bring it up for a vote in the House or Senate — without the president's endorsement. Republicans, still smarting from their failure to fulfill their years-long promise to repeal Obamacare, would have an extremely hard time voting for anything perceived as supporting the law without political cover from the president.      Before coming out against the proposal Wednesday, Trump spent Tuesday sending mixed signals on whether he would support the bipartisan effort. Early Tuesday, he suggested the White House was involved in crafting the legislation and praised the work by lawmakers. By the evening, he commended the work but trashed the idea of a bailout, echoing comments made by conservatives who oppose the deal.      Republicans were reluctant to weigh in on the deal after details of the bill were released Tuesday. But GOP sources, especially in the House, privately began dismissing the accord, saying the concessions wouldn’t be enough for most Republicans in the House.      Asked about a vote on the agreement Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans had not yet discussed a way forward. Ryan soon came out in a statement encouraging the Senate to pursue repeal — not an Obamacare \\"fix.\\"      Some Republicans want a bigger concession from Democrats in exchange for continuing the payments. In an interview with POLITICO just hours after Trump ended the subsidies last week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the White House would never back a stand-alone Alexander-Murray-type deal but could accept the measure if they got a border wall or something else for Trump.      White House legislative liaison Marc Short and GOP sources echoed that sentiment, suggesting that Republicans might instead secure a repeal of the individual and employer mandates under Obamacare.      Democrats are highly unlikely to back any kind of mandate repeal because they would view that as undermining the law.

The Obamacare payments are estimated at about 7 billion this year and help insurers cover out-of-pocket costs for low-income customers. Insurance commissioners say about 6 billion of the money had been released before Trump's cutoff. A federal court last year ruled that the subsidies were illegally appropriated, but the Obama and Trump administrations had continued to pay them out while the litigation is under appeal. Many insurers, fearing the payments would be cut off, raised rates for 2018 health plans higher than they otherwise would have.      Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday blasted Trump for flip-flopping. He said Trump probably did not know what was in the Obamacare deal and said his only hope was that Trump would quickly reverse course to support it.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

Expand this summary.","output":"A Japanese company, Akagi Nyugyo, recently made headlines when it released a 60-second video featuring its executives and employees executing a group bow of apology. The video, which has received more than 1 million views on YouTube, was created to apologize for raising the price of their popular frozen snack, Garigari-kun bars, by 9 cents, bringing the cost up to 70 yen. This is the first price hike for the ubiquitous brand since 1991. The company stated, \\"We held on for 25 years, but...\\" as they explained the decision to increase the price. Not only did the company feel it necessary to create a heartfelt video apology for raising prices, but the commercial also features a catchy song about rising costs to emphasize the sincerity of their apology. In Japan, public apologies like this are both expected and scrutinized, demonstrating a stark cultural difference in comparison to other countries where apologies can sometimes be seen as an admission of guilt. While the company may not have anticipated the viral response to their video, it highlights the extreme commitment to customer satisfaction held by Japanese businesses. Akagi Nyugyo was likely focused on maintaining its image as a customer-centric company, even if it meant creating a public apology for a relatively minor price increase. This type of corporate behavior is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, where businesses often go to great lengths to show gratitude and remorse when they believe they have inconvenienced their customers. The video serves as a powerful example of just how seriously companies in Japan take their responsibility to their consumers. Other global brands have also faced similar situations in Japan, such as McDonald's, which had to issue an apology when their mozzarella sticks were found to be missing one vital ingredient. This kind of behavior has gained international attention and is seen as indicative of the high standards that Japanese consumers expect from companies operating in their country. It remains to be seen if this kind of public apology will become more commonplace in other countries, as businesses increasingly strive to establish positive relationships with their customers. However, one thing is certain: Akagi Nyugyo's unique and heartfelt apology certainly got the attention of millions of people worldwide, demonstrating the power of sincere corporate communication in today's connected world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He rode his bike super duper fast and won lots of races. People loved him, and he became very popular. Companies saw how much everyone liked Lance, and they wanted him to wear their special clothes and shoes while he was riding his bike. One of these companies was called Nike.  Nike is a place where they make all sorts of clothes and shoes for sports. They made a deal with Lance, saying \\"Please wear our stuff and tell everyone how great it is!\\" And so, Lance did that for a long time. Then one day, Lance told the world that he had not been telling the truth. You see, there were rules about how fast you could ride a bicycle without help, and Lance had been breaking those rules. He was using some things that made him go faster even when he was not supposed to. People got very upset with Lance because they felt cheated, and they did not want him to wear their shoes or clothes anymore. Lance became sad but knew he made mistakes and needed to make them right. He wanted to show everyone that he was sorry. So, he decided to stop wearing Nike and start wearing shoes and clothes from another company called ASICS. ASICS is also a place that makes clothes and shoes for sports, just like Nike. They have lots of comfortable things to wear for riding bikes and doing other fun activities. Lance wanted to make a fresh start with ASICS and show everyone that he was not the same person who broke the rules. In this new chapter of his life, Lance began telling everyone, \\"I am not a Nike guy anymore, I am an ASICS man now!\\" He hoped that by changing what he wore and making better choices, people would see that he was truly sorry for what he had done. Now, Lance continues to ride his bike, wearing his ASICS shoes and clothes, and trying to be a better person every day.

When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help.

Identify the independent clauses: \\"This is particularly important where the boat has protruding cap rails or a toe rail\\" and \\"If the straps are too short, you should use a traverse or spreader bar.\\" 2. Since these are two independent clauses, I added a period after the first clause to separate them into two distinct sentences. 3. I noticed a dependent clause \\"If the straps are too short\\" in the second sentence, so I added a comma after it to separate the dependent clause from the independent clause \\"you should use a traverse or spreader bar.\\""},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question. The shop owner doesn't show any emotion.A small boy, a young Colin Sullivan (Conor Donovan), is at the counter and witnesses Costello's interaction with the shop owner. Costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man Costello knows. He tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand.

While it is commonly known for its consistency lying between a pudding and a soup, the very heart of Binignit is found in its primary component -- bananas, a ubiquitous fruit in tropical regions that brings a distinctive combination of sweetness and texture to the dish. The bananas are well-complemented by the inclusion of another ingredient which is Sago – tiny, translucent and gelatinous pearls derived from the pith of a variety of tropical palm plants. Sago pairs wonderfully with the bananas, matching its sweet tones while additionally providing a delightful contrast of textures that make the Binignit an experiential treat to eat, both tantalizing to the palate with its abundant flavors and satisfying to the senses with its playful mélange of consistencies.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who searches the plane wreckage?, using the article: In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir.  Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls.  Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.  Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men., what would be the answer ?

Process:  - Living organisms in the sea die - The matter forms on the sea floor - Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it - After many years the matter is compressed and heated - The result is that crude oil forms.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more animals in the sea happens, how will it affect LESS oil.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The given process describes how crude oil forms mainly from microscopic aquatic life forms, such as plankton and algae, rather than larger sea animals. The primary step in this natural conversion involves the gradual application of heat and pressure over millions of years after these life forms die and accumulate on the seafloor, followed by layers of sediment.  Regarding the perturbation hypothesis, if there were more large animals in the sea, it likely wouldn't directly result in less oil formation. Although more large animals could perhaps mean more organic matter on the seafloor when they die, remember that crude oil mainly originates from smaller, microscopic organisms due to their abundant population and rapid lifecycle. The carbon cycle plays a significant role here, as many of the larger animals consume smaller ones, turning the carbon back in CO2, which gets released back into the atmosphere, rather than settling to the seabed.  One potential indirect impact of more sea animals could be changes in the ecosystems that might affect the population of these smaller, oil-producing organisms. If an increase of a certain animal species leads to a change in the food chain that decreases the population of plankton and algae, this could theoretically lead to less crude oil forming in the future.  However, it's important to note that the oil we are currently extracting was formed millions of years ago, and any changes in todays' marine ecosystem dynamics wouldn't be noticeable on oil reserves for millions of years more.  In other words, while the hypothesis certainly might have indirect effects, any potential impact would be complex and depend on many factors, including the specific dynamics of the altered ecosystems and their impact on microscopic sea flora and fauna. Hence, the overall effect on the formation of crude oil would be challenging to predict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Chinese imperial tombs are typically  approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied.  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture.

Answer:","output":"In later periods, the guardian figures in Chinese imperial tombs became much more varied as compared to the Han dynasty, where they were mainly represented by lions and chimeras. This increase in variety and diversity of guardian figures can be attributed to several factors, including the influence of different dynasties, cultural changes, artistic developments, and the introduction of new religious beliefs. 1. Influence of different dynasties: As different dynasties ruled China over the centuries, they brought with them their own customs, beliefs, and artistic preferences. This led to variations in the types of guardian figures used in imperial tombs. For instance, the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) saw an increased use of human and animal guardian figures that were not only powerful and mythical, but also depicted daily life, such as servants, guards, and horses. 2. Cultural changes: Over the course of Chinese history, its society evolved and became increasingly sophisticated. This cultural evolution was reflected in the art and architecture, including the guardian figures in imperial tombs. As a result, the types of guardian figures diversified to include more human-like characters, celestial beings, and mythological creatures that symbolized protection, power, and wealth. 3. Artistic developments: As Chinese artists developed new techniques and styles, the depiction of guardian figures in imperial tombs grew more intricate and refined. Artists began to portray guardian figures with greater realism and attention to detail, giving rise to more varied and unique representations of these protective entities. 4. Introduction of new religious beliefs: As new religious beliefs, such as Buddhism, were introduced to China, they began to influence the art and architecture in imperial tombs. Buddhist concepts, such as spiritual liberation and the afterlife, influenced the design of guardian figures, leading to the inclusion of Buddhist deities and more religiously-themed representations. In conclusion, the guardian figures in Chinese imperial tombs became much more varied in later periods due to the influence of different dynasties, cultural changes, artistic developments, and the introduction of new religious beliefs. These factors contributed to making the guardian figures a more diverse and sophisticated means of embodying the power, protection, and prosperity required for the deceased in the afterlife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prune the Meidiland rose during the late winter after all of the foliage has fallen from the plant but before the spring temperatures begin to rise and new growth forms. Prune your plant in January if you live in a warmer region. In warmer regions where it does not get cold enough for roses to shed their leaves, pruning should be done in January and all of the leaves and flowers should be pruned off. This will allow the shrub to have a brief rest before producing new foliage and flowers in late winter or spring. Use bypass or hand pruners that are sharp. Dull pruners will crush the stems and damage the growth buds. Always wash your pruning shears before and after you prune plants to control the spread of any plant diseases that may be in your garden. Remove all dead growth and debris from around the plant to make the pruning process a bit easier. Rake the area around the plant and remove any trash, leaves or other items. Place this debris in a composter, or in a bag in the trash if you are concerned that the debris might have a plant disease or fungus of some kind. Remove any black or dark brown stems because these colors indicate that this growth has died. Dead growth should be cut back in order to help the plant produce healthy, new growth. If no healthy buds remain on a particular stalk, cut the stalk to the ground to encourage the plant to produce new stalks. When cutting make vertical, angled cuts directly above the first healthy bud. Diseased parts of the plant should be removed as soon as you spot the disease. Check your roses through their growing season to make sure that your plants have not developed any diseases. Trim these branches off entirely or back to where the  center of the stem tissue is a healthy white. Remove diseased parts of the plant from your yard. These cuttings will have to be burned or thrown away. You cannot place these cuttings in the compost bin, as the plant disease could still spread from within the compost bin. Once you have removed any dead, damaged, or diseased growth, cut your plant back to height that you would like it to be. The height of white Meidiland roses can be reduced by four to eight inches, if a shorter height is preferred, but it is not necessary. Simply trim each branch back to the desired height. Prune off any branches that are growing at odd angles and branches that are growing across other branches. If a branch is growing across another branch, it could rub against the other branch, causing injury and opening up the shrub to disease. White Meidilands that are more than a few years old should have up to one-third of the oldest, thickest, woodiest branches removed completely. This will open up the center of the shrub to better air circulation and sunlight exposure. It will also keep the shrub “younger” since the leftover branches will be less than a few years old. Summary:","output":"1. Choose the right time: Prune during late winter when the foliage has fallen but before spring temperatures rise and new growth forms. January is ideal for warmer regions. 2. Prepare the tools: Use bypass or hand pruners that are sharp and always wash your pruning shears before and after using. 3. Clean the area: Remove dead growth and debris from around the plant to simplify the pruning process. 4. Remove dead growth: Cut back black or dark brown stems as they indicate dead growth. If no healthy buds remain on a stalk, cut the stalk to the ground. 5. Make the cuts: Make vertical, angled cuts directly above the first healthy bud. 6.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 - August 9, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his work as the lead guitarist and as a vocalist with the band Grateful Dead, which came to prominence during the counterculture era in the 1960s. Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group. One of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire thirty-year career (1965-1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). Jerry Garcia's ancestors on his father's side were from Galicia in northwest Spain. His mother's ancestors were Irish and Swedish. He was born in the Excelsior District of San Francisco, California, on August 1, 1942, to Jose Ramon \\"Joe\\" Garcia and Ruth Marie \\"Bobbie\\" (nee Clifford) Garcia, who was herself born in San Francisco. His parents named him after composer Jerome Kern. Jerome John was their second child, preceded by Clifford Ramon \\"Tiff\\", who was born in 1937. Shortly before Clifford's birth, their father and a partner leased a building in downtown San Francisco and turned it into a bar, partly in response to Jose being blackballed from a musicians' union for moonlighting.  Garcia was influenced by music at an early age, taking piano lessons for much of his childhood. His father was a retired professional musician and his mother enjoyed playing the piano. His father's extended family--who had emigrated from Spain in 1919--would often sing during reunions.  Garcia experienced several tragedies during his youth. At age four, while the family was vacationing in the Santa Cruz Mountains, two-thirds of Garcia's right middle finger was accidentally cut off. Garcia and his brother Tiff were chopping wood. Jerry steadied a piece of wood with his finger, but Tiff miscalculated and the axe severed most of Jerry's middle finger. After his mother wrapped his hand in a towel, Garcia's father drove him over 30 miles to the nearest hospital. A few weeks later, Garcia -- who had not looked at his finger since the accident -- was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.  Less than a year after he lost most of his finger, his father died. Vacationing with his family near Arcata in Northern California in 1947, Garcia's father went fly fishing in the Trinity River, part of the Six Rivers National Forest. Not long after entering the river, Garcia's father slipped on a rock, lost his balance and was swept away by the river's rapids. He drowned before other fishermen could reach him. Although Garcia claimed he saw his father fall into the river, Dennis McNally, author of the book A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead, argues Garcia formed the memory after hearing others repeat the story. Blair Jackson, who wrote Garcia: An American Life, lends weight to McNally's claim. Jackson's evidence was that a local newspaper article describing Jose's death failed to mention Garcia was present when he died. Where else are his ancestors from","output":"Jerry Garcia's ancestors have diverse origins. On his father's side, they were from Galicia in northwest Spain. On his mother's side, his ancestors were of Irish and Swedish descent.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the rocket that malfunctions carrying? Wasps Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Sting of Fury\\" Genre: Science Fiction, Action, Adventure Plot: In the not-so-distant future, the global economy heavily relies on space exploration, including asteroid mining, scientific research, and commercial space travel. Amidst these advances in space, a leading biotechnology company, BioGenix, had designed a genetically modified breed of wasps. These wasps play a vital role in solving a global pollination crisis which has caused agricultural hardships worldwide.  BioGenix's genetically modified wasps have successfully tailored the pollination of various crop types which have significantly increased food production in controlled environments. As the next phase of this top-secret project, BioGenix plans to spread these species over wider regions to benefit global agriculture.  To achieve this vision, BioGenix collaborates with AstroTech, a renowned aerospace engineering company, to create a specialized rocket known as Pollinator One. Pollinator One is designed to carry the wasps within small capsules for a high-altitude orbital release over the Earth. The plan ensures the wasps will propagate and carry out the pollination task, gradually restoring the ecosphere.  Dr. Angela Reyes, an essential character of the story, is a brilliant scientist who specializes in entomology and genetics, and is the creator of the genetically modified wasps. Major Mike Stevens serves as the chief astronaut in the mission, overseeing the release of the rocket and ensuring its success. As the launch day arrives, excitement builds up as the world watches Pollinator One blasted off into space, carrying the potential solution to a looming global famine. However, halfway into the mission, a malfunction occurs in the rocket and it loses contact with mission control. At this point, Pollinator One appears to be on a crash course back to Earth. The malfunction's cause is traced back to corporate sabotage by a group of eco-terrorists who believe the genetically modified wasps could decimate the global ecosystem instead of saving it. Major Mike Stevens, a former Air Force pilot, is recruited on a daring rescue mission on-board a prototype space shuttle to intercept and fix Pollinator One. During the dangerous rescue mission, Mike experiences shocking revelations as he comes face-to-face with the mutated wasps that have become increasingly aggressive and threatening due to cosmic radiation exposure. The malfunction caused the early release of the wasps within the rocket, and they have begun wreaking havoc on both Pollinator One's systems and the rescue team. As the wasps multiply and evolve in unexpected ways, Angela is tasked with finding an antidote and a new means to control them before they cause an outbreak situation on Earth. On the other hand, Mike has to not only navigate through an infested Pollinator One but also battle the eco-terrorists who wish to destroy the rocket and stop BioGenix's plan. As the film reaches its climax, Angela manages to engineer a biological substance that can drive the mutated wasps to reestablish their designated pollination behavior while neutralizing their aggressive tendencies. Meanwhile, Mike and his team manage to re-stabilize Pollinator One within the earth's atmosphere along with the eco-terrorists' involvement being exposed. In the end, the wasps are safely deployed to designated pollination zones, leading humanity toward a healthier and harmonious future. As the credits roll, Angela and Mike celebrate their victory against all odds, shifting the narrative of the film towards their newfound camaraderie and setting the stage for potential sequels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Shadow Chancellor George Osborne Photo: Paul Grover Alistair Darling reminds me of one of those kidnapped Colombian judges in sweat-drenched polyester shirts, who are forced to record messages of support for their captors, but try desperately to signal to the camera that they are doing so under duress. With every blink, every hesitant reply, every furrowing of his brow, even his hint in yesterday's Daily Telegraph that the hugely expensive ID card scheme may be scrapped, the wretched Chancellor seems to be saying: I know, I know, I want to bring down the public debt, too. But my captor, Gordo el Furioso – he will not let me! Last week's pre-Budget report ought to have been a detailed technical manual, an emergency route map to save Britain, last of the big G20 nations still to be sunk in recession, from debt catastrophe. This year, we are on track for a £178 billion budget deficit, even as the economy shrinks by 4.75 per cent. Credit agencies, the Bank of England, the OECD and the IMF all warn that this is not sustainable: that Britain's public sector borrowing (about 12.6 per cent of GDP this year) is eating into what remains of its credibility in the global markets like a vicious rust. Instead of a technical document, however, the Government delivered a series of political scare slogans clumsily knitted together with a few statistics. The purpose of this PBR, pure and simple, was to sow fear about the Conservative Party's plans and the fiscal tightening that (let us hope) would follow a Tory victory. \\"In 1997, our public services were in crisis,\\" Mr Darling reminded the Commons on Wednesday. \\"The Conservative Party seems quite incapable of realising… that we must secure long-term sustainable growth in this country,\\" he continued – adding that Tory plans would slow down demand too quickly and wreck the recovery. In other words: Vote Tory for a Miserable, Indigent, Hopeless Life. The Brown regime long since ceased to conduct itself as a serious government: it is now a clunking electoral machine whose sole objective is to limit the scale of the Conservative majority next May or (if you believe the bookies) March. Most of the measures announced by the Government last week will never be enacted by Labour ministers: the promise to \\"protect front-line services\\" was pure political sweetener to stir into the Labour core vote's tea, and it is a safe assumption that Brown and Darling will be long gone when the proposed one per cent increase in National Insurance falls due in April 2011. Within hours of the PBR's publication, the Institute for Fiscal Studies had found a £36 billion black hole in its pages. How would Labour pay for that? Mr Darling would have liked to have been able to answer that question, and evidently favoured a substantial VAT rise to make his final PBR a more plausible piece of work, and one that posterity might view with favour. The Treasury mandarins were understandably desperate for a plan that would hasten deficit reduction. But the PM was having none of it. As I wrote last month, Gordon's best legacy to the Labour Party could yet be a modest defeat. And his clear objective in this PBR was not fiscal stringency, but the consolidation of the crude notion that Labour are the good guys who still spend lots of money on nice things, and the Cameron Conservatives are the wicked, greedy Etonians who will force wee children up chimneys, re-open the workhouses and shoot Santa Claus on the grouse moors. That juvenile \\"dividing line\\" is scarcely the basis for a winning electoral coalition: but – Labour strategists calculate – it might narrow Cameron's Commons majority rather significantly. And the scale of that majority is of the utmost importance not only to the shape of the party-political landscape after the election, but the prospects of the nation as a whole, and of its economic recovery specifically. Although last week's PBR naturally shone the spotlight of scrutiny upon the hostage Mr Darling, it was a reminder that, very soon, it will be Chancellor Osborne making major budgetary announcements to the Commons. He and David Cameron, both special advisers to the Major Government, remember all too well what it was like governing with a small majority, and then with no majority at all. They know that, to stand a chance of conquering Britain's structural deficit, they need a robust electoral mandate. Osborne also knows that this job, so to speak, will be The Job. Of course, any Chancellor of the Exchequer has a shot at becoming Prime Minister – but of the 21 occupants of No 11 since the war, only four have done so (Macmillan, Callaghan, Major and Brown). Mr Osborne may buck the trend, but to stand a chance he must first be an outstanding Chancellor. So he and his team – more than any other on the Tory side – are preparing to hit the ground running, with an emergency budget within 50 days of the election and an autumn spending statement. Fiscal rules having proved pretty worthless in the Brown years, Osborne will subject himself to the discipline of an Office for Budget Responsibility: a fiscal watchdog that should, if it is genuinely independent, and is allowed to bite as well as bark, transform the terms of trade. Though he is often accused of being too political by temperament, and insufficiently immersed in technicalities of economic policy, it is precisely the political arts that Osborne will need to end this public debt crisis. Which colleagues does he choose to disappoint first? In what order does he fight the big battles? How does he bring public opinion with him as he cuts into the flab of the state – and when, and in what circumstances, does he accept that he must take action irrespective of public hostility? This is why one of the Shadow Chancellor's shrewdest proposals is the introduction of a \\"Star Chamber\\" system, to involve more Cabinet colleagues in spending decisions and to give stronger institutional form to collective responsibility for fiscal policy. To be honest, he will need this, and much more. If it does half of what Cameron and Osborne say it will, the next government will be racked by controversy over spending cuts, tax increases, and our old friend, \\"the language of priorities\\". And that's only half of it. \\"To really get to grips with this,\\" one senior Cameroon told me yesterday, \\"we have to reinvent the relationship between the citizen and the state.\\" That's exactly right. If the Cameron-Osborne revolution is to be real, it must be about more than the politics of cuts; it must be about weaning an entire country off the malfunctioning, bloated post-war state. That is as big a change in the way we live as was achieved in the Thatcher era. Last week's PBR was the last gasp of the old. It is time now to see just how dramatically different the new truly is.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? cumbersome","output":"The phrase \\"cumbersome\\" is generally considered negative. It has several definitions and connotations, all of which convey a sense of difficulty, inconvenience, or unwieldiness. When something is described as cumbersome, it could mean one or more of the following: 1. Heavy and difficult to carry or manage: When an object is cumbersome, it is usually bulky, unwieldy, and challenging to handle due to its size, shape, or weight. For example, moving a large sofa can be considered a cumbersome task because it can be difficult to maneuver and lift. 2. Slow or complicated, and therefore inefficient: In this sense, cumbersome refers to processes or tasks that are inefficient and time-consuming, often due to an overly complex or outdated system. For instance, a cumbersome administrative procedure might involve filling out multiple forms and waiting for approvals from several departments before action is taken. 3. Difficult to use or manage, often because of being complex: When a tool, device, or technology is cumbersome, it is usually hard to use, navigate, or understand because of its complexity. For example, a computer program with poorly designed user interface or complicated functions can be described as cumbersome to use. In all of these cases, the word cumbersome has a negative connotation because it describes a situation or object that is inconvenient, challenging, or problematic in some way. People generally seek ease, simplicity, and efficiency, so describing something as cumbersome is likely intended to indicate that it is not ideal or that it may require a significant amount of effort to manage or overcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Combine facts and answer this: Saxton Temple Pope had a close relationship with a man who lived most of his life where? Answer:","output":"Saxton Temple Pope had a close association with Ishi, a man who lived most of his life in California. Ishi, often referred to as the \\"Last Wild Indian\\" in America, lived the majority of his life in the rugged wilderness of northern California, specifically in the regions around Mount Lassen and Deer Creek. Born around 1861, Ishi was a member of the Yahi tribe, part of the larger Yana group. The Yahi tribe was nearly decimated at the end of the 19th century because of the California Gold Rush and the subsequent violence, disease, and starvation that it brought on. Ishi, who survived these devastating effects, lived in the wild until 1911, when he arrived in Oroville, California, and was subsequently taken under the protection of anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley. His connection with Saxton Pope began when Pope was assigned as a physician to attend to him. The bond between them grew beyond their initial doctor-patient relationship. Pope took a keen interest in understanding the Yahi culture—its values, way of life, and especially, their traditional archery skills, a rich cultural asset. Thanks to his friendship with Ishi, Pope became an expert in Yahi archery techniques. He studied Ishi's methods, including how to construct bows and arrows, and to hunt using them. Their friendship and collaboration led Pope to write two books detailing his relationship with Ishi and what he learned from him about archery and Yahi culture: \\"Hunting with the Bow and Arrow\\" and \\"Yahi Archery.\\"  Therefore, Ishi's life was intimately entwined with the wilderness of northern California, where he hunted, built tools, and survived until the tragic extinction of his tribe. Simultaneously, this wilderness became instrumental in facilitating the enriching bond that he developed with Saxton Pope, which went on to bridge cultural divisions and lead to vital cross-cultural exchanges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An exotic's eye area can get crusty and gooey because its flat face doesn't allow for good drainage. Take a paper towel or washcloth and wet it with warm water.","output":"Gently dab at the area around your cat's eyes, being careful not to touch the eyes themselves, in order to remove any buildup that may have accumulated. It is important to keep your Exotic Shorthair's eyes clean to prevent eye infections and maintain their overall health. Make sure to use a fresh, clean piece of the paper towel or washcloth each time and dispose of them properly after each use. The Exotic Shorthair's tear ducts might sometimes become blocked, which can lead to excessive tearing or discharge from the eyes. If you notice that your cat's eyes are constantly watery or have yellow or green discharge, it is important to contact your veterinarian for an examination. Next, focus on cleaning your exotic shorthair cat's ears. Like any other cat, Exotic Shorthairs are prone to build-up of earwax, dirt, and debris in their ears. To clean their ears, use a cotton ball or swab moistened with a vet-approved ear cleaning solution to gently wipe away any debris. Avoid using human ear cleaning products, as these can be too harsh for your cat's delicate ears and may cause irritation. In addition to maintaining your Exotic Shorthair's eyes and ears, regular grooming is essential for keeping their fur healthy and free from tangles or mats. Despite having a short coat, this breed is prone to shedding. Make sure to brush your cat's fur at least once a week with a grooming brush specifically designed for shorthaired cats, as this can help to remove loose hair and stimulate the natural oils in their skin. Since Exotic Shorthairs are more susceptible to respiratory issues due to their flat faces, it's important to keep an eye on their breathing and consult with your veterinarian if you notice any signs of difficulty, such as heavy panting, coughing, or wheezing. Regular check-ups with your veterinarian can help to identify and address any potential health issues early on. Ensure that your Exotic Shorthair is receiving a nutritious and balanced diet. Provide them with high-quality cat food recommended by your veterinarian, as a proper diet is crucial for maintaining their overall health and well-being. Additionally, make sure fresh water is always available for your cat to drink. Your Exotic Shorthair will also appreciate a comfortable and clean living environment. It's essential to maintain a clean litter box by scooping it daily and replacing the litter entirely at least once a week. Providing your cat with plenty of toys and playtime is necessary for their mental and physical well-being, as well. This breed tends to be more active and social than other shorthair cats, so be prepared to spend quality interactive time with your feline friend. Lastly, make sure your Exotic Shorthair is up-to-date on their vaccinations and gets regular flea and tick prevention treatments. By following these guidelines and working closely with your veterinarian, you can ensure that your Exotic Shorthair cat will live a happy, healthy, and long life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: When punctuation  began, it was mainly to help people read out loud. Until a few hundred years ago, not many people were taught to read, so there was a lot more reading out loud by the few people who could. To help those reading out loud in the old days, sign  known as \\"points\\" were added to pages of writing. Punctuation comes from the Latin word punctus, meaning \\"point\\". These points told readers when to pause  or take a breath, and what to emphasize . In Europe from the early centuries AD, these points were widely used although not everybody used the same points for the same thing. When printing was invented, printers had to be made more clearly about what to put where, so that everyone was doing the same thing. Since that point, all sorts of punctuation rules have been discovered and invented. Speech marks \\"...\\" Speech marks or quotation marks are used to show that someone is speaking. The sort we have in English today began to be widely used during the 18th century. Before that readers simply understood from the way a sentence was written that someone was speaking although sometimes spoken words were underlined. Comma , colon: period(full stop). All three of these sorts of punctuation marks were given their Greek names by Aristophanes, a librarian who lived in Byzantium in the 2nd century BC. They were marks on the page, each with a message to the reader. Comma meant a short pause. Colon meant a medium  sized pause. Period meant a long pause. Exclamation mark! In the early days of punctuation, if you saw this sign, you were supposed to pause. Some people think the exclamation mark began as what the Greek word IO looked like if it was turned 90 degrees. This word means \\"Oh, gosh!\\" With the I on the top and the O under it, the sign as we know it today was developed. Question mark? In the middle age, a squiggle  above a full stop was sometimes used to show the sentence was a question and that a person's voice should go up at the end. By the 17th century it had turned into what we call a question mark. The...

Here's how you can make it, step-by-step: 1. Gather materials: You'll need two pieces of fabric (about 12 inches by 12 inches each), beans or rice for the stuffing, a needle, thread, scissors, and a bowl or funnel to help pour the stuffing. 2. Cut the fabric: Use the scissors to cut the fabric into two equal-sized squares or circles. 3. Decorate (optional): If you want your bean bag to have a design, you can draw or sew on the fabric pieces now. 4.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Andy, Trevor, and Billy are childhood friends. As young adults, Billy sells drugs and Andy does deliveries for him. One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster.  Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened.  However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back.  He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead.  When he delivers them to the mob, they quickly spot them as fakes and assume Trevor switched them. Billy figured by doing this, the mobsters would send a goon to kill Trevor and with him out of the picture, he could have Laura back with no blood on his hands. However, since he was the one to notify the mobsters, they tell him if he wants Trevor dead he has to do the killing himself.

The final image is a mix of band members and a variety of other influential people from the time. Apart from the Rolling Stones (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts), here's a list of people who made an appearance on the cover: 1. The Beatles – The likenesses of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr were created in a 3-D collage and placed under the translucent portion of the album cover. They appeared as small, caricature-like faces hidden among the band members – arranged diagonally from John Lennon just above Bill Wyman's left shoulder to Ringo Starr above Charlie Watts' right shoulder, with Paul McCartney and George Harrison in the middle. This was somewhat of a tribute to the rivalry and friendship between the two bands. 2. Marianne Faithfull – An English singer, songwriter, and actress who was dating Mick Jagger at the time, Faithfull appeared as a female character wearing a gown on the album cover. 3. Collage of Famous Faces – There are several other personalities who appeared on the cover, but were either removed or went uncredited. Among them were actress Marlon Brando, author Edgar Allan Poe, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Sir Francis Bacon. This Michael Cooper-designed cover also featured other prominent figures from the time. However, due to copyright issues, contractual disagreements, and other reasons, the faces of these individuals were mostly obscured, making them difficult to recognize, or were removed from the final layout.

Another rental car, another unfamiliar highway, another string of e-mails sent from his BlackBerry while driving 70 mph. Bird took a sip from his coffee and looked over at Dan Grandone, a co-worker riding in the passenger seat. \\"I don't know about you, but I'm running on adrenaline right now,\\" Bird said. \\"I love this feeling that we're on the verge of something crucial.\\" Bird had lived at that precipice ever since joining Barack Obama's campaign as a top organizer in 2007, but rarely had he faced a challenge so daunting as the one awaiting in Racine. As deputy director of Organizing for America, a national network of Obama supporters, Bird was scheduled to speak with a group of volunteers who had been threatened at town halls, outshouted at local rallies and weakened by a general sense of post-campaign fatigue. With one 90-minute visit, Bird hoped to leave them confident, empowered and reenergized. \\"We want these people to feel like they can control almost anything that happens in government,\\" said Bird, who had traveled from his office at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington to spend two days visiting volunteers across Wisconsin. \\"They should feel like there's no barrier between the regular people out in the states and the power players in D.C.\\" The outcome of the health-care debate weighed partially on Bird's success, and on the effectiveness of Organizing for America (OFA) in general. When Bird was named deputy director of OFA last year, he became the vanguard of much more than 13 million e-mail addresses collected from supporters during Obama's campaign. He became one of the people most responsible for validating Obama's campaign ethos: that grass-roots support can power government and shape legislation. It is a theory that now faces a defining test. Conservatives have waged an angry and effective battle against Obama's health-care legislation, and OFA has responded by asking its volunteers to visit congressional offices and flood town hall meetings in a massive show of support. This month, Obama sent an e-mail to OFA members: \\"This is the moment our movement was built for,\\" he wrote. When Bird arrived at a Racine coffee shop called Cup of Hope and sat down with 10 OFA volunteers, he spoke with similar urgency. \\"We need to flex our muscles on this, and we need to act fast,\\" he said. \\"We always said in the campaign that this was not just about one election but about a chance to make some major changes. Well, here's the chance.\\" Bird had a lifetime of experience thriving against long odds, and he relished the role. The son of conservative Baptists, Bird grew up in a Missouri trailer park before attending Harvard Divinity School. He organized underfunded schools in Boston, worked for Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004 and started a company that lobbied Wal-Mart -- his mother's former employer -- to improve its benefits and wages. On behalf of Obama, he had moved to five states, helping the candidate overcome racism in South Carolina and Islamophobia in Pennsylvania and Ohio. When Bird arrived in Wisconsin last week, he recognized all the familiar hallmarks of an underdog fight. Gone were the 44 field offices across the state where Obama organizers had worked during the campaign; now Bird spent his visit searching for power outlets in Wisconsin coffee shops and conducting conference calls at sidewalk cafes. Gone were the 100 paid staffers who orchestrated an Obama victory in the state; now OFA employed one person in Wisconsin, Grandone, who hoped to hire two or three assistants if the budget allowed. \\"Right now,\\" Grandone said, \\"we are kind of building this thing as we fly it.\\" Around the table in Racine, Bird listened as the volunteers rattled off evidence of OFA's growing pains. Local membership was relatively stagnant because Racine residents were exhausted after volunteering during the long presidential campaign. Newspapers had focused their coverage of health-care town halls on the most vocal conservatives, even when the crowd contained more Democrats. One OFA member said he was now the target of repeated threats. \\"I've had a guy say to me, 'Why should I be afraid of a liberal when I have a .357?' \\" said Ryan Gleason, 32.","output":"Title: From Campaign Trail to Healthcare Battle: Organizing for America's Pursuit of Grassroots Support and Political Change Article Summary: Jeremy Bird, deputy director of Organizing for America (OFA), has always thrived when facing challenges and has been an influential figure since joining Barack Obama's campaign in 2007. With the healthcare debate in full swing, Bird and the OFA network aim to inspire and empower volunteers, emphasizing the importance of grassroots support. As Bird travels to reenergize volunteers in Racine, Wisconsin, they discuss the growing pains faced by OFA and the need for their continued involvement. Despite these obstacles and the apparent underdog status, Bird remains relentless, urging volunteers to flex their grassroots muscles and seize the opportunity for major political change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"Title: \\"Three Scouts: The Bandits' Gamble\\" Genre: Western/Action/Adventure Plot Summary: In the late 1800s, a small, lawless town called Shadow Valley becomes the epicenter of corruption and chaos. That is until a local sheriff named Daniel Brokman, known for his unwavering sense of justice and a dark past, decides it is time to restore order. One gloomy afternoon, he spots three bandit scouts entering the outskirts of the town, igniting a series of events that could change the face of Shadow Valley forever. Plot: The movie starts with Sheriff Daniel Brokman arriving at his office to assess reports of recent criminal activity plaguing Shadow Valley. His hunches come to life as he surveys the town's edge from his window and notices three mysterious figures on horseback, surveying the land and taking notes. The next day, Daniel and his eager deputy set off to investigate these strangers and gather intelligence. While keeping tabs on the bandit scouts, Daniel uncovers that they are part of the notorious Blazing Scorpions, a violent and expanding gang of outlaws led by the cunning and ruthless outlaw, Javier \\"The Scorpion\\" Ramirez. The gang aims to seize control of Shadow Valley for its strategic location and unguarded resources – a perfect haven for their illicit activities. Daniel has an unexpected encounter with Alexandra Fortune, a determined and skillful gunslinger who seeks vengeance on The Scorpion for ruining her family's life. Alexandra reveals that these three scouts have been tasked with identifying vulnerable targets in the town for a massive heist. As the plot thickens, Daniel, Alexandra, and the deputy unite to devise a plan to stop the Blazing Scorpions, forge alliances with local merchants, and assemble Shadow Valley residents into a makeshift but spirited defense force. Tensions rise between Daniel and Alexandra as their past is unveiled, and they realize that they were once enemies. However, they must set aside their differences and reconcile before the imminent attack. The climax unfolds with an intense and suspenseful battle between the defenders of Shadow Valley and the invading Blazing Scorpions, in which the three scouts play a strategic role in directing their marauding gang's assault. Daniel and Alexandra fight bravely alongside their newly-formed militia, ultimately leading the town to victory. The townspeople, once broken and demoralized, stand united with newfound hope. The three scouts are captured alive and sent to face justice, while Daniel turns down Alexandra's offer to travel together, as he believes his place is in Shadow Valley, protecting its people. In the end, Daniel learns the importance of trusting and collaborating with others, despite their past, as the bonds they form can become the keys to overcoming adversity and finding hope in the bleakest moments. With the threat of the Blazing Scorpions thwarted for now, the town of Shadow Valley starts to rebuild, and peace begins to reemerge. \\"The Three Scouts: The Bandits' Gamble\\" is a story of redemption, loyalty, and the strength that comes from unity in the face of adversity – consequences of a seemingly simple encounter with three bandit scouts that evolved into the tale of a town fighting for its dignity and freedom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ilya Nikolayevich Bryzgalov ( ( listen); Russian: Il'ia Nikolaevich Bryzgalov; born 22 June 1980) is a Russian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He was selected in the second round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, 44th overall, by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He has also played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers, Edmonton Oilers and Minnesota Wild. In 2006-07 season, Bryzgalov won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks. Bryzgalov started his professional career in his native Russia, splitting the 1999-2000 season between Spartak Moscow of the Russian Supreme League (RSL-2) and Lada Togliatti of the Russian Superleague (RSL). Bryzgalov played two seasons with Lada Togliatti before joining the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, who had drafted him in the second round, 44th overall, in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft.  However, with Jean-Sebastien Giguere and Martin Gerber ahead of him in the club's depth chart, Bryzgalov spent the better part of his first four seasons in North America with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL). He made his Mighty Ducks debut in 2001-02, playing in his first of two games during that four-season stretch.  With the departure of backup Gerber, Bryzgalov took over behind Giguere in 2005-06 season. However, injuries to the Ducks starter allowed Bryzgalov to play more games than he otherwise would have and he responded to the challenge with a 13-12-1 record with a 2.51 goals against average (GAA) and .910 save percentage. In the subsequent playoffs, Bryzgalov made three starts and one relief appearance for the Ducks in their first-round series against the Calgary Flames. In Game 1, he filled-in for an injured Giguere, taking a 2-1 overtime loss. He relieved Giguere once more in Game 5 and stopped all 19 shots he faced in a 3-2 loss. He then took over the starting job for Games 6 and 7 of the series, winning 2-1 in Game 6 and recording a shutout in the decisive Game 7. Moving past the Flames, Bryzgalov then recorded 5-0 and 3-0 shutouts in the first two games of the second series against the Colorado Avalanche for three consecutive shutouts. He tied Frank McCool's 1945 playoff record for most consecutive shutouts by a rookie and passed Giguere, who had recorded consecutive shutouts in 2003 for the third-longest playoff shutout streak of all time. Despite his success in the first two rounds, Bryzgalov struggled in the semi-finals against the Edmonton Oilers and was eventually replaced by Giguere for the rest of the series as the Ducks were eliminated in five games.  Bryzgalov continued to play backup to Giguere the following season and into the 2007 playoffs. Bryzgalov made comments regarding Anaheim Ducks Head Coach Randy Carlyle, saying he believed Carlyle has no confidence in him. However, he briefly took over as the starter for the first four games of the Western Conference Quarter-Finals, winning three games as Giguere took a leave of absence with personal issues. Bryzgalov came in for relief in the Western Conference finals against the Detroit Red Wings, but remained on the bench as the Ducks went on to defeat the Ottawa Senators in the Finals in five games to win the franchise's, and Bryzgalov's, first Stanley Cup.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many games did he play in the 2005-06 season ?","output":"In the 2005-06 season, Bryzgalov played more games than he otherwise would have due to injuries to the Ducks' starter and he responded to the challenge with a 13-12-1 record, which indicates that he played in 26 games."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.

Summarize the following: Snip the corner off a bag of soil to create a narrow spout. Starting with the edges, go around the frame and pour in the soil until it just touches the underside of the hardware cloth. Give the frame an occasional shake while you work to level off the soil and help it distribute more evenly.  You can also add a small amount of fertilizer to the potting soil to promote the health of new plants. Look for nitrogen-rich fertilizers and mix a light sprinkling into the fresh soil before you fill the frame. Formulate your own soil specifically for succulent plants by mixing two parts moist soil from your yard or garden with one part sand and small pebbles. Use a chopstick, screwdriver or slender wooden dowel to burrow into the soil about 1-1.5” deep. This will create a series of small holes that will make planting the seeds and cuttings much more expedient. Dig one hole for each plant you intend to grow.  Make sure the holes are relatively narrow and that the soil around the opening isn’t cracked or loose. Be careful not to make the holes so deep that you reach the plywood backing. Confirm that the holes you dig are wide enough to accommodate the root bulbs of larger succulent species. Insert the cuttings through the wire screen of the hardware cloth root-side down. They should fit perfectly into the holes you just opened up. After all the cuttings are in place, pat the soil around the visible portion of the plants to anchor them.  At this point, you should begin thinking about how you want your finished living picture to look. This will give you an idea of what type of planting pattern will work best. Plant leaf cuttings at an angle to the soil, with the trimmed end below the surface. You won’t hang your living picture right away. Seeds and young cuttings will need two to four weeks of constant sunlight and daily watering to begin growing. When the roots have spread and found traction in the soil, the plants will be resilient enough to mount without coming loose. For the first week or so, aim to water your plants once a day. Simply wet the top of the soil around each of the plants. As they develop, they’ll require less and less water and general maintenance. Once the roots have secured themselves in the soil, you'll be able to mount the frame with no fear of the plants coming dislodged. Attach the hook or wire hanger to the upper portion of the plywood backing and display it in a well-lit section of your living room, kitchen, patio or garden. Take the frame down whenever you need to water the plants or add new fertilizer to the soil.  You can also water the plants using a spray bottle. Give them a generous misting once or twice a day, and be sure to saturate the soil as well as the foliage. Make sure the soil is adequately drained before rehanging the living picture.","output":"Create a narrow spout on a soil bag and pour soil into a frame, occasionally shaking to level it.

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251-183 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \\"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\\". A revival opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author Burt Shevelove the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by Tom Poston), Lew Parker as Senex, Carl Ballantine as Lycus and Reginald Owen as Erronius. Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. \\"Pretty Little Picture\\" and \\"That'll Show Him\\" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with \\"Echo Song\\" (sung by Hero and Philia), and \\"Farewell\\" (added for Nancy Walker as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). \\"Echo Song\\" and \\"Farewell\\" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden.  The musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the St. James Theatre on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred Nathan Lane as Pseudolus (replaced by Whoopi Goldberg and later by David Alan Grier), Mark Linn-Baker as Hysterium, Ernie Sabella as Lycus, Jim Stanek as Hero, Lewis J. Stadlen as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by Jerry Zaks, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Dramas Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical.  Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance.

And the benefits of reading, for me, are immeasurable. Loving the written words was what led me to journalism. But not every child has the chance to enjoy these pleasures and benefits. In Buffalo---one of the poorest cities in the nation---this is particularly true. Over a third of Buffalo's children are living in poverty. Families who struggle for food and clothing certainly don't have the money for books. That's where a Buffalo news-sponsored program called \\"Books for Kids\\" steps in. Through an unusual book drive  and collection of cash donations, the effort places books into the hands of needy local children, usually through community organizations that serve children. Since it began in 1995 ---the  _ of Rose Ciotta, then a Buffalo news reporter, along with two wonderful local Buffalo State college professors, Geraldine Bard and Elizabeth Cappella ---the effort has distributed more than 1.5 million books to children. Returning to the personal side, both of my children know the value of putting books in the hands of children. Successful students themselves became interested from an early age. My sons, Alex, now a college senior, founded the Books for Kids High School Coalition as a Canisius High School student. He handed it down to his sister, Grace, a Nardin Academy senior this year, who has carried on the tradition of organizing book drives in local high schools.

The destroyers take positions over many of Earth's major cities, including New York, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), an MIT-graduate working for a cable company in New York City, discovers hidden satellite transmissions which he believes is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack by the aliens. With the help of his ex-wife Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), a White House staffer, David and his father Julius (Judd Hirsch) gain entrance into the Oval Office to warn President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) of the impending attack. The President immediately orders large-scale evacuations of the targeted U.S. cities, but the aliens attack with advanced directed energy weapons before the evacuations could be completed. The President, his young daughter, portions of his staff, Constance and the Levinsons narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as a destroyer lays waste to Washington D.C.On July 3, the United States conducts a coordinated counterattack; the movie follows the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, as they participate in an assault on the destroyer that has devastated the city of Los Angeles.

One-sided dogfights ensue. Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) manages to evade the guns of the attacker ships and lures a single attacker to the Grand Canyon. There, as his jet is about out of fuel and the attacker is about to overtake him, he deploys the landing chute for his jet and it drapes across the alien craft, temporarily disorienting the pilot. Captain Hiller then ejects from his jet. The alien crashes into the top of the canyon wall...

Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House that a highly anticipated diplomatic summit with Kim would happen in the next few months.      Story Continued Below      “North Korea, by the way — as you can probably see, we’ve been in touch with North Korea,” Trump said. “We’ll be meeting with them sometime in May or early June, and I think there will be great respect paid by both parties.”      The timeline for talks between the two countries puts Trump largely on schedule with initial plans put forth last month by South Korean officials, who stunned the international community by announcing the two leaders would meet by May.

Officials from North Korea said on Sunday that the government reached out to the U.S. to convey that Kim is open to discussing denuclearization efforts in a meeting with Trump.      Trump told reporters on Monday that “hopefully we’ll be able to make a deal on the de-nuking of North Korea.”      The president did not mention Kim by name and did not say whether the meeting would occur in the U.S., North Korea or elsewhere.      But Trump’s remarks bolstered the likelihood that the unprecedented sitdown with Kim — which would be the first such summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader — will actually occur.      Trump called the prospects of talks between the two countries “very exciting” while criticizing past administrations for not engaging in dialogue with North Korea.      “This should have been done by other presidents, and they decided they couldn’t have done it, but it would have been a lot easier if it were done five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago,” the president said.      Though the White House did not initially set pre-conditions for a meeting, Trump administration officials have maintained that North Korea has to get serious about ending its weapons testing and dismantling its nuclear program for talks to be successful.      The White House has said it will maintain maximum pressure and keep up sanctions on Kim’s government until progress is achieved in discussions.      Trump’s relationship with Kim has been marked by tense public feuding, with the president threatening last year to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea if its weapons tests continued.       ||||| (ATTN: RECASTS headline; ADDS more details in last 3 paras)      SEOUL, April 10 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has talked about prospects for dialogue with the United States at a key party meeting, state media said Tuesday, in his first official comment on a planned summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.      The North's ruler made a \\"profound analysis and appraisal\\" of inter-Korean ties and potential talks with the U.S. at the meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea's political bureau Monday, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).      Hours before the report came out, Trump said he plans to meet with Kim next month or in early June to \\"hopefully\\" reach a deal on the North's denuclearization.      Kim discussed the recent situation on the Korean Peninsula, including details about his planned summit with President Moon Jae-in on April 27.      \\"He made a profound analysis and appraisal of the orientation of the development of the north-south relations at present and the prospect of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue,\\" the report said in English, using North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.      Without elaborating, the KCNA said that Kim set forth the WPK's future policy of international relations and how to respond to them.      North Korea held the WPK's political bureau session for the first time since February 2015. Since Kim Jong-un took office in late 2011, the country has so far had nine political bureau sessions and extended meetings, including the latest one.      Kim and key party officials usually discuss major policies and their future direction at political bureau meetings.      \\"It is quite rare that North Korea mentioned details about the inter-Korean summit and future dialogue with the U.S.,\\" a ministry official said. \\"North Korea seemed to attach meaning to the holding of the WPK meeting by reporting it.\\"            The summits come after more than a year of heightened tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. North Korea's denuclearization will top the agenda for the inter-Korean summit and the Kim-Trump meeting.      During Kim's surprise visit to China last month, he told President Xi Jinping that denuclearization hinges on Seoul and Washington's \\"progressive and synchronous\\" measures.      The WPK meeting came as the North's rubber-stamp parliament prepares to hold a key session Wednesday mainly to discuss the national budget and a personnel reshuffle.      Attention is being paid to whether the regime will send any message to the South or the U.S. at the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) meeting ahead of its planned summits.      North Korea's state-run TV broadcaster released footage of Kim presiding over the politburo meeting. Experts said that the North is apparently seeking to show to the outside world that it is preparing for the summits in its own way.      \\"Kim Jong-un has tried to restore a party-centric system after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, who sought a military-first policy,\\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.      \\"The North seems to seek to develop itself as a normal state by improving its ties with the South and the U.S.\\"                  This photo, carried by North Korea's state news agency on April 10, 2018, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un presiding over a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) a day earlier.

The official accompanied the North's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho at a ministerial-level meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Baku, Azerbaijan, last week.      The move suggests that the communist nation's diplomats are trying to drum up international support for leader Kim Jong-un's vision for denuclearization.      Meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in late March, Kim was quoted as saying that he's willing to achieve peace and stability in the region through phased and synchronized steps toward denuclearization.      He's scheduled to hold summit talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a border village on April 27, followed by a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump as early as May.      Kim's reported remarks drew a mixed response from North Korea watchers in Seoul and Washington.      It's meaningful that the North's leader expressed a commitment to denuclearization himself. But the talk of phased and synchronized measures triggered concerns that it may herald a setback to the implementation of a potential package deal, which is sought by the U.S. and South Korea, given the secretive regime's track record of reneging on previous agreements that followed a \\"word-for-word\\" and \\"action-for-action\\" approach.

US President Donald Trump agreed last month to talks with Mr Kim, but Pyongyang had been silent on the summit.      Mr Kim mentioned the \\"prospect\\" of dialogue between North Korea and the US at a meeting of party officials.      Details of the proposed meeting, including timing, remain unclear.

If the talks go ahead, it would be the first time a sitting US president has met a North Korean leader.      Mr Kim did not explicitly mention a summit with the US president at the Workers Party meeting on Monday.

Shortly after the meeting was first mentioned publicly by Mr Trump in March, a KCNA commentary insisted it was not sanctions but \\"self-confidence\\" that had brought it to the negotiation table.      While the US has said North Korea is ready to discuss denuclearisation, it remains unclear what exactly the two sides mean by that.

The Battle of Cocos, fought between Australia's HMAS Sydney and German battle cruiser the Emden, was one of the crucial encounters of the early war, fought 100 years ago. In 1914, on November 1, the original Anzac fleet - with nearly 30,000 Australian and New Zealand soldiers aboard - had steamed out of the West Australian port of Albany. They would make their way across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal to Egypt where they would fine-tune their training. From there, on April 25, 1915, they would land at Gallipoli. The men on those troop-carrying ships laid the foundations for the Anzac legend. But there were hazards to be feared on that ocean crossing with the German raider Emden was loose in the Indian Ocean. Watch the full 9NEWS special on the historic WWI battle. Please note, the items is split into three videos. Germany had been left with the scraps when it came to colonies in Asia and the Pacific. Most had already been claimed through the centuries by England, the Netherlands and Spain. But in the early years of the 20th century, they established a strong East Asia fleet in the Chinese treaty port of Tsintao to protect German trading interests. When war erupted in August, 1914 most of the German ships headed across the Pacific, attempting to get back to strengthen the Atlantic fleet, But Captain Karl Von Muller, commander of the cruiser Emden was given a lone-wolf mission - to break into the Indian Ocean to sink Allied shipping and shell the ports of India and Malaya. While Von Muller was a cunning captain hellbent on sinking ships, he did not believe in taking, unnecessarily, the lives of the sailors. For all his ruthless privateering in the shipping lanes, he did not take one life. But now came a new mission - to steam to the Cocos Keeling Islands, smash up the wireless equipment, destroy the masts and cut the undersea cable that connected Europe to Australia.

It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. It actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. What makes 'Yellow Emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine, the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee. She plays her character, Emy Wong so sweetly, that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor, statuesque, with a regal quality. She comes from an important old family, where ancient customs are still practiced. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. It is simply how it is done in her world. However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. Emy decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her Western man. But only after a very long courtship, as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman. Her pilot, George, is a good guy, and promises to marry Emy, so that she doesn't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. Neither one counts on a third party, one Ilona Staller, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man, that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. Her place in society is gone, she has been debased. The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud, elegant woman gives up her career, as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father, and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town, and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute! Classic drama. I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. One would expect lots of sex and nudity here, but there is not much. And when there is, it is totally non-exploitative, and very artsy and soft-core. If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle, with Sylvia Kristel, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic. I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice. Her father shows George, and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees. He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. Totally unexpected. After catching it on late night cable TV years ago, I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. More sex? No, more melodrama. For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! I actually preferred the cable version better. I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD. I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack. While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare, and quite special. I recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don't need sex and violence to maintain their interest. Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review? Options are: [I] negative.

While in the field, she collected two flowers to examine in detail. She puts the first flower, flower X, under a microscope and begins to look at it. After examination she determines it's an anemophilous plant. She then takes flower Y and repeats the same process to determine that it's an entomophilous type of plant.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which flower has a less exposed stamen? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we need to determine which type of plant typically has a less exposed stamen based on their pollination methods. Step 1: Understand the two types of plants mentioned. Anemophilous plants are those that rely on wind for pollination, while entomophilous plants depend on insects or other animals for pollination. Step 2: Relate the pollination methods to the exposure of the stamen. For anemophilous plants, the stamen needs to be more exposed to ensure that pollen is easily carried away by the wind to achieve successful pollination. In contrast, entomophilous plants have flowers that are designed to attract pollinators, like insects. These plants typically have concealed stamen and more attractive features, such as colours, fragrances, and nectar, to lure pollinators. While visiting the flower, the pollinators come into contact with the stamen and pick up the pollen, ensuring successful pollination. Step 3: Determine which flower has a less exposed stamen, based on the pollination methods. Given the aforementioned information, it's clear that entomophilous plants typically have less exposed stamen compared to anemophilous plants. Conclusion: Flower Y, being an entomophilous plant, has a less exposed stamen compared to flower X, which is an anemophilous plant."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary.  His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing.  The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church.  As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man.  At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw.  But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road.  As he did so he glanced back.  A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.  He was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was Gervase doing in the field?\\" is \\"Standing\\"? Select from: + no + yes","output":"+ no The paragraph does not mention that Gervase was standing in the field. It simply says that Gifford saw Gervase's head above the hedge and later saw him in a horse and trap on the road. He could've been standing, sitting, or even lying down—we don't know for sure. That's why saying he was standing is incorrect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The term also refers to a concept close to melodic mode in Indian classical music. \\"Raga\\" is a remarkable and central feature of classical Indian music tradition, but has no direct translation to concepts in the classical European music tradition. Each \\"raga\\" is an array of melodic structures with musical motifs, considered in the Indian tradition to have the ability to \\"color the mind\\" and affect the emotions of the audience.  - Pebbles is an extensive series of compilation albums in both LP and CD formats that have been issued on several record labels , though mostly by AIP . Together with the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series , the Pebbles series made available over 800 obscure , mostly American \`\` Original Punk Rock '' songs recorded in the mid- 1960s -- primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres -- that were previously known only to a handful of collectors . In 2007 , the release of the Pebbles , Volume 11 : Northern California CD marked the final album in the Pebbles series ( Curiously , Vol. 12 had been issued in 1999 ) . The following year , Bomp ! marked the 30th anniversary of the original Pebbles album with a spartan , limited - edition , clear - vinyl reissue complete with the original pink cover insert . The Pebbles series played a significant role in the emergence of a \`\` canon '' of garage - rock music and artists in the late 1970s and early 1980s . In his review of the Pebbles series for Allmusic , Richie Unterberger comments : \`\` Though 1972 's Nuggets compilation reawakened listeners to the sounds of mid- ' 60s garage rock , it only focused on the tip of the iceberg . Behind those forgotten hits and semi-hits lurked hundreds , if not thousands , of regional hits and flops from the same era , most even rawer and cruder ... . More than any other factor , these compilations ( in the Pebbles series ) were responsible for the resurgence of interest in garage rock , which remains high among collectors to this day . '' Including the Highs in the Mid-Sixties series , Best of Pebbles series , Essential Pebbles series , Planetary Pebbles series , and two box sets , more than 60 compilation albums have been released using the Pebbles name . Following on the heels of the success of the Pebbles series , dozens of other series of garage rock compilation albums have been started , with numerous albums being released each year for several decades .  - AIP Records is a record label that was started by Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records, being launched in 1983 to continue the Pebbles series. The abbreviation AIP stands for \\"Archive International Productions\\". The first 10 volumes in the Pebbles series had been released by BFD Records of Kookaburra, Australia (most likely a fictitious label name to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits) in 1979-1980 and have been kept in print by AIP for many years. Including those in the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series  which concentrated on American regional music scenes  there are over 50 LPs covering some 800 obscure, mostly American \\"Original Punk Rock\\" songs recorded in the mid-1960s  primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres  that were previously known only to a handful of collectors.   - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - A psychedelic drug is a drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors.  - Garage rock (shortened as \\"garage\\"; sometimes '60s punk\\" or \\"garage punk\\") is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada. The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional. The phrase \\"garage band\\" is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Garage punk is a rock subgenre that evokes characteristics identified with punk rock. Its progenitors are with the North American garage rock bands in the early 1960s. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"garage rock\\" or \\"garage revival\\". Another movement that is widely categorized as \\"garage punk\\" drew heavily from stripped-down 1970s punk rock and Detroit proto-punk, taking shape in the indie rock underground between the late 1980s and early 1990s.  - The Highs in the Mid-Sixties series is a group of 23 compilation albums of garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings that were issued by AIP Records in the mid-1980s. This series is a companion to the \\"Pebbles\\" series of similar music; the title is technically preceded by \\"Pebbles Presents:\\". The title sounds like it might have come from a weather report, although \\"Highs\\" intends to mean \\"the best\\" (and is also an apparent drug reference), while the recordings on these albums were originally released in the mid-1960s.  - Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.

Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days.

Hypothesis: China still uses traditional Chinese medicine. (1). Yes. (2). It's impossible to say. (3). No.","output":"Yes, based on the context provided, we can draw the hypothesis that China still uses traditional Chinese medicine. The text explicitly states that poachers in China catch seals \\"to use the genital organs for traditional Chinese medicine.\\" This statement indicates that there is still a demand for seal genital organs within the practice of traditional Chinese medicine in the country. Traditional Chinese medicine is an ancient practice with origins dating back over 2,000 years. It is based on the belief that the body's vital energy, or Qi, needs to flow freely and maintain balance to ensure good health. Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses a variety of treatments, including herbal remedies, acupuncture, massage, and dietary therapy. In the context provided, the demand for seal genital organs is associated with traditional Chinese medicine practices. The use of animal parts in these treatments is not uncommon, as the practice has historically involved various ingredients sourced from plants, animals, and minerals. However, it is important to note that not everyone in China relies solely on traditional Chinese medicine. Many individuals in China also turn to Western medicine to address their health concerns. Additionally, the use of endangered species and controversial methods, such as seal poaching, has been a topic of concern and debate within global conservation efforts. In summary, given the context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that China still uses traditional Chinese medicine. While it is not the only form of medicine practiced in the country, its continued use of seal genital organs indicates that the practice remains prevalent in some areas or among certain populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is planning to send nearly 20,000 more shelters as aid agencies deliver emergency supplies to those displaced by the earthquake of 25 April. The international development secretary said the majority of shelter kits were in place before the earthquake hit. This meant temporary homes were provided to thousands within 24 hours of the quake, Justine Greening added. Ms Greening also praised the UK's search and rescue workers for \\"saving many lives\\". The 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Nepal, triggering avalanches and mudslides and reducing whole villages to rubble. The death toll has hit 7,500 and is continuing to climb. At least one Briton died in the tragedy while others remain unaccounted for. The UN estimates that eight million people have been affected by the earthquake while 2.8 million people have been displaced by it. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: \\"Our pre-positioned shelter kits meant that within 24 hours of the earthquake British aid was reaching communities who had been hit hard and providing temporary homes to thousands of people across Nepal. \\"Ahead of the monsoon season, we are delivering thousands more to help the Nepalese people cope as they recover from this tragic disaster.\\" Rescue workers are picking through the rubble in the search for people caught up in the earthquake, but the Nepalese Government has announced the search and rescue effort is over. The UK's 60-strong international search and rescue team is also now returning home. The focus has now moved to aid agencies trying to get shelter, clean water and food to those left homeless by the disaster before the monsoon season arrives. A UK Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) public appeal for donations has so far raised more than Â£33m, while the UK government has committed Â£17.5m in humanitarian aid to date.

It added that it had given \\"practical assistance\\" to more than 350 British nationals in Nepal and had arranged flights out of Nepal for around 150. Among the Britons still missing is architecture student Matt Carapiet, 23, from Bearsted, Kent, who was trekking through Langtang Valley when the earthquake struck.

Write a title for this article: KABUL, Afghanistan, July 31  NATO on Monday took over command of international forces from the United States in southern Afghanistan, where the fight against the Taliban insurgency has turned more deadly than at any time since American forces ousted the radical Islamist movement in 2001. The transfer will allow the United States to shift more of its 22,000 troops in Afghanistan toward the border with Pakistan, where leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda are believed to have taken refuge and continue to operate across a porous frontier. It will also mean a far larger military role for the 18,000 NATO troops here, which will be embarking on one of the most difficult tasks of its 57-year history. The NATO forces have been in Afghanistan since 2003, but in a peacekeeping role in the largely quiet north. They will now lead the fight against the Taliban, as well as take on powerful drug lords who are backing the insurgents. As if to underscore the challenges, a car bomb exploded in the eastern province of Nangarhar, killing 8 people and wounding 16, as NATO and American generals presided over a flag ceremony marking the transfer of command in an air-conditioned hangar miles away at the southern air base of Kandahar. Clashes between insurgents and troops of NATO and the United States-led coalition continued over the weekend, with a number of insurgents killed or captured, the Afghan Defense Ministry reported. Anticipating the transfer, Taliban insurgents have stepped up their campaign since the spring. They have used car bombs and roadside bombs, assassinated local officials, attacked government posts and gathered in ever larger numbers to fight with international forces. The attacks have terrorized local people, and the perilous security across the south has halted virtually all development and reconstruction projects and helped turned the population against the Afghan government and its foreign backers. The Canadian, British and Dutch troops who make up the bulk of the NATO forces in southern Afghanistan now face an enormous challenge in turning the situation around. The new NATO commander, Lt. Gen. David Richards of Britain, will command 18,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan. The United States coalition commander, Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, will remain in Afghanistan in command of 18,000 American troops under a coalition flag. The commanders stressed that the transfer would enhance security and the international commitment to Afghanistan. I hope and believe the huge significance of this renewed international commitment will not be lost on the majority who yearn for peace, stability and increased prosperity we came here to deliver, General Richards said in a speech to a select audience of government and provincial officials. These millions of people should be reassured that they will not be let down, he said, according to Afghan news agencies. General Eikenberry, who has spent the last months calming Afghan fears over the withdrawal of United States troops from southern Afghanistan, repeated his own message. The United States will not leave Afghanistan until the Afghan people tell us the job is done, he said. The war on terrorism began here in Afghanistan and it continues today. We must never forget that. NATO will have soldiers from 37 countries under its command in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, deployed in the northern, western and southern parts of the country. The NATO deployment will bring thousands more troops to southern Afghanistan, the Taliban heartland, where insurgents have mounted a vigorous campaign this year. Already, NATO forces have encountered stronger resistance than they expected as they moved into the area over the last several months. Sixty-eight troops from the international forces have died so far this year, most of them American but some Canadian and British. So far the pace of casualties exceeds that of 2005, when 86 troops died in the worst year for coalition forces since American troops invaded Afghanistan in 2001 after its Taliban rulers harbored Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. General Richards has said he plans to do things differently from the United States-led forces, and emphasizes the importance of development and aid to rural communities. But first he has to bring a modicum of security. At the moment, his troops are still battling for control of several districts. In a news conference this weekend, he said he hoped to set up secure zones in the south within the next three to six months. But he said that the current military presence would be needed for 3 to 5 years and that a foreign military presence would be required in Afghanistan for 15 years to ensure stability.","output":"\\"NATO Takes Over Command in Southern Afghanistan to Battle Taliban Insurgency\\""},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Cameron was crying and Alex walked up and kissed her.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who was Harriet Hobson returning the watch for? , can you please find it?   Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up. Answer:","output":"Harriet Hobson was returning the watch for Johnny O'Clock. Johnny received the watch as a gift from Nelle, Guido Marchettis' wife and his former girlfriend.

This document verifies all of the final decisions that were made between you, your spouse, and the court. The decisions include those about property, money, support, and children. A copy of the decree of divorce can be found here. During the 60 day waiting period and before you attend the court hearing to get your divorce decree signed, you must complete any parenting classes that are required if you have a child with your spouse. Make sure you do not blow these off as it may delay your divorce and cause the judge to impose other requirements. During these parenting classes, you will learn about the responsibilities and hardships of co-parenting after a divorce. For example, part of the course may teach you about how to handle problems that arise while parenting without your spouse around (i.e., how to be a good single parent). The final step in ending your marriage is the divorce hearing. If your divorce is uncontested, the judge will simply look over the divorce decree and he or she will sign it if they are satisfied. If the divorce is contested, a judge will hear both sides and decide how to end the marriage, including how to split up property and child custody rights. The judge's decisions will be formalized in the divorce decree and the judge will sign it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the process of finalizing a divorce, emphasizing the importance of the decree of divorce, which verifies all final decisions made by the involved parties and the court.

Van Day's spokesman said the singer \\"should be leaving for home soon\\" following the operation but will need to rest for the next month. The singer has cancelled his scheduled appearances for November. He tweeted: \\"Thanks for all the kind and positive messages I've had today.

Then choose 1 end to seal with packing tape. Tape along the seams to ready the box for packing. For shipping, use corrugated cardboard boxes. These boxes are double-walled, so they’re stronger than regular boxes. The tray is similar to an egg carton, dividing the box into cells that hold containers in place. It’s a useful option when you plan on sending multiple items. They can be purchased from moving and shipping companies, but many liquor stores can give you some for free if you ask nicely.  Foam trays are another option. These trays come in various sizes to hold all sorts of containers. If you are using a specialty wine box, the tray will already be in place. Wrapping paper or newspaper is usually enough protection with a tray. Roll the paper around each container as tightly as possible. To be safe, you can also wrap the containers in bubble wrap.  When shipping multiple containers, wrap each one individually. Use rubber bands or packing tape as needed to hold the wrapping in place. If you have a tray, this part is easy. Slide the container into the tray’s cell, squeezing the wrapping as needed to fit it. Keep the lid or cap end pointed upwards. Double-check that the container is wedged in place with its cap on securely. Repeat this with any other containers sent in the same package. If you choose not to use a tray, lay the container in the center of the box. Keep it away from the sides as much as possible. Stuff the packing peanuts, bubble wrap, or air bags into the package as needed. Use them to eliminate any leftover space, such as between the container and the wall. Also add cushioning above the container as needed. The extra padding can make the difference between a broken container and successful shipping. Fold the box’s top flaps together. Tape along all the seams. Attempt to lift the flaps to check how well they are taped down. Cover over any loose spots with additional layers of tape to ensure your package doesn’t open up in the delivery person’s hands! Find a black permanent marker. On the top side of the box, write “Liquid” and “Fragile” in capital letters. In fact, write it several times all over the box to make your point. Then, take the box to the shipping company.

Labeling the contents as liquid or fragile does not guarantee that the box will arrive in 1 piece, but it may alert a carrier about to handle the package roughly.","output":"The article is all about how to safely pack and ship containers in a box, using materials like corrugated cardboard boxes, protective trays, wrapping paper or bubble wrap, and packing peanuts or air bags to ensure the items stay secure and cushioned, along with marking the box as containing \\"liquid\\" and \\"fragile\\" items before shipping."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  A satellite&#x27;s need is determined - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket Answer:","output":"The final step of the process, after the satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket, is to launch the rocket and place the satellite into its designated orbit around the Earth. This crucial step is vital to ensuring the satellite's functionality and mission success.  Launching the satellite involves several sub-steps, which are detailed below: 1. Pre-launch preparations: Prior to the launch, technicians thoroughly check the rocket, satellite, and launch pad to ensure all systems are functioning correctly. They also confirm the satellite's placement within the rocket and secure all necessary control and support devices. Weather conditions are closely monitored to guarantee a safe launching environment. Final trajectory calculations are made, taking into consideration various factors such as air resistance, orbital altitude, and required orbital inclination. Additionally, the launch window is carefully chosen to ensure a precise orbital insertion. 2. Ignition and lift-off: The rocket's engines ignite, generating a tremendous amount of thrust to lift the rocket and its payload off the launch pad. The initial acceleration is necessary to overcome the Earth's gravity and carry the satellite to its desired altitude. As the rocket ascends, it undergoes several flight phases, including the vertical ascent, gravity turn, and horizontal flight. 3. Staging: Most rockets have multiple stages, which are separate sections of the vehicle containing their own engines and propellant tanks. Once a stage has expended its fuel, it is jettisoned to reduce the rocket's overall mass. This process is known as \\"staging.\\" Each stage takes the rocket progressively higher and faster during its ascent. 4. Fairing separation: During the ascent, the satellite is protected within the rocket's payload fairing. This aerodynamic shell shields the satellite from atmospheric forces, such as drag and temperature variations. Once the rocket reaches a desired altitude, typically above the Earth's denser atmosphere, the fairing is no longer necessary and is separated from the structure to further reduce the rocket's mass. 5. Orbital insertion: After the final rocket stage has completed its burn and attained the desired altitude and velocity, the satellite is released from the rocket and is placed into its intended orbit around the Earth. This phase requires precise control to ensure a successful deployment and the correct orbital parameters. 6. Post-launch operations: Once the satellite is successfully deployed into orbit, ground control teams initiate contact to verify its functionality and health. The satellite's solar panels are extended to provide power, and onboard systems are tested to ensure proper operation. The satellite then begins its mission, carrying out the tasks it was designed to perform, such as Earth observation, telecommunications, or scientific research. In conclusion, the final step of the process detailed above is to launch the rocket, carry the satellite into orbit, and successfully deploy it to carry out its intended mission. This step encompasses several sub-steps, each critical to ensuring the satellite's functionality and overall mission success. The meticulous planning and execution during this final step ensure that the satellite meets its determined need and contributes valuable data, services, or research findings to benefit stakeholders on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the use of the word \\"bad\\" also implies that while it may not be terrible, it's not outstanding either. 2. \\"Price is good\\" - This is a positive aspect as it implies that the pricing of the burger is reasonable, which is always a good selling point for customers. 3. \\"Employees are nice\\" - Another positive point in the review, stating that the staff was friendly and polite during the reviewer's visit. 4. \\"French Fries are probably the wurst I have had. Like eating a piece of hard foam.\\" - This statement is decidedly negative, as the reviewer is comparing the quality of the fries to a hard and unpleasant texture. The use of the word \\"wurst\\" instead of \\"worst\\" could suggest a play on words, possibly intending to make the statement even more negative. 5. \\"Won't return\\" - This is a clear negative point, indicating that the customer's overall experience was not satisfactory enough to merit a repeat visit. To summarize, this review contains some positive points, such as the decent price and nice employees, but the strongly negative critique of the French fries and the customer's decision to not return to the establishment tip the overall review towards the negative side.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  Now, I have a new situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest.

Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader.

Roger adjusted the feet located underneath the appliance to ensure it was sitting on a solid, even surface. This was crucial for maintaining proper function and preventing any issues down the line. After leveling the fridge, he installed the water and ice line connections, following the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure a leak-free and secure connection. Roger was meticulous with this step, knowing that it could lead to potential water damage if not executed correctly. With the water and ice lines successfully connected, it was time to plug in the fridge and give it a test run. Roger was careful not to kink the power cord or water lines as he slid the fridge into its designated space in the kitchen. As the fridge powered up, he listened for any unusual noises or signs of potential malfunction. Hearing nothing out of the ordinary, he moved on to testing the ice maker and water dispenser, ensuring both operated smoothly and efficiently. Finally, with all tests yielding positive results, Roger began transferring the contents of the old fridge to the new one. As he did, he took the opportunity to clean and organize the items, discarding expired products and wiping down the shelves to start fresh. Once the fridge was fully stocked and organized, he stood back and admired his handiwork, feeling a great sense of satisfaction in having successfully installed the appliance with ease and confidence. In summary, Roger's prior experience in installing a fridge in a different house considerably facilitated the installation process for him.

A man's body has been found in his home after it lay undiscovered there for four years following his suicide. David Carter, who neighbours said was well-liked, told friends he was moving from his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to New Mexico in 2007. A real estate worker who went into his suburban home to repossess it last week - after bank officials finally realised he hadn't paid the bill for four years - and found his remains. He is believed to have shot himself with a handgun. The body of David Carter was found in his house and is thought to have killed himself in 2007. The employee of the Milwaukee County treasury office- who entered his home in the West Allis neighborhood in order to start the repossession process- found Mr Carter's 'nearly skeletonized' remains on his stairway, a gunshot in his head, and a handgun on his chest. No bill or income tax has been paid by Mr Carter since late 2007, so that is the approximate date-of-death that officials have given him, but there is no way to be exact. 'We're trying to figure it out, too. How could it go this far?' said local government worker Michael Czaplewski. 'It's one of those things where it falls between the cracks, I guess,’ he told the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel. Unexpected: The city of Milwaukee mowed his lawn and shovelled his snow since he went missing, and sent bills totalling 37,000 for the services that went unpaid. Though Mr Carter clearly did not maintain the house, the city took it upon themselves to shovel and mow his lawn through the years and then charged him for those services; his bill is now 37,000 for the years of maintenance. Mr Carter, whose 45th birthday would have been January 23 of this year, lived and studied in Milwaukee, and school records show him attending the local high school and earning a college degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As an only child raised by a single mother, Mr Carter had few close relatives after his mother died following a battle with cancer in 1997. Mr Carter's cousin, Kevin O'Neill, said that he became emotionally withdrawn and began drinking heavily after his mother's death. His remains were found last week when a city employee came to the house to start the foreclosure process. In spite of his grief, he moved on to work as a nuisance control officer for the city of Milwaukee from 1999 to 2007. He resigned from that job in September 2007 and said he was planning to move to Albequerque, and then he disappeared. 'The people closest to him knew he moved so nobody ever did bother to think that anything was wrong with him,' said his high school friend Teresa Bornheimer. Since his body was found, more details are being discovered as people try to understand how he could have been dead in his own house for four years without anyone noticing. Medical records show that he was listed as the father of a girl who is now 14 years old. He and the mother never married and the mother, whose name has not been released, said that the last time she saw him was in 2006. Certain: His 'nearly skeletonized' body was identified using dental records. Though he clearly was not a constant part of the girl's life, he did keep her in his thoughts as investigators found a note which had a list of his possessions that he bequeathed to her. 'My jaw just dropped when I found out. I told myself maybe it's a bum living at the house,' said Ms Bornheimer. The decomposed body was identified as Mr Carter using dental records. The profits from the sale of his house, which originally belonged to his mother, will go to the county but because of the discovery that he had a daughter, she could likely challenge the county for the profits. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"A man named David Carter, who lived in Milwaukee, told his friends he was moving to New Mexico in 2007. But actually, he stayed in his home and sadly took his own life. His body was found four years later by a person who came to take the house because David had not paid any bills. The city did things like mow his lawn and shovel snow, not knowing he was gone, and charged him for it. David's friends and family thought he had just moved away and didn't know what had happened. It's surprising that nobody found out earlier, but sometimes things fall between the cracks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They tell the owner, George (Aleksandr Gordon), that they are searching for the boxer Ole Andreson and that they want to kill him. They tie up Nick Adams and the cook, and wait for Ole Andreson to appear. Three customers enter the restaurant and are sent away by George. One of the customers is played by Tarkovsky, who whistles Lullaby of Birdland. The second scene shows Nick Adams visiting Ole Andreson (Vasiliy Shukshin) in his hide-out, a small room.

Answer:","output":"This review would likely increase the chances of me buying the product. Here's my step-by-step justification: 1. The reviewer acknowledges that the recordings are from 50+ years ago and are derived from existing LPs, 45s, or 78s. This sets an expectation of potentially lower audio quality due to the age and source of the recordings. 2. However, the reviewer states that this is the \\"VERY BEST reconstruction\\" they have ever heard, which suggests that the product's audio quality is better than other similar products. 3. The reviewer also mentions their involvement in the product's production, which could indicate a potential bias. However, their excitement and enthusiasm for the product, coupled with specific examples (e.g., Buddy Rich on drums, the song \\"CARIOCA\\") may still be persuasive. 4. The reviewer addresses potential concerns about purchasing public domain material by assuring potential buyers that they will \\"LOVE IT.\\" Overall, the reviewer's excitement and satisfaction with the product, as well as their assurances that it is of high quality despite being derived from older original sources, would increase the chances of me buying the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then I will assign points for each element, considering the scale from 0 (not similar) to 5 (very similar). 1. Topic (Earthquake): Both sentences mention an earthquake occurring, so their topic is the same. Points: 5/5 2. Magnitude: The first sentence is about a 6.0-magnitude earthquake, while the second is about a 5.0-magnitude earthquake. They are similar to some extent, but not identical. Points: 3/5 3. Location: The first sentence mentions Greece, while the second talks about Japan. These locations are different and not similar at all. Points: 0/5 4. Reporting agency: The first sentence refers to the \\"USGS\\" (United States Geological Survey) as the source, while the second sentence doesn't mention any source. The first sentence has additional information, while the second has missing information, which makes it somewhat similar. Points: 3/5 5. Verb used to describe the earthquake: The first sentence uses the verb \\"hits,\\" while the second sentence uses \\"jolts.\\" Although both verbs convey the idea of a sudden impact, they are not identical in meaning. Points: 3/5 Now, let's calculate the average similarity score by adding the individual similarity scores of each of the five elements and dividing the sum by the total number of elements: (5 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 3) / 5 = 14 / 5 = 2.8 Based on this analysis, the sentences have a similarity score of 2.8 (out of 5) which means that the sentences are moderately similar but not identical, and have some significant differences, primarily in the location and magnitude of the earthquakes."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - Overview.

Why doesn't the Moon spin?  -no. -yes.","output":"To determine whether these questions have the same meaning, let's analyze them step by step. 1. Read and understand both questions:    - Why isn't the Moon spinning?    - Why doesn't the Moon spin? 2. Break down the questions into their essential components:    - Both questions are asking about the Moon's rotation (spinning).    - The first question uses the present continuous tense (isn't spinning), whereas the second question uses the simple present tense (doesn't spin). 3. Consider potential differences in meaning or context based on the tenses used:    - The present continuous tense might imply an ongoing action or process. In this case, the first question could possibly be asking why the Moon is not currently spinning at this very moment.    - The simple present tense is more general and used for habits, facts, and general truths. The second question, therefore, is asking about the Moon's lack of spin as a general phenomenon, not necessarily focused on the current moment. 4. Assess the potential difference in meaning:    - Despite the difference in tense usage, both questions are effectively asking about the same phenomenon: the Moon's lack of rotation. 5. Provide a final analysis:    - While there might be a subtle difference in tense, in practical terms, both questions convey the same essential meaning.

And now Millie Mackintosh reveals her top tips for hosting the perfect dinner party this festive season exclusively to Femail. Millie's advice comes in light of new research showing two thirds of people (64 per cent) are shunning pubs, restaurants and parties, to instead open their homes to friends and family. However, this increase in generosity has led to a plethora of problems, with hopeless hosts admitting to a myriad of dinner party disasters. Problems range from not being prepared enough with food, drink and room dressing (53 per cent) to leaving guests to their own devices while preparing food (28 per cent) and struggling to decide on recipes (15 per cent). And with almost two thirds (62 per cent) of Britons more likely to host a get together in their homes in the run up to the festive season than during the rest of the year, dilemmas faced by the majority of people, such as what to cook (46 per cent) and planning drinks (26 per cent), is set to increase. Seven in ten (69 per cent) said  they have had gatecrashers at their gathering (ie neighbours, friends or acquaintances turning up unexpectedly). One in ten admit to passing off food (such as takeaways) as their own when hosting parties. And British dinner party hosts revealed they frequently lose essential props such as toilet paper (7 per cent), milk (5 per cent) and seats (28 per cent). The poll from  Tassimo has spurred the brand to come up with an 'ultimate solution to the nation's hosting woes' with their Perfect Host panel.

What's the answer? Pick from:  1). vapor particles.  2). solid.  3). ice.  4). frigid.","output":"The answer is 1). vapor particles. When water is heated above 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure, it undergoes a phase transition from liquid to gas. This gaseous state of water is referred to as steam or water vapor. Above 100 degrees Celsius, water molecules gain enough kinetic energy to break free from the liquid state and enter the gaseous phase. Let's delve a little deeper into the science behind this phenomenon. Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms bonded together, with the molecular formula H2O. In the liquid state, water molecules are packed closely together and are held in place by hydrogen bonds that form between the negatively-charged oxygen atom in one water molecule and the positively-charged hydrogen atom in another. As water is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases, causing them to move faster. When the temperature reaches the boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius, these molecules have enough energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds holding them together in the liquid state, and they transition into the gaseous state. This is when steam is formed, comprising water vapor particles that are spaced farther apart than in the liquid state. To recap, when water is heated above 100 degrees Celsius, it transforms from liquid to gas, generating steam or water vapor particles. The other options provided, solid, ice, and frigid, do not describe the state or characteristics of water at this temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Elshijh, an Egyptian doctoral candidate at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said he felt fairly excited when he learned that Mo Yan had won the literary prize. \\"Mo's winning of the prize is pushing Egypt to translate more of his works into Arabic,\\" Elshijh said, adding that there is already an Arabic edition of \\"Red Sorghum,\\" but Egypt's Ministry of Culture recently announced that it will translate another of Mo's works from Chinese to Arabic. Although Chinese literature is getting more attention around the world, translated versions of Chinese works remain in small supply in places like the United States and Europe. Jonathan Chuck, an American who has been working in social media for three years in China, has read some ancient Chinese classics in Englishand can name several ancient poets such as Li Bai. Chuck said works of Chinese literature are hard to get in the United States, as bookstores simply don't carry many English translations. \\"Besides, China is considered a mysterious country and far away from our daily life.\\" Chuck said when he was in school, pupils mostly studied Western literature translated from French, German and Portuguese, not literature translated from Asian languages. \\"China's Nobel prize will inspire more Westerners to notice Chinese literature, and I may read some of Mo's works,\\" he added. Li Ling, a professor at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said Chinese literature has less of a market than English-language literature because Western culture is the dominant culture. Moreover, it is difficult to fully express some Chinese words in English, which can limit Chinese literature to a Chinese-literate audience, Li added. \\"Western readers are more picky about what they read,\\" he said, explaining that if a Chinese book is not translated well, it would be \\" _ \\" to recommend it to Western readers. Li expects China's Nobel laureate  to expand foreign readership. Question: According to what Chuck said, Mo's winning Nobel Prize has a/an   _   effect on Chinese Literature.

They dim immediately when it's sunny and brighten when a passing cloud blocks the sun. A wall of windows at a University of Pennsylvania engineering building has built-in blinds   controlled by a computer program that follows the sun's path. Buildings are getting smarter and the next generation of building materials is expected to do even more. Windows could catch the sun's energy to heat water. Sensors that measure the carbon dioxide breathed out by people in a room could determine whether the air conditioning needs to be turned up. Many new materials and technology have been designed in the last 15 years. They are now being used in a wave of buildings designed to save as much energy as possible. They include old ideas, like \\"green roofs\\", where a belt of plants on a roof helps the building keep heat in winter and stay cool in summer, and new ideas, like special coating for windows that lets light in, but keeps heat out. As technologies such as sensors become cheaper, their uses spread. The elevators at Seven World Trade Center, which is under construction in New York, use a system that groups people traveling to nearby floors into the same elevator, thus saving elevator stops. People who work in the building will enter it by swiping   ID cards that will tell the elevators their floor, readouts will then tell them which elevator to use. The building also has windows with a coating that blocks heat while letting in light. More new building materials and technology are in development.

As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others. According to the above context, answer the following question. How does the mom feel about the world? Answer:","output":"The mom feels a mix of emotions about the world. She is worried for her children's safety, especially her daughters, due to her own traumatic experiences. This worry might cause her to be more protective than she should be. At the same time, she sees the world as a place for activism and strives to make a difference by speaking the truth, raising awareness, and helping others. Despite her fears, she wants to teach her children the power of resilience and standing up against injustice. Overall, her feelings towards the world are a combination of concern, hope, and determination to make a positive impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r....  Guess a valid title for it!

With impeccable acting, a concise storyline, and jump scares that genuinely send shivers down your spine, this movie is a must-see for horror enthusiasts everywhere. As a positive movie review, it's essential to recognize the film's outstanding features that make it stand out from the crowd. Insidious delivers a satisfying blend of psychological thriller and supernatural suspense. It masterfully avoids the common horror movie clichés, allowing the audience to experience a rich and engrossing narrative that keeps them engaged and anxious throughout. The plot of the film revolves around Josh and Renai Lambert, played by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, a couple who moves their family - their daughter and two young sons - into a new home, only to discover sinister forces haunting them. When one of their sons, Dalton, falls into an unexplainable coma, the couple seeks the help of paranormal investigator Elise Rainier (played by Lin Shaye) to unravel the mystery and save their son from a dark and dangerous spirit realm known as The Further. The acting in 'Insidious' is nothing short of phenomenal, with all the main characters delivering powerful and raw performances that strike an emotional chord. Byrne convincingly portrays a devoted mother desperate to save her child, while Wilson brings depth to his role as a man torn between skepticism and fear. Lin Shaye's performance as the seasoned psychic is equally captivating, with a strong on-screen presence that effectively bridges the gap between viewers hungry for answers and the horrifying dilemma our protagonists face. One aspect where 'Insidious' truly excels is its sound design, which dramatically enhances the film's eerie atmosphere. The atonal musical score by Joseph Bishara is a standout, creating a chilling backdrop that further intensifies the on-screen tension. Clever utilization of sound effects in pivotal scenes makes even the smallest moments feel ghastly and spine-chilling, ensuring that the audience remains on edge throughout the film. The film's visuals are another highlight, with an intelligent combination of practical effects, makeup, and minimal reliance on CGI. This lends the movie an air of authenticity and keeps the paranormal encounters terrifyingly grounded in reality. James Wan's direction, combined with David M. Brewer and John R. Leonetti's cinematography, elevates the movie to a visual spectacle, with atmospheric lighting and clever camera angles that keep the viewers glued to their seats. With a compelling narrative, exceptional performances, and haunting visuals that stand tall in the world of horror films, 'Insidious' is a cinematic triumph that redefines the genre and leaves a lasting impact on its viewers. Despite being over a decade old, this film continues to entertain and disturb audiences, making it a timeless classic in the world of horror."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At Dave's son's birthday party, Jason and Cynthia, using PowerPoint, announce their troubled marriage and they are considering divorce because they cannot have a baby.

In their presentation, they show beautiful pictures of sunlit beaches and beautiful locations. They also assure the others that the couples therapy is purely optional. Dave and Ronnie discuss their inability to go because of childcare responsibilities and decline the trip.

(CNN) -- Despite their public handshake on Monday it appears there is still some way to go before Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia bury the hatchet.  A long-running spat between the two golfers resurfaced after they shared a contentious round together at The Players' Championship in May.  After several verbal volleys in either direction, Garcia's joke that he would invite Woods round for \\"fried chicken\\" during the U.S Open led to an immediate and unreserved apology from the Spaniard, who denied it was racially motivated.  A statement from the world No. 1 on social networking site Twitter called the remarks \\"wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate.\\"  Woods also said that he was sure there was \\"real regret\\" on the part of Garcia and that it was time to move on.  Inevitably, the issue resurfaced as both players prepared to come face-to-face ahead of the second major of the year at Merion in Philadelphia.  The pair greeted each other on the practice range but the world No. 1 told a press conference on Tuesday there had been no time for a formal apology.  Asked if they had discussed Garcia's comments Woods replied: \\"No, we didn't discuss anything. Just came up and said 'hi' and that was it.\\"  Woods was pressed by reporters as to whether the Spaniard had offered him any form of apology but he said: \\"No, we haven't had time for that.  \\"It's already done.

Options:  A. flintlock  B. tennis court  C. at home  D. motion  E. arcade Answer:","output":"E. Arcade The most sensible option for firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth would be at an arcade. This is because arcades are designed for fun and safe entertainment, and have specific games and attractions where you can participate in activities like this. In this case, the game would likely be a well-designed and controlled environment, already set up for players to aim and fire projectiles at targets such as a clown's mouth. The arcade staff would ensure the equipment is functional and safe to use, adhering to various safety regulations. Comparing this option to the others, it's clear that an arcade is the most logical and common-sense choice: A. Flintlock: A flintlock is a type of firearm dating back to the 17th century, which is not a safe nor relevant option for the given situation. Firing any firearm, whether antique or modern, at a clown's mouth would be not only dangerous but also inappropriate in any context. B. Tennis court: While a tennis court is a place to hit a ball, it is a setting strictly meant for playing tennis with proper gear like racquets and tennis balls. Using it to shoot a projectile ball at a clown's mouth would be both disrespectful to others who may be playing or wanting to play tennis and unsafe without proper targets and infrastructure in place. C. At home: Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth in a home setting isn't the most appropriate choice. There's a higher risk of causing damage to objects or injury to people present, as homes are not designed or equipped for this kind of activity. Parents or guardians would also likely have concerns about safety and stress the importance of not playing with projectiles indoors. D. Motion: This option doesn't make sense, as \\"motion\\" is not a place or context where one could fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. Motion is a term that describes movement and is not relevant to the question at hand. In conclusion, an arcade is the most logical and safe place to fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. This environment is specifically created for such games and activities, making it the most common-sense option among the ones provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Either a handwritten or typed letter is totally acceptable. A handwritten letter will have a slightly more personal look, but a typed letter is better if you're more comfortable that way. What matters is the effort you're making to craft a letter and send it, so don't worry too much about your choice here.  If you choose to handwrite it, use a pen with black or blue ink. Write in either print or cursive, as long as your writing is legible. If you choose to type it, use a font that's easy to read, like Times New Roman or Arial. This is especially necessary if you're writing a thank you letter to a professional colleague. While dashing off a note on a torn piece of scrap paper demonstrates your interesting character, it's considered more polite to use a nice piece of stationery or a thank you card. If someone went to the trouble of giving you a gift, the nice thing to do is send them your letter in a format that shows you're sincerely grateful.  If you go with stationary, it doesn't have to be fancy. Look for heavier-weight paper made with cotton or another high-quality material. It's fine to use stationary with a design or your initials. Packs of thank you cards are sold in stationary shops and drug stores. Consider getting more than one so you'll have more cards on hand for next time. The style of your note will be a little different depending on who's receiving it. Keeping the nature of the gift in mind, think about what type of note would be most appropriate. No matter what, you want to leave the person receiving the note feeling that you're sincerely grateful.  For example, if you're sending a thank-you note to your boss, and the workplace setting is pretty formal, you might want to choose high-quality business stationery, type the letter and format it according to the standards for a  professional business letter. If the note is for a friend, you can show a little more personality. Write your note on a funny postcard, or make your own cool stationary. While sending a thank-you text message never quite has enough oomph to show how grateful you are, sometimes it's fine to send an email. This is especially true if you're not writing the note in thanks for a physical gift. For example, if your aunt lent an ear when you were upset over breaking up with your boyfriend, you might want to send her a thank-you email in gratitude for her patience and understanding.  However, if you need to thank someone for giving you an actual gift or for dedicating a significant amount of time toward helping you, it's better to send a real letter. People realize that it takes effort to write and mail a letter, and that extra time will be appreciated. If you send an email, it should be as well composed and thoughtful as a regular letter would be. In fact, you might want to take even more time making sure it's well written, since you're not going to the trouble of sending it by snail mail.

Context: The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh.

Summarize: The helicopters are in addition to the £2.5m donated by the UK to the UN's Humanitarian Air Service. The military and UN helicopters will ferry people and aid supplies across remote and hard-to-reach terrain. The Foreign Office has confirmed that British dual national Hemchandra Rai, 42, was killed in the disaster. The married father of three lived in Hong Kong. Reports of another British victim killed at Mount Everest base camp are still being investigated. Ms Greening said: \\"These highly versatile Royal Air Force helicopters and UN aircraft will mean life-saving aid supplies can be moved around Nepal and reach people in remote communities cut off by the earthquake who are in desperate need. \\"Conditions in Nepal are dire, but the UK is determined to do everything it can to help support Nepal and its people.\\" The three CH47 Chinook aircraft will be transported from RAF Brize Norton to the region. The Department for International Development (DfID) says the first Chinook is being prepared for transit on Thursday and will be sent out on Friday, with the other two being sent in the coming days. The Foreign Office also confirmed that two of its teams, deployed to locate and assist British nationals in remote areas, helped rescue eight British nationals who were then transported from Dhunche to Kathmandu. Some 300 British citizens have been assisted by the British embassy in Kathmandu since Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake struck, killing more than 5,500 people. An aid flight carrying 120 Britons from Nepal to the UK landed on Thursday. There were emotional scenes as family members greeted relatives after the plane landed at Stansted Airport shortly after 03:00 BST. Meanwhile, a boy and a woman have been rescued from collapsed buildings in Kathmandu after surviving for five days in the rubble. Among those arriving back at Stansted on board the DfID-chartered Boeing 767 - which flew aid out to Nepal on Sunday - were children and people chosen as a priority because of health conditions. The youngest passenger was a three-month-old baby. Husband and wife Grahame and Holly Jobes, from Sunderland, were reunited as he stepped through immigration. Mr Jobes, who was in Nepal for a friend's wedding, told the BBC he was in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \\"Things were dropping down, people were running,\\" he said. \\"I am very fortunate, I managed to get out. I was next to people who are no longer here.\\" Harry Quinn, 26, from Brighton, said a hotel - which had turned him away because it was full - completely collapsed with 80 people inside. \\"We were among the lucky ones but we saw plenty of others who weren't so lucky.\\" Chris Berriman, from Morpeth, Northumberland, arrived back in the UK on Monday. He said he was in a bookshop in Kathmandu when the quake struck. \\"I dropped to my knees in the doorway and watched large cracks appear in the walls around me,\\" he said. \\"I staggered out into the streets when the quake passed. The streets are narrow with tall buildings so there was debris falling everywhere.\\" About 30 British and Irish families are reportedly still waiting for news of their loved ones who may have been in Nepal at the time of the earthquake. Judy Ross, from Bath, said she feared for the safety of her daughter, Susannah Ross, 20, who is among a group of trekkers stranded in northern Nepal following the earthquake. She has heard her daughter is alive, but said she did not know what state she was in and that she feared boulders \\"the size of a car\\" were still falling in the area. An appeal launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has raised more than £19m in the UK - including £14m in public donations and £5m from the government, which matched the first £5m of public donations. The UK government has also pledged £15m to Nepal in aid. Members of a 60-strong UK International Search and Rescue (UKISAR) team have also started searching for victims on the ground - including in remote parts of Nepal - with specialist rescue dogs. Hundreds of shelter kits and solar lanterns are among 18 tonnes of supplies from the UK which have arrived in the devastated region, Ms Greening said. A team of Gurkha engineers - 12 from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles and six from the Queen's Gurkha Engineers - has also travelled to the country to help operate water purification equipment. The DEC, an umbrella organisation that brings together 13 British aid charities to deal with international crises, has launched a website and donation line.","output":"The UK has donated £2.5m to the UN's Humanitarian Air Service and is sending military and UN helicopters to ferry aid supplies and people across remote and hard-to-reach areas in Nepal.

First one has to take into account the time period this film was made in. 1995. Rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it. Remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was befriended by Nazis. They took him in. Nazi's aren't all this awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a void that is missing be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the part perfectly. Omar Epps was the hot shot track star, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it. Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped. She then found her self experiment with her sexuality, and getting involved politically. This film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism, people's own perspectives come into play. I read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one (Nazis). So what? Remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see him devolve how he did. He even says right before he kills himself, I didn't mean it, I wanted to be an engineer. Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men, Ice Cube was somewhat of an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug. They both showed no consideration at all for their roommates, and generally appear to not like white people very much. They were angry like the Nazis but not on the level of Nazis in terms of overall badness. Sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. People say it shows white=-bad black=good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just misguided. Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate. Although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well. Good movie, well done. Like all movies that deal with racism, its a great piece to get a discussion going. I don't think Cube and Busta coulda beat those Nazis though. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review? Options are:  A). negative.

Hello, my little friend! Today we're going to learn about a period in London's history when people got very sick from a bad germ called the plague. The plague made lots of people in London sick many different times, and it lasted for about 400 years! Let me explain it to you in a simple way. First, what is the plague? The plague is an icky germ that can make people feel very sick or even cause them to die. It was like a really, really bad flu. And like the flu, it could spread from one person to another. In the olden days, people didn't have the same medicine and doctors as we do now to help them feel better. Now let's talk about London. London is a big city in a country called England, far away across the ocean. A long, long time ago, London had a few big times when the plague made a lot of people sick. These times were called \\"epidemics.\\" Let's count those epidemics! 1. The first time was called the \\"Black Death.\\" The Black Death happened a very long time ago, way back in the years 1348-1350. Many people in London, and in other parts of the world, got sick and could not get better.  2. The second big time happened in 1603. During this time, the plague didn't make as many people sick as during the Black Death, but it still made a lot of people in London very sick. 3. Another big time happened in 1625. That's only 22 years after the second time. This one was called the \\"Great Plague of 1625.\\" 4. The very last big time was in 1665. This one was called the \\"Great Plague of London.\\" Many, many people got sick during this time. But, after the year 1666, the big plague epidemics stopped happening in London. So between the Black Death in 1348 and the Great Plague of London in 1665, plague epidemics in London happened for about 400 years. That's a long, long time!  But don't worry, my little friend. Today, we have medicine and doctors to help keep people healthy, and the plague doesn't make people sick like it used to. So, it's a good thing that we live now and not during the time when the plague was making so many people in London sick!"},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film centers on five graduate school students in Iowa who live together in a rustic home: Jude (Cameron Diaz), Pete (Ron Eldard), Paulie (Annabeth Gish), Marc (Jonathan Penner), and Luke (Courtney B. Vance). After Zack (Bill Paxton), a Desert Storm veteran, helps move Pete's car, the group invite him to have dinner with them. However, Zack turns out to be a racist who praises Adolf Hitler and denies the historicity of the Holocaust, leading to a tense political debate with the liberal students. The evening takes a turn for the worse, when the veteran snaps and threatens to rape Paulie, then threatens Marc with a knife. Zack breaks Pete's arm but is stabbed to death by Marc. The group decides to cover up the murder. Paulie regrets that the man is dead, even though she and Marc were threatened. After a long discussion led by Luke, the students decide to follow up this event by inviting other right-wing extremists for dinner to murder them, reasoning this would \\"make the world a better place\\". The students lay down a procedure for each murder. The guest will be given every opportunity to change his/her mind and recant his/her beliefs. If the guests fail to change his/her ways by dessert, the group offers the guest poisoned white wine from a blue decanter and raises a toast. The bodies are buried in the group's vegetable garden. Guests include a homophobic protestant reverend; a misogynistic, chauvinistic rape apologist; a Neo-Nazi; an anti-environmentalist; a racist, anti-Semitic Nation of Islam fundamentalist; a Pro-life extremist; a censorship advocate; a hobo assailant (the only dinner guest who momentarily considers recanting his beliefs); and opponents of gay rights, all of whom are murdered. After ten murders, misgivings begin to surface within the group as a couple of them grow indecisive regarding the justification of their actions. Infighting and guilt compel Jude, Pete, Marc, and Paulie, in an almost unanimous decision with only the dissent of Luke, to spare a teenage opponent of mandatory sex...

Hospital workers wash their hands as little as 30 percent of the time they interact with patients, studies show. Efforts in New York hospitals and elsewhere seek to save 30 billion lost per year to hospital-acquired infections by installing surveillance equipment at hand washing sinks. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Surveillance Systems at Handwashing Sinks: A New Approach to Preventing Hospital-Acquired Infections and Saving Billions Introduction: Hospital-acquired infections are a major concern for public health officials as they contribute to extended hospital stays, increased risk of complication, increased mortality rates, and a massive financial burden. In fact, in the United States alone, studies reveal that an astounding 30 billion is lost yearly to hospital-acquired infections. One common factor contributing to these infections is the inadequate hand hygiene of hospital workers. Recent studies show that they wash their hands only 30% of the time when they interact with patients, despite being a standard protocol in medical facilities. Installing Surveillance Equipment at Handwashing Sinks: In response to this alarming trend, several hospitals in New York have emerged at the forefront of implementing new strategies to reduce hospital-acquired infections. One such strategy involves the installation of surveillance equipment at handwashing sinks that monitor the hand hygiene of healthcare workers. Step 1: Identifying Key Locations for Surveillance Equipment: To effectively implement this strategy, it is crucial to identify and install surveillance systems in places where handwashing is most essential, such as entrance and exits of patient rooms, intensive care units, operating rooms, and laboratories. Step 2: Integrating Technology for Real-Time Monitoring: The surveillance systems are integrated with advanced technological sensors that can monitor the hand hygiene of healthcare workers in real-time. This real-time monitoring allows hospitals to identify potential lapses in hygiene protocol and address them promptly, reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Step 3: Monitoring Compliance and Providing Feedback The data collected by the surveillance equipment can be used to analyze the overall compliance with hand hygiene protocols and generate customized reports for each healthcare worker. This feedback can be used to encourage diligent handwashing and reinforce the need for proper hand hygiene as a crucial part of patient safety. Step 4: Educating Healthcare Workers on Hand Hygiene Importance: In addition to surveillance and feedback, it is crucial to provide ongoing education, training, and reinforcement of the importance of hand hygiene for healthcare workers. This can be achieved through mandatory training seminars, educational materials, and regular reminders throughout the hospital facility. Conclusion: With hospital-acquired infections posing a significant threat to public health, it is imperative that healthcare facilities adapt to new strategies to help reduce the spread of infections. The installation of surveillance equipment at handwashing sinks serves as a promising approach to address inadequate hand hygiene and take proactive measures in halting the spread of infections. By increasing the handwashing compliance among hospital workers, this innovative strategy has the potential to reduce the 30 billion lost annually to hospital-acquired infections and improve overall patient care and safety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Folding Steamer The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version. Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of  pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean. Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables. Steaming Pan This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled  steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living. Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store. Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the  pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot  see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice. For serious users of steamers,I recommend having one of each version.If you just want  to try it,get the folding stainless-steel type.

Options: - wilderness - encyclopedia - magazine - commercial - countryside  The answer is \\"encyclopedia\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"encyclopedia\\" because encyclopedias are comprehensive collections of information and knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, systematically arranged for easy access and retrieval. They are designed to provide the reader with a broad understanding of a specific topic, concept, or field of study. Encyclopedias can be general, covering a vast array of subjects, or specialized, focusing on a particular discipline or area of interest. In the case of looking up information about a sloth, an encyclopedia would be the most appropriate source among the given options. Here's why: 1. Wilderness and countryside: These terms refer to natural, rural, or undeveloped areas that are characterized by their unspoiled landscapes and ecosystems. While sloths may inhabit these environments, these terms on their own do not comprise a collection of writings where one could find information on the topic. 2. Magazine: Magazines are periodicals that usually focus on particular areas of interest or subjects, and they contain articles, essays, news items, and other content related to their chosen topic. Although it is possible to find articles or features on sloths in certain magazines (e.g., wildlife, nature, or zoology publications), magazines are not a consistently reliable source for comprehensive or detailed information about a specific animal. 3. Commercial: This term generally refers to something related to business, commerce, sales, or marketing. In the context of written works, it could potentially refer to promotional materials, product catalogs, or advertisements. Although it is conceivable that a sloth-related product or service could appear in a commercial context, this would not be an ideal source to consult for information about sloths. An encyclopedia, on the other hand, offers readers a reliable and organized source of in-depth knowledge on a vast range of topics, including animals like sloths. Within an encyclopedia, one would likely find an article or entry dedicated to sloths that covers their habitat, behavior, diet, physiology, taxonomy, and more. Furthermore, encyclopedias usually undergo rigorous editorial processes and expert review, which helps ensure the accuracy of their content. As such, encyclopedias are a superior choice for accessing dependable and comprehensive information about sloths."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: Dear Peter, My name is Frank. I am from America.

She sometimes feels that her two children know more about their baby---sitter than they do about her. Molly employs   around eighty people in her factory and warehouse, and ten others in her two new fashion stores, but her newest employee is the most important one for her. After years of worrying about her business more than her family, she has decided to make Sally Pamonte new general manager in her company.

Woo island was frequently shaken by earthquakes, but Mud island had no such problems.  But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Write an article using the following points: Vance McAllister's loss went against tide of Republican mid-term victories. Known as 'kissing congressman' after amorous embrace caught on video. Partner in the affair was wife of a friend of McAllister's since high school. McAllister, married at the time, admitted 'personal mistakes' and ran again. Failed to win enough votes to join other candidates in run-off ballot. Article:","output":"Title: Vance McAllister's Loss in Mid-Term Elections: A Notable Exception to Republican Victories Introduction: (Background and context for the article) The mid-term elections of [year] witnessed a sweeping wave of Republican victories, securing numerous seats in boards, councils, and even Congress. However, standing in stark contrast to these wins was the loss of Vance McAllister, a candidate who had earned the controversial moniker of \\"kissing congressman.\\" This article delves into the factors that contributed to McAllister's downfall and examines how personal indiscretions may have impacted his campaign. Body: 1. The Scandal: (Brief description of the scandal) Vance McAllister, at the time a married man, was captured on video engaging in an amorous embrace with a woman who was not his wife. To make matters worse, the woman turned out to be the wife of one of McAllister's high school friends. This incident garnered widespread media attention and earned him the nickname \\"kissing congressman.\\" 2. Aftermath and Response: (McAllister's reaction to the scandal) Following the exposure of the scandal, McAllister admitted to making \\"personal mistakes\\" and took responsibility for his actions. Despite the negative press, he decided to run for re-election in the mid-term polls, possibly believing that his constituents would overlook his transgressions. 3. Impact on the Campaign: (How the scandal may have affected McAllister's chances) While other Republican candidates successfully wooed voters with their political agenda and promises, McAllister's campaign was marred by his past indiscretion. Voters now examined him more critically and struggled to reconcile the image of a devoted representative with that of a man who had betrayed his wife and friend. 4. Election Results: (McAllister's performance in the elections) In a sea of Republican victories, Vance McAllister failed to garner sufficient votes to join the other candidates in the run-off ballot. Many believe that his personal scandal played a significant role in undermining his campaign, casting doubt on his ability to uphold public trust and maintain an untarnished image. Conclusion: (Significance of McAllister's loss) Vance McAllister's defeat in the Republican-heavy mid-term elections highlights the impact of personal misconduct on political careers. His loss serves as a cautionary tale, reminding aspiring politicians that they must remain accountable for their actions and maintain a strong moral compass. As the so-called 'kissing congressman' fades from the public eye, his experience raises important questions about the expectations of character and conduct that we hold for our political representatives."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers.

This is because the availability of more landfill space can encourage waste disposal instead of recycling. Landfills serve as an easier and cheaper option for waste management compared to recycling. However, landfills have adverse effects on the environment, such as emitting greenhouse gases, contaminating groundwater, and occupying valuable land resources. When there are limited landfill sites or high landfill taxes, industries and governments are motivated to invest more in recycling programs and encourage the public to recycle. This approach helps to conserve resources and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal.

Which Israeli Prime Minister was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1995?","output":"The Israeli Prime Minister who was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1995 was Yitzhak Rabin. Born on March 1, 1922, in Jerusalem, Rabin had a long and storied career in both the Israeli military and government before his tragic assassination. Rabin initially started his career in the military when he joined the Palmach, an elite fighting force of the Haganah, the underground Jewish military organization during the British Mandate in Palestine. He quickly rose through the military ranks, and by 1947, he was serving as the Chief of Operations for the Palmach. In 1964, he was appointed the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and oversaw Israel's military victory during the Six-Day War in 1967. Following his military career, Rabin entered the world of politics. He was appointed as the Israeli ambassador to the United States in 1968, where he built strong ties with the American administration and strengthened the US-Israel alliance. In 1974, he was elected as the Prime Minister of Israel, a position he held until 1977. During his first term, Rabin focused on strengthening Israel's economy and increasing social spending. In 1992, Rabin was elected again as the Prime Minister of Israel, serving for the second time. His second term was marked by his commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This led to the signing of the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993, a historic agreement that established mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and opened peace negotiations between the two parties. On November 4, 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was attending a peace rally in the Kings of Israel Square (now known as Rabin Square) in Tel Aviv when he was tragically assassinated by a Jewish extremist named Yigal Amir. Amir, a right-wing Israeli opposed to the Oslo Accords and the idea of Israel relinquishing territory for peace, shot Rabin three times as he made his way to his car after the rally, ending the life of a prominent Israeli leader. Rabin's assassination sent shock waves throughout Israel and the world, and left a lasting impact on the peace process. In recognition of his commitment to peace and the Oslo Accords, Yitzhak Rabin was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, along with Shimon Peres, then Israel's Foreign Minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Chairman of the PLO. Rabin's legacy as a military hero and a peacemaker continues to be remembered and celebrated in Israel and around the world."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Multi-select: Knowing that \\"damming a river can cause a lake to form\\", how would one answer \\"If a beaver does what it does in order to build its home, then near the river will form\\" Available choices:  A). a large H2O source  B). a den for tigers  C). a small military camp  D). a giant black hole...A:","output":"A beaver is known for building structures in water bodies such as rivers and streams, which are commonly referred to as beaver dams. As a result of these activities, alterations in the environment occur, causing changes in the geographical attributes of the area surrounding the river.  To address the query \\"If a beaver does what it does in order to build its home, then near the river will form...\\", we examine the options given. A). a large H2O source - This is the most correct answer. When beavers construct dams, they cause the water flow from the river to slowly accumulate, leading to the formation of a pond or lake around the dam. This expanded water body serves as both a home for the beaver and an augmented water source in the local ecosystem. They choose areas with a slow-moving current to build their dams, as this makes it easier for them to swim and gather materials. The held back water forms a wide and deep body, which the beaver uses for protection from predators, easy access to food during winter, and a method of transportation. This newly formed water source can be referred to as a 'large H2O source.' B). a den for tigers - This option is incorrect. While tigers are known to swim and may utilize bodies of water in their environment, the formation of a water body due to the construction of a beaver dam would not inherently lead to the creation of a tiger den. The presence of tigers is dependent on several factors including availability of prey, vegetation cover, and favourable climatic conditions. C). a small military camp - This option is also incorrect. The formation of a dam by a beaver resulting in the creation of a lake or pond has no direct connection with the establishment of a military camp. The location and establishment of a military camp are strategic decisions made by human beings taking into account factors such as terrain, logistics, and strategic advantage. D). a giant black hole - This option is absolutely incorrect. The activities of a beaver, no matter how transformative to the local environment, cannot give rise to a physical phenomenon such as a black hole. Black holes are cosmic bodies with gravity so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape from them once inside a certain region known as the event horizon.

Write an article based on this summary: More than 20,000 items ranging from a human skull to shoes and sea mines have been discovered during dredging work in Portsmouth Harbour. Article:","output":"Title: Portsmouth Harbour Dredging Unearths Treasure Trove of Over 20,000 Historical Artifacts Introduction Portsmouth Harbour, located on the south coast of England, has long been a busy hub of maritime activity for both civilian and military vessels. Recently, the harbor underwent a major dredging operation to deepen and widen the navigation channel to accommodate larger ships including the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. In the process, a fascinating array of over 20,000 historical artifacts has been unearthed, which ranges from a human skull to shoes and sea mines. This vast treasure trove offers an exciting insight into the harbor's past and offers researchers and historians valuable information about the region's maritime history. The Dredging Process and Discoveries The dredging work began in September 2016 as part of the preparation for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. Over a period of 24 months, a total of £31 million was spent on the project, and it involved the removal of around 3.2 million cubic meters of sediment from the harbor floor. A team of archaeologists from the UK Ministry of Defence, environmental consultants, and divers were tasked with monitoring the dredging operation, as there was always a strong possibility to discover significant historical artifacts during such projects. And indeed, the findings exceeded all expectations, uncovering a remarkable collection of more than 20,000 items, some dating back to the Bronze Age, that paint a detailed picture of Portsmouth's extensive naval and maritime history. A Glimpse into the Past Many of the items found during the dredging work are highly valuable in understanding the development of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques, and lifestyle in different historical periods. Some of the most interesting discoveries include anchors, cannonballs, musket balls, and remarkably well-preserved iron, copper, and bronze age tools. Also found were over 50 German sea mines from World War II that were safely removed by Royal Navy bomb disposal experts. Other intriguing discoveries include a human skull, several personal items such as leather shoes, clay pipes for tobacco, and various pieces of pottery. These artifacts provide valuable insights into the daily lives of people who lived and worked in the Portsmouth Harbor area throughout history. Conservation and Display of the Findings The discovered artifacts have been cataloged and are currently undergoing restoration and conservation efforts in collaboration with the Mary Rose Trust, Southampton University, and other leading archaeological institutions. Once the conservation process is complete, these unique pieces of history are expected to go on public display, with the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and other local museums being the most likely venues. Some of these artifacts may also become part of traveling exhibitions showcasing British naval history, attracting history enthusiasts and the general public alike, while also contributing to the understanding and preservation of the nation's maritime heritage. Conclusion The Portsmouth Harbour dredging project has brought to light a treasure trove of priceless historical artifacts, each one telling its own story of the harbor's past. The excavated items offer an unprecedented peek into the lives of people who lived or visited the harbor over the centuries and contribute significantly to the understanding of the region's maritime history. The preservation and display of these artifacts will ensure that these stories and the lessons they hold will continue to educate and inspire future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: On November18, 1995, Itzhak Perlman, the world famous violinist, came on stage to give a concert at Lincoln Centre in New York City. If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, you know that getting on stage is not easy for him. He got polio as a child, and has to walk with the aid of two crutches now. That night Perlman walked slowly to his chair. Then he sat down and began to play. But, suddenly, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it break---it broke with a loud noise. People thought to themselves, \\"He would have to get up to either find another violin or find another string for this one.\\" But he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he played from where he had stopped. He played with such passion and such power. Of course, everyone knows that it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. But that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that. You could see him changing and recomposing the piece in his head. When he finished, there was a silence in the room. Then people rose and cheered. We were all on our feet, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated what he had done. He smiled and then he said in a quiet tone, \\"You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can make with what you have left.\\" His words have stayed in my mind ever since I heard them. That is also the way of life.

Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia man was alone before his fatal fall from an upper level of Atlanta's Turner Field, police said Tuesday, as they continue to investigate his death.  Ronald L. Homer, 30, was attending Monday night's Braves game against the Phillies. The Braves said they planned to observe a moment of silence for Homer before Tuesday's game.  Four witnesses told officers that they saw Homer fall from the fourth level of the stadium during a rain delay in the game, the Atlanta Police Department said.  \\"All the witnesses stated that there was (sic) no other people around Mr. Homer when he fell,\\" police said, adding there were no surveillance cameras at the scene.  Police said the fall appeared to be accidental but that it was too early to tell if alcohol was a factor.  Homer, of nearby Conyers, fell 65 feet into the players' parking lot. He was unconscious when emergency responders found him, but he died later at the hospital, police said.  An autopsy on Homer is complete, but authorities are not releasing details, citing pending toxicology results, Tami Sedivy-Schroder, an investigator with the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, said Tuesday. Results can take up to eight weeks, she said.  Homer's mother, Connie Homer, told CNN affiliate WXIA that he was a big Braves fan who was attending the game with a friend.  \\"I'm just sick,\\" she said. \\"We're a very close family.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks?, using the article: Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the Table Rocks host a diverse range of flora throughout its four ecological regions: oak savanna, chaparral, mixed woodland, and mounded prairie. The area contains over 340 species of plants, including about 200 species of wildflowers. While your friend specifically asked for wildflowers excluding desert parsley and California goldfields, the article mentions several other common wildflowers that grow abundantly in the Table Rocks area: 1. Western buttercups (Ranunculus occidentalis): These wildflowers feature bright yellow petals and are native to western North America. They grow well in moist habitats, such as the mounded prairie region, where vernal pools are present. 2. Bicolor lupine (Lupinus bicolor): This wildflower is characterized by its blue and white flowers, growing in clusters along a central stem. Bicolor lupine is well-adapted to various habitats and thrives in areas with moist to moderately dry soils, making it suitable for different regions of the Table Rocks. 3. Camas (Camassia spp.): Camas wildflowers can also be found on the Table Rocks, producing an edible bulb. They are characterized by their star-shaped, blue-purple flowers, which grow in racemes. Camas prefer moist meadows and prairies, such as those found in the mounded prairie region. It is essential to note that Death camas (Toxicoscordion spp.) also grows on the Table Rocks and is poisonous. Native Takelma people used death camas as an anesthetic. It somewhat resembles camas; therefore, the two should not be confused. In summary, besides desert parsley and California goldfields, other common wildflowers observed on the Table Rocks include western buttercups, bicolor lupine, and camas. These wildflowers, along with many others, contribute to the biodiversity and beauty of the Table Rocks landscape across its four distinct ecological regions."},{"instruction":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Obama: 'Our hearts are broken' for families of Connecticut shooting victims An emotional President Obama, wiping away tears and choking up as he spoke, said Friday that \\"our hearts are broken\\" for the families of the victims in the deadly mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. The president, hinting at possible legislation, pledged \\"meaningful action\\" to prevent more killings in the future. The president addressed the tragedy during remarks at the White House Friday afternoon, as details continued to emerge. Authorities say at least 26 people, most of them children, were killed when a gunman clad in black military gear opened fire inside a Connecticut elementary school. The president, who in the past has maintained his composure at such moments no matter the depth of the tragedy at hand, on Friday paused repeatedly, struggling to get through his remarks. The president stopped for several seconds, his eyes welling up, as he discussed the victims. \\"The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old,\\" Obama said. \\"They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.\\" Shortly before speaking, Obama ordered that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff on public grounds through Tuesday. House Speaker John Boehner ordered flags be lowered at the U.S. Capitol. The president said he reacted to the tragedy as a parent. \\"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years, and each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today,\\" Obama said. \\"I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.\\" The shooting quickly stirred questions about whether lawmakers in Washington might pick up the push for stricter gun control. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney brushed off such questions at the briefing, but Obama called for \\"action\\" toward the close of his remarks Friday, citing the frequency with which such mass shootings have occurred. \\"These neighbors are our neighbors, and these children are our children, and we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this -- regardless of the politics,\\" Obama said. Several Democratic lawmakers were also calling Friday for stricter gun control. \\"Our expressions of sympathy must be matched with concrete actions to stop gun violence,\\" Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said. Obama was first briefed on the shooting Friday morning by counterterrorism adviser John Brennan and is continuing to receive regular updates. Obama also spoke with Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy to express his condolences, and offer support. The White House said the FBI is supporting state and local law enforcement officials in Connecticut as they respond to and investigate the incident. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A very sad thing happened in Connecticut where a person with a gun went into a school and hurt many people, mostly young children.

Summarize this article: After the first leg of their play-off finished goalless, Fraser Mullen, for Beath, and Kieran Gibbons, for Kilby, netted in normal time. With no further score after 30 more minutes of play, the hosts scored all five of their spot-kicks. Liam Henderson struck the decisive penalty, keeping Gary Locke's side in Scottish League Two. The home side came flying out of the traps and duly took the lead after just three minutes. There was excellent build-up play down the left involving Robbie Buchannan and Dale Carrick, before Henderson laid the ball off for Mullen. The former Hearts and Hibernian defender drilled a low shot beyond Matthew McGinley in the visiting goal to break the deadlock. The Blue Brazil keep their foot on the gas, and only a magnificent stop by McGinley denied Carrick from doubling the lead. The striker also crashed a header off the crossbar before Kris Renton's deflected volley flew inches wide. East Kilbride slowly eased their way into the game and Joao Victoria, then Sean Winter, came close to a leveller. The Lowland League champions began the second half on the front foot and had claims for a penalty turned down by referee Craig Charleston after the ball appeared to strike the arm of David Syme. The Lanarkshire side's pressure did pay off, though, when the home defence failed to clear their lines, allowing Gibbons to drill the ball along the slippery surface from 25 yards out and find the bottom corner. Neither side were able to strike a knockout blow before normal time expired, and the game East Kilbride's Adam Strachan fired in a deflected 20-yard effort that struck the crossbar on its way over. Both teams looked weary as the rain-soaked pitch began to take its toll. but Cowdenbeath almost snatched a late winner through Craig Johnston, whose effort was tipped over by McGinley. With Mullen, Johnston, Renton and Syme netting spot-kicks for Cowdenbeath, and Strachan, Russell McLean and Victoria replying, it was Jamie Sneddon's save from Paul Woods that proved crucial. The stop gave Henderson the opportunity to seal victory for the Blue Brazil, and the defender duly converted his penalty, preserving Cowden's SPFL status, and consigning East Kilbride to another season of junior football. Cowdenbeath manager Gary Locke: \\"I don't think it's really anything to celebrate. The chairman is a flamboyant character, and when I came to the club, he said, we're in the play-offs, just win them for us. \\"Credit to the players, they've battled really hard over the two games. East Kilbride were fantastic, I certainly feel if they came up they'd be top-four or top-five team in this league. \\"So it was a really difficult two games, it gets to be a bit of a lottery when it goes to penalties, but I'm delighted the club's kept their place in the league, because the consequences of going down would've been pretty tough, I'd have thought.\\" East Kilbride manager Martin Lauchlan: \\"It's devastating - we put so much into the game. We lost a goal early - the worst possible start we could've had - but after that we looked the better team and the more likely to score. \\"I think our fitness levels looked terrific. It's so difficult to get to this point, with so many play-off games, and to get here and lose it is tough. \\"I think they showed in the game they're well capable of playing at this level, but we're bitterly disappointed.\\" Match ends, Cowdenbeath 1(5), East Kilbride 1(3).

David Strohm Jr., a 27-year-old man from Tustin, California, lost his life after climbing a tree in his parents' backyard on Saturday evening. What started as an innocent last climb ended in an electrical accident that cut his life short. According to the Los Angeles Times, Strohm proceeded to climb the tree to snap the perfect shots of the sunset, which he then posted to Facebook at around 6 pm. As the evening progressed and he did not return, concerned friends and relatives began searching for Strohm. They spent the entire night looking for him, even taking the extreme measures of going door-to-door in the neighborhood. It wasn't until the next morning that they received an ominous clue to the whereabouts of Strohm. Underneath the tree he had climbed, his cellphone was discovered on the ground, as reported by the Orange County Register. Upon further investigation, they tragically found Strohm still in the tree, lifeless and leaning against a power line. The exact details of how Strohm came into contact with the power line are still unknown. When firefighters arrived on the scene, they were forced to shut down power to approximately 20 homes in the area in order to safely retrieve and bring down Strohm's body. The situation highlights the grave danger electricity poses and serves as a reminder for everyone to exercise caution around such hazards. David Strohm Jr. was described by neighbors and family as a \\"nice kid\\" who enjoyed helping his family and neighbors. The Strohm family lived together in the Tustin home, with David residing there along with his mother and stepfather. His father was also present, witnessing the heart-wrenching scene as his son's body was taken down from the tree. As questions continue to emerge and the community grieves for the loss of Strohm, authorities remind everyone of the critical importance of safety around electrical power lines. An Orange County firefighter involved in the incident emphasized this by stating, \\"Our message is: stay away. Electricity is so dangerous.\\" The tragic passing of David Strohm Jr. serves as a somber reminder of the risks associated with electrical hazards, even for something as innocent as capturing the beauty of nature. Lessons learned from this unfortunate event must encourage a greater awareness of electrical safety. It is essential for individuals to educate themselves about the potential dangers in their environment and understand the need for extreme caution around power lines and other electrical equipment. In memory of David Strohm Jr., it is important to honor his love for nature and photography and ensure that his tragic death serves as a wake-up call to others. Prioritizing safety and raising awareness of the potential dangers associated with everyday activities like climbing trees must prevent further loss of life in such devastating circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

M. Lower Should I validate this answer? Possible answers: * No. * Yes. The answer is:","output":"No, the suggested answer does not accurately address the question about the major economic activities of the early Canadians. Instead, it focuses on prominent English Canadian historians. A more appropriate answer to the question would be: The major economic activities of the early Canadians were primarily based on natural resources and agriculture. Early Canadians engaged in the fur trade, which was a significant economic driver during the 17th and 18th centuries. This trade heavily relied on the Indigenous peoples' skill and knowledge in hunting and trapping. Additionally, the fishing industry, particularly cod fishing, was vital to the economy of coastal areas, such as those in present-day Newfoundland and Labrador. Agriculture was another significant economic activity for early Canadians. Settlers cultivated various crops and engaged in livestock farming, particularly in regions with fertile soil, like the St. Lawrence River valley. The abundance of forests allowed for a thriving lumber industry, which supplied materials for shipbuilding and export to European markets. As the population grew and urban centers developed, manufacturing industries began to emerge, mainly to meet the demand for domestic goods, such as textiles and metal products. Over time, transportation, communication, and infrastructure improvements facilitated the expansion of trade and contributed to further economic growth in Canada. In conclusion, the major economic activities of the early Canadians included fur trade, fishing, agriculture, lumber industry, and gradually expanding manufacturing sectors."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Originating in Central Asia, the Sarmatians started their westward migration around the 6th century bc, coming to dominate the closely related Scythians by the 2nd century bc. The Sarmatians differed from the Scythians in their veneration of the god of fire rather than god of nature, and their women's prominent role in warfare, which possibly served as the inspiration for the Amazons. At their greatest reported extent, around 1st century AD, these tribes ranged from the Vistula River to the mouth of the Danube and eastward to the Volga, bordering the shores of the Black and Caspian seas as well as the Caucasus to the south. Their territory, which was known as Sarmatia to Greco-Roman ethnographers, corresponded to the western part of greater Scythia .

The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe.

You’ll be sharing a room with multiple people who might snore loudly or come back to the room very late at night. If this type of late-night activity is likely to wake you up, you’ll need to have earplugs and a sleeping mask to be able to get a restful night’s sleep in a hostel.

Accuses academies of profiteering from junk food vending machines. Education Secretary Michael Gove says he trusts headteachers to make the right choices. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Critical Issue of Nutrition in Schools: The Controversy Surrounding Healthy Eating Guidelines and Junk Food Profiteering Famed chef Jamie Oliver has once again put the spotlight on the critical issue of food and nutrition in schools, raising important questions about the efficacy of current healthy eating guidelines. He argues that allowing schools to opt-out of these regulations is leading to a significant decrease in the nutritional levels among youngsters. Using his strong culinary platform, Oliver has constantly bubbled over with passion for revolutionizing school meals. Known for his concerted efforts against the proliferation of unhealthy food in school environments, the latest crusade pits him against the academies that are gaining significantly from vending machines stocked with junk food. The chief concern raised by Oliver is that these establishments are profiteering – that is, making an undue profit from an unmerited source – from these vending machines. Filled with high-sugar, high-salt, and fat-laden snacks, these machines are a tempting option for students and a financial boon for academies. However, they pose a grave threat to the health of our children, contributing to rising rates of obesity, childhood diabetes and other diet-related health issues. While healthy eating guidelines are in place to ensure that children receive balanced meals at schools, there’s currently a legal loophole exposing many academies and free schools to override these edicts. Oliver suggests that this option to opt-out contributes directly to the degradation of the nutritional intake of youngsters. In contradiction to Oliver’s arguments, Education Secretary Michael Gove has expressed his faith in headteachers' discretion. He believes that school leaders are best equipped to make the right decisions for their students’ nutritional welfare. Gove's standpoint implies trust in the autonomous judgement of each headteacher to balance the financial benefits of vending machines with the health implications. The controversy hence lies between strict adherence to the nutrition guidelines or providing academies with the autonomy to choose what best fits their circumstances. Developing an approach that provides the necessary balance is a challenging task. Stricter regulation could indeed secure a higher nutritional standard in schools while possibly straining their finances or undermining their autonomy.  Meanwhile, giving schools the discretion to decide could result in lowered nutritional standards, risking the health and wellbeing of children under the guise of profiteering.  This conflict urges a critical revaluation of the existing guidelines. Striking a balance between the nutritional health of students, the financial independence of schools, and the autonomy of school leaders in shaping their institution is much needed. It is clear that beyond just guidelines, there is a need for a comprehensive strategy, ensuring that schools provide nutritious meals without compromising on their financial health. Jamie Oliver's advocacy for nutritional reform in schools provides an essential push for this issue to be addressed more seriously. It underscores the immediate need for collaboration among educators, policymakers, dieticians, and chefs like Oliver himself, to ensure that the nutrition and health of our future generations are not compromised. Education Secretary Michael Gove’s trust in headteacher’s autonomy also raises the important question of how we can empower our educators to make smart decisions regarding nutrition. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding healthy eating guidelines and junk food profiteering among academies is a noteworthy concern that deserves critical attention. A fair solution needs to be sought – one that incorporates the importance of nutritional health in schools, respects the autonomy of academies, but without allowing a platform for profiteering at the expense of our children’s health."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

And they have yet to analyse satellite images of the region in which the most famous Himalayan peak - Everest - is located. However, there continues to be debate over exactly how tall Everest is. \\"The primary stretch that had its height dropped is a 80-100km stretch of the Langtang Himal (to the northwest of the capital, Kathmandu),\\" said Richard Briggs, a research geologist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Langtang range is the region where many locals and trekkers are still missing, presumed dead, after the avalanches and landslides that were triggered by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April. Scientists believe the height of a handful of other Himalayan peaks, including the Ganesh Himal to the west of the Langtang range, may also have dropped. The satellite images they have analysed so far have focused on central Nepal, which was the hardest hit by the quake. Everest is to the east of this main shaking zone. Scientists say whether or not the world's highest peak saw a change in its height by few centimetres will have to be further confirmed by ground survey and GPS or an airborne mission. \\"But what we see in the data that we evaluated further away from the plate boundary, to the north of the capital Kathmandu, is a clearly identifiable region with subsidence of up to 1.5m,\\" says Christian Minet, a geologist with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), which processed the Nepal earthquake data sent by the Sentinel-1a satellite. Scientists with DLR's Earth Observation Centre of compared two separate images of the same region sent by the satellite, before and after the quake. \\"The positive value we have received (from the satellite image) after the quake means the area (the mountains in and around the Langtang region) is further away from the satellite and it is lower now,\\" said Mr Minet. \\"But with this result we cannot say that a specific mountain is one-point-something-metres lower; it is the general area that we can assess.\\" He said the satellite images showed the area of the mountain range had dropped by 0.7m-1.5m. The study has also found that areas including the capital, Kathmandu, to the south of the Himalayan mountains have been uplifted by the quake. \\"The negative value we have received from the acquisitions of the before and after earthquake images means that some areas (Kathmandu and its surroundings) are now closer to the satellite, and that means they have seen an uplift,\\" says Mr Minet. Scientists say the drop and the uplift are normal geological behaviour during an earthquake of this scale. \\"The fault underneath Kathmandu has slipped and it's moved the overriding part of the crust to the south towards the southern end of the part that squashes the crust; and to the northern end it stretches it,\\" says Tim Wright, professor of satellite geodesy at the University of Leeds. \\"From where it is squashed, which is more or less underneath Kathmandu, we get uplift. And where it stretches, which is in the high mountains to the north of Kathmandu in this case, we get subsidence. \\"The biggest amount of slip on the fault was actually just north of Kathmandu, so it's the mountains north of Kathmandu that have subsided the most in this particular case.\\" Normally, the Himalayas are on the rise because of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. But during major earthquakes the process gets reversed, experts say. \\"Between earthquake events, Nepal is being squashed and the part (including Kathmandu) nearest the big fault underneath it is being dragged down by the Indian plate, and [areas] further back are being lifted up as you imagine squashing something is going to push things up,\\" says Prof Wright. \\"Now, during the earthquake itself what happens is the opposite. The part that was dragged down because it was stuck at the fault - that slips freely and rebounds up, and the part that was being squashed upwards drops down.\\" Authorities in Nepal say they are yet to assess the impacts of the earthquake on the Himalayas as they are still occupied with rescue and rehabilitation after the devastating earthquake. This article was about:","output":"The article talks about how a big earthquake in Nepal made some big mountains like Everest go down a little bit.

Q:Information:  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Mathias Woo Yan Wai ( Chinese :  ; born 1968 ) is a cultural worker in the cross-media discipline in Hong Kong , with creative works ranging from theatre and multi-media design , to cultural policy research and analysis , art education , architectural design and screenplay writing .

Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe.  - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory.  - In European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics or beauty, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function, such as pottery or most metalwork.  - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - The Pearl River Delta (PRD), also known as Zhujiang Delta or Zhusanjiao, is the low-lying area surrounding the Pearl River estuary, where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea. It is one of the most densely urbanised regions in the world and is an economic hub of China. This region is often considered an emerging megacity. The PRD is a megalopolis, with future development into a single mega metropolitan area, yet itself is at the southern end of a larger megalopolis running along the southern coast of China, which include metropolises such as Chaoshan, Zhangzhou-Xiamen, Quanzhou-Putian, and Fuzhou. The nine largest cities of PRD had a combined population of 57.15 million at the end of 2013, comprising 53.69% of the provincial population. According to the World Bank Group, the PRD has become the largest urban area in the world in both size and population.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.  - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek  (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from  (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\").  - Stagecraft is the technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it is primarily the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision.  - A performance, in the performing arts, generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. Usually the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand. Afterwards audience members often applaud.  - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.

Article: Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants  to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize  \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end. Question: The writer of this passage seems to hold the opinion that   _  .

The answer to the question: Whose piece is now called the Festive Symphony? is inside the article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech..., can you guess it ?

I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I’d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take. For the fun one…My friend was turning 50 and she wanted a theme destination celebration. 18 of us went to Belize. She went all out. Two private villas that you could only access by boat, all the swag you can imagine. And plenty of booze. That alone is already a super special vacation but for me it had even more meaning.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: From hitting the mall with your girl friends on a Saturday afternoon, to holiday spending on gifts that go under the tree, shopping could be called one of America's favorite pastimes. For most people, it means some new clothes for work or a small trinket for a friend. For others, however, shopping is much more than an enjoyable pastime, and in some cases, it is a real and destructive addiction that can turn into a financial disaster. Compulsive shopping and spending are defined as inappropriate, excessive, and out of control. Like other addictions, it basically has something to do with impulsiveness and lack of control over one's impulses. In America, shopping is embedded in our culture; so often, the impulsiveness comes out as excessive shopping. Sometimes this is referred to as \\"shopholism\\". Shopping addiction can damage a person's life, family, and finances. \\"No one knows what causes addictive behaviors, like shopping, alcoholism, drug abuse, and gambling\\", says a professor of applied health science. Some of the new evidence suggests that some people, maybe 10%-15%, may have a genetic predisposition to an addictive behavior, coupled with an environment in which the particular behavior is triggered, but no one really knows why.\\" Individuals will get some kind of high from an addictive behavior like shopping. What are the telltale signs that shopping has crossed the line and become and addiction? What should a concerned family member or friend look out for when they think shopping has become a problem? The behaviors can signal a serious problem: *Shopping or spending money as a result of feeling angry, depressed, anxious, or lonely *Having arguments with others about one's shopping habits *Feeling lost without credit cards -- actually going into withdrawal without them *Buying items on credit, rather than with cash *Describing a rush or a feeling of euphoria with spending *Feeling guilty, ashamed, or embarrassed after a spending spree  *Thinking obsessively about money *Spending a lot time juggling accounts...

He is the son of Carol (nee Lutz) and Warren Elliott Norquist (a vice president of Polaroid Corporation), and is of Swedish ancestry. His brother, David Norquist has served in senior posts in Republican administrations at both the United States Department of Defense and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Norquist became involved with politics at an early age when he volunteered for the 1968 Nixon campaign, assisting with get out the vote efforts. Norquist is best known for founding Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) in 1985, which he says was done at the request of then-President Ronald Reagan. Referring to Norquist's activities as head of ATR, Steve Kroft, in a 60 Minutes episode that aired on November 20, 2011, claimed that \\"Norquist has been responsible, more than anyone else, for rewriting the dogma of the Republican Party.\\"  The primary policy goal of Americans for Tax Reform is to reduce government revenues as a percentage of the GDP. ATR states that it \\"opposes all tax increases as a matter of principle.\\" Americans for Tax Reform has supported Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) legislation and transparency initiatives, while opposing cap-and-trade legislation and efforts to regulate health care.  In 1993, Norquist launched his Wednesday Meeting series at ATR headquarters, initially to help fight President Clinton's healthcare plan. The meeting eventually became one of the most significant institutions in American conservative political organizing.

To combine them, subtract 24*a from 2*a: 2*a - 24*a = -22*a Now the equation looks like this: -66 = -22*a Next, we need to isolate 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by -22: -66 / -22 = (-22*a) / -22 Which simplifies to: 3 = a So, the solution to the given equation -66 = 2*a - 24*a is a = 3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gay man left paralyzed in vicious New Glasgow attack The friends and family of a man who was stabbed in a vicious attack in New Glasgow, N.S., leaving him paralyzed, say they believe he was targeted because he's gay. New Glasgow police said a 27-year-old man was airlifted to Halifax hospital with critical injuries Saturday morning after police discovered the victim lying on a downtown street after he was stabbed. Police were on a routine patrol shortly before 2:30 a.m. local time when they saw a man on the ground near the intersection of Archimedes Street and Forbes Street. After closer inspection they saw that the man was stabbed. Amy Punke said she and a group of friends, including her 27-year-old roommate Scott Jones, were out celebrating the opening of a friend's art studio. She said the group decided to leave one bar and go to another. She went on ahead and did not witness the attack. Scott Jones, 27, was stabbed twice in the back leaving him paralyzed after a vicious attack early Saturday morning in New Glasgow, N.S. (Courtesy of Amy Punke) “He was walking with a friend and two men, who had previously been at the bar we were at, came running across the street. One of the men distracted Scott’s friend and the other man stabbed Scott twice in the back and tried to slit his throat,” she said. The injury to Jones' throat was superficial, said Punke, but the stabbing severed Jones’ spinal cord leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. According to Punke — who has been speaking to Jones and has been by his side in hospital — when one of the attackers grabbed the victim, he whispered something in his ear before stabbing him. Jones told Punke he doesn't remember what the man said. She said she doesn’t know why anyone would want to hurt Jones. “Myself, and his family and the people that know him, we feel that he may have been targeted because of the fact that he’s gay — and he’s openly gay in town,” said Punke. She said Jones is very well known in New Glasgow. “He’s a musician and he’s very open about his sexuality in that he encourages conversation. In fact just two days ago we were talking about him going to high schools and junior high and talking to teens that are afraid of coming out. Just the nature of the evening and the people that we were with and the fact that he was targeted out of all of us,” said Punke. Jones was taken to Aberdeen Hospital but then was airlifted to the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre in Halifax. Police said the victim remains in critical but stable condition.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the man who was the brother of John, 2nd Earl Brownlow?  Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line. The owners of Belton are buried in the village of Belton's parish church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer Richard Brownlow (1555–1638), and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899–1978). The owners of Belton House have been: Sir John Brownlow I (1594–1679) Bequeathed Belton to his great-nephew John Brownlow II. Sir John Brownlow II (1659–1697).

Q:Background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Paragraph: Sand mining in the north coastal region was stopped 20 years ago, but it still continues to this day in the south region. Both fishing communities there are still prosperous, but the southern one had a couple of bad years, with fish and other marine wildlife becoming more scarce. The southern beach had erosion problems as well. The northern beach recovered, and is suitable for tourism.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which region has a less coral riffs? A:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, it can be inferred that the southern region has less coral reefs compared to the northern region. This conclusion can be drawn from the information that the southern region is still facing sand mining activities, which leads to an increase in water turbidity. The disturbance of underwater and coastal sand negatively affects the marine ecosystem and organisms that require sunlight, such as coral reefs. On the other hand, sand mining has stopped in the northern coastal region 20 years ago, which allowed the beach to recover and become suitable for tourism, suggesting that the coral reefs in the northern region are less affected and potentially more abundant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the domestic front, he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege. He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President, Richard Nixon. He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security. He also launched the Interstate Highway System, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act, and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What sort of conservative was Eisenhower?","output":"Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, can be described as a moderate conservative. As a moderate conservative, he sought to preserve and continue certain policies and institutions from the past, but he also embraced change and innovation when necessary for the betterment of the nation. Eisenhower's conservative values were evident in his adherence to principles such as limited government intervention, fiscal responsibility, and the importance of a strong national defense. However, unlike some other conservatives of his time, he was pragmatic and open to the idea of the government playing a somewhat larger role in certain areas of public life, especially those that promoted national security, economic growth, or societal progress. Continuation of New Deal agencies: Eisenhower believed in maintaining the stability and continuity of the country, which is why he continued to support the New Deal agencies initiated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Instead of dismantling these agencies, he sought to manage them more efficiently and effectively. Expansion of Social Security: While some conservative politicians sought to limit or even eliminate social welfare programs, Eisenhower expanded Social Security. This action served as an example of his pragmatic and flexible approach to governance, as he recognized the value of the program in providing support to vulnerable populations. Interstate Highway System: The establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the United States under Eisenhower's administration demonstrated his willingness to balance his conservative principles with the need for progress and modern infrastructure. This ambitious project, which required significant federal investment, helped to facilitate economic growth and strengthen the nation's defense capabilities. National Defense Education Act: Similarly, Eisenhower's investment in education through the National Defense Education Act reflected his belief in the importance of a well-educated population for national security and prosperity. This legislation provided funding for higher education, particularly in the areas of mathematics, science, and foreign languages. Peaceful use of nuclear power: Eisenhower's amendments to the Atomic Energy Act encouraged the peaceful use of nuclear technology in areas such as energy production. This approach exhibited his pragmatic conservatism by balancing the potential dangers of nuclear proliferation with the benefits it could bring to society. In summary, President Dwight D. Eisenhower can be characterized as a moderate conservative who blended traditional conservative values with a willingness to embrace change and innovation when necessary for the overall welfare of the nation. His presidency saw a continuation of New Deal policies, expansion of social programs, and investment in education and infrastructure, all while maintaining his commitment to fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Egypt's president says comments he made more than two years ago that are being criticized as anti-Semitic were taken out of context, Egypt's official news agency reported Wednesday. President Mohamed Morsy said the statements, made in 2010, were about Israeli aggression against Palestinians in Gaza, not about the Jewish people, according to a statement published in Egypt News. U.S. senators visiting Cairo on Wednesday confronted him about the comments, according to one of the senators. \\"In our meeting with President Morsy, we voiced our strong disapproval of statements he made a few years ago that have recently surfaced,\\" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in a written statement. \\"We had a constructive discussion on this subject. We leave it to the president to make any further comments on this matter that he may wish.\\" The","output":"controversy around President Morsy's comments has raised concerns about the future of Egypt's relationship with Israel and the United States, as well as the issue of anti-Semitism in the region. According to the Middle East Monitor, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called the 2010 statements \\"deeply disturbing\\" and urged Morsy to retract his remarks and demonstrate his commitment to peace and tolerance. Various political and religious leaders have also weighed in on the matter, with some condemning the president's comments as harmful to regional stability, while others have defended Morsy's right to express his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some analysts have argued that the Egyptian president's previous affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, a group often accused of promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, may have influenced his controversial remarks. In an effort to address the situation and ease tensions, Egypt's government has initiated diplomatic efforts to clarify the president's position, reassuring both Israel and the United States that Cairo is committed to maintaining peace agreements and fostering a spirit of cooperation in the region. Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials have highlighted the progress made in recent negotiations with Israel, particularly in areas such as border security and counter-terrorism efforts. In response to the senators' concerns, Morsy's press secretary released a statement clarifying the president's position on the matter. \\"President Morsy reaffirms that he strongly believes in religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence among all people of the world,\\" the statement read. \\"The comments expressed in 2010 were specifically targeting Israel's actions against Palestinians in Gaza and should not be interpreted as a reflection of his views towards the Jewish community.\\" The Egyptian leader has acknowledged the need for improved communication and reiterated his commitment to engage in open dialogue with the international community. President Morsy has pledged to work closely with the U.S. and other allies in the region to address shared concerns, including the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, the ongoing civil war in Syria, and the fight against terrorism. Nonetheless, critics argue that concrete actions must be taken by the Egyptian president in order to demonstrate his commitment to religious tolerance and regional stability. Some suggest the need for Egypt to take on a stronger role in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promoting bilateral agreements, while others propose the implementation of domestic policies that expressly protect the rights of religious and ethnic minorities in the country. The recent episode involving President Morsy's comments highlights the importance of responsible political discourse and the need for leaders to choose their words carefully, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics such as religious tensions and the complex dynamics of the Middle East. As Egypt continues to navigate its new role on the global stage following the 2011 revolution and the establishment of a civilian government, it will be crucial for President Morsy and his administration to foster an environment of trust, respect, and open dialogue with their international partners, in order to address pressing regional challenges and work towards a more peaceful and prosperous future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70).

A:","output":"The painting that possibly influenced \\"The Swimming Hole\\" is \\"Scène d'été\\" created in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is suggested that Thomas Eakins might have seen Bazille's painting at the Salon during his time in Europe, which could have inspired the composition and theme of \\"The Swimming Hole.\\" Both paintings depict a group of male figures enjoying leisurely activities in a natural setting, highlighting themes of camaraderie and appreciation for the male form."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Instructions: In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) evolved into one of the most successful unsupervised techniques for generating realistic images. Even though it has recently been shown that GAN training converges, GAN models often end up in local Nash equilibria that are associated with mode collapse or otherwise fail to model the target distribution. We introduce Coulomb GANs, which pose the GAN learning problem as a potential field, where generated samples are attracted to training set samples but repel each other. The discriminator learns a potential field while the generator decreases the energy by moving its samples along the vector (force) field determined by the gradient of the potential field. Through decreasing the energy, the GAN model learns to generate samples according to the whole target distribution and does not only cover some of its modes. We prove that Coulomb GANs possess only one Nash equilibrium which is optimal in the sense that the model distribution equals the target distribution. We show the efficacy of Coulomb GANs on LSUN bedrooms, CelebA faces, CIFAR-10 and the Google Billion Word text generation. Output:","output":"Coulomb GANs approach learning as a potential field, attracting generated samples to training set samples while repelling each other, resulting in improved modeling of the target distribution and preventing mode collapse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Ristar, released as in Japan, is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis, which released worldwide in February 1995. A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, \\"Ristar\\", was also released, which shared similar themes, while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics.  - Softdisk is a software and Internet company based in Shreveport, Louisiana. Founded in 1981, its original products were disk magazines (which they termed \\"magazettes\\", for \\"magazine on diskette\\"). They were affiliated and partly owned by paper magazine \\"Softalk\\" at their founding, but survived its demise.  - John D. Carmack (born August 20, 1970) is an American game programmer, aerospace and virtual reality engineer. He co-founded id Software. Carmack was the lead programmer of the id video games \\"Commander Keen\\", \\"Wolfenstein 3D\\", \\"Doom\\", \\"Quake\\", \\"Rage\\" and their sequels. Carmack is best known for his innovations in 3D graphics, such as his famous Carmack's Reverse algorithm for shadow volumes, and is also a rocketry enthusiast and the founder and lead engineer of Armadillo Aerospace. In August 2013, Carmack took the position of CTO at Oculus VR, which in 2014 became a subsidiary of Facebook.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - id Software LLC (formerly id Software, Inc., ; see Company name) is an American video game developer headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company Softdisk, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, game designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack (no relation to John Carmack). Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved.  - A disk magazine, colloquially known as a diskmag or diskzine, is a magazine that is distributed in electronic form to be read using computers. These had some popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as periodicals distributed on floppy disk, hence their name. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s caused them to be superseded almost entirely by online publications, which are sometimes still called \\"diskmags\\" despite the lack of physical disks.  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre.  - Shadow Knights is a platform game created by id Software and published by Softdisk in 1991 .

Both a Louisiana citizen affiliated with the Louisiana Democratic Party and the American Democracy Legal Fund filed complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics on Wednesday alleging that Cassidy's work for the university violates multiple ethics rules and guidelines and calling for an investigation. The ADLF complaint, obtained by CNN, alleges that Cassidy failed to receive required approval from the Ethics Committee to engage in teaching activities from 2011-2014.

Yes; The answer is:","output":"1). No; A more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question \\"What state was the Civil War in?\\" would be: The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, took place in several states throughout the United States. The war was primarily fought between two sides – the Union, which was made up of states that remained loyal to the federal government, and the Confederacy, which was made up of states that seceded from the Union to form their own government due to their support for the institution of slavery and other differences. The war was not confined to a single state, as battles and significant events occurred in numerous states across the country. Before the Civil War began, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederate States of America: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. These states seceded from the Union in the period between President Abraham Lincoln's election in November 1860 and his inauguration on March 4, 1861. Lincoln's opposition to the extension of slavery into the western territories was among the main reasons for their secession. Four additional states – Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina – seceded following the start of the war in April 1861, when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina. The 11 Confederate states formed the core of the Southern rebellion, while the Union consisted of 20 free states and 5 border states. The Civil War saw many significant battles and skirmishes in various states, including landmark battles such as the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, the Battle of Antietam in Maryland, and the Battle of Bull Run in Virginia. Additionally, many states experienced smaller but still important battles, guerrilla warfare, and other military engagements throughout the course of the war. In conclusion, the American Civil War was not restricted to one specific state; rather, it was a conflict that spanned several regions throughout the United States. The statement \\"Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question, as it fails to fully explain the complexity and scope of the war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field?, using the article: Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It has an elevation of 2,162 m (7,093 ft) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining products from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.Pali Dome, located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Like Cauldron Dome, it consists of two geological units. Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material. It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield. Much of the lava flows form..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field is Pali Dome. This volcano, which is located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is a significantly eroded structure and constitutes an important part of the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Pali Dome, similar to Cauldron Dome, is composed of two geological units and is largely made up of andesite lava flows and small quantities of pyroclastic material. Like Mount Fee, which lies to the southeast of Mount Cayley, Pali Dome showcases signs of significant erosion. However, the lava flows and pyroclastic remnants found in Pali Dome specifically point towards the explosive volcanic activity that it has witnessed in the past. Despite extensive erosion and the passage of geological time, the physical attributes of the Pali Dome provide invaluable insights into its volcanic history. Its exact age and the timeline of volcanic events it has experienced might be undisclosed, but it clearly forms a part of the older geological features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. In conclusion, the eroded volcano in question in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field is Pali Dome, which serves as a distinct landmark just like Mount Fee, contributing to the varied geological history and landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What was Dr Frank Harte reaction to James? Movie title: Calvary Movie plot: The film Calvary is a parable of the betrayal of the Irish people by the Irish Catholic Church.Context for the story: The Irish Catholic Church which was a pillar of, and defined Ireland's soul has been revealed to have consciously and methodically covered up institutional atrocities perpetrated by themselves.Set in rural Ireland, the film begins in a confessional where Father James Lavelle (Brendan Gleeson) is taking confession. The voice on the other side speaks, \\"I was seven the first time I tasted semen\\". \\"Certainly a startling opening line\\", Father James replies. The voice asks if he's being ironic. Father James takes a more serious tone. The voice tells him that he was molested both orally and anally by a priest when he was seven and he bled a lot. Father James asks if he would like to report the priest. The voice says that the priest died a long time ago and that it didn't matter. \\"Killing a bad priest isn't a big deal, but if you kill a good priest, people take notice\\". The voice says he's going to kill Father James in seven days on the beach.James lives a very simple life. He sleeps in a small room with a bed and his only two possessions are his crucifix and his dog. He takes walks on the beach and interacts with the town people. On the beach, he sees his altar server is drawing a landscape. In it there are two figures. James asks who they are and the boy says he doesn't know, but he has been having a lot of dreams about ghosts lately.After mass, Father James is speaking with Father Leary (David Wilmot) who is gossiping about the townsfolk, sharing information he's heard in confession and making racially inappropriate comments about Simon (Isaach De Bankole) the only black man in the town. Father James doesn't say a word about the threat on his life.James' daughter Fiona (Kelly Reilly) comes to town to lay low after a botched suicide attempt. The townsfolk didn't know it was possible for a Catholic priest to have a daughter. James explains that he became a priest after his wife died. The locals in... The answer is:","output":"In the movie Calvary, Dr. Frank Harte (played by actor Aidan Gillen) is introduced initially as a cynical, atheist doctor who is disrespectful towards Father James. Despite the angst and tension between the two characters, Harte plays a crucial role as he interestingly provides a confrontational and skeptical perspective on the church and its teachings. It’s essential to clarify the dynamic between Dr. Frank Harte and Father James. Their interactions are defined by frank, straightforward dialogs, challenging the faith and suffering that Father James represents. In the context of the film, Dr. Harte serves a potent role, embodying the skepticism, doubt, and anger towards the church, especially considering the backdrop of the church's betrayal of Irish society. Given his profession as a doctor, Harte represents a more scientific, rational viewpoint on life, which profoundly contrasts with Father James's religious, faith-based perspective. Frequently, he pushes the boundaries of propriety and respect, as his disbelief and skepticism towards Father James's faith manifest in bitter, cutting sarcasm. This gap between their viewpoints spurs dynamic conversational exchanges that fuel the narrative. Specifically, Dr. Harte's reaction to Father James is ambivalent and complex. On one hand, he openly mocks and challenges Father James, displaying contempt for his faith. He relatively lacks reverence for the church, considering his personal beliefs and the overarching narrative of the church's penetration in Ireland. But on the other hand, Harte never attempts to take physical action against Father James, which might suggest a confusing sense of respect or at least tolerance for Father James as an individual, if not for the institution he represents. The scene where Dr. Harte draws a comparison between the church and his profession, claiming doctors are moving towards obsoleteness with reference to the increasing irrelevance of the church in modern society, is demonstrative of his complex relationship with Father James. His acknowledgment that they both might be remnants of a past era distinctively captures the layered relationship between these characters rooted in skepticism and an unavoidable understanding. Considering investing in the film proposal based on the relationship between Dr. Harte and Father James, it's pivotal to recognize their interaction's intensity and depth. The characters' contrasting outlooks incite profound questions about faith, guilt, redemption, and the role of the church in society, fostering thoughtful and engaging content for audiences, a pointer to a potentially successful film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Superpowers HQ | The Sun |Features Inside the imposing, hotel-sized building workmen put the finishing touches to a series of rooms packed with space-age equipment aimed at boosting the \\"superpower\\" of its users. It may sound like something from Tom Cruise's next film Mission: Impossible 4, but this is the latest venture of the Church of Scientology, which has the Hollywood superstar as its most famous devotee. Cruise is expected to attend the grand opening of what is known as The Super Power Building, which has nearly 900 rooms and has taken more than 13 years to build at a cost of £50million. Fellow film stars John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are also expected to be there. The building in Clearwater, Florida, has been shrouded in secrecy since its foundations were first laid. And when The Sun tried to find out about the imposing structure, it turned out to be Mission: Impossible. Within minutes of arriving outside the entrance a security guard stepped out from behind a blacked-out door to monitor us. Somebody's watching ... cult security guard takes pictures of The Sun's men in Florida Moments later another guard on a mountain bike peddled up and asked what we were doing. He wore a white shirt and black trousers, the uniform adopted by many Scientology staff. Later, yet another security guard began filming us before ducking behind a tree when we trained our camera on him. Attempts to find out what will happen in the Super Power Building were met with silence by officials. The veil of secrecy does not surprise experts who have followed the religion since it was founded by the late science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard in 1952. Someone who has spoken to dozens of former members, said: \\"Scientology claims not to be a cult but all they do gives that impression. They don't like people snooping around what they are doing.\\" A series of alleged artists' impressions of the interior that were leaked on to the net have revealed NASA-like training gizmos that will be used to help devotees of the religion to boost their so-called \\"theta powers\\". The building houses an ANTI-GRAVITY SIMULATOR central to boosting devotees' mental abilities. Users are strapped blindfolded into the machine which spins around and is said to aid perception of direction. Other rooms contain a VIDEO SCREEN that moves back and forwards while flashing up images. It is said to help users enhance their ability to spot subliminal messages. The centrepiece of the 12-storey building is the sixth-floor INDOOR RUNNING TRACK the length of the structure, which is kept in semi-darkness. Hi-tech ... artist's impression of a training machine at the new Scientology building in Florida An insider said Scientology worshippers will be encouraged to run until they are close to exhaustion and their mind freed of painful memories. The highly secret Super Power course was developed by Hubbard and is said to boost a person's perceptions or senses through mental and physical exercises. Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell, we all have 57 extra \\"abilities\\". These include being able to sense blood circulation, balance and know compass direction, temperature and gravity as well as have an \\"awareness of importance, unimportance\\". Almost half the building's 889 rooms will be used to carry out \\"audits\\"  the Scientology term for counselling sessions. Auditing is a cornerstone of the religion, which all members must undergo. It is said that a museum dedicated to Hubbard will be on the ground floor, plus murals depicting famous moments in Scientology's history. The Super Power Building is connected by a walkway to a luxury hotel, Fort Harrison, used as a retreat exclusively by Scientology members. The hotel is also ringed by CCTV cameras and security guards hover at the entrance. Both Pulp Fiction star Travolta and Alley, best known for TV's Cheers, are regular visitors. Tom Cruise has also spent time at Fort Harrison. The Top Gun star is by far the most high-profile of the estimated eight million who follow the Church of Scientology worldwide. Followers ... Kirstie Alley, Tom Cruise and Juliette Lewis Cruise has helped raise hundreds of thousands towards it. He joined the religion in the late Eighties. Other celeb followers include actor Will Smith, Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie, actress Juliette Lewis and My Name Is Earl star Jason Lee. Cruise rarely talks in public about his devotion but he has appeared at many official functions. Insiders say he is second in command to Scientology leader David Miscavige in all but name. The Super Power Building's £50million costs were met by followers, but Cruise's name does not appear on a list of donors leaked by ex-members. Kirstie Alley is reported to have donated more than £160,000. Scientology's main headquarters in Britain is in Saint Hill, West Sussex, but quiet Gulf Coast town Clearwater  a popular spot for Brits after they have visited Orlando's Disney World  has become ground zero for the religion. The building is expected to draw many more Scientologists to the area. Over the past two decades the church has become the largest single property owner in Clearwater. Futuristic ... cutting edge design at the new Scientology building Many residents resent the takeover but are afraid to speak out. \\"They have such an imposing presence that no one wants to say anything against them,\\" said one local. \\"You hear so many stories about harassment of people who dare to speak out against them.\\" Nancy Beckman, 78, who runs a Christian Science Reading room close to the Super Power Building, said: \\"I call them the ants. All you see are lots of people wearing black and white scurrying around. I have nothing against them but they are secretive. A lot of people do not feel secure around them.\\" She said visitors to Clearwater were \\"mesmerised\\" by the Super Power Building. \\"Clearwater is the training ground for Scientology and they are here to stay,\\" she said. Another resident, who would not be named, said Scientology is nothing more than a cult. \\"Most people follow the teachings of religious scripts, Scientologists follow those of a failed science fiction writer,\\" they said. \\"That tells you all you need to know about their church.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the Church of Scientology's Super Power Building located in Clearwater, Florida.

Process:  - A sperm and egg meet inside a woman&#x27;s fallopian tube - The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus - The zygote implants in the uterus - The zygote becomes an embryo - The embryo becomes a fetus - The fetus grows for approximately 9 months - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby grows into a child - The child becomes an adult - The adult mates with another adult -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the egg will not be fertilized happens, how will it affect MORE babies.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of the egg not being fertilized has a direct effect on the process. The process of human reproduction and development is interrupted at the very beginning, ultimately affecting the production of more babies. Here is the step-by-step analysis and justification of the effects of this perturbation: 1. An unfertilized egg cannot create a zygote, as fertilization is the fusion of a sperm and an egg to form a zygote. This means that the entire process would come to a halt at the first step. 2. Since there is no zygote formed, it won't travel to the uterus and won't implant in its wall. This means that steps involving zygote travel and implantation will not take place. 3. As there is no zygote present, it won't develop into an embryo, and subsequently, no fetus will form. This leads to the disruption of the process at steps concerning embryo and fetus development. 4. With no fetus growing inside the womb, the woman will not become pregnant and will not give birth to a baby after approximately nine months. This directly impacts the generation of more babies. 5. Consequently, there will be no baby to grow into a child and, eventually, an adult. The subsequent steps involving baby growth, child development, and adults mating with others for reproduction are affected as well. Overall, the perturbation of the egg not being fertilized directly impacts the process of human reproduction and development by interrupting the initial steps and influencing the subsequent stages. This ultimately leads to fewer babies being born, affecting the overall population and its growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - sore feet - amazement - retrospection - boredom - crowding  The answer is \\"crowding\\" because A:","output":"When visiting a museum with narrow halls, the experience can often lead to \\"crowding\\" due to a number of factors contributing to this overwhelming sensation. However, it is important to note that each individual's experience may differ based on their personal preferences and the specific museum being visited. Firstly, museums with narrow halls typically have limited physical space for visitors to navigate through the exhibits. This creates a constrained environment where people are forced to walk close together, sometimes brushing against each other or even bumping into one another. The limited personal space available can make some feel increasingly uncomfortable or anxious, especially in a world that has become increasingly aware of the importance of personal space for both health and comfort reasons. Secondly, narrow halls can impact the overall visual experience of the museum for visitors as it can be challenging to get a clear view of the exhibits. In these confined spaces, it is often difficult to appreciate or fully comprehend the displayed items from an optimal distance or from multiple angles. This can lead to a less engaging experience in comparison to museums with spacious galleries that allow for a more immersive, balanced interaction with the art or artifacts. Another contributing factor to crowding is the potential concentration of visitors in a particular area or around a popular exhibit. When there is a high demand for viewing a specific exhibit or numerous visitors in a confined area, wait times can increase, and congestion can create bottlenecks that disrupt the flow of movement. The pressure of staying within an allocated time slot and navigating the crowd adds to the stress experienced by the visitors. It is also worth considering that some visitors may feel the need to rush through the museum to avoid the crowded areas, resulting in an inability to fully appreciate and absorb the experience at their own pace. This may lead to a superficial interaction with the displayed items or the inability to retain valuable information presented in the museum. Lastly, the presence of large groups, such as guided tours or school trips, may exacerbate the crowding issue. These groups often move in clusters, taking up even more limited space in the narrow halls, resulting in additional navigational challenges, noise, and increased levels of discomfort for other visitors. In conclusion, visiting a museum with narrow halls might lead to the experience of crowding due to spatial limitations, inadequate viewing opportunities, concentrated visitor clusters, and reduced overall enjoyment. As museums are typically meant to inspire, educate, and provoke reflection, the impact of crowding within narrow halls should be acknowledged and, where possible, addressed by both visitors and museum management in order to optimize the museum experience for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music. is inside the article: In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity...., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music is named Camille Saint-Saëns. He was known for his nontraditional teaching methods when he served as a professor at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, following the death of Louis Niedermeyer. Rather than strictly adhering to the traditional classical music program, Saint-Saëns introduced his students to the works of several contemporary musicians of his time, such as Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner.  His unique approach to teaching music wasn't well received by all his colleagues, which led to some contention. However, this did not deter him from his philosophy of introducing a wider range of musical styles to his students. His philosophy is reflected in the words of his best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, who remembered Saint-Saëns revealing to them the works of masters from whom the rigorous classical nature of their program of study kept them distant.  In addition to teaching, Saint-Saëns was also a composer. He even used his position to organize a farce performed by the students and contributed to it by composing incidental music. The article also mentions his well-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, which he originally conceived with his students in mind. These examples further illustrate the way Saint-Saëns embraced and encouraged creativity and expression, pushing the boundaries of the academic regime.  Despite his proactive approach and his growing reputation as a soloist and composer, Saint-Saëns faced some setbacks. For instance, when he decided to compete a second time for the Prix de Rome in 1864, it was met with surprise, and he was unsuccessful. However, even one of the judges, Berlioz, recognized and regretted having to vote against a man who truly is a great artist. Saint-Saëns' influence on the music world and his timeless impact on his students serves as a testament to his skill and unconventional methods, even in the face of professional adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has initiated a last-ditch diplomatic campaign to avert a confrontation this month over a plan by Palestinians to seek recognition as a state at the United Nations, but it may already be too late, according to senior American officials and foreign diplomats. The administration has circulated a proposal for renewed peace talks with the Israelis in the hopes of persuading the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to abandon the bid for recognition at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly beginning Sept. 20. The administration has made it clear to Mr. Abbas that it will veto any request presented to the United Nations Security Council to make a Palestinian state a new member outright. But the United States does not have enough support to block a vote by the General Assembly to elevate the status of the Palestinians’ nonvoting observer “entity” to that of a nonvoting observer state. The change would pave the way for the Palestinians to join dozens of United Nations bodies and conventions, and it could strengthen their ability to pursue cases against Israel at the International Criminal Court. Senior officials said the administration wanted to avoid not only a veto but also the more symbolic and potent General Assembly vote that would leave the United States and only a handful of other nations in the opposition. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic maneuverings, said they feared that in either case a wave of anger could sweep the Palestinian territories and the wider Arab world at a time when the region is already in tumult. President Obama would be put in the position of threatening to veto recognition of the aspirations of most Palestinians or risk alienating Israel and its political supporters in the United States. “If you put the alternative out there, then you’ve suddenly just changed the circumstances and changed the dynamic,” a senior administration official involved in the flurry of diplomacy said Thursday. “And that’s what we’re trying very much to do.” Efforts to head off the Palestinian diplomatic drive have percolated all summer but have taken on urgency as the vote looms in the coming weeks. “It’s not clear to me how it can be avoided at the moment,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a former Palestinian negotiator who is now executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine in Washington. “An American veto could inflame emotions and bring anti-American sentiment to the forefront across the region.” While some officials remain optimistic that a compromise can be found, the administration has simultaneously begun planning to limit the fallout of a statehood vote. A primary focus is to ensure the Israelis and Palestinians continue to cooperate on security matters in the West Bank and along Israel’s borders, administration officials said. “We’re still focused on Plan A,” another senior administration official said, referring to the diplomatic efforts by the administration’s new special envoy, David M. Hale, and the president’s Middle East adviser on the National Security Council, Dennis B. Ross. Mr. Hale replaced the more prominent George J. Mitchell Jr., who resigned in May after two years of frustrated efforts to make progress on a peace deal. The State Department late last month issued a formal diplomatic message to more than 70 countries urging them to oppose any unilateral moves by the Palestinians at the United Nations. The message, delivered by American ambassadors to their diplomatic counterparts in those countries, argued that a vote would destabilize the region and undermine peace efforts, though those are, at least for now, moribund. Two administration officials said that the intent of the message was to narrow the majority the Palestinians are expected to have in the General Assembly. They said that and the new peace proposal — to be issued in a statement by the Quartet, the diplomatic group focused on the Middle East comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations — could persuade potential supporters to step back from a vote on recognition, and thus force Mr. Abbas to have second thoughts. “The fact is there are countries who would choose not to do that vote if there was an alternative,” the first senior administration official said.

The answer to the question: What species is Sherman's father? is inside the article: Mr. Peabody is a gifted anthropomorphic dog who lives in a penthouse in New York City and raises his adopted human son, 7-year-old Sherman, and tutors him travelling throughout history using the WABAC, a time machine. They visit Marie Antoinette in Versailles during the French Revolution in 1789. Getting caught in the Reign of Terror, Peabody is nearly sent to the guillotine to be executed by Maximilien Robespierre, but escapes with Sherman through the Paris sewers. In the present day, Sherman attends the Susan B. Anthony School on his first day of school. His knowledge of the apocryphal nature of the George Washington cherry-tree anecdote leads to a fight with one of his classmates, a girl named Penny Peterson, in the cafeteria where she treats him like a dog and puts him in a choke hold, humiliating him. Peabody is called in by Principal Purdy as Sherman had bit Penny in retaliation, and also confronted by Ms. Grunion, a Child Protective Services agent, who suspects that Sherman's behavior is due to being raised by a dog and plans to visit to their home to investigate whether he is an unfit parent. Peabody then invites Penny and her parents, Paul and Patty over for dinner to reconcile before Ms. Grunion arrives. Penny calls Sherman a liar for claiming first-hand knowledge of history. Despite Peabody's contrary instructions, Sherman shows Penny the WABAC to show proof and takes her into the past, where she stays in Ancient Egypt in 1332 BCE to marry King Tut. Sherman returns to get Mr. Peabody's help. Peabody hypnotises the Petersons and manages to retrieve Penny., can you guess it ?

Breaking down the given premise, we have two important pieces of information to consider: 1. Both men are wearing similar colors. 2. There is a conversation happening between the two men. The primary premise specifies that both men are wearing similar colors. In the context of the statement \\"A man in red winter clothes talks to another man in red,\\" this implies that both men are wearing some shade of red. Therefore, this part of the statement is consistent with the given premise, as long as these similar colors are red. Next, we need to consider the second part of the statement, which is involving the two men in conversation. Since the given premise does not mention any detail about the conversation, we can assume that there's no contradiction with the statement in this aspect. In conclusion, the statement \\"A man in red winter clothes talks to another man in red\\" can be considered true based on the premise \\"Both men are wearing similar colors,\\" if we ensure that the similar colors are red and if there is indeed a conversation happening between the two men. However, it is important to note that the given premise alone does not directly confirm the truthfulness of the statement, but it does not contradict it either. To definitively confirm the truthfulness of the statement, further clarification regarding the specific color they are wearing (red) and the existence of the conversation would be required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Learn from your failures and keep moving forward even when you face setbacks. 8. Participate in competitions or auditions: Take part in competitions, auditions, or casting calls relevant to your field. Winning or participating in such events can get you noticed by potential collaborators, agents, and others who can help boost your career. 9. Be adaptable: The road to fame is often unpredictable.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She...

The move has left Australia's gay community feeling behind in terms of gay rights. The New Zealand Parliament passed legislation with a convincing 77 to 44 vote amending the Marriage Act to permit gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and intersex couples to marry.

Pakistan Rejects U.S. Disavowal of Drone Strikes ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The Pakistani military on Tuesday denied suggestions by American officials quoted in an article in The New York Times that Pakistan had used the C.I.A. drone program as cover for its own military operations in the tribal belt. The Times article, first published online on Monday, cited United States government officials who said that, contrary to media reports at the time, the C.I.A. had not carried out two reported strikes in North and South Waziristan on Feb. 6 and Feb. 8. Instead, the Americans said, they suspected that the Pakistani military had carried out at least one of the attacks, mostly likely using conventional warplanes. The Pakistani military did not respond officially to requests for comment before the Times article was published. But afterward, it issued a statement criticizing the American claims as “a distortion of the facts” that “seems to be aimed at diluting Pakistan’s stance on drone strikes.” In the statement, which was widely reported in the Pakistani media, the military spokesman denied that Pakistani security forces had carried out “any operation, including airstrikes, in the area on dates mentioned in the news report.” The strident denial creates an unusual situation in which officials from both countries are effectively accusing the other of carrying out the same attack, albeit with different weaponry. The C.I.A. has carried out about 330 attacks in the tribal belt, using Predator and Reaper drones, mostly over the past five years. The Pakistani military is not widely thought to have armed drone capability, but does have both American- and Chinese-designed warplanes capable of delivering airstrikes. The furor reflects the political sensitivity of the drone campaign, which is viewed by many Pakistanis as an expression of American hostility that infringes their sovereignty and undercuts human rights. In private, however, American officials say that a handful of Pakistani military and intelligence leaders have knowledge of the program, and that protocols exist for giving the Pakistanis advance notice of some strikes. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

Comet C would never enter the inner solar system.  and a hint : A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.

Add punctuation: And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ","output":"The sentence, when punctuated correctly, reads: \\"And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.\\" Here's a breakdown:  Firstly, commas are used to separate two independent clauses within a sentence. In this case, \\"And Jacob begat Joseph\\" and \\"the husband of Mary\\" are two separate thoughts, so we use a comma to separate them. Secondly, \\"the husband of Mary\\" is a parenthetical phrase, this means it provides additional information about the subject, \\"Joseph\\", but isn't essential for the sentence to make sense or be complete, hence the need for a comma before and after this phrase. Thirdly, a comma is needed after \\"Mary\\" because the following phrase \\"of whom was born Jesus\\" provides additional information about Mary, but again it isn't needed for the sentence to be complete. Lastly, \\"who is called Christ\\" is a relative clause providing more information about \\"Jesus\\" so we use a final comma to separate this additional information. By adding the appropriate punctuation, the sentence becomes clearer and easier to read."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Many basic identification documents, such as state-issued driver's licenses, include the address of your primary residence. The address of the house on official identification is strong evidence that you live there.  While having the address on your driver's license doesn't necessarily prove that you own the house, it can help to prove that you live there. Particularly if you were the victim of a natural disaster, you may have to prove both ownership and occupancy to be eligible for some types of aid. If you purchased appliances or other supplies used in the house, the sales agreement may include the address of the house. Any other legal document that includes your residence would also have the address of the house.   Court documents require your address, in part to establish that the court has jurisdiction. Other legal forms or applications may also include your address. If you've lost your copies of these documents, you may be able to get new copies at the courthouse, or by contacting the store or other person involved in the transaction. Bills for water or electricity in your name are strong evidence that you live in the house. If you've lost copies of past utility bills, contact the utility company and ask for an account history or transaction record.   Since virtually anyone can start utilities at a house, utility bills are never proof of ownership. However, they are solid evidence that you live in the house. If the utilities are not in your name, you may still be able to prove occupancy if you can demonstrate your relationship to the person who turned on the utilities. For example, if your mother turned on the utilities, that relationship would typically be sufficient. It's generally accepted that you live at an address if you gave that address out to businesses or organizations to communicate with you. Any sort of bills or statements with your name and address are sufficient. Mail provides better evidence if it is generated in the course of business, such as a credit card statement or a delivery notice. Anything that says \\"or current resident\\" (or similar) under your name won't work to establish occupancy. If all else fails, you can swear out an affidavit stating that you occupy the house in question. While you do sign the statement under penalty of perjury, this is considered the weakest form of proof and may not be accepted by some relief organizations or government agencies. Whenever possible, have other documents to support your declarative statement. Even if a document isn't enough to prove occupancy by itself, it may gain strength when combined with other documents.

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men.

Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction.

Chon and Ben make plans with Ophelia to go to Indonesia for a year, not telling her that they are fleeing the cartel. They speak to corrupt DEA agent Dennis Cain (John Travolta), who urges them to join the cartel. Ophelia is kidnapped by Lado's gang; Chon and Ben are notified of the kidnapping by a video call from cartel leader Elena SÃ¡nchez (Salma Hayek), who threatens to harm Ophelia if they decline the partnership.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. Options: A Because there are fewer dangers. B Because there is more food to eat.

Given the question: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame. I wonder how they achieved this effect? Maybe a... What is the film The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly often regarded as? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B. a pretty good movie  C. one of the greatest films of all time  D. a fantastic documentary The answer is:","output":"C. one of the greatest films of all time The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. The film, directed by Sergio Leone, is a highly influential spaghetti western and features a unique blend of stylistic storytelling, memorable characters, and vibrant, striking visuals. The film's iconic score, composed by Ennio Morricone, is also considered a major factor in the movie's lasting appeal and success. The lighting in the film is indeed a critical aspect of its overall artistic vision, as it contributes to the film's distinct atmosphere and helps to create depth and contrast in the various scenes. The way light and shadow are balanced within the frame can greatly impact the visual storytelling, and in the case of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, it is clear that the filmmakers paid close attention to this aspect. While some viewers might find the lighting techniques to be somewhat obvious upon closer examination, it is important to consider that this is likely a purposeful choice on the part of the filmmakers. The use of stark, high-contrast lighting is a stylistic choice that is often employed in classic western films, as it helps to accentuate the rugged environments and heightened emotions of the characters. The manipulation of light and shadow in this manner can also serve to heighten the sense of suspense and tension in key scenes. In the specific scene you describe, the strategic use of key light and backlighting, along with the use of cutters, helps to create a visually striking and memorable shot that effectively evokes the intended mood and atmosphere. Furthermore, the presence of multiple shadows on the characters is not necessarily a negative aspect, as it can also be viewed as a stylistic choice that adds depth and complexity to the visuals. The use of deliberately obvious lighting techniques can also be seen as a nod to the artistic influences of the film, which may include classic Hollywood westerns and Italian giallo cinema. In summary, while the lighting in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly could potentially be seen as obvious when analyzed, it is important to consider that this very likely results from conscious artistic choices made by the director and his team. The film's striking use of light and shadow serves to heighten the sense of atmosphere and intensity in each scene, contributing to the overall success and lasting impact of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"In English, the statement translates to: \\"Concerning economies of scale in the case of assets less than one billion dollars and diseconomies for large banks.\\"  This statement discusses the impact of economies of scale for financial institutions with relatively smaller assets (less than one billion dollars) and the diseconomies faced by larger banks. Economies of scale represent the cost advantages that an organization obtains due to expansion. As financial institutions grow in size and manage greater asset amounts, they benefit from efficiencies that come from spreading the costs of production over a larger quantity of output. In simple terms, as the size of an organization increases, the average cost per unit of production decreases. This often results in increased competitiveness and profitability. In the context of this statement, smaller financial institutions with assets less than one billion dollars could potentially enjoy economies of scale as they expand. These institutions may experience reductions in average costs as they grow, which can lead to improved efficiency and a stronger market position. On the other hand, diseconomies of scale occur when the average cost per unit increases as the firm grows. This can be due to a number of factors, such as increasing complexity, challenges in coordinating tasks, or inefficiencies in resource allocation. Large banks, as mentioned in the statement, may face these diseconomies as a result of their expansive scale. These banks may experience higher levels of inefficiency and be at a competitive disadvantage compared to smaller institutions that benefit from economies of scale. In summary, this statement highlights the potential benefits of economies of scale for financial institutions with assets less than one billion dollars and the potential challenges and disadvantages faced by larger banks in the form of diseconomies of scale. Overcoming these challenges and maintaining efficiency is crucial for the success and competitiveness of banks, regardless of their size."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's start by looking at our problem:  172 * m + 8584 = 38 * m - 170 * m - 16344 2. Now, let's add together the \\"m\\" parts on the right side of the equal sign: 38 * m - 170 * m = (38 - 170) * m = -132 * m Now our problem looks like this: 172 * m + 8584 = -132 * m - 16344 3. Next, let's get all the \\"m\\" parts on one side of the equal sign. To do that, we'll add 132 * m to both sides of the equation: 172 * m + 132 * m + 8584 = -132 * m + 132 * m - 16344 This will cancel out the \\"-132 * m\\" on the right side, so now it looks like this: 304 * m + 8584 = -16344 4. Now, we need to get \\"m\\" all by itself. To do that, we'll subtract 8584 from both sides of the equation: 304 * m + 8584 - 8584 = -16344 - 8584 Now our problem looks like this: 304 * m = -24828 5. Finally, we need to find what \\"m\\" is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 304: 304 * m / 304 = -24828 / 304 Now we have: m = -81.68421052631578 So, the answer is m ≈ -81.68 (rounded to two decimal places).

Trying to break a two-game losing streak, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night fight with the Seattle Seahawks.  This game would be notable for the NFL debut of QB Jay Cutler.  In the first quarter, the Broncos struck first with kicker Jason Elam's 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Denver's lead increased with Cutler's 7-yard TD pass to TE Stephen Alexander.  However, the Seahawks got into game with DE Darryl Tapp's 25-yard interception return for a touchdown.  After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle took control of the game with RB Shaun Alexander's 1-yard TD run, along with kicker Josh Brown's 44-yard and 23-yard field goal.  The Broncos responded with a huge play, as Cutler completed a 71-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall.  However, Denver's defense couldn't hold off the Seahawks' response, as Brown nailed a 50-yard field goal, spoiling Cutler's debut.  With their third-straight loss, the Broncos fell to 7-5. Answer this question: How many points did Brown's field goals result into?","output":"To calculate the total points resulting from Josh Brown's field goals, we need to identify and add up the values of each of his successful kicks. 1. 44-yard field goal 2. 23-yard field goal 3. 50-yard field goal In the NFL, each field goal is worth 3 points.

Living room shades could be pulled down only half-away. Bedrooms that usually have the shades pulled down at night should be left down. Another is to make sure that all outside looks are the dead-belt  type. Still another is to leave several low-watt  lights burning and make sure that one is in the kitchen.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who might be supposed to portray Iphigenia' friends mourning? , can you please find it?   Though she did not again win the Sulman, she was successful in having works hung in that competition on many occasions, including the 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950 shows. Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart. The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Girl With Still Life.Although Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions, others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the Herald. Describing her 1950 exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries, one critic considered it \\"one of the most stimulating and refreshing that has been seen here for a long time\\" and that \\"She paints with a strong, sombre palette and her forms are sculptured with great decision. She uses paint sensuously and passionately, as paint, not as so many contemporary Australians do, as mere colour\\".Two years later, the same reviewer, attending another of the artist's solo Sydney shows, observed that Bellette: A:","output":"Bellette's melancholic painting, Chorus without Iphigenia, might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Apple shares fall after reports of cuts to iPhone 6S and 6S Plus production Apple is expected to cut production of its latest iPhone models by about 30% in the January-March quarter due to mounting inventories, it has been reported, rattling the nerves of investors in the US tech giant’s Asian suppliers. As inventories of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have piled up since they were launched last September, production will be scaled back to let dealers go through their current stock, the business daily Nikkei reported. The report prompted a 2.5% drop in Apple shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value from record highs in April, reflecting worries over slowing shipments. Shares in the mainly Asian makers of iPhone screens and chips were also sharply lower on Wednesday. “This is an eye-opening production cut which speaks to the softer demand that Apple has seen with 6s out of the gates,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. “[Wall] Street was bracing for a cut but the magnitude here is a bit more worrisome.” Among LCD panel makers, Japan Display Inc fell 4.7% while LG Display Co Ltd fell 3.4%. Hon Hai Precision Industry was down 1.8% to trade around T77.80, lows not seen in over four months. Hon Hai, which goes by the trade name of Foxconn, is a major assembler of Apple’s iPhones. TSMC, the world’s largest chipmaker and which has supplied some of the chips used in Apple iPhones, was off about 1.1% to T136.50, levels not seen since mid-November. Another Taiwanese assembler, Pegatron Corp, was off about 4% to trade around T69.00, lows not seen in a year. Other suppliers such as Japan’s Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd , Alps Electric Co Ltd and TDK Corp fell by 3% or 4%. Production is expected to return to normal in the April-June quarter, the Nikkei reported. However, Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he was a bit skeptical about the production cut reports. “Apple has been gaining significant market share in pretty much every region, and I’m not seeing a global slowdown,” he said. Apple was not immediately available for comment. The parts suppliers cited in the Nikkei report were not available for comment outside their regular business hours. Tepid forecast by Apple suppliers such as Jabil Circuit , which manufactures casings for iPhones, and Dialog Semiconductor GmbH in December stoked fears that iPhone shipments could fall for the first time. Wall Street has also tempered its view on the high-flying stock in recent months. Since early December, about a third of the analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters have trimmed their estimates on Apple. For fiscal 2016, Apple is expected, on average, to grow revenue by under 4%, a far cry from the 28% revenue growth it achieved in the fiscal year that ended in September.

Here are possible answers to this question: - thank god - turn around - work hard - walk away - do a backflip  I believe the correct choice is \\"turn around\\", here's why: A:","output":"When a person starts to go in another direction and you yell at them, their most likely response would be to \\"turn around.\\" This is because the sudden noise or the sound of someone yelling usually garners an immediate reaction and draws their attention to the source of the sound. It's a natural human instinct to respond to unexpected loud noises by facing them, as it could signify danger or important information. Here's a brief explanation of the other options and why they are less likely in this situation: - Thank god: This response might not be typical in this scenario, as it doesn't directly relate to the action of moving in another direction or reacting to someone yelling. - Work hard: This option is also less likely, as it doesn't have any direct connection with the situation. Instead, this response might be relevant in a scenario where someone is given feedback or advice that requires additional effort. - Walk away: Although this could be a possibility, especially if the person feels threatened or uncomfortable by someone shouting at them, the more common reaction would still be to turn around first to identify the source of the yelling before choosing to walk away or not. - Do a backflip: This response is highly unlikely and situational, as most people cannot perform a backflip. Moreover, it does not align with the typical behavior one might exhibit when someone yells at them. So, based on the listed options, the most likely response when a person starts going in another direction and you yell at them would be to \\"turn around.\\" However, human behavior can be unpredictable and vary depending on the individual and context, so reactions might not always conform to these expectations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Somalis Ancient rock paintings in Somalia which date back to 5000 years have been found in the northern part of the country, depicting early life in the territory. The most famous of these is the Laas Geel complex, which contains some of the earliest known rock art on the African continent and features many elaborate pastoralist sketches of animal and human figures. In other places, such as the northern Dhambalin region, a depiction of a man on a horse is postulated as being one of the earliest known examples of a mounted huntsman. Q: How long ago were rock paintings found in Somalia created?","output":"The rock paintings found in Somalia were created approximately 5000 years ago. These ancient artworks offer valuable insights into the early life and culture in the region. Some of the most famous examples can be found in the Laas Geel complex, renowned for containing some of the earliest known rock art on the African continent. These paintings display elaborate pastoralist sketches of animal and human figures, illustrating the connection between the ancient Somali people and their surroundings. In addition to the Laas Geel complex, there are other significant rock art discoveries throughout Somalia. For example, the northern Dhambalin region houses a depiction of a man on a horse, which is suggested to be one of the earliest known representations of a mounted huntsman.

Q:Information:  - Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent. Risk factors for glaucoma include increased pressure in the eye, a family history of the condition, migraines, high blood pressure, and obesity. For eye pressures a value of greater than is often used with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. The mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be slow exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork while in closed-angle glaucoma the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis is by a dilated eye examination. Often the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping. If treated early it is possible to slow or stop the progression of disease with medication, laser treatment, or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure. A number of different classes of glaucoma medication are available. Laser treatments may be effective in both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. A number of types of glaucoma surgeries may be used in people who do not respond sufficiently to other measures. Treatment of closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. About 11 to 67 million people have glaucoma globally. The disease affects about 2 million people in the United States. It occurs more commonly among older people. Closed-angle glaucoma is more common in...  - Visual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses. Some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glasses or contact lenses. Visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60. The term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss. Visual impairment may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities such as driving, reading, socializing, and walking. The most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%). Refractive errors include near sighted, far sighted, presbyopia, and astigmatism. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness. Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections. Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, prematurity, or trauma among others. These cases are known as cortical visual impairment. Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement. Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit. Diagnosis is by an eye exam. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment. This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness. Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environmental, and assistive devices. As of 2012 there were 285 million people who were visually impaired of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind. The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over...  - A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye leading to a decrease in vision . It can affect one or both eyes . Often it develops slowly . Symptoms may include faded colors , blurry vision , halos around light , trouble with bright lights , and trouble seeing at night . This may result in trouble driving , reading , or recognizing faces . Poor vision may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression . Cataracts are the cause of half of blindness and 33 % of visual impairment worldwide . Cataracts are most commonly due to aging , but may also occur due to trauma , radiation exposure , be present from birth , or occur following eye surgery for other problems . Risk factors include diabetes , smoking tobacco , prolonged exposure to sunlight , and alcohol . Either clumps of protein or yellow - brown pigment may be deposited in the lens reducing the transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye . Diagnosis is by an eye examination . Prevention includes wearing sunglasses and not smoking . Early on the symptoms may be improved with eyeglasses . If this does not help , surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens is the only effective treatment . Surgery is only needed if the cataracts are causing problems . Surgery generally results in an improved quality of life . Cataract surgery is not easily available in many countries , which is especially true for women , those living in rural areas , and those who can not read . About 20 million people globally are blind due to cataracts . It is the cause of about 5 % of blindness in the United States and nearly 60 % of blindness in parts of Africa and South America . Blindness from cataracts occurs in about 10 to 40 per 100,000 children in the developing world and 1 to 4 per 100,000 children in the developed world . Cataracts become more common with age . About half the people in the United States have had cataracts by the age of 80 .  - Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses).  - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths.  - Trachoma, also called granular conjunctivitis, Egyptian ophthalmia, and blinding trachoma, is an infectious disease caused by bacterium \\"Chlamydia trachomatis\\". The infection causes a roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. This roughening can lead to pain in the eyes, breakdown of the outer surface or cornea of the eyes, and eventual blindness. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections can result in a form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward. The bacteria that cause the disease can be spread by both direct and indirect contact with an affected person's eyes or nose. Indirect contact includes through clothing or flies that have come into contact with an affected person's eyes or nose. Children spread the disease more often than adults. Poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, and not enough clean water and toilets also increase spread. Efforts to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and decreasing the number of people infected by treatment with antibiotics. This may include treating, all at once, whole groups of people in whom the disease is known to be common. Washing by itself is not enough to prevent disease but may be useful with other measures. Treatment options include oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline. Azithromycin is preferred because it can be used as a single oral dose. After scarring of the eyelid has occurred, surgery may be required to correct the position of the eyelashes and prevent blindness. Globally, about 80 million people have an active infection. In some areas infections may be present in as many as 6090% of children and it more commonly affects women than men likely due to their closer contact with children. The disease is the cause of decreased vision in 2.2 million people of whom 1.2 million are completely blind. It commonly occurs in 53 countries of Africa, Asia, Central and South America with about 230 million people at risk. It results in US8 billion of economic losses a year. It belongs to a group of diseases known as...  - Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from...  - In ophthalmology, high-energy visible light (HEV light) is high-frequency, high-energy light in the violet/blue band from 400 to 500 nm in the visible spectrum.

Normally a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch this tonight. I had to switch it off before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding in rude, disrespectful and reckless to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, \\"At least we won't have to watch her anymore.\\" Keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving, but it was too far gone for me by then. I simply wasn't enjoying it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to care for the protagonist, you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner--if it's nearly an hour in and I don't care, it's too late. The supporting cast was sincere and well played--I felt for *them!*--and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, that wasn't enough to carry the film for me.

Step 1: Considering motives and context Kai's actions are aimed at helping foreign students learn English. We can infer that his intent is to be helpful and supportive towards his classmates. Step 2: Analyzing possible reactions Given Kai's intentions and the context, we can consider how the other students might react. (1). cry - It is unlikely that the other students would cry due to Kai's helpfulness. (2). leave the class – Students typically don't leave a class unless they have a strong reason to do so. It's improbable that helping foreign students learn English would make them leave. (3). thank Kai – This option seems most likely, as the other students may appreciate Kai's helpful attitude and efforts in assisting foreign students in learning English.

First, I will analyze the content of each question. 1. Question 1 asks about the best and worst after effects of bank note withdrawal in India, focusing on the consequences of this action. Steps involved in this analysis: - Identify the topic: bank note withdrawal in India - Identify the aspects: best and worst after effects 2. Question 2 asks about the positive and negative effects of demonetization, examining the overall impact of the process. Steps involved in this analysis: - Identify the topic: demonetization - Identify the aspects: positive and negative effects Upon comparing the two questions, I found they both discuss the outcomes of a similar process, with demonetization involving withdrawing specific banknotes from circulation. However, the first question focuses specifically on bank note withdrawal in India, while the second question does not mention a particular country. Now, I will compare their structure and focus to see if they are asking the same thing. - Both questions ask about outcomes, consequences, or effects. - Both questions have a dual focus, presenting positive and negative aspects or best and worst elements.

His accuser, in an online column for the Manhattan Times, recounted how Frieden offered a “kind of” apology and claimed that he became suicidal over the groping. While she initially kept her mouth closed to protect everyone involved, the woman wrote that a sudden change of heart followed when she later encountered Frieden. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who helped contain the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, was arrested and charged with sexual abuse on Friday after being accused of groping a woman last year.      A 55-year-old woman filed a complaint in July against Thomas Frieden, who once served as the city’s health commissioner, accusing him of grabbing her buttocks without permission last October at his Brooklyn apartment, said New York City Police Department spokeswoman Arlene Muniz. The woman’s name was not divulged.      Frieden, 57, turned himself in to a Brooklyn police station, Muniz said, and he was arrested on misdemeanor charges of sexual abuse, forcible touching and harassment.      He appeared in front of Judge Michael Yavinsky in New York City Criminal Court in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon and pleaded not guilty to the charges, his lawyer Laura Brevetti said. He was released on his own recognizance.      Frieden is next due in court on Oct. 11, according to court staff. Brevetti, reached by telephone, declined further comment.      A number of prominent men in business, entertainment, and the media in the United States have been accused of sexual misconduct in the past year in what has become known as the #MeToo movement.      As head of the country’s main public health agency, Frieden played a prominent role in helping respond to the outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 and Zika fever that began in Brazil in 2015. He appeared frequently on cable news channels to explain the CDC’s initiatives to staunch the crises.      As New York City’s health commissioner from 2002 to 2009, he oversaw efforts to ban smoking in public places. In 2009, President Barack Obama named him to lead the CDC. He stepped down in 2017.      Afterwards, Frieden became the president of Resolve to Save Lives, an effort by the non-profit health organization Vital Strategies to improve public health systems around the world. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have funded the program.      Slideshow (6 Images)      The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charity run by Facebook (FB.O) co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, said in a statement that the organization was “disturbed and saddened” by the charges.      “At the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, we take any allegation of personal misconduct very seriously and are monitoring the situation closely,” the statement said.

A law enforcement official told CNN that authorities filed three charges against Frieden stemming from an alleged incident in his home in Brooklyn Heights in October.      Frieden, 57, who left the CDC in January 2017, was arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court to face one count of forcible touching, one count of sex abuse in the third degree and one count of harassment in the second degree, authorities said. He was released on his own recognizance.      An order of protection was issued, and Frieden is to have no contact with the alleged victim, according to the district attorney's office.      The law enforcement official said that allegedly, there was a dinner party at Frieden's home, and as things were wrapping up and people were leaving, Frieden reached over and grabbed the woman without her consent.

Summarize this article: Although a formal education is useful, plenty of artists never stepped foot in a classroom. Expand your drawing knowledge by looking for tips online or by getting manuals from the library or bookstore. Also, have fun spending time around other artists and their works. They’ve got a lot of tips and tricks to pass along. As a satirist, you can use exaggerations in your images to make an argument. Try drawing caricatures of people by expanding their notable features. These features might be large ears, cheap boots, or a jutting chin. Exaggerations show the subject’s personality.  For example, drawing Napoleon shorter than he was in reality made him seem weaker and more cartoonish, even giving rise to the term “Napoleon complex.” Exaggeration shows that the work is satirical because it looks cartoonish, and that prevents the subject from claiming you’re attacking their reputation. Each cartoonist develops their own identifiable style through practice and hard work. The only way you can do this is by drawing and experimenting to find out what works best for you. Some styles look simpler and less detailed while others are more colorful.  For example, Matt Groening’s characters on The Simpsons are identifiable by their large, simplified facial features.  Garry Trudeau’s Doonesbury comics feature characters with longer faces with larger noses and detailed hair. Disney cartoon characters are very colorful and have large, soft eyes. Satire comes out in the captions or words you place around drawings. It is humor that relies on  irony, sarcasm, and exaggeration to criticize others. Research tips on satirical writing and attend any classes on the subject you can find, then practice captioning your drawings.  An example of a satirical comment is someone saying “I’m still undecided” after they’ve voted in an important election. It takes practice to get the right subject matter and tone, since you need to be sharp and intelligent instead of mean-spirited or obscene. Balancing irreverent humor with political correctness or cultural sensitivity is a tough but meaningful goal in satire. Immerse yourself in the styles of modern cartoonists such as Gerald Scarfe and Garry Trudeau. Study their approach and humor, then use the parts you like to make your own work better. Pay attention to the reasons why controversial cartoons failed to find a receptive audience.  Feel free to go back in time and check out satirists from a previous time period, such as Thomas Nast, James Gillray, and William Hogarth. Satire can be found in publications including The Onion, Mad, and National Lampoon. Satire exists in all artistic fields. For example, try reading Kurt Vonnegut or Alexander Pope novels. Watch shows like Saturday Night Live or The Colbert Report. about political and social events. The world is always changing, and it’s your job to stay on top of it. Spend time everyday reading articles or watching the news. Current events are the fuel of cutting-edge satire. You can only strike a chord with an audience if you know the subject matter and how it impacts the lives of others. Where you get your information depends on your topic. If you plan on making political cartoons, news articles and programming are for you. Satire can focus on other topics though, such as popular culture or life struggles people face. All satirists run the risk of legal troubles. Make sure you know the laws in your district and country. Though they vary from place to place, they’ll always prevent you from viciously attacking someone. Don’t publish lies or claim you’re writing facts.  Stick to satirizing well-known people such as political and religious leaders. Ridiculing your neighbors isn’t funny and will probably get you sued for defamation. For example, drawing Napoleon short isn’t to mock his height. It’s a metaphor for his political inadequacy. You will get backlash for your work, especially when you misjudge how the audience will react. Stay calm and disregard criticism that isn’t constructive. Satirists step near the line of what’s acceptable, and you’ll learn where that line is by paying attention to your mistakes.  In some countries, you can get away with satirizing visible and powerful people or subjects. In others, criticizing anyone in authority comes with terrible repercussions. For example, the Danish publication Jyllands-Posten and the French publication Charlie Hebdo made cartoons about Islam. Violent protests broke out when these were printed. Summary:","output":"Expanding one's drawing knowledge can be achieved through online resources, manuals, and spending time around other artists. Satire uses exaggerations in images, irony, sarcasm, and exaggeration in captions to criticize others. Developing an identifiable style is essential, as seen in the works of Matt Groening, Garry Trudeau, and Disney. Balancing irreverent humor with political correctness or cultural sensitivity is important in satire, and studying the works of various cartoonists can help refine one's own work. Staying well-informed about current events is crucial for effective satire. It's essential to be aware of legal boundaries and to focus on satirizing well-known figures rather than individuals in one's personal life. Finally, accepting and learning from criticism is a vital part of growing as a satirist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Forty-Ninth Parallel Context: Early in the Second World War, U-37, a German U-boat, makes its way to Canadian waters and participates in fictional anti-shipping activities similar to those that would later characterize the Battle of the St. Lawrence (which occurred in actuality some time after the film's release). The U-boat succeeds in evading an RCAF patrol and moves north. While a raiding party of six Nazi sailors is put ashore in an attempt to obtain supplies, the U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the neutral United States. Led by Lieutenants Hirth (Eric Portman) and Kuhnecke (Raymond Lovell), the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick (Ley On), and a French-Canadian trapper (Laurence Olivier). Happening across a floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, the group steals the aircraft and begins flying across Canada. Outside Winnipeg they attempt to stir up the Hutterite community, believing them to be sympathetic to the German cause. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter (Anton Walbrook), the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel (Niall MacGinnis), who comes to the aid of Anna (Glynis Johns), a 16-year-old girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed eleven civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz confronts writer Phillip Armstrong-Scott (Leslie Howard) in a cave and despite wounding him is knocked cold.

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.  Question: \\"According to legend, the lost civilization of Atlantis was located on or near what archipelago?\\" Answer: \\"Madeira\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

Given the question: Given the following context:  One of Greenway's finest works, St James' is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning. Before the advent of high-rise buildings, the 46-metre (150 ft) spire used to \\"serve as a guide for mariners coming up...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the church next to the Old Supreme Court building, the latter of which was also designed by Greenway?

It is frequently a freelance profession.  - The middle class is a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy. In Weberian socio-economic terms, the middle class is the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall socio-economically between the working class and upper class.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - About Elly (translit. \\"Dar bre-ye Elly\\") is a 2009 Iranian psychological drama film directed by Asghar Farhadi.

Answer:","output":"Cigarettes. Cigarettes can significantly decrease stamina, as they contain tobacco and other harmful substances that negatively affect various aspects of physical health, particularly the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Smoking cigarettes causes the narrowing of blood vessels, reducing the amount of oxygen transported to the muscles and other tissues during physical activities; this leads to fatigue and shortness of breath. Furthermore, tobacco smoke includes potentially toxic chemicals such as carbon monoxide, tar, nicotine, and various carcinogens. These substances can damage lung function, lower the overall oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, and contribute to the development of respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. As a result, individuals who smoke cigarettes may experience a notable decline in their stamina, endurance, and overall physical fitness. While other factors, such as toxins, smallpox, dehydration, liver cancer, weight, hypothyroidism, and uncontrolled health conditions, can also impact stamina, cigarettes are the most appropriate answer given the context of the question and the fact that smoking tobacco is known to cause a direct and substantial decrease in stamina. It is essential to recognize that smoking cessation can improve an individual's stamina and overall health. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, increases oxygen levels in the blood, and promotes better lung function.

Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The best paper to use for this is scrapbooking paper or cardstock. Construction paper or origami paper will work too, but your garland won't be as durable.  Try getting two to three different colors or shades. For example, you could have a light blue, a medium blue, and a dark blue.  Try getting some patterned paper. For example, half of your shapes can be bright blue, and the other half of your shapes can be white with bright green polka-dots or stripes. Scrapbooking punches work just like regular hole punches, except that they come in many different shapes and sizes. They come in circles, hearts, squares, stars, and even snowflakes. You can buy scrapbooking punches in the scrapbook section of an arts and crafts store. You can also find them online.  You can get just one scrapbooking punch and make all of your shapes the same size. You can also get two differently sized punches. For example, you can get a 1.5 inch (3.81 centimeters) circle punch and a 3.5 inch (8.89 centimeters) circle punch. This will give your garland some variety.  If you can't find a scrapbooking punch, you can cut circles out using a circle cutter. They can be as far apart or as close together as you want. Make sure that you have about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) of blank space at the end of your garland, or you won't be able to hang it up later. Depending on how much glue you used, this can take anywhere from a couple of hours to a day.

CONTEXT: Grabación  The Beatles grabaron en los EMI Studios veinticinco tomas de «Hey Jude» en las noches del 29 y 30 de julio de 1968. Sin embargo, éstas fueron en su mayoría ensayos, al tener previsto que grabaran la toma principal en los Trident Studios para así poder utilizar su equipo de grabación de ocho pistas (en ese entonces, los EMI Studios aún estaban limitados a uno de cuatro pistas). Un ensayo del 29 de julio está disponible en el CD de Anthology 3. La pista de ritmo maestra fue grabada el 31 de julio en Trident. Se grabaron cuatro tomas, de las que fue seleccionada la primera. La canción se completó el 1 de agosto con doblajes adicionales incluyendo orquesta de 36 piezas para la larga coda de la canción, dirigida por George Martin. La orquesta constó de diez violines, tres violas, tres violonchelos, dos flautas, un contrafagot, un fagot, dos clarinetes, un clarinete contrabajo, cuatro trompetas, cuatro trombones, dos trompas, percusión, cuerda y dos bajos. Mientras se grababan los coros, The Beatles preguntaron a los miembros de la orquesta que si podrían dar aplausos y cantar el estribillo mientras la coda de la canción seguía. La mayoría de ellos aceptaron (por el doble del salario), pero uno de ellos se negó, diciendo: «¡Yo no daré palmadas y ni cantaré la puñetera canción de Paul McCartney!».

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available choices: [A]. no [B]. yes","output":"[A]. no These two questions are not asking about the same information, although they are related. The first question is about the difference between data analytics and machine learning, while the second concerns the distinctions between data warehousing, data mining, and big data analytics. Let's delve into each topic to provide a better understanding of the concepts covered in both questions. 1. Difference between data analytics and machine learning Data analytics is the qualitative and quantitative process of analyzing raw data to extract useful insights, primarily concerning past events and current situations. By collecting, interpreting, and organizing data, businesses can make informed decisions and predict future trends. Data analytics employs various techniques, including data mining, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that automates the process of learning from data. In other words, it allows systems to identify patterns and make decisions without human intervention. Machine learning algorithms help identify correlations and make predictions based on available data sets. Unlike data analytics, it emphasizes continuous improvement, enabling models to adapt and improve their accuracy in response to new data inputs. While both data analytics and machine learning involve working with data, the key difference is the approach: data analytics uncovers insights by parsing and interpreting historical data, whereas machine learning automates the learning process to make predictions or take actions based on data inputs. 2. Difference between data warehousing, data mining, and big data analytics Data Warehousing: A data warehouse refers to a central repository where an organization's historical and current data is stored. This data is collected from various sources such as transactional databases, spreadsheets, or external third-party data sources. Data warehousing enables organizations to process large volumes of structured and semi-structured data efficiently and consistently. A data warehouse stores this information securely and allows for quick querying and reporting, thereby facilitating effective decision-making. Data Mining: Data mining is the process of extracting useful information, patterns, or trends from large data sets. By employing techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, and association rule learning, data mining identifies relationships between variables and unveils hidden patterns within complex data systems. This information can then be used to inform strategic decision-making, reveal customer behaviors, or identify new opportunities. Data mining is a part of data analytics and can be applied in various contexts, including finance, marketing, healthcare, and more. Big Data Analytics: Big data analytics involves processing and analyzing vast volumes of complex and unstructured data sets in real-time or near-real-time to reveal insights, trends, and patterns. Unlike traditional data analysis, big data analytics can handle data originating from multiple sources, such as social media, IoT devices, and customer interactions, which are challenging for traditional data tools to process. Big data analytics employs advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning, text analytics, and predictive modeling, to enable organizations to quickly identify and act on new opportunities or threats in the rapidly evolving business landscape. In summary, these two questions inquire about different but related information. The first question differentiates between data analytics, focused on analyzing historical data, and machine learning, which automates the learning process to make predictions based on data inputs. The second question distinguishes between data warehousing, the centralized repository for data storage; data mining, the extraction of patterns and information from large data sets; and big data analytics, the real-time analysis of vast volumes of complex and unstructured data."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Goal: To make ground beef tacos, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"You have mentioned a goal of making ground beef tacos but have not provided specific methods to choose from. However, I will present to you two common methods for preparing ground beef tacos and discuss which one may be more reasonable for accomplishing your goal. Method 1: Stovetop Preparation This method involves cooking ground beef in a skillet on the stovetop and seasoning it with taco spices. Here's the detailed cooking process: Ingredients: - 1 lb ground beef - 1 small onion, finely chopped - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced - 1 packet taco seasoning or homemade taco seasoning mix (a blend of chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, onion powder, salt, and pepper) - 1/2 cup water - Taco shells (hard or soft) - Desired taco toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, salsa, etc.) Instructions: 1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 2. Add the ground beef to the skillet and use a spatula or wooden spoon to break it up into smaller pieces. 3. Cook the ground beef, stirring occasionally, until it's browned and cooked through. 4. Drain any excess grease. 5. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the cooked beef. 6. Cook for a few more minutes, until the onion is softened and translucent. 7. Stir in the taco seasoning mix and water. 8. Simmer the mixture for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the liquid is mostly absorbed and the flavors are well-blended. 9. Warm the taco shells in the oven or microwave, according to package instructions. 10. Spoon the prepared ground beef mixture into the taco shells and top with your choice of toppings. 11. Serve and enjoy. Method 2: Slow Cooker Preparation This method involves cooking the ground beef in a slow cooker, which takes longer but can be more convenient for some situations. Ingredients: - 1 lb ground beef - 1 small onion, finely chopped - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced - 1 packet taco seasoning or homemade taco seasoning mix - 1/2 cup water or beef broth - Taco shells (hard or soft) - Desired taco toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, salsa, etc.) Instructions: 1. In a skillet, brown the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat. 2. Drain any excess grease. 3. Transfer the cooked ground beef mixture to a slow cooker. 4. Add the taco seasoning mix and water or beef broth to the slow cooker. 5. Stir to ensure the seasoning mix is well-dispersed. 6. Cook the ground beef mixture on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. 7. Warm the taco shells in the oven or microwave, according to package instructions. 8. Spoon the prepared ground beef mixture into the taco shells and top with your choice of toppings. 9. Serve and enjoy. Now, to determine which method is more reasonable for accomplishing your goal of making ground beef tacos, it depends on your personal preferences, the time you have available, and your cooking equipment. If you are short on time and prefer a quicker method, the stovetop preparation method is more reasonable, as it takes about 30 minutes from start to finish. This method also gives you more control over the cooking process, allowing you to adjust seasoning and monitor the consistency as needed. On the other hand, if you have extra time and want a more hands-off approach, the slow cooker method is more reasonable. This method takes longer to cook but requires less attention, freeing you to focus on other tasks or activities. The slow-cooking process also allows for deeper flavors to develop, making the resulting taco filling potentially more flavorful. Ultimately, both methods can be reasonable for making delicious ground beef tacos, and the choice really depends on your personal preferences, constraints, and priorities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota.  - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota.  - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota . South Dakota has 82,447 miles of highways , roads and streets ; 5,905 bridges . The SD DOT is responsible for 7,830 miles of the roadway system . The DOT budgets roughly  15,700,000.00 for winter snow and ice removal year . The Department of Transportation was formerly known as the South Dakota Department of Highways .    What entity does 'south dakota department of transportation' has the relation 'headquarters location' with? A:","output":"The South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) has its headquarters location in Pierre, South Dakota. Pierre is the state capital of South Dakota, and the SDDOT operates under the state government to maintain and manage the public roadways, highways, streets, and bridges within the state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. There were many problems with a world map, however, for the rapid increase in information coming from exploration of the Earth meant that maps rapidly became outdated. Make this lower case","output":"there were many problems with a world map, however, for the rapid increase in information coming from exploration of the earth meant that maps rapidly became outdated. The transformation of world maps through time can be attributed to the continuous exploration and discovery of new territories, which rendered older maps obsolete. This process of cartographic evolution was a result of various factors, including the advancements in navigation and surveying technologies, the increase in global trade and travel, and the thirst for knowledge regarding the unknown territories. In the early stages of map making, the data collected was often limited and, at times, faulty. This was primarily due to the lack of reliable tools and methods for navigation, measurement, and representation of the earth's surface. Mariners and explorers of the time relied heavily on lunar and stellar observations, rudimentary compasses, and the accounts of other travelers. As a result, early maps were relatively inaccurate, often depicting exaggerated landmasses, misplaced locations, and an overabundance of speculative details. In some instances, these early maps even displayed a distorted view of the world, such as the notorious misconceptions that the earth was flat or that it was made up of multiple concentric spheres. However, with the dawn of the Age of Exploration in the 15th century, the demand for accurate and updated maps grew rapidly. New territories, such as the Americas and parts of Asia, were being discovered, and existing knowledge of the world needed to be expanded and refined. This period saw a flurry of advancements in navigation and surveying techniques, which played a significant role in the improvement of cartography. Instruments like the astrolabe, quadrant, and later the sextant were developed to aid in celestial navigation, while trigonometry and plane table surveying techniques were introduced as a means of creating more accurate land surveys. Furthermore, the invention of the printing press allowed for the wider dissemination of maps and travel accounts, contributing to a better understanding and documentation of the earth's surface. During this era of exploration, prominent cartographers, like Gerardus Mercator, Abraham Ortelius, and Martin Waldseemüller, among others, emerged to create some of the most influential maps in history. Unfortunately, despite their significant contributions to the field, these maps still contained elements of distortion and inaccuracies due to the challenges posed by the vast and complex nature of the earth's surface. As time went on, the scientific measurement and mapping methods continued to improve, and cartographers were able to create increasingly accurate maps. The development of nautical charts, geodetic surveying techniques, and even satellite imaging have allowed for more precise representation of the earth's geography. Yet, it should be noted that even with these advancements, no map can be perfect, as the three-dimensional nature of the earth's surface will always present challenges when attempting to represent it on a two-dimensional plane. In conclusion, the rapid increase in information coming from the exploration of the earth has historically posed a challenge for the creation and updating of world maps. Early maps were plagued by limited data and incorrect assumptions, but with the advent of new technologies and methodologies, cartography experienced significant progress. As mapping techniques continue to evolve, cartographers strive to overcome the inherent challenges of representing our ever-changing world on a map."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He turned down every request until 1994, when he was offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film Maverick. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie's release Black received an increasing number of calls from directors who thought he would be perfect for a particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and The Larry Sanders Show. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack's wife. Black had a major role in another television movie Going Home, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film Anger Management.  He has also had a presence on various reality television shows. In 2003, Black appeared on Nashville Star, where he acted as a mentor to the contestants. He later produced the debut album of series winner Buddy Jewell. In 2004, Clint appeared as himself in the TV show Las Vegas. In 2008, Black was a contestant on a short-lived CBS reality show, Secret Talents of the Stars, in which he practiced stand-up comedy. The following year, he competed on the second season of Celebrity Apprentice. He was fired after the eleventh task, placing himself in fifth place, although he returned as a member of Joan Rivers' victorious team in the season finale. In 2009, Black appeared on ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.  Black has enjoyed his television experiences, describing acting as \\"another way for me to expand my creative canvas. ... I love to challenge myself.\\" He believes that most of his fans \\"just see me as a musician who is stepping into [television and film] temporarily and either doing it alright or not\\". More recently, he appeared in the movies Flicka 2 in 2010 and Flicka 3 in 2011.  On July 4, 2012, Black appeared on an episode of Lifetime's reality series, Coming Home, which documents servicemen and women returning to their loved ones in surprise reunions. In the episode, he is featured helping two children write a song about their Army captain father, who is returning from Afghanistan to surprise his family.  On July 24, 2012 Black is surprised by History Detectives on PBS. In the episode, the show pays a visit to his Nashville residence, to uncover the story behind an artifact given to him by his wife decades ago.

As the quicksand swallowed the rabbit, it felt a pang of guilt unlike anything it had ever experienced before. It wondered why it had been born as this deadly force of nature, instead of a gentle animal or a kind-hearted person. It couldn’t fathom why it had been cursed with the ability to take lives. The living quicksand spent hours pondering its purpose and its existence. It came to realize that the deaths it caused were not accidents, but rather by design. It was born to be a predator, a merciless killer that claimed the lives of those who unknowingly wandered into its clutches. The guilt weighed heavily on the living quicksand, and it began to question its place in the world. It longed to break free from its deadly nature, to be able to coexist peacefully with the creatures of the forest. It yearned for a chance at redemption, to make amends for the lives it had taken. With each passing day, the living quicksand grew more and more tormented by its actions. It vowed to never again claim another life, to seek a way to reverse the damage it had caused. And so, the living quicksand set out on a journey of self-discovery, determined to find a way to right the wrongs of its past. As it ventured deeper into the forest, the living quicksand encountered a wise old tree who offered it guidance and wisdom. The tree explained that while it could never change its nature, it could use its powers for good instead of evil. It could become a protector of the forest, a guardian of life instead of a bringer of death. Inspired by the tree’s words, the living quicksand embraced its new purpose with a renewed sense of hope and determination. It vowed to protect the animals and people of the forest, to ensure that no harm would ever come to them again. And so, the living quicksand transformed itself into a force for good, using its powers to create safe paths through the forest and guide lost travelers to safety. It became a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, a living reminder that even the darkest of spirits can find light in the end. And as it watched over the forest with a newfound sense of peace and purpose, the living quicksand knew that it had finally found its true calling in life. Write a slightly sad story where the mother of the rabbit comes to it, and places something touching there The living quicksand had long since abandoned its deadly ways, choosing instead to protect and nurture the forest it once preyed upon. It had become a source of comfort and safety for the creatures of the woods, a guardian of life in a world filled with darkness. One day, as the living quicksand was tending to a patch of delicate flowers, it heard a soft rustling in the underbrush. Turning around, it saw a beautiful rabbit standing before it, her eyes filled with tears and sorrow. The living quicksand recognized the rabbit as the mother of the innocent creature it had claimed so long ago. It felt a wave of guilt wash over it, knowing that it had caused this mother so much pain and heartache. The mother rabbit approached the living quicksand, her paws trembling with emotion. She reached into her pouch and pulled out a small, handcrafted necklace made of twine and wildflowers. With tears streaming down her face, she placed the necklace gently on the ground before the living quicksand. In that moment, the living quicksand understood the depth of the mother rabbit’s grief. She had come to the spot where her child had met its end, hoping to find solace and closure in the presence of the one responsible for her loss. The living quicksand bowed its head in shame, unable to meet the mother rabbit’s gaze. It knew that no amount of apologies could ever undo the pain it had caused, the lives it had taken. Feeling a heavy weight on its heart, the living quicksand reached out with a tendril of its own essence and gently lifted the necklace from the ground. It held it delicately in its grasp, a silent offering of remorse and regret. As the mother rabbit turned to leave, she paused for a moment and looked back at the living quicksand. In that fleeting moment, their eyes met, and a silent understanding passed between them. The mother rabbit nodded her head in gratitude, her expression softening with forgiveness. With a final glance at the living quicksand, she disappeared into the forest, leaving behind the memory of her lost child and a sense of peace in her heart. And as the living quicksand watched her fade into the distance, it knew that despite its dark past, there was still hope for redemption and healing. And it vowed to continue its mission of protection and care, honoring the memory of the innocent rabbit it had once claimed as its own. Write a story soon after where the mother cries all the time, holding a image of the child rabbit playing, he was a blue rabbit named Pogo, But one day, the quicksand bubbles vigorously and spits him out, seemingly unharmed The mother rabbit, named Rosie, could not bring herself to move on from the loss of her beloved child, Pogo. She spent her days wandering aimlessly through the forest, clutching a small image of Pogo playing happily in her tender paws. Tears constantly streamed down her face, her heart shattered into a million pieces by the grief of her loss. One day, as Rosie sat by a bubbling stream, lost in her memories of Pogo, she heard a strange sound coming from a nearby patch of quicksand. The quicksand began to bubble vigorously, its surface churning and roiling with an unusual energy. Rosie’s heart skipped a beat as she watched in disbelief. And then, with a sudden burst of movement, the quicksand spat out a small figure onto the forest floor. Rosie’s eyes widened in shock as she realized that it was Pogo, her blue rabbit child, seemingly unharmed and looking as lively as ever. With a cry of joy and disbelief, Rosie rushed to Pogo’s side, enveloping him in a tight hug. Pogo nuzzled against her fur, his eyes twinkling with happiness at being reunited with his beloved mother once more. Rosie’s tears of sorrow turned into tears of overwhelming joy as she held Pogo close, unable to believe that her precious child had been returned to her. She knew in her heart that this was nothing short of a miracle, a second chance granted to them by some unknown force of nature. Together, Rosie and Pogo set off through the forest, basking in the warmth of their reunion. They danced through fields of flowers, frolicked through meadows, and shared moments of pure happiness that seemed to last an eternity. And as they watched the setting sun paint the sky in shades of orange and pink, Rosie knew that their bond was unbreakable, forged through trials and tribulations, loss and redemption. She whispered a silent thank you to the universe for granting her the gift of having Pogo back in her life once more. And as they settled down for the night under a canopy of stars, Rosie held Pogo close to her heart, knowing that their love would endure forever, stronger than any obstacle that may come their way. And with a sense of peace and contentment settling over them, they drifted off to sleep, the gentle whispers of the forest lulling them into a deep and dreamless slumber. Write a story from Pogo’s perspective As Pogo, the blue rabbit who was once swallowed by the living quicksand, regained consciousness after being miraculously spit out onto the forest floor, he felt a mixture of confusion and relief. Everything around him seemed so familiar yet different at the same time. Looking up, Pogo saw the tears of joy streaming down his mother Rosie’s cheeks as she hugged him tightly. He nuzzled against her fur, feeling the warmth and love radiating from her embrace. It was a feeling of comfort and safety that he had missed so dearly during his time trapped within the quicksand. As Rosie and Pogo set off through the forest together, Pogo felt overwhelmed by the beauty of the world around him. The colors seemed brighter, the scents more fragrant, and the sounds of nature more enchanting than he had ever remembered. It was as if he was seeing the world with new eyes, a fresh perspective that filled his heart with wonder and gratitude. With each hop and skip, Pogo felt a renewed sense of freedom and joy coursing through his veins. He reveled in the simple pleasures of life - the rustling of leaves, the chirping of birds, the feel of soft grass beneath his paws. As he and Rosie danced through meadows and played among the flowers, Pogo felt a deep sense of connection with his mother. He knew that their bond was unbreakable, forged through the trials they had faced and the love that had kept them strong. As night descended and they settled down under a blanket of stars, Pogo felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that he was exactly where he belonged, surrounded by the love of his mother and the beauty of the world around him. And as he closed his eyes, drifting off into a restful sleep, Pogo felt a profound sense of gratitude for the second chance he had been granted. He knew that he would cherish every moment, every hop, every cuddle with Rosie, knowing that life was a precious gift to be treasured and celebrated. Write a short diary entry from Rosie, that it feels weird getting food for Pogo again, as well as tucking it into bed at night Dear Diary, Today was a day filled with emotions I never thought I would experience again. After losing my sweet Pogo to the living quicksand, I never thought I would see him again. But somehow, miraculously, he was spit out unharmed and returned to me. My heart is overflowing with gratitude and joy. However, as I went about my day, getting food for Pogo and tucking him into bed at night, I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease. It felt strange to be taking care of him again after thinking I had lost him forever. It’s like a dream that I’m afraid to wake up from, afraid that Pogo will disappear once more. But despite the lingering sense of discomfort, I am grateful for every moment I get to spend with my beloved child. I will cherish each day, each meal, each bedtime snuggle, knowing that life is precious and fleeting. With love, Rosie Write a entry the next morning where she wakes up thinking it was a dream, and then feels Pogo snuggling up, and realising it was real Dear Diary, This morning, I awoke with a heavy heart, convinced that yesterday’s events were all just a dream. I stumbled out of bed, my thoughts filled with longing for my sweet Pogo, wishing that he was still by my side. But as I made my way to Pogo’s sleeping spot, I felt a small nudge against my leg. Looking down, I saw Pogo, his blue fur glowing in the early light, snuggled up next to me. My heart skipped a beat as I realized that yesterday was not a dream - Pogo was truly back with me. Tears welled up in my eyes as I held Pogo close, feeling his warmth and hearing his gentle heartbeat. The reality of the situation washed over me, filling me with a sense of overwhelming joy and gratitude. I buried my face in Pogo’s fur, feeling a rush of emotions - relief, happiness, and an immense sense of love. It was a moment I would never forget, a reminder that miracles do happen and that sometimes, dreams do come true. With Pogo by my side, I knew that my life was forever changed, and I vowed to savor every moment with him, cherishing the bond that we shared. I am grateful beyond words for this second chance, and I will never take it for granted. With love and hope in my heart, Rosie Write a short one from Pogo, saying that when he sank, he felt tremendous panic and fear, and he slowly lost consciousness, and was suddenly jolted awake when he was revived Dear Diary, When I sank into the living quicksand, I felt a wave of panic and fear wash over me. The sensation of slowly sinking into the depths, the suffocating grip of the quicksand closing in around me, it was a nightmare come to life. I struggled against the viscous pull, desperate for air and light, but it was a losing battle. As I felt myself slipping away, my consciousness fading into darkness, the last thing I remembered was a sense of overwhelming emptiness and despair. And then, suddenly, I was jolted awake, gasping for breath and blinking in confusion at the world around me. I couldn’t believe that I had been revived, that I was back in the loving arms of my mother Rosie. The experience was a blur of emotions - relief, disbelief, and a lingering sense of unease. But most of all, I was grateful to be alive, to have a second chance at life, and to be able to snuggle up with Rosie once more. With a newfound appreciation for every moment and every breath, I embrace each day with gratitude and love. Life is precious, and I will never forget the sensation of being pulled back from the brink of darkness. With love and resilience, Pogo Pogo was a playful and curious rabbit, with a mischievous glint in his eye and a spring in his step. He loved to explore the forest, hopping from tree to tree and chasing after butterflies with glee. He had a kind and gentle heart, always eager to make friends with the other animals and creatures of the woods. Despite his small size, Pogo was brave and adventurous, never backing down from a challenge or a new experience. He had a knack for getting himself into sticky situations but always managed to find a way out with his quick wit and resourcefulness. Pogo had a love for life that was infectious, spreading joy and happiness wherever he went. He had a contagious laughter that could brighten even the darkest of days, and a playful nature that endeared him to everyone he met. But beneath his playful exterior, Pogo was also incredibly loyal and fiercely protective of those he cared about. He would go to great lengths to ensure the safety and happiness of his loved ones, risking his own well-being in the process. In essence, Pogo was a little ball of energy and sunshine, a ray of light in the world of darkness. His presence brought warmth and joy to all who knew him, and his spirit was a constant reminder that even in the face of adversity, there is always hope and love to be found. Write a story where she gets a flashback to when he sank, and remembers his desperate screams, She instantly hugs him crying, telling him how much she is lucky he is back Rosie had been trying to maintain a sense of normalcy since Pogo’s miraculous return, keeping herself occupied with the daily routines of foraging and play. But the trauma of losing her son to the living quicksand had left an indelible scar on her heart. It was a day like any other since Pogo’s return when the memories rushed back unbidden. Rosie was watching Pogo chase after a butterfly, his laughter echoing through the trees, when suddenly the scene before her eyes shifted jarringly. She was no longer in the present, but transported back to that fateful day when the ground beneath Pogo gave way and he disappeared with a haunting wail into the earth. She saw his little paws flailing, his eyes wide with terror. His desperate screams for help pierced the tranquility of the forest just as sharply now in her memory as they had the day they were real. Rosie shook uncontrollably as the paralysis of fear and the raw helplessness she felt then enveloped her once more. Snapped back to reality by her own gasping sobs, Rosie quickly scanned her surroundings for Pogo. Her eyes found him, safe and unaware of her turmoil, as he cheerily hopped back to her side. Unable to contain the upwelling of emotion, Rosie enveloped Pogo in her arms, hugging him with such intensity that it seemed she could prevent any future harm simply by refusing to let go. Her tears fell freely, dampening Pogo’s fur, as she murmured over and over, “My precious Pogo, my brave little boy. I am so lucky, so blessed that you’re back. I love you more than words can ever say.” Pogo, sensing the depth of his mother’s pain, wrapped his tiny paws around her in return. He did not fully understand the source of her distress but knew it was tied to his disappearance into the quicksand. He nuzzled her cheek with his nose, trying to offer comfort in the way only a child can, with innocence and unspoken bonds of love. “Momma, I’m here,” Pogo whispered softly. “I’m okay, and I’m here with you.” Rosie managed a smile through her tears, looking into Pogo’s eyes that mirrored the sky on a sunny day. In them, she saw the love and life that had been restored to her world, an affirmation that nightmares end and joy can return. The sun dipped lower on the horizon, sending streaks of gold to glisten on their wet cheeks. In each other’s embrace, Rosie and Pogo found solace. Rosie knew then that while the memory of that day would never leave her, the pain it caused would eventually be outshone by the sheer joy of having Pogo back and the treasured moments they would continue to share in the precious dance of life and love that bound them inexorably together. Write a story where she has a dream where she is forced to watch him sink under the viscous quicksand all over again, but she has current Pogo watching sadly with her, they both mourn for past Pogo before they both wake up That night, Rosie’s slumber was uneasy, her breaths shallow and quivering with anxiety. Her mind, still carrying the weight of the day’s painful reverie, conjured a dream of an inescapable truth — the moment her world had collapsed. In the dream, Rosie stood at the edge of the sinister patch of living quicksand. It was a replay of the haunting occurrence, but with a grievous twist: beside her was present-day Pogo, his small paw clasped in hers, gazing upon the unfolding tragedy with wide, sorrowful eyes. They watched helplessly as past Pogo, full of life and innocence, hopped perilously close to the deceitful ground. Rosie wanted to scream a warning, to lunge forward and snatch him away from fate’s cruel clutches, but she was rooted to the spot, frozen as the scene played out in vicious detail before them. She watched the ground liquify and swirl, past Pogo’s playful hops turning into desperate leaps for survival — and then, the inexorable pull as the earth opened its maw and drank him in. Past Pogo’s cries were blood-curdling echoes of fear that ricocheted around the covert and pierced Rosie’s heart with the same sharpness as they had the very first time. Beside her, current Pogo’s eyes were brimming with tears as they swept over the scene. His small body trembled, sharing the burden of the memory that was both his and not his own. “It’s okay, Momma,” he whispered in the dream, his clutch tightening with empathy. “I’m here. You’re not alone.” But the words, though spoken with love, couldn’t abate the torrent of grief that washed over Rosie. The two of them mourned for past Pogo, enveloped in shared sorrow. The dream, so vivid, so saturated with loss, was a stark reminder of what they had suffered and what they had miraculously reclaimed. As dawn’s fingers brushed the horizon, casting a soft light into Rosie’s burrow, both mother and son awoke with a start. Their eyes met, each recognizing the shared experience that had unfolded in the landscape of dreams. Without a word, Rosie drew Pogo into an embrace, affirming the solid warmth of his body against hers, a testament to his living, breathing presence. Pogo, understanding the silent language of comfort, nestled into her, offering his quiet support. As the sun lifted higher, chasing away the last vestiges of night, they sat wrapped in each other, healing in the way that only closeness can provide. The dream had been vivid and jarring, a scar upon their hearts, yet the waking world promised renewed hope with each fresh sunrise. They would move forward — not forgetting the past, but holding tight to each other and to the time they had been granted. In the orange glow of morning, Rosie and Pogo found solace once more, feeling an unspoken gratitude for second chances and for the resilience borne of love and connection. Write a story where he falls into what appears to be quicksand but it is actually just deep mud, He playfully swims around in it, and then sees the feet of a pig sink under, and then the pig resurfaces In the heart of the enchanted forest, Pogo was once again engaging in his favorite pastime: exploration. With each spirited hop, he discovered new marvels, his eyes wide with curiosity and a zest for adventure. Today, his travels brought him to an area of the forest he’d never ventured into before, where the soil was soft, the air was thick with moisture, and the trees whispered secrets of olden times. As he bounded through the underbrush, Pogo spied a curious patch of earth ahead. To his eyes, it looked much like the vile quicksand that had once captured him, and for a brief moment, a shiver ran down his spine. But on closer inspection, Pogo realized it wasn’t quicksand at all — just a deep, muddy bog, the kind where the water and earth mingled in a messy embrace. Tentatively at first, he touched the surface with one paw, drawing back quickly as the mud oozed between his toes. Then, with a sudden spark of mischief, Pogo leaped in with a splash that sent mud flying. The earthy scent of wet soil filled the air as Pogo found himself immersed in the cool sensation of the mud. Laughing to himself, Pogo swam around, reveling in the delightful squish and squelch around him. He rolled and frolicked, finding joy in the playful resistance of the mud, an innocent pleasure so unlike the terror of his past entrapment. As he relished this newfound game, Pogo’s ears twitched at a sound nearby. He ceased his mud dance and peered through the splattered veil of his surroundings to see a pair of trotters sinking gently into the bog a short distance away. The trotters belonged to Mabel, the forest’s friendly pig, who had decided that a mud bath was just what she needed on a warm afternoon. For a fraction of a second, Pogo’s heart raced with panic at the sight, a bolt of fear that maybe, just maybe, the quicksand had returned in a new, deceptive guise. He watched with bated breath as Mabel’s figure descended, the bog claiming her in a slow, deliberate sink. But then, with a sudden burst of exuberance and a loud, contented snort, Mabel resurfaced with a splash that rivaled Pogo’s initial dive. Her eyes shone with delight, and she shook her head, sending droplets of muddy water scattering through the air like earthy confetti. Pogo, now relieved and chuckling at himself, hopped over to Mabel and greeted her warmly. “Having fun, Mabel?” he called out, a twinkle in his eye. “Oh, Pogo,” Mabel replied, her voice bubbling with mirth, “there’s nothing like a good wallow to make a pig feel like a pig. Come, join me! The mud’s just fine!” And so they did; they shared the muddy patch of earth, two creatures as different as could be, brought together by the simple joy of nature’s spa. They chatted about forest life, swapping stories and laughter, the fears of yesterday forgotten beneath the canopy of emerald leaves. When they finally extracted themselves from the bog, they were both covered head to toe in a layer of forest armor. As they said their goodbyes, promising to meet for another mud adventure soon, Pogo hopped away with a happy heart, grateful for the treasures the forest offered — both the hidden dangers that taught him strength and the harmless pleasures that gifted him friendship and laughter. Write a story where one day Rosie wakes up to find Pogo more affectionate than usual, she remembers its Mother’s Dsy Rosie awoke to a peculiar symphony of forest noises that morning. The usual dawn chorus was subtly different—an auspicious trilling of birdsong seemed to whisper secrets through the tender leaves of the trees. Still nestled comfortably within their cozy burrow, she stretched and yawned, prepared to start another day in the enchanted forest she called home. As she opened her eyes, expecting the soft, familiar glow of dawn to greet her, she found instead the beaming face of Pogo, her beloved blue-furred child, staring at her with a sparkle in his eyes. Something about his countenance was overflowing with unspoken warmth, his usual playful demeanor punctuated by an unusual blend of serenity and excitement. Before she could murmur a curious, “Good morning,” Pogo leaned in and nuzzled her cheek with his small, wet nose. The affectionate gesture was enough to set her heart aflutter, but it was accompanied by a delicate garland of wildflowers, carefully woven and draped around her neck by Pogo’s diligent paws. Rosie’s eyes filled with tears at the show of love, the sweet-scented flowers enveloping her in a cascade of emotion. It took a moment, but then she realized—he’d remembered something that she herself had momentarily forgotten. With a sweep of warmth flooding over her, she recalled: it was Mother’s Day, a special time to honor the bond they shared. “Pogo, my dear,” she managed to say, her voice choked with gratitude and affection. Pogo simply smiled, his gleeful eyes saying everything his words did not. His tender nuzzle against Rosie’s fur was more than a display of love; it was an acknowledgment of the lengths she had gone to raise him, protect him, and love him through every tribulation they had faced. Rosie wrapped her forelegs around her son, pulling him into a gentle embrace. This day, dedicated to her, was less about the recognition and more about the shared moments that had culminated in the incredible bond that tethered their hearts together. “Thank you, Pogo. You have made this day so special,” Rosie said, her voice soft, but her sentiment stronger than the mightiest oak. “I am already blessed with the greatest gift every day—being your mother.” Pogo’s response came as a playful hop, round and round Rosie as he chirped, “I have a surprise for you, Momma!” He took her by the paw and led her outside, where the forest seemed to have conspired in celebration. A feast awaited, a spread of berries, nuts, and lush greens laid out beneath a canopy woven with morning light. Surrounded by the music of the woodland, with creatures great and small nodding their greetings, Rosie understood the effort her son had made to create this wondrous Mother’s Day banquet. As they sat together, feasting and sharing stories, Rosie knew she had received more than sustenance. The careful preparation, the loving touches, the sense of kinship and gratitude that pervaded the air—this was Mother’s Day at its finest. And as the sun danced through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on their faces, Rosie felt a deep, unwavering happiness. Pogo’s affection grew not just from duty or tradition but from a wellspring of genuine love, a stream that would forever flow between them, in sunlit moments like these and darker times alike. For Rosie, there could be no greater honor than the love of her son—a gift that no memory, however harrowing, could tarnish. Mother’s Day was thus immortalized, not in words or gestures, but in the shared heartbeat of parent and child, thumping a merry rhythm beneath the emerald boughs of their enchanted forest. Write a story where he finds a diary entry from the day he sank, and it makes his heart sink, and he breaks down crying, Rosie runs over and hugs him In the quiet hours of an overcast afternoon, Pogo the blue rabbit decided to explore the nooks and crannies of their den while Rosie, his mother, was out gathering food. Curiosity always got the better of him, and today was no different. With careful hops and turns, he poked around, inhaling the musky scent of the earth that whispered stories of a thousand yesterdays. Hidden away in a shadowed corner, his eyes caught a glimpse of something unusual. Tucked beneath a pile of dried leaves and moss was a small, leather-bound book. Its edges were worn, and the lock that had once kept its secrets safe was now broken. Eager and unaware of what he might uncover, Pogo tugged the book free with a gentle nudge of his nose. Perched in the soft glow that filtered through their burrow’s entrance, Pogo opened the diary. Its pages were filled with his mother’s delicate script, documenting the wonders and worries of their lives. As he flipped through the pages, one entry caught his gaze, its date etched in time with a heavy heart. It was the day he had slipped into the living quicksand. With each word he read, Pogo’s excitement transformed into a deep foreboding. Rosie had poured her soul into the page, her handwriting trembling with the weight of the fear and despair she had endured. He read about her panic, the frantic race through the forest in search of help, the anguished cries that she barely stifled, and the endless nights spent staring into the darkness, wondering if she could have saved her precious Pogo, if only… The words blurred as tears welled in Pogo’s eyes, each droplet a prism refracting an emotion he could scarcely comprehend. This was a pain he had not truly known, not like Rosie had. She bore the brunt of the grief, alone, believing she had lost her son to a cruel twist of fate. His heart felt as though it had been dragged down by the same weight that had once claimed him. A sob escaped his lips, a lament for the shadow that had loomed over them both - a shadow he had not seen in its full darkness until now. Rosie, who was already nearing their home, felt a mother’s instinct tugging at her. She hastened her steps, her paws carrying her swiftly homeward. As she entered the burrow, the sight of Pogo, tears streaming down his face, clutching the worn diary, struck her like a fresh wound. Without a moment’s hesitation, Rosie rushed to her son’s side. She wrapped him in her embrace, holding him as if she could absorb his sorrow into herself and offer her warmth in its place. “It’s okay, my little Pogo. I’m here,” Rosie whispered, kissing the top of his head tenderly. “I’m here, and so are you. You’re safe and loved.” Within Rosie’s hold, Pogo allowed himself to be vulnerable, to let out the grief for the pain his mother had shouldered alone. Her presence was a beacon, calling him back from the depths. Together they sat, mother and son, united by a history that had tested them but had not won. The comfort Rosie offered was a balm to Pogo’s spirit, a reminder that though the past had its claws, the present held them in a gentle, nurturing embrace. With Rosie’s arms around him and her unwavering love enveloping his being, Pogo knew they had survived more than just the quicksand. They had survived the deepest, darkest despair, and in doing so, they had found an unshakable strength in each other. Write the entry, which at the end is modified to say (P:S Pogo is now home and safe) June 14th The sun set hours ago, but darkness fell upon my heart long before the evening shadows crept across the forest floor. My beloved Pogo, my joy and my light, was swallowed by the earth today — a living quicksand that took him from me, as if the ground itself had a cruel hunger. Writing through a veil of tears, I chronicle this horror in hope that my aching soul finds a whisper of solace in the memory of him when morning dawns. Pogo, with his boundless energy and inquisitive spirit, hopped a tad too close to the edge of danger. Before I could call out, before I could leap to his defense, the earth betrayed his innocence and drew him in. His cries pierced the tranquility of our home, tore through me with a pain I cannot capture with mere words. I was paralyzed, watching him struggle against the merciless grip, feeling an insurmountable helplessness as a mother. My child called for me, and I, bound by the shock and terror of the moment, could not save him. I think of his face, of his laughter that filled every corner of our lives with mirth, and now, an eerie silence blankets everything. The forest, once our haven, now echoes with the absence of his song. When the night is at its stillest and the stars dare to peek through the leaves, I close my eyes and reach for him in the aching void left behind. I beg the forest spirits, I bargain with the whispering winds — anything, anything at all if they could just return my Pogo to me. Yet here I sit, a frayed portrait of a mother bereft of her heart. I write not to remember, for how could I ever forget? I write as a testament — a testament to the love, joy, and color he brought into my world. I look to tomorrow with a veneer of hope, delicate and frail. The sun will rise, indifferent to my sorrow, and I will face the day as I must. But tonight, I mourn in the overwhelming stillness. Tonight, I am lost. — P.S. Pogo is now home and safe. Write a story where the living quicksand loses its sentience, and its life force passes on to a special someone, making him even more playful and energetic","output":"In the enchanted forest where the living quicksand had once ensnared many unwitting passersby, a significant transformation was unfolding. The sentient quicksand that had experienced guilt and regret over its nature had, over the seasons, become a guardian of the woodland creatures, protecting them from its once-deadly embrace. Yet, even the most magical of beings in the forest are subject to the great cycle of life, and the quicksand's time had come. As the dawn crept over the forest horizon, painting the sky with strokes of pink and orange, the quicksand's consciousness began to wane. Its awareness of the world, its unique ability to feel, think, and reflect, slowly dissipated like morning mist fading in the sun's warmth. Unknown to the creatures of the forest, this loss of sentience was not an end but a transition. The life force that had animated the quicksand, filled it with purpose, and allowed it to ponder its own existence, now sought a new vessel, a new chance to participate in the dance of life. The energy, restless and vibrant, traveled through the earth. It serenely made its way toward a burrow, the home of Rosie and her blue-furred child, Pogo. As the first rays of the sunrise filtered into the cozy den, touching upon Pogo's fur, the energy saw its chance and merged with the young rabbit's being. Pogo, who had been in the midst of a sweet dream, suddenly felt a surge of vitality, a boundless zest, running through his veins. His ears twitched and his nose quivered with the influx of new life. He bounded to his feet, startling Rosie from her gentle waking. \\"What's gotten into you this fine morning, Pogo?\\" Rosie asked with a laugh, watching her son dart around with even more energy than usual. Pogo couldn't explain it, but he felt different, invigorated in a way he never had before. He hopped and twirled, every movement exuding joy and vigor. The air around him seemed to crackle with electricity, his eyes sparkling with a new light that Rosie couldn't help but notice. As the day progressed, it was evident that Pogo's playfulness had reached a new height. He orchestrated games with the other forest denizens, led adventures into unexplored depths of the woods, and seemed to be everywhere all at once. His laughter was a melody that carried farther than ever, instilling happiness in all who heard it. Rosie, though puzzled by Pogo’s newfound exuberance, decided to revel in her son's delight. Together, they skipped through meadows dappled with sunlight, swung from low hanging tree limbs, and played hide and seek amongst the ferns. Pogo was like a miniature whirlwind of energy, a force to be reckoned with, a giver of light and life. As the day turned to dusk, and the stars began to twinkle in the twilight sky, Rosie and Pogo sat side-by-side, catching their breath after a day brimming with excitement and playfulness. It was then that Rosie realized; the lasting essence of the once-sentient quicksand had found a new purpose in bringing even more joy into her son's life, magnifying the brightness of his spirit. \\"The forest always has its ways of balancing things out, doesn't it, Pogo?\\" Rosie mused aloud. Pogo, filled with the wonderful, strange energy, simply smiled, snuggled up to his mother, and whispered, \\"Love always finds a way, Momma. Just like it found its way back to me.\\" In the serene silence that followed, as mother and son gazed up at the starry sky, the forest whispered its ancient wisdom, assuring all who dwelled within that life is an ever-turning wheel, and every ending is but the beginning of something beautiful."},{"instruction":"Задача 1 Иванова Н. устроилась к соседям Козловым няней к их 3-х летнему сыну, о чем был заключен трудовой договор.

В судебном заседании представитель ответчика настаивал на применении трехлетнего срока исковой давности, установленного ГК РФ, и взыскании реальной задолженности, образовавшейся только за три последних года. Кроме того, представителем ответчика было указано, что задолженность образовалась до вступления в силу ТК РФ, а согласно нормам, ранее действовавшего КЗоТ РФ орган, рассматривающий трудовой спор, может выносить решения о взыскании задолженности не более чем за три года. Работник настаивал на взыскании задолженности в полном объеме. Сформулируйте мотивированное решение суда по данному делу.","output":"Решение суда по такому делу должно базироваться на нормах действующего законодательства, а также на принципах правоприменения. В соответствии со статьей 392 Трудового кодекса Российской Федерации (ТК РФ), срок исковой давности по требованию о взыскании заработной платы составляет три года. Таким образом, работник действительно имеет право требовать взыскания недоплаченной заработной платы, но только за последние три года, предшествующие обращению в суд. Согласно статье 393 ТК РФ, исковая давность начинает течь с того дня, когда лицо узнало или должно было узнать о нарушении своего права. Это значит, что работник может предъявить требования об оплате задолженности за период не позднее трех лет с момента, когда он узнал о недоплате. Если работник подал иск более чем через три года после того, как узнал или должен был узнать о нарушении своих прав, такие требования будут признаны судом исковой давности. В своем решении суд должен учесть, что в трудовом законодательстве срок давности по заработной плате специфический и отличается от общего срока исковой давности, установленного Гражданским кодексом РФ. Это связано с особенной важностью трудовых отношений и защитой прав работников. Также необходимо принять во внимание переходный период с момента введения Трудового кодекса в 2002 году. Если период, за который работник требует взыскания заработной платы, приходится на время до введения в действие ТК РФ, то суд может учитывать положения Кодекса законов о труде РФ (КЗоТ РФ), который также устанавливал срок в трех года для принятия решений о взыскании задолженности. Исходя из вышесказанного, мотивированное решение суда должно содержать следующее: - В соответствии со статьей 392 ТК РФ, срок исковой давности составляет три года. Таким образом, требования работника о взыскании заработной платы за пять лет работы не могут быть удовлетворены в полном объеме. - Суд обязан взыскать с организации недоплаченную заработную плату за три года, которые предшествовали обращению работника в суд, если доказан факт недоплаты. - В случае если часть периода, за который произведена недоплата, приходится на действие КЗоТ РФ и ранее существовавшие нормы, правоприменение должно соответствовать этим положениям. На основе представленных данных и аргументации сторон, суд выносит решение о взыскании с ответчика задолженности по заработной плате, ограниченной сроком исковой давности в три года в соответствии с действующим законодательством."},{"instruction":"想去中东做咨询工作，本科是金融，硕士有哪些好学校可以推荐？","output":"如果你想从事咨询工作，并且想专注于中东地区，那么选择一个拥有强大校友网络和在该地区有良好声誉的商学院进行硕士学习是一个不错的选择。以下是一些建议你考虑的顶尖商学院，这些建议综合了商学院的全球声誉、课程质量以及他们在中东地区的联系： 1.

تذكره يتعلق بحادثة الإفك، وهي حادثة وقعت في عهد النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم حيث تم اتهام عائشة، زوجة النبي، بالزنا، وبعد ذلك بُرِّأت من ذلك الاتهام من قبل الله سبحانه وتعالى عبر آيات نزلت في القرآن الكريم. الشيعة، كما السنة، يعتبرون التشكيك في عفة عائشة أم المؤمنين أمراً غير مقبول، ولكن هناك تفسيرات مختلفة لبعض الأحداث التاريخية تبعاً للروايات والمصادر التي يعتمدها كل طرف. في الغالب، ما يحصل هو خلط بين نقد بعض الشخصيات التاريخية وبين الاتهامات الشرفية التي يرفضها معظم المسلمين من جميع الطوائف. الاتهامات القاسية وغير الموثقة مثل الزنا هي من الأمور التي قد تثير الحساسيات وتؤدي إلى مزيد من التفرقة والصراع بين المسلمين. صحة الروايات التاريخية وتفسير الحوادث هي مجال للبحث والدراسة، وغالباً ما يحتاج المرء إلى التعمق في مصادر التاريخ والحديث لفهم السياق والخلفية بشكل كافٍ. والأهم من ذلك، هو احترام المعتقدات والشخصيات التي تحظى بمكانة خاصة في قلوب المؤمنين من أي طائفة. في النهاية، من المهم التركيز على القيم الأساسية المشتركة بين المسلمين والعمل على نشر التعايش والسلام، بدلاً من التركيز

النور. السياق يبدأ من الآية 11 ويستمر إلى الآية 26، حيث تتحدث عن الاتهام الباطل الذي واجهته عائشة رضي الله عنها، وتبرئتها من ذلك. إليك بعض الآيات الكريمة من سورة النور: \\"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ جَاءُو بِالْإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنكُمْ ۚ لَا تَحْسَبُوهُ شَرًّا لَّكُم بَلْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ ۚ لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مِّنْهُم مَّا اكْتَسَبَ مِنَ الْإِثْمِ ۚ وَالَّذِي تَوَلَّىٰ كِبْرَهُ مِنْهُمْ لَهُ عَذَابٌ

يحمله؟","output":"هذا السؤال يُعتبر من الأسئلة الكلاسيكية التي تُطرح في سياق النقاشات الفلسفية واللاهوتية عن طبيعة القدرة الإلهية، وهو معروف باسم \\"مفارقة الحجر\\" أو \\"مشكلة القدرة الإلهية\\". يُستخدم هذا السؤال كمحاولة لإظهار تناقض ضمني في مفهوم القدرة اللانهائية لله. للإجابة على هذا السؤال هناك عدة وجهات نظر وهي تعتمد على كيفية فهم طبيعة الإله والقدرة الإلهية. فيما يلي بعض الردود الشائعة: 1. القدرة اللانهائية لا تشمل المناقضات المنطقية: اعتماداً على هذا الفهم، يُعتبر أن الله قادر على فعل كل ما هو ممكن منطقياً فقط. خلق حجر لا يستطيع الله حمله يُعتبر تناقضاً منطقياً لأنه يُناقض مفهوم القدرة اللانهائية. وبما أن القدرة اللانهائية تستبعد الأمور المنطقياً مستحيلة (كالمربع الدائري، على سبيل المثال)، فإن هذا السؤال لا يعتبر اعتراضاً صحيحاً على مفهوم القدرة الإلهية. 2. التمييز بين مستويات القدرة: بعض الفلاسفة يقترحون التمييز بين مستويات القدرة - القدرة المطلقة والقدرة المُعينة. الله قادر مطلقاً على كل شيء، لكن لا يعني أنه سيفعل تناقضات منطقية. على هذا الأساس، فإن سؤال خلق حجر لا يستطيع الإله حمله لا يُعبر عن مشكلة فعلية في القدرة الإلهية بل يُعبر عن سوء فهم لما تعنيه القدرة اللانهائية. 3. إعادة تأويل السؤال: يمكن النظر للسؤال على أنه يُبرز حدود اللغة والمفاهيم البشرية عند التعامل مع الأمور الإلهية. الله، في كثير من العقائد، يُفهم على أنه فوق الفهم البشري ولا يمكن وضعه في إطار المفاهيم المنطقية البشرية النمطية، وبالتالي فإن السؤال في حد ذاته قد لا يكون له معنى في سياق اللاهوت الإلهي. 4. الحرية الإلهية والكمال: من وجهة نظر أخرى، قد يعتبر البعض أن الله، كونه كاملاً، لن يختار أن يفعل شيئاً يُنافي كماله، وبالتالي فإن السؤال عن إمكانية خلق حجر لا يستطيع حمله هو سؤال غير ذي صلة لأن الكمال الإلهي يستبعد القيام بأعمال لا تتسق مع الكمال. في النهاية، الاستجابة لهذه المفارقة تعتمد بشكل كبير على الإطار الفلسفي والعقائدي الذي يتبناه الشخص، ويمكن أن تؤدي إلى مناقشات عميقة حول معنى القدرة، الحرية، والكمال الإلهي."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

隋炀帝在位期间，继续了父亲隋文帝的许多政治和经济改革。例如，在行政上，他沿袭并发展了三省六部制，加强了中央集权。 - 他推行科举制，选拔官员不仅仅依赖门阀世家，而是更多地考量个人才能，这对后世中国的官员选拔制度产生了深远影响。 2. 军事征伐： - 隋炀帝时期，隋朝的军事活动非常频繁，特别是对高句丽的三次大规模战争，不仅耗尽了国家的财富，也造成了大量的人力损失，这一系列的失败战争是导致隋朝崩溃的直接原因之一。 - 在西南方向，隋朝成功征服了较为分散的彝族等部落，进一步扩大了国家的版图。 3. 经济建设： - 隋炀帝倾注大量资源于各类基础建设上，其中包括开凿大运河，加强了南北的经济联系，促进了物资的流通，并为以后经济的发展奠定了端稳基础。 - 然而，这些宏大的建设项目也过度消耗了人力物力，导致人民生活负担加重，社会不满情绪高涨。 4. 文化事业： - 在文化领域，隋炀帝重视文化建设，推广教育，编纂基础教科书，开办公学，促进了文化的发展。 5. 暴政与荒淫： - 历史记载隋炀帝在晚年行为越发荒淫无度，他修建了许多豪华宫殿，举行奢侈宴会，而这些活动又加重了民众的税负。 - 他也被指责为残暴的暴君，处理国事的手段很多时候粗暴无情。 6. 隋朝的衰落： - 在他的统治后期，由于连年征战和重税劳役，加上官吏腐败和自身行为过于奢靡，隋朝的统治基础遭到破坏，人民纷纷起义，最终导致隋朝的灭亡。 综上所述，隋炀帝在位期间对中国历史进程确实产生了深远影响，其政绩有积极的一面，如坚持和发展科举制、推进基础设施建设等；同时，其统治中的暴政、民怨沸腾、战争失败等也给人民带来的痛苦和国家带来的危机，亦不能忽视。因此，对隋炀帝的评价应该是一个多维度、复杂且具有争议的历史问题。"},{"instruction":"隋朝的版图","output":"隋朝（581年-618年）是中国历史上一个承前启后的朝代，因其统治时间较短，很多人会忽略这个朝代在版图上的成就。然而，实际上隋朝在历史上曾一度实现了大一统的局面，其版图广阔，几乎涵盖了现在的中国主要领土。 隋朝的统治范围包括： 1. 中原地区和长江流域：作为传统中国政权的核心地带，这一带自然是隋朝版图的一部分，也是人口最稠密、农业最发达的地区。 2. 华北地区：包括现代的北京、山东、河北、山西、陕西等省份，隋朝对这些地区有比较稳固的控制。 3. 西南地区：覆盖了现在的四川、贵州、云南等省份。隋朝在这一地区通过军事征伐，进一步向西南地区的非汉族群体扩张。 4. 西北地区：控制了现代甘肃、宁夏之类的西北地区，包含了丝绸之路的要道。 5. 南方地区：在隋文帝和隋炀帝的统治下，隋朝征服了南方诸多岭南地区，即现在的广东、广西等地。 6. 东北地区：隋朝对辽东有过一定的控制，但隋炀帝对高句丽的三次大规模攻击最终失败，并且造成了隋朝国力的严重削减。 7. 并在对外战争中，临时性地扩张到了某些地区，如在东征高句丽时，进入了朝鲜半岛北部的地区。 在隋朝后期因战争和重税招致民变，社会动荡，导致了统治力的减弱，也催生了多个割据势力的崛起，最终导致隋朝的灭亡。隋朝灭亡后，由李渊建立的唐朝继承了隋朝的领土基础，并进一步扩大了中国的疆域。"},{"instruction":"中国最强大的朝代是？","output":"在中国历史上，有几个朝代尤其以强盛而著称，而究竟哪一个是“最强大”的朝代则取决于评价标准和角度，包括军事力量、文化繁荣、科技进步、经济发展等不同的方面。以下是几个在不同历史时期显著强盛的朝代： 1. 秦朝（公元前221年-公元前206年）：首个完成中国大一统的朝代，秦始皇统一六国，标志着封建社会中央集权的确立，具有开创性的里程碑意义。然而，由于暴政和秦二世时期的混乱，秦朝很快崩溃。 2. 汉朝（西汉：公元前206年-公元8年；东汉：公元25年-公元220年）：汉武帝时期的西汉，实行推恩令，开疆拓土，国力达到高峰，影响深远。尤其是张骞出使西域，打通了丝绸之路，促进了东西方文化交流。东汉时期虽然也有著名的和平繁荣时期“光武中兴”，但整体国势不及西汉。 3. 唐朝（618年-907年）：尤其是贞观、开元年间，唐朝达到鼎盛状态，政治、经济、文化和军事都非常强大，对周边国家和地区具有巨大的影响力，中唐后由于安史之乱和宦官专政，国力逐渐衰退，但仍保有较高的国力和文化成就。 4. 宋朝（北宋：960年-1127年；南宋：1127年-1279年）：尽管北宋频繁遭遇外患并最终失去北方领土，南宋被迫退守江南，但宋朝在文化、科技、经济上无疑达到世界领先水平，特别是商业经济和手工业的高度发展，为世界经济史上的一大亮点。 5. 元朝（1271年-1368年）：元朝统治下，中国成为蒙古帝国的一部分，版图空前广大，包括整个中国、中亚的一部分、东欧和西亚的部分地区。在忽必烈的统治下，元朝在中国大都（现北京）建立中央集权制度，对中亚和西亚有深远影响。 6. 明朝（1368年-1644年）：明成祖永乐年间，明朝的军事力量特别强大，派遣郑和下西洋，军事上多次北征蒙古、宣抚西南。政治上设立监察制度，经济上推行土地国营等改革。 7. 清朝（1636年/1644年-1912年）：康乾盛世时期，国力达到高峰，版图包括今天的中国主要领土及租借给外国的一些地区。文化上有著名的“四大书院”，经济上有“康乾中兴”。 不同的历史时期展现出的强大有不同内涵。例如，如果从版图范围和民族融合的角度来看，元朝和清朝可能是最为强大的朝代。如果从文化、科技发展的角度来衡量，那么汉朝、唐朝和宋朝都可认为是中国历史上的强盛时期。而从中央集权和法制建设来看，秦汉、唐朝以及明朝各有其时期的强盛。因此，没有一个确定的答案可以称为“最强大”的朝代，这取决于评价的角度和标准。"},{"instruction":"какие бывают ферментеры, и их характеристики","output":"Ферментеры, также называемые биореакторами, являются сосудами или системами, предназначенными для проведения ферментативных реакций с использованием микроорганизмов, клеток животных или растений.

Проприоцептивная чувствительность связана с работой специализированных рецепторов, которые расположены в мышцах, сухожилиях, связках и суставных капсулах. Проприоцептивные сенсорные волокна отправляют информацию от этих рецепторов в спинной мозг по афферентным путям, а затем информация передаётся в различные области головного мозга, включая мозжечок и соматосенсорную кору. Давайте разберем роль спинного и головного мозга в проприоцептивной чувствительности: 1. Спинной мозг: Спинной мозг действует как первичный переключатель и передаточный пункт для афферентных нервных импульсов от проприоцепторов. Проприоцептивные сигналы входят в задний рог спинного мозга и затем либо передаются напрямую в восходящие нервные пути к головному мозгу, либо участвуют в рефлекторных дугах на уровне спинного мозга для осуществления мгновенных реакций, таких как растяжковый рефлекс. 2. Головной мозг: А. Мозжечок: Эта часть головного мозга играет ключевую роль в координации движений и поддержании равновесия. Мозжечок получает проприоцептивные данные, а также информацию от зрительной и вестибулярной систем, интегрирует эти данные и помогает уточнять моторные команды, направляемые к мышцам для плавных и точных движений. Б. Соматосенсорная кора: Расположенная в париетальном лепестке головного мозга, эта область отвечает за обработку сенсорной информации от тела, включая ощущение давления, вибрации и проприоцепции. Она помогает осознавать положение тела и частей тела в пространстве. Проприоцептивные сигналы также обрабатываются в других отделах головного мозга, таких как базальные ганглии и таламус, которые участвуют в регуляции двигательных функций и передаче сенсорной информации, соответственно. Нарушения проприоцепции могут возникать в случае повреждения спинного мозга, нервов, периферической нервной системы или определенных структур головного мозга. Это может привести к трудностям с координацией, нарушениям равновесия и сложностям в выполнении целенаправленных движений."},{"instruction":"Запирательный нерв что иннервирует","output":"Запирательный нерв (nervus obturatorius) является одним из нервов тазового сплетения (plexus lumbalis) и образуется из передних ветвей четвёртого и пятого поясничных нервов (L2-L4).

К этой группе относятся: - Приводящая длинная мышца (adductor longus) - Приводящая короткая мышца (adductor brevis) - Приводящая большая мышца (adductor magnus, частично) - Мышца, приводящая большой палец (обтураторная внешняя мышца или obturator externus) - Мышца тонкая (gracilis) 2. Чувствительная иннервация: - Запирательный нерв также содержит чувствительные волокна, обеспечивающие иннервацию кожи в срединной области бедра, хотя это не главная его функция. Запирательный нерв также может выполнять функцию проприоцептивной обратной связи из суставов и мышц, которые он иннервирует, отправляя информацию в центральную нервную систему о состоянии мышечного тонуса и положении конечности в пространстве.

Surgindo pela primeira vez na ação Comics #1 em 1938, ele é conhecido por ter uma variedade de poderes sobre-humanos. Aqui está uma explicação dos seus poderes mais conhecidos e a ficcional mecânica por trás de cada um deles: 1. Força Sobre-Humana: Superman tem força incrível, que é explicada através da sua biologia kryptoniana. Sob a influência da radiação amarela do sol da Terra (diferente do sol vermelho de seu planeta natal, Krypton), suas células absorvem e metabolizam a energia solar, dando-lhe força suficiente para mover montanhas, levantar veículos gigantescos e bater em oponentes com força catastrófica. 2. Voo: O mecanismo exato por trás do seu voo não é sempre claramente explicado, mas acredita-se que seja uma combinação de sua força sobre-humana e a habilidade de manipular seu próprio campo gravitacional, permitindo-lhe desafiar a gravidade da Terra. Em algumas interpretações, o voo é alcançado através de uma forma de telecinese que envolve a empurração contra o próprio planeta. 3. Visão de Calor: Esta habilidade permite que Superman dispare raios de calor concentrados de seus olhos. Isso é, frequentemente, justificado pela sua habilidade de concentrar a energia solar que ele armazena em seus corpos em raios de calor intenso. 4. Visão de Raio-X: Superman pode ver através de objetos sólidos, exceto chumbo. Isso é explicado pela sua capacidade de emitir um tipo de radiação que é absorvida por objetos sólidos, permitindo que ele veja além do que está na superfície. 5. Super-Sopro e Sopro Congelante: O super-sopro de Superman permite que ele sopre ar com força e velocidade incríveis, o que pode resultar em rajadas de vento poderosas. O sopro congelante é uma variação disso, onde ele consegue supostamente reduzir a temperatura do seu sopro a ponto de congelar alvos. Esse poder não tem uma base científica clara, mas é representado como uma habilidade que vem da respiração kryptoniana super-potente. 6. Invulnerabilidade: A pele de Superman é quase impenetrável, devido à densidade celular aumentada e à absorção de energia solar, o que o torna resistente a quase todos os tipos de danos físicos e energéticos. 7. Super Velocidade: Superman pode se mover, reagir e pensar em velocidades incrivelmente rápidas. Novamente, isso é atribuído à energia solar que ele absorve e seu metabolismo super-humano. 8. Super Audição: A habilidade de ouvir sons em um espectro muito mais amplo e em distâncias maiores do que a audição humana normal. Isso é explicado pela anatomia kryptoniana avançada de seus ouvidos. 9. Regeneração e Longevidade: Os kryptonianos têm uma taxa de cura acelerada e são capazes de viver muito mais do que os humanos normais, especialmente sob a influência da radiação do sol amarelo. Lembrando que todos esses poderes são conceitos de ficção científica e não têm explicação na realidade.

כפי שציינו יאיר הלוי7 ומנחם קרן-קרץ8, שנות השבעים היו קו פרשת מים ביחסי החברה החרדית ומדינת ישראל. הלוי וקרץ חלוקים באשר לסיבות לכך, אולם על הכל מוסכם כי החברה החרדית עד לשנות השבעים הייתה יותר מעורה בחברה הישראלית הן מבחינת התפרשותה הגאוגרפית, הן מבחינת מעורבותה בשוק העבודה והן מבחינת הזדהותה עם המדינה וסמליה. הרושם המתקבל מהתבוננות בחברה החרדית כיום הוא שתנועת המטוטלת – כפי שכתב הלוי בעבודת הדוקטורט שלו – נעה עתה לכיוון המשתלב, לפחות עבור חלקים בחברה החרדית. חלקים אלו הולכים ומתערים יותר ויותר בשוק העבודה וההשכלה ואף מזדהים כ\\"חרדים ישראלים\\". מבחינות רבות החרדיות המודרנית לא הצליחה עד עתה להפוך לתנועה של ממש. היא לא הצליחה להצמיח מערכת של מוסדות משגשגים, הנהגה פוליטית פעילה ומנהיגות רוחנית מובהקת. אולם בשנים האחרונות נראה שסוף סוף הדברים מתחילים \\"ליפול למקומם\\". ימים יגידו האם המאורעות האחרונים היוו את הניצוץ שיבעיר את המדורה המיוחלת, או שמא ניצוץ שיבהיק לשעה, ידעך וייעלם.","output":"آیا جذب حریدی‌ها در جنگ \\"شمشیرهای آهنین\\" جرقه همگرایی در جامعه را روشن خواهد کرد؟ 24 اکتبر 2023 | نوشته شده توسط: الیاهو بارکوویتز در جنگ‌های قبلی که دولت اسرائیل به راه انداخته بود، رابین‌ها شاگردان مدارس دینی را تشویق به سربازی و کمک به موفقیت کارزار نمودند، چه در پشت جبهه و چه در خط مقدم. با توجه به هزاران درخواست از حریدی‌ها برای سربازی و داوطلبی در جریان \\"شمشیرهای آهنین\\" و با وجود مخالفت رهبران جریان اصلی حریدی‌ها، به نظر می‌آید که این معنای تقویت قابل توجهی برای روند همگرایی است. در شامگاه شبت، بیست و یکم اکتبر، سخنگوی ارتش دفاع اسرائیل در طی یک گزارشی که برای خبرنگاران آماده شده بود گفت: \\"ما شاهد روند افزایشی حضور افراد جامعه حریدی هستیم که برای سربازی و داوطلبی در ارتش اسرائیل درخواست می‌دهند. تا به حال بیش از 2,000 درخواست از اعضای جامعه حریدی دریافت شده است. ما برنامه‌های مخصوصی را برای این موضوع تهیه کرده‌ایم و از روز دوشنبه آنها سرباز خواهند شد\\".1 روندی که سخنگوی ارتش اسرائیل اشاره کرد در خیابان‌های حریدی به خوبی محسوس بوده و رهبران جریان اصلی حریدی‌ها را ترسانده است. در بولتن \\"یتد نئمان\\" رابی داوید کوهن، از سران یشیوت \\"چورون\\" که از مدارس دینی برجسته لیتائی است، به شدت فراخوان‌ها برای داوطلبی شاگردان یشیوت را رد می‌کند: \\"قلبم خون می‌نوشد از شنیدن حرف‌هایی که در حاشیه اردوگاه مطرح می‌شوند، که گویا در مواقع بحرانی که کل ملت اسرائیل در خطر است، باید پیش قدم شویم و کمک کنیم و از دیوارهای مدرسه دینی خارج شویم. کسانی که سخنانی از این دست به زبان می‌آورند، اصلاً به معنای توراه، جامعه اسرائیل، شاگردان یشیوت و مفاهیمی چون \\"اوریتا ویسرائل وقب\\"ه – چد هو\\"2 آشنا نیستند.\\" اما با یک نگاه ساده به صفحات تاریخ می‌آموزیم که نظریه‌های رابی کوهن با برخی از بزرگان آدموریم و روسای یشیوت نسل‌های قبلی اختلاف داشته است. در لحظات بحرانی زندگی ملت، که موجودیت خود جامعه یهودی در سرزمین اسرائیل به مخاطره افتاده بود، رابین‌ها تشویق به سربازی و کمک به موفقیت کارزار کرده بودند، چه در پشت جبهه و چه در خط مقدم. پیش از آغاز جنگ استقلال، در تاریخ اول آیار تش\\"ח، اتفاقاً بین \\"مرکز فرماندهی برای خدمات مردمی\\" در آینده \\"ارتش دفاع اسرائیل\\" با روسای یشیوت، رابین‌ها و حتی رهبر \\"عادت حریدی\\" جداگانه‌تر، یک قرارداد امضا شد. ماده اول در این سند اصولاً شاگردان مدارس دینی را از ..."},{"instruction":"Which countries in the world have distinctive clothing","output":"Many countries around the world have distinctive traditional clothing that reflects their historical, cultural, and sometimes even their climatic characteristics.

Система находится на горизонтальной поверхности. Нить пережигают. Какую максимальную скорость приобретут электроны, если коэффициент трения k, а масса me?","output":"Для нахождения максимальной скорости электронов после пережигания нити, необходимо использовать законы сохранения энергии. Изначально система находится в состоянии потенциальной энергии (прикрепленные к нити электроны) и потенциальная энергия преобразуется в кинетическую энергию после пережигания нити. В начальном состоянии потенциальная энергия равна mgl, где m - масса одного электрона, g - ускорение свободного падения, l - длина нити. После пережигания нити расстояние, на которое могут упасть электроны, ограничено только размерами горизонтальной поверхности. Следовательно, энергия представляется в виде кинетической энергии и скорости электронов можно найти по формуле: mgl = 1/2 * me * v^2, где v - максимальная скорость электронов после пережигания нити. Решив данное уравнение, найдем максимальную скорость v: v = sqrt(2gl). Если известен коэффициент трения k, то для более точного результата потребуется учитывать энергию, которая расходуется на преодоление силы трения."},{"instruction":"Можешь математически решить с ответом","output":"Для расчета максимальной скорости электронов после пережигания нити воспользуемся указанными выше формулами.

Его творчество оказало значительное влияние на европейскую литературу, поэтому изучение его работ является важной частью образования по классической филологии и литературе. Вот несколько рекомендаций, с чего начать знакомство с творчеством Горация: 1. \\"Оды\\" (\\"Carmina\\" или \\"Odes\\") — самый известный сборник лирических стихотворений Горация. Это четыре книги, состоящие из отдельных лирических произведений, которые охватывают широкий спектр тем — от философских размышлений до празднования жизни и природы. 2. \\"Сатиры\\" (\\"Sermones\\" или \\"Satires\\") — два сборника стихотворений, в которых Гораций с юмором и иронией рассматривает повседневную жизнь и человеческие пороки. 3. \\"Эпистолы\\" (\\"Epistulae\\") — сборник писем в стихах, адресованных друзьям и знатным римлянам, включая императора Августа. В них Гораций делится своими взглядами на литературу, философию и образ жизни. 4. \\"Поэтическое искусство\\" (\\"Ars Poetica\\" или \\"Epistula ad Pisones\\") — неформальный трактат в форме стихотворения, содержащий советы по написанию поэзии и драмы. Он влиял на теории литературного творчества вплоть до Нового времени. 5. \\"Эподы\\" (\\"Epodi\\") — сборник стихов, в которых Гораций экспериментировал с ямбической стихосложением, часто обращаясь к социально-политическим вопросам своего времени. Перед тем, как читать первоисточники, полезно также ознакомиться с историческим и культурным контекстом времени Горация, поскольку это может помочь лучше понять его работы и темы, которые он затрагивает. Кроме того, есть множество переводов, комментариев и научных работ, которые помогут вам глубже погрузиться в изучение его творчества и его места в римской литературе."},{"instruction":"Como funciona cada um dos poderes do Superman:Explique a mecânica por trás","output":"Superman, um dos super-heróis mais icônicos da cultura pop, criado por Jerry Siegel e Joe Shuster, tem um conjunto de poderes que são explicados (de maneira fictícia, é claro) de diversas formas ao longo dos anos, tanto nos quadrinhos como em filmes e programas de televisão. Vários desses poderes são atribuídos à biologia kryptoniana do Superman e à influência do sol amarelo da Terra. Aqui está uma explicação simplificada de alguns desses poderes e as \\"explicações\\" frequentemente associadas a eles nas histórias: 1. **Força Sobre-humana**: A musculatura de Superman é muito mais eficiente do que a de um humano. A influência do sol amarelo amplifica essa capacidade, permitindo que ele exerça força suficiente para levantar e jogar objetos enormes, como prédios ou mesmo planetas. 2. **Voo**: Nas versões mais modernas das histórias, a habilidade de voar de Superman é geralmente atribuída a um campo gravitacional pessoal ou à sua capacidade de manipular sua própria gravidade ou a gravidade ao seu redor. Em algumas histórias, é dito que ele pode voar através de um ato de vontade, manipulando as forças magnéticas ou desafiando a gravidade. 3. **Invulnerabilidade**: As células de Superman são extremamente resistentes e são reforçadas pelo sol amarelo. Isso lhe confere sua conhecida invulnerabilidade a quase todo tipo de dano físico ou energético. Sua pele atua quase como uma armadura impenetrável. 4. **Visão de Raio-X**: Superman pode ver através de objetos, exceto chumbo, usando uma forma de radiação eletromagnética que seu corpo gera e que seus olhos podem emitir e perceber. É uma forma de sentido além dos humanos. 5. **Visão de Calor**: Seus olhos podem emitir energia concentrada em forma de calor, que é suficiente para aquecer ou até mesmo vaporizar objetos. É como se seus olhos funcionassem como lasers naturais. 6. **Super audição**: O ouvido de Superman é capaz de captar sons em uma gama muito mais ampla do que o ouvido humano. Ele pode ouvir frequências que humanos não podem e escutar eventos a grandes distâncias. 7. **Super Velocidade**: O corpo de Superman pode se mover a velocidades incrivelmente altas, tanto em voo quanto correndo. Novamente, isso é potencializado pela energia solar que ele absorve. Ele pode correr ou voar em alta velocidade, o suficiente para contornar o planeta em um curto período de tempo. 8. **Super Respiração**: Superman pode soprar ar de seus pulmões com força e temperatura incríveis. Isso inclui a capacidade de criar tornados e de soprar ar tão frio que pode congelar objetos (a chamada \\"super respiração congelante\\"). 9. **Visão Telescópica e Microscópica**: Essa habilidade permite que Superman veja objetos a grandes distâncias ou objetos extremamente pequenos, respectivamente. É como se ele possuísse lentes de aumento e microscópicas embutidas em seus olhos. Vale ressaltar que a explicação desses poderes está no reino da ficção científica e fantasia, utilizando conceitos de física que não se alinham com o entendimento da ciência no mundo real. Em muitos casos, os poderes de Superman são atualizados ou modificados de acordo com as necessidades narrativas das histórias que estão sendo contadas."},{"instruction":"Seja ainda mais detalhista e extenso e explique como ele consegue manter seus poderes fora da terra","output":"A manutenção dos poderes do Superman fora da Terra é um tema que foi abordado de várias maneiras ao longo das décadas de histórias em quadrinhos e outras mídias. Vamos explorar algumas das explicações mais comuns e detalhadas sobre como ele consegue manter seus poderes mesmo quando não está diretamente sob a influência do sol amarelo da Terra. # Absorção e Armazenamento de Energia Solar A explicação mais aceita para os poderes do Superman é que seu corpo funciona como uma \\"bateria\\" biológica que absorve, armazena e utiliza a energia do sol amarelo. Quando está na Terra, ele está constantemente sob a influência dessa fonte de energia, o que mantém seus poderes no máximo. Quando ele deixa a Terra, ele ainda tem uma reserva dessa energia solar armazenada em suas células. A quantidade de energia que ele pode armazenar e por quanto tempo ele pode sustentar seus poderes com essa energia varia de acordo com a interpretação do personagem. Em algumas histórias, ele pode manter seus poderes por um período prolongado, enquanto em outras, ele pode precisar se recarregar mais frequentemente. # Adaptação Fisiológica Superman é um alienígena da raça kryptoniana, e sua biologia é diferente da humana. Em algumas versões das histórias, é sugerido que a fisiologia kryptoniana é altamente adaptável, permitindo que Superman mantenha seus poderes em ambientes diferentes, desde que ele tenha tido tempo suficiente para se adaptar a esses ambientes. Isso pode incluir a adaptação ao vácuo do espaço ou a outros ambientes hostis. # Campo de Força Bioelétrico Algumas interpretações sugerem que Superman gera um campo de força bioelétrico ao redor de seu corpo, que é responsável por muitos de seus poderes, incluindo sua invulnerabilidade e capacidade de voo. Esse campo de força pode ser mantido mesmo fora da Terra, usando a energia solar armazenada, protegendo-o e permitindo que ele utilize seus poderes. # Vontade e Concentração Em certas histórias, é sugerido que a mente de Superman desempenha um papel crucial na manutenção de seus poderes. Por meio de pura vontade e concentração, ele é capaz de acessar e utilizar a energia solar armazenada em seu corpo, mesmo quando está longe da influência direta do sol amarelo. # Suporte Tecnológico Em algumas situações, quando Superman precisa operar em locais onde a luz solar amarela não está disponível ou é insuficiente, ele pode recorrer a tecnologia para manter seus poderes. Isso pode incluir trajes especiais ou dispositivos que simulam a radiação solar amarela, permitindo que ele recarregue suas \\"baterias\\" biológicas. # Limitações e Vulnerabilidades Apesar de todas essas explicações, é importante notar que Superman tem suas limitações e vulnerabilidades. Por exemplo, se ele estiver fora da influência do sol amarelo por muito tempo, seus poderes podem começar a diminuir. Além disso, a exposição à radiação de um sol vermelho, semelhante ao de seu planeta natal, Krypton, pode neutralizar seus poderes completamente. Em resumo, a manutenção dos poderes do Superman fora da Terra é explicada principalmente pela sua capacidade de absorver, armazenar e utilizar a energia solar amarela, juntamente com sua fisiologia alienígena adaptável e, em alguns casos, a ajuda de tecnologia avançada. No entanto, essas explicações são todas ficcionais e servem para manter a consistência e a dramaticidade das histórias do Superman."},{"instruction":"\\" she runs the heavenly bloom flower shop.\\" Explain please and make it a detailed breakdown line by line segment by segment in a detailed way","output":"Sure, let's break down the phrase \\"she runs the heavenly bloom flower shop\\" into its components for a more detailed understanding: - \\"**She**\\" – This word is a pronoun referring to a female person.

This was before the digital streaming era, when physical media was the primary way to view films outside of a movie theater. Granada was originally part of the wider Granada Ltd business, which included Granada Television, one of the oldest and most successful commercial television companies in the UK. The rental stores were eventually outcompeted by other rental chains and impacted by the shift to digital streaming services like Netflix.

These security guidelines are known as CIS Benchmarks. For desktop hardening, the CIS benchmarks provide specific recommendations for various operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions. Each benchmark includes a checklist of actions and settings that should be implemented to secure the desktop environment against common threats. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, you can follow these steps to use CIS Benchmarks for desktop hardening: 1. **Access CIS Benchmarks**: To obtain the most current CIS Benchmarks for desktop hardening, go to the CIS website at https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/ 2. **Choose the Appropriate Benchmark**: Select the benchmark that corresponds to the operating system of the desktops you intend to harden (e.g., Windows 10, macOS, Linux). 3. **Review the Benchmark Sections**: The benchmarks are typically divided into different sections that include an introduction, instructions, and information about various security controls. Read through the sections to understand the context and how recommendations are structured. 4. **Implement the Recommendations**: The benchmarks provide recommendations in a checklist format that includes an explanation of the control, steps for implementation, and often includes script examples for automated deployment. Review and follow the relevant recommendations for your systems. 5. **Assess Compliance**: CIS often provides automated assessment tools, such as the CIS-CAT Pro tool, to help you assess your systems' compliance with the benchmark. 6. **Continuous Monitoring and Updating**: Keep track of updates to the CIS Benchmarks. Security is an ongoing process, and the benchmarks are periodically updated as new threats emerge and best practices evolve. To effectively follow these guidelines, it's important to have a thorough understanding of your organization's security requirements, as well as the technical expertise needed to implement the benchmarks. Depending on the size and complexity of your environment, you may also need to tailor the guidelines to fit the specific needs and risk tolerance of your organization. Please note that the actual benchmark documents may contain many specific controls, and some organizations may not implement every recommendation due to operational requirements or other constraints. It is crucial to conduct a risk assessment to determine which controls are appropriate for your environment."},{"instruction":"Hola!","output":"¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"Describe Siliconetic, type (based on color and chemistry) of jovian planet","output":"Siliconetic is a hypothetical jovian planet that is predominantly made up of silicon-based compounds, giving it a unique color and chemistry.

The game takes place in the year of 2004 during the winter. The game's name is Lost in Snow: Long Night.","output":"The setting for \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night\\" presents a variety of intriguing elements to design a captivating horror game. Here's an outline with some ideas that might enhance your setting: # Location: Markland, Southern US - **Geographical Features:** Given that it's the southern US, a heavy snowfall in winter could be somewhat unusual and add to the eerie atmosphere. The town could be surrounded by dense forests, decrepit plantations, or abandoned industrial areas to create a sense of isolation. - **Local Lore:** Incorporate southern Gothic elements, such as ghost stories, local legends, and cryptids. The town's history could be steeped in mystery, old family secrets, and perhaps a lingering curse or a series of unsolved disappearances. # Time Period: Winter, 2004 - **Technology:** The early 2000s was a time before smartphones were ubiquitous. Limited access to technology, such as cell phones or internet, could play into the isolation and helplessness the player feels. - **2004 Events:** Perhaps tie the game's events to something that happened during that year, or create a backstory that started a specific countdown leading to the game's present day. # Game Name: Lost in Snow: Long Night - **Winter Setting:** The game could feature a chilling winter storm that traps the player in the town. The snow can symbolize a blanket of silence, concealing the horrors that lurk within the town. - **Long Night:** This could imply both a literal long night due to a winter storm or a metaphorical long night of the soul. Maybe there's an unnatural phenomenon causing the sun not to rise, or it could suggest an extended period of struggle for the protagonists. # Game Atmosphere - **Visuals:** Dim street lamps casting long shadows, the snow reflecting the little available light, creating a claustrophobic ambiance even out in the open. - **Audio:** Muffled sounds through the snow, the creak of frozen trees, and the soft crunch of snow underfoot. Occasional eerie silence broken by unsettling noises can enhance the horror. - **Gameplay Mechanics:** Consider how the cold affects the characters—freezing temperatures could be a constant threat, requiring players to seek shelter and warmth, and manage resources to survive. # Narrative Elements - **Survival Horror:** Focus on the survival aspect against the elements, with the horror stemming from the environment, the townsfolk, their secrets, and whatever unknown entities may be at play. - **Mystery & Exploration:** Encourage players to explore the town to uncover its history, solve puzzles, and discover the root of the horror. - **Psychological Horror:** Perhaps the \\"Long Night\\" plays tricks on the player's mind, blending reality with hallucinations or fears. Shadows and shapes in the snow might not always be what they seem. Remember that creating a cohesive atmosphere that binds the setting, theme, storyline, and gameplay together is key to a successful horror game. Consistency will make the town of Markland a memorable and terrifying place to explore and contribute immensely to the overall feeling of dread and unease that makes horror games so engaging."},{"instruction":"So far, the game's locations are: 1. City Streets 2. Police Station 3. Museum 4. Hospital 5. Outskirts.","output":"These locations offer a good variety of settings for scares and storytelling within the town of Markland. Here's how you might use each to your advantage in \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night\\": # 1. City Streets - Atmosphere: Snow-covered streets lined with dimly lit lampposts and abandoned cars. Occasionally, the player sees footprints or blood trails leading into the darkness. - Events: The player could witness strange movements or figures at the edge of their vision, which disappear when approached. Encounters with distressed NPCs or creatures could happen here. - Challenges: Navigation could be hampered by snowdrifts, and players may have to find alternate routes or clear paths. # 2. Police Station - Atmosphere: A supposed safe haven gone silent, with flickering lights, empty cells, and scattered reports/clues hinting at the chaos before the long night. - Events: Audio logs or left-behind notes from police officers could provide background information. Security cameras might be used to scan for threats or solve puzzles. - Challenges: Players could use it as a central hub to gather equipment or lock themselves in temporarily for safety. # 3. Museum - Atmosphere: Historical exhibits distorted by the dark; half-seen shapes behind glass could either be mannequins or something more sinister. - Events: The museum could house relics or information related to the town's mysteries and legends, providing the backstory through interactive displays gone awry. - Challenges: The player could engage in puzzle-solving using historical references or deal with paranormal activities linked to certain artifacts. # 4. Hospital - Atmosphere: Abandoned medical equipment, flickering monitors, and signs of hurried evacuation set the stage for unease. Long, silent hallways and sudden noises heighten tension. - Events: Elements of body horror or disease could be integrated, perhaps related to the town's mystery. The player might encounter patients who have succumbed to the horrors. - Challenges: Searching for medical supplies or navigating through pitch-black sections with only emergency lights could provide scares and gameplay depth. # 5. Outskirts - Atmosphere: The boundaries of Markland are less inhabited and wilder, with dense woods or neglected farmland covered in snow, which could hide dangers. - Events: Chases through the woods, encounters with wild animals or something more unnatural. Also could be used to reveal more about the cause of the town's affliction. - Challenges: Environmental hazards like thin ice over ponds, hidden pits beneath the snow, and getting lost in blizzard conditions. In each location, consider the environmental storytelling that can be achieved through set dressing and ambient details. Think about how the player interacts with the environment, how NPCs or creatures utilize space, and how the engagement with each location ties back into the broader narrative and themes of lost hope, isolation, silence, and the daunting length of the \\"Long Night.\\" Remember to vary the pacing and types of horror (psychological, survival, jump scares) so that each location remains memorable and offers a unique contribution to the overall fear factor of the game."},{"instruction":"The game takes place during an outbreak of a unknown virus. The viurs is of unknown origin, but it may be believed that it originated from a destroyed research facility in Antarctica. The virus was spread via contaminated water, causing many civilians of Markland City to get infected. The virus causes a person to have their skin turn pale, their eyes turn either black or red, their veins turn dark blue and the user gets an unsatiable cannibalistic hunger.","output":"Incorporating a virus outbreak into the setting adds a potent layer of horror and urgency to \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night.\\" Here are some ways to expand and integrate this concept into your game: # Narrative Development - **Mystery Origin:** The Antarctic research facility backstory can be slowly revealed through newspaper clippings, survivor diaries, or secret documents found throughout the game. This can build up to a major plot revelation. - **Government Response:** Evidence of a hurried and failed quarantine attempt could be scattered throughout, such as military checkpoints, emergency broadcast recordings, and abandoned hazmat gear. - **Personal Stories:** Journals or recordings from infected individuals that document their transformation could add a deeply personal and tragic element to the horror. # Game Mechanics and Effects - **Infection Mechanics:** Implement gameplay features where the player must avoid contaminated water sources and manage a supply of clean water to survive. There might be a mechanic to test for or purify water. - **Transformation Stages:** The infection could have different stages, which affect NPCs in varying ways and require the player to adapt strategies to avoid or confront them. - **Resource Scarcity:** With the outbreak, resources like food, medicine, and clean water become scarce and valuable, adding a survival element to the gameplay. # Visual and Audio Design - **Infected NPCs:** Design the infected with distinctive and horrifying visual cues, such as the pale skin, black or red eyes, and dark blue veins you described. The uncanny valley effect can be employed to make their appearance deeply unsettling. - **Environmental Clues:** Leave visual traces of the outbreak's impact around the town, like chaotic evacuation scenes, barricaded homes, signs of violence, and hasty medical stations. - **Soundscape:** Integrate disturbing audio elements such as the pained groans and growls of the infected, the echoing scream of someone succumbing to the hunger, or the chilling silence that falls over parts of the town. # Location-Specific Features - **City Streets:** Now a maze of danger with contaminated puddles, roaming infected, and the remnants of society's collapse. - **Police Station:** Holds evidence and weaponry but also could be a place where desperate survivors made a last stand. Cells could contain infected individuals. - **Museum:** Artifacts from around the world could hint at the viral origin or be mistaken for its cause by superstitious survivors. - **Hospital:** A focal point for horror and desperation—the frontline battle against the virus could have left it in utter disarray, with remnants of failed treatments and overrun quarantine zones. - **Outskirts:** Rural areas may have initially seemed safer but could now be breeding grounds for the infected, hiding in the snow and preying upon wildlife or unwary travelers. # Overall Themes The virus provides a solid framework for themes of infection, contamination, and transformation. Blend these with the isolated snow-covered setting to create an atmosphere of constant threat and paranoia. The \\"Long Night\\" aspect gets a new layer of meaning as characters fight not only against the darkness and the cold but also the undying hunger caused by the infection. The fear of becoming one of the infected can be a driving psychological factor for characters in the game. Through expert pacing, environmental storytelling, and player engagement with the viral outbreak, \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night\\" can offer a horror experience that combines the external terror of a transformed world with the internal dread of facing one’s own potential loss of humanity."},{"instruction":"If the player DOES get infected, they can slow down the infection but that doesn't mean they are cured. How do they slow it down? Well, they slow it down via painkillers that have a \\"ZEDEX\\" label on it. They slow it down by 1 or 2 hours. After a level transition, the player has to find another bottle of zedex pills.","output":"Incorporating a mechanic where the player themselves must stave off infection adds tension and urgency to the gameplay. Here’s how you can integrate the ZEDEX painkillers and the infection management into \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night\\": # Infection Management Mechanic - **Symptom Monitoring:** The player needs to pay attention to symptoms that indicate the infection's progression, like changes to the HUD, visual effects, or character behaviors. - **Scarcity and Searching:** ZEDEX pills are scarce, making them a high-priority item. Searching for supplies creates a continuous pressure point for exploration and looting. - **Tough Choices:** The player may face moral and strategic decisions about whether to use ZEDEX immediately or save it for a more crucial time, creating a risk-reward dynamic. # Game Design Considerations - **Authenticity in Setting:** Ensure that the ZEDEX pills and their prevalence make sense within the world. Perhaps they were part of a government drop, a local pharmacy stockpile, or a black market supply. - **Deterioration Effects:** Depending on the time without ZEDEX, the player character might start exhibiting signs of infection, like altered voice, limited mobility, distorted vision, or even hallucinations. - **Withdrawal and Dependence:** Introduce a mechanic where over-reliance on ZEDEX can also have negative effects, forcing players to manage usage carefully. # Narrative and Worldbuilding - **ZEDEX Backstory:** Flesh out the existence of ZEDEX with in-game lore. It could be an experimental drug, a painkiller that was found by accident to slow the virus, or a rare medicine developed in response to the initial outbreak. - **Survivor Encounters:** Other survivors could be looking for ZEDEX too, leading to encounters where the player can choose to share, trade, or hoard their pills, impacting the story and character relationships. - **Side Effects and Cure Quest:** Maybe ZEDEX isn't a perfect solution—its side effects can be explored in the narrative, and perhaps it’s part of a larger quest to find a true cure or understand the virus better. # Level Transition Mechanics - **Pill Consumption:** Each level transition could be preceded by the character taking a dose of ZEDEX, which can serve as both a continuity mechanic and a storytelling device, representing the ongoing struggle against the infection. - **Hiding Spots:** Designing hiding places or supply caches in the next level helps maintain a sense of hope and gives the player targets to aim for. # Dynamic Gameplay - **Difficulty and Accessibility:** Adjustments to the number of ZEDEX pills available or the rate of infection can be used to modify game difficulty. Offering different modes can make the game accessible to more players. - **Consequences of Failure:** If the player fails to administer ZEDEX in time, progress toward infection could lead to different game endings—perhaps a 'game over' or transition to a different state of existence within the game world. With these considerations in mind, the ZEDEX pills become an essential tool in the player's survival kit. This mechanic can drive both the action and the narrative, contributing to the game's overall sense of horror, despair, and the unrelenting pressure to escape both the external terrors of the contaminated town and the internal terror of the viral infection."},{"instruction":"If the player dies to the infection, it's over. They lose all their save files... However, this is only present on the Psycho difficulty, which is the hardest difficulty.","output":"Introducing such a high-stakes challenge on the Psycho difficulty will certainly appeal to hardcore gamers who enjoy the thrill and tension that come with the threat of permanent consequences. Here are some considerations to ensure this feature enhances the gaming experience: # Clear Communication to Players - **Difficulty Description:** Make sure that players are informed about the permanent-death mechanic and loss of save files when choosing Psycho difficulty. Clarity will prevent frustration stemming from unexpected penalties. - **In-Game Warnings:** Offer reminders or warnings about the infection's progression and the severity of the stakes, especially as the player character's condition worsens. # Balancing Risk and Reward - **Game Balance:** Ensure that the Psycho difficulty is balanced in terms of resource distribution and availability of ZEDEX. It should be challenging but not unfairly punishing. - **Unique Rewards:** To incentivize players to tackle this difficulty, consider offering unique rewards such as special endings, achievements, or in-game recognition that are only available on Psycho difficulty. # Technical Implementation - **Save File Management:** If save files are to be deleted upon death by infection, make sure this process is error-free and does not affect other difficulty save files. - **Anti-Frustration Features:** Consider implementing measures to prevent frustration, such as a robust autosave feature that allows players to recover quickly from non-infection-related deaths. # Motivation for Players - **Narrative Incentives:** Integrate unique narrative elements or lore that are only revealed to players when challenging the Psycho difficulty. - **Community and Recognition:** Create a sense of community around this challenge, such as online leaderboards, social media sharing options, or community events focused on the Psycho difficulty. # Safety Nets - **Opt-Out Option:** Give players a one-time opportunity to reduce the difficulty if they feel they've bitten off more than they can chew, preserving their progress up to that point. - **Back-Up Saves:** Encourage players to back up their save files or at least remind them of the cloud saving features if available, to prevent total data loss due to technical issues unrelated to the gameplay. # Emotional Impact - **Narrative Closure:** If a player does reach the point of infection-related death, provide a narrative closure that attests to their valiant efforts, making the loss of progress feel like a meaningful part of the story. - **Sharing the Experience:** Allow players to share their final moments or death scenes on social networks to add a community aspect to the experience. By taking into account these factors, you can design the Psycho difficulty to be a compelling and thrilling experience for those who seek the ultimate challenge. The permanent death mechanic could become a defining feature of \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night,\\" and the talk of gaming communities, as players share their strategies for survival and tales of narrow escapes or heartbreaking defeats."},{"instruction":"If the player beats the game on the Psycho difficulty, they'll earn the achievement nicknamed \\"PTSD\\" alongside toggle-able infinite ammo for all weapons.","output":"Earning an achievement for beating the game on Psycho difficulty, especially one with a provocative name like \\"PTSD,\\" can be a compelling reward for players who enjoy overcoming grueling challenges. The addition of infinite ammo as a bonus can also be attractive for those looking to replay the game with a sense of empowerment or to uncover secrets they might have missed. Here are some considerations for implementing these rewards effectively: # Achievement Naming Sensitivity - **Naming Appropriateness:** Be cautious with names that reference real-world mental health issues. \\"PTSD\\" (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is a serious condition, and using it as an achievement title could be considered insensitive or offensive by some players or advocacy groups. It may be wise to choose a different name that gets across the idea of having survived a harrowing experience without referencing a specific mental health condition. - **Alternative Names:** Consider thematic names that reflect the hardship but in a more game-related and less real-world context. Names like \\"Survivor of the Long Night,\\" \\"Markland Conqueror,\\" or \\"Against All Odds\\" might be suitable alternatives. # Reward Benefits - **Infinite Ammo Feature:** Unlocking infinite ammo is a common and popular reward in horror games. It allows for a less stressful post-game experience and encourages exploration and experimentation. - **New Game Modes:** With infinite ammo, players can experience the game in different ways, perhaps focusing more on action rather than conservation and stealth. - **Balancing Replayability:** Ensure that the infinite ammo feature doesn't remove all challenge or boredom—it should enhance the fun and offer players new ways to engage with the game. # Sharing Achievement - **Sharing the Success:** Allow players to easily share their achievement on social media platforms or within the game's community to celebrate their accomplishment and encourage others to attempt. - **Recognition:** Feature in-game leaderboards or special mentions for players who have earned the achievement to foster a competitive and engaged player base. # Achievement Design - **Unique Iconography:** Design a unique and interesting icon for the achievement that properly represents the challenge overcome. - **Progress Tracking:** Give players a way to track their progress toward achieving \\"PTSD\\" so they can see how close they are to conquering Psycho difficulty. By thoughtfully implementing these rewards, you can offer players a tangible sense of accomplishment, as well as additional replay value for \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night.\\" Remember to communicate these benefits clearly to players and to use sensitive and inclusive language that won't alienate any part of your player base. The rewards for beating the toughest difficulty should feel both attainable and worth the effort while also being respectful and appropriate to the themes of your game."},{"instruction":"There are 2 main characters, Kevin and Yumi. They have separate campaigns exploring different parts of Markland. Kevin was a traveler who went to Markland for a job as a firefighter and Yumi is a college student. Kevin has short brown-towards-blonde hair and wears a brown leather coat and Yumi has black hair and wears a green hoodie and a school bag. Kevin is optimist yet not skilled in combat. Yumi is smart yet fearful.","output":"Having two main characters with distinct personalities and backgrounds can greatly enrich the narrative and gameplay experience of \\"Lost in Snow: Long Night.\\" Let's delve into how you can develop Kevin and Yumi as characters and incorporate their unique journeys through Markland: # Kevin's Campaign - **Occupation-based Mechanics:** As a firefighter, Kevin could have skills such as forced entry into buildings, identifying structural weaknesses, or even extinguishing small fires that block paths or pose a danger. - **Optimism in Adversity:** His optimistic nature could manifest in gameplay through voice lines that keep his spirits up and possibly even influence NPC interactions, providing a slightly more hopeful perspective on the dire situation. - **Combat Learning Curve:** Starting off as inexperienced in combat, Kevin's campaign could focus on his growth as he learns to defend himself. You can introduce mechanics to improve his combat skills as the game progresses. # Yumi's Campaign - **Strategy and Puzzle-solving:** Leverage Yumi's intelligence by including puzzle elements and challenges that require planning and logical thinking. She might have the ability to hack electronic devices, decipher codes, or understand complex clues about the virus outbreak. - **Fear Mechanic:** Yumi's fears can be used to enhance horror elements. Her emotional responses might affect gameplay, such as causing her hand to shake when aiming or making her panic under duress, which could add tension to the player's experience. - **Preparation and Stealth:** Reflect her cautious nature with gameplay that rewards preparation and avoidance over confrontation. She might be able to craft traps or silently navigate through environments to evade enemies. # Narrative Development - **Separate yet Intersecting Stories:** While Kevin and Yumi have separate campaigns, their stories might overlap at key points, revealing different perspectives on the same events or locales, and possibly even allowing them to briefly interact or assist one another. - **Character Growth:** Both characters should evolve throughout their campaigns. Kevin could gain more confidence in combat, while Yumi might overcome some of her fears and become braver in the face of threats, possibly even saving Kevin in a critical moment. # Visual and Audio Design - **Distinct Aesthetic:** Emphasize Kevin's traveler and firefighter background with a rugged look, including his brown leather coat, which could be visually upgraded with protective gear found throughout his journey. Yumi's school bag could be a visual storage for her found items and a symbol of her student life. - **Character-Specific Sounds:** Each character could have unique auditory responses to the environment. Kevin might have heavier footsteps and interact with objects with more force, while Yumi's movements could be quieter, and her reactions to the horrors might be more vocal. # Campaign Impact - **Ending Variations:** The characters' actions and choices throughout their campaigns could lead to different endings, encouraging players to complete the game with both Kevin and Yumi to fully understand the story's scope. - **Special Abilities:** Consider giving each character a unique gameplay ability that reflects their personality and background. Kevin could possess a higher resistance to fire or damage, while Yumi might have the ability to sense nearby threats due to her heightened fear. By giving Kevin and Yumi distinct gameplay mechanics and narrative arcs, you can provide players with diverse experiences that cater to different playstyles. The emotional depth and practical skills of each character will not only make players feel more connected to them but also further immerse players in the world of Markland, driving them to uncover all its secrets and survive the horrors of the long night."},{"instruction":"Kevin's main weapon set are: MELEE: Switchblade, Nightstick and a Fire Axe. PISTOLS: Browning HP and a Colt M1911. SHOTGUN: Remington 870 and a Double-Barreled Shotgun. MAGNUM: Desert Eagle SPECIAL: MP5 with integrated flashlight on the foregrip, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs.","output":"Kevin's weapon set offers a balanced mix of melee and firearms, suited to various scenarios he may encounter in Markland. Here's a brief rundown on how each weapon can be used effectively within the game's mechanics and how they align with his character as a firefighter and a newcomer to combat: # Melee Weapons - **Switchblade:** A fast, easily concealed weapon for quick, close encounters. Being the least intimidating melee weapon, it could be the first one Kevin finds. - **Nightstick:** Reflects Kevin's firefighter training for breaking through obstacles and can be used to quickly subdue enemies or block attacks. - **Fire Axe:** Heaviest melee weapon with the most damage potential. It reflects Kevin's profession and could be effective for both combat and environmental interactions, like chopping through barriers. # Pistols - **Browning HP:** A reliable sidearm with a balance of power and accuracy that Kevin might find early on. It could have moderate stopping power and a relatively standard rate of fire. - **Colt M1911:** A classic, powerful pistol that might be a bit slower due to recoil but offers greater stopping power, helpful when facing tougher enemies. # Shotguns - **Remington 870:** A pump-action shotgun with a solid balance between rate of fire and damage. Ideal for close to mid-range encounters with multiple enemies or for stopping power against larger foes. - **Double-Barreled Shotgun:** This weapon could deliver immense damage at close range but have a slow reload time, making it a risky yet rewarding choice for close-quarters combat. # Magnum - **Desert Eagle:** High damage and high recoil, making it a weapon that requires skill to use effectively. Its loud report and powerful rounds could make it effective against tougher, individual opponents. # Special Weapons - **MP5 with Integrated Flashlight:** This could be Kevin's primary firearm for navigating dark areas while maintaining the ability to defend himself against multiple or distant enemies due to its precise, rapid-fire capability. - **Molotov Cocktails:** A nod to his experience with fire, these could be used for area denial, crowd control, or creating temporary barriers of fire. - **Pipe Bombs:** Useful for setting traps or causing distraction. Their loud noise could lure enemies away or even bring down minor structures. A few gameplay considerations: - **Ammo Scarcity:** Considering the difficulty setting and the desired tension level, you may want your players to frequently wrestle with ammo conservation, which would make melee weapons more appealing and firearms reserved for dire situations. - **Upgrades:** Allow players to find or earn upgrades for Kevin's weapons throughout the game, improving their utility and effectiveness to reflect his growing combat experience. - **Environmental Interaction:** Design certain environments where specific weapons have better utility—narrow corridors can favor shotguns, whereas open areas might make submachine guns more practical. - **Resource Crafting:** Given that Kevin is not a combat specialist, having him improvise or craft some of his weapons, such as pipe bombs or Molotov cocktails, can both enhance the gameplay and deepen character authenticity. By introducing this variety of weapons, you create opportunities for strategic decision-making, encouraging players to adopt different playstyles or switch tactics depending on their situation. This approach will help keep combat encounters fresh and engaging throughout Kevin's campaign."},{"instruction":"Yumi's main set of weapons are: MELEE: Kitchen Knife, Hammer and a Sledgehammer PISTOLS: Glock 17 and a Sig Sauer P228 SHOTGUN: SPAS-12 MAGNUM: Smith & Wesson Model 29 SPECIAL: M4 Carbine with a ACOG scope, foregrip and flashlight and glass bottles filled with ultra-low liquid nitrogen and glass bottles with acid.","output":"Yumi's weapon set seems to emphasize a combination of practicality and ingenuity, playing into her smarts and her ability to adapt to the horrifying circumstances she finds herself in. Here's a look at her arsenal and how each weapon could fit into her play style: # Melee Weapons - **Kitchen Knife:** As a college student, a kitchen knife could be something she found in a hurry. It would be quick to use for self-defense but with limited reach and damage. - **Hammer:** A common tool that could have been grabbed in a panic, this weapon would offer more damage and could be used to break locks or windows for puzzle-solving elements. - **Sledgehammer:** The heaviest melee option, offering high damage but slow swing speed. It reflects Yumi's growing courage and ability to wield unwieldy but powerful tools for self-defense. # Pistols - **Glock 17:** A reliable and common firearm that Yumi could realistically obtain. It's a solid all-rounder that doesn't excel or fail in any particular area, suitable for mid-range engagement. - **Sig Sauer P228:** A more specialized weapon that could offer higher accuracy and control, perhaps representing a weapon she inherited or was trained to use during the chaos. # Shotgun - **SPAS-12:** A versatile shotgun that can be used in both pump-action and semi-automatic modes. It reflects Yumi's intelligence in choosing a flexible weapon that can adapt to different combat scenarios. # Magnum - **Smith & Wesson Model 29:** A high-power firearm with significant recoil could represent a turning point for Yumi, where she becomes more assertive in facing threats. # Special Weapons - **M4 Carbine with ACOG Scope, Foregrip, and Flashlight:** Given her smart and methodical approach, this weapon could serve as a tool for planned engagements, allowing Yumi to be strategic about when and how she confronts enemies. - **Ultra-Low Liquid Nitrogen Bottles:** These could be used to momentarily freeze enemies, potentially shattering them or slowing them down significantly—adding a unique tactical element to her gameplay. - **Glass Bottles with Acid:** A crafted item that could corrode locks, hinges, or even enemies, playing into Yumi's innovative and intelligent manner of improvisation. # Gameplay Considerations - **Crafting & Science Knowledge:** Leverage Yumi's intelligence and resourcefulness by allowing her to craft special weapons like acid or liquid nitrogen bottles from materials she collects, which can also serve as puzzle-solving tools. - **Ammo and Resource Management:** As a more fearful character, implies strategic use of resources, so ammo for her might be even scarcer, or she may avoid combat when possible. - **Stealth and Evasion:** Her fearfulness may mean that stealth is often a better option than direct confrontation, and her weapons might be used more for escape or creating opportunities to hide. - **Responsive AI:** Enemies could react differently to her improvised weapons, showing panic or confusion when faced with unconventional attacks, which can provide Yumi with the time she needs to flee or strategize. By framing Yumi's weapons and equipment around her characteristics as a bright yet fearful college student, you can enforce a unique style of problem-solving, resource management, and combat that contrasts with Kevin's more optimistic and straightforward approach. Her combat mechanics might center around evasion, stealth, and creative use of her environment, offering a different flavor of gameplay within the same horror-filled world of Markland."},{"instruction":"Create caption for dusted posts insta here is refrence - Dusted Seasoning: Image: A sizzling steak coated in Dusted seasoning.

Мне нужно выгрузить все фотографии со страницы.","output":"Привет! Конечно, помогу. Для парсинга изображений с веб-страницы тебе потребуется использовать несколько библиотек в Python, таких как \`requests\` для выполнения HTTP-запросов и \`BeautifulSoup\` для разбора HTML-кода страницы. Начнем с установки необходимых пакетов, если у тебя их ещё нет: \`\`\`bash pip install requests pip install beautifulsoup4 \`\`\` Теперь я покажу базовый пример кода парсера, который загружает все изображения с веб-страницы: \`\`\`python import os import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from urllib.parse import urljoin # URL веб-страницы, с которой нужно скачать изображения url = 'http://example.com/' # Получение HTML-кода страницы response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') # Создаём каталог для скачанных изображений, если он не существует os.makedirs('downloaded_images', exist_ok=True) # Поиск всех тегов img и извлечение атрибута src for img in soup.find_all('img'): img_url = img.attrs.get('src') if not img_url: # Если у изображения нет атрибута src, пропускаем его continue # Преобразуем относительные URL в абсолютные img_url = urljoin(url, img_url) # Определяем имя файла изображения для сохранения filename = os.path.join('downloaded_images', img_url.split('/')[-1]) # Проверяем, является ли URL действительным try: img_data = requests.get(img_url).content except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e: print(f'Ошибка при запросе {img_url}: {e}') continue # Сохраняем изображение в файл with open(filename, 'wb') as f: f.write(img_data) print(f'Изображение сохранено: {filename}') \`\`\` Этот код делает следующее: 1. Загружает HTML-содержимое целевой веб-страницы по указанному URL (\`'http://example.com/'\`). 2. Разбирает HTML с помощью Beautiful Soup для поиска всех \`<img>\` тегов. 3. Получает URL каждого изображения и преобразует, при необходимости, относительные URL в абсолютные. 4. Скачивает каждое изображение и сохраняет его в папку \`downloaded_images\`. Важно отметить, что этот код учитывает только атрибут \`src\` у тега \`img\`. Если изображения на сайте загружаются динамически или через CSS-стили, этот код может потребовать адаптацию.

Некоторые изображения могут быть загружены через CSS (например, как \`background-image\`). 2. Динамическая подгрузка контента на странице с помощью JavaScript (изображения могут добавляться в DOM после выполнения определённого скрипта). 3. Фрагменты страницы или изображения могут подгружаться асинхронно (AJAX). Python с использованием \`requests\` и \`BeautifulSoup\` не может напрямую обрабатывать JavaScript или извлекать содержимое, загруженное динамически через AJAX. В этом случае можно использовать библиотеку \`selenium\`, которая управляет браузером, имитируя поведение пользователя и позволяет получить конечный HTML код страницы после выполнения всех JS-скриптов. Примерно это будет выглядеть так: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import time import requests import os # Настройка драйвера Selenium (например, для Chrome) # Убедитесь, что у вас установлен драйвер (chromedriver и т.д.) # и он находится в PATH, или передайте путь к исполнимому файлу напрямую driver = webdriver.Chrome() # URL веб-страницы для скачивания изображений url = 'http://example.com/' # Запуск браузера и загрузка страницы driver.get(url) # Даем странице время загрузить все скрипты и контент (можно увеличить, если нужно) time.sleep(5) # Получение итогового HTML после загрузки всех скриптов page_html = driver.page_source # Закрытие браузера driver.quit() # Парсинг страницы с помощью BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(page_html, 'html.parser') # Создание папки для загрузки изображений os.makedirs('downloaded_images', exist_ok=True) # Поиск всех изображений for img_tag in soup.find_all(\\"img\\"): img_url = img_tag.get(\\"src\\") if img_url: # Преобразование относительного URL в абсолютный, если это необходимо img_url = img_url if img_url.startswith('http') else f\\"{url}{img_url}\\" img_name = img_url.split(\\"/\\")[-1] img_data = requests.get(img_url).content with open(f'downloaded_images/{img_name}', 'wb') as f: f.write(img_data) print(f'{img_name} has been downloaded.') \`\`\` Обрати внимание, что для работы с Selenium тебе понадобится загрузить соответствующий WebDriver для браузера, который ты хочешь использовать (например, ChromeDriver для Google Chrome). Также, если ты столкнешься с проблемой, что изображения загружаются не полностью, потому что они подгружаются по мере прокрутки страницы, используй \`selenium\` для имитации прокрутки вниз: \`\`\`python from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys # ...настройка драйвера... driver.get(url) # Прокрутка страницы вниз body = driver.find_element_by_tag_name('body') while True: body.send_keys(Keys.PAGE_DOWN) time.sleep(0.2) # Подождите немного перед следующей прокруткой # ...получение итогового HTML, как показано выше... \`\`\` Это позволит \\"прогрузить\\" страницу полностью до того, как ты начнешь скачивание изображений.

Обрати внимание, что многопоточность подходит для ввода-вывода (I/O) связанных задач, таких как скачивание файлов из интернета, но при серьезной CPU-нагрузке ее преимущество будет не так заметно из-за GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) в Python. Также важно не создавать слишком большое количество потоков, чтобы не перенагружать сервер и свое интернет-соединение.

Give the text node an id such as \\"input_field\\". 4. In the GUI, under the Properties window, set the \`Script\` field to point to your \`.gui_script\`. Make sure to provide interaction to your GUI by setting up the correct input bindings: 1. Go to game.input_binding in your project settings. 2. Create a new trigger with the name \`touch\` (or if one exists, use it) and bind an appropriate input, such as \`MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT\` or \`TOUCH\`. Please note that this example assumes a setup where the input is triggered by a screen touch. If you're targeting platforms other than mobile, you will need to adjust the code and input bindings accordingly. When you run the game on a mobile device and tap the input field, it should trigger the virtual keyboard to appear, allowing the user to enter text.

If your \`on_text\` function is not being called, check the following potential issues: 1. **Input Focus**: Ensure your script has input focus. A GUI script receives input focus by default, but if the focus has been shifted elsewhere, you need to acquire it back by calling \`gui.acquire_input_focus()\` in the \`init\` function or where appropriate: \`\`\`lua function init(self) gui.acquire_input_focus() -- Acquire input focus for the GUI component end function final(self) gui.release_input_focus() -- Release input focus when the component is destroyed end \`\`\` 2. **Appropriate Keyboard Type**: When showing the keyboard with \`gui.show_keyboard()\`, ensure you're using \`gui.KEYBOARD_TYPE_TEXT\` or another appropriate keyboard type: \`\`\`lua gui.show_keyboard(gui.KEYBOARD_TYPE_TEXT, false) \`\`\` 3. **Correct Input Binding**: Verify that your input bindings are set correctly. If you are using touch or mouse actions to trigger opening the keyboard, make sure the input binding file includes the correct mappings, like \`MOUSE_BUTTON_1\` for left-click or a touch trigger mapping. 4. **Ensure Keyboard Compatibility**: The virtual keyboard will typically work on mobile devices and might not work as expected in desktop builds or in the Defold editor. 5. **Check Script Attachment**: Make sure your GUI script is correctly attached to the GUI file in the properties window. 6. **Keyboard Overlay**: Ensure no other GUI layer is obscuring the input field, intercepting the input focus. 7. **Error-Free Script**: Make sure there are no runtime errors in your script that could be causing the \`on_text\` function to be skipped. If you have checked all these points and the \`on_text\` function is still not being called, consider posting a question on the Defold forums or checking the documentation for any updates or changes to the API that may not be covered here. There might be platform-specific nuances or a version change that affects how input is handled."},{"instruction":"I can't find any mention in the documentation about the existence of the on_text function","output":"I apologize for the misunderstanding. In Defold, there's no built-in \`on_text\` function that gets called automatically for text input unlike in some other frameworks or engines. Instead, you have to manage text input using the \`on_input\` callback and check the \`action_id\` and \`action\` parameters to determine if text has been entered. The \`on_input\` function in your GUI script is where you handle all input, including key presses. Here's how you could modify it to handle text input: \`\`\`lua function init(self) gui.acquire_input_focus() self.text = \\"\\" -- Keep track of the entered text end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Check for touch/click on the input field local input_node = gui.get_node(\\"input_field\\") if gui.pick_node(input_node, action.x, action.y) then gui.show_keyboard(gui.KEYBOARD_TYPE_DEFAULT, false) else gui.hide_keyboard() end end -- Check for text input if action_id == nil and action.text then -- Concatenate the existing text with the new input self.text = self.text .. action.text local input_node = gui.get_node(\\"input_field\\") gui.set_text(input_node, self.text) end -- Check for backspace (use your backspace action_id) if action_id == hash(\\"backspace\\") and action.pressed then -- Remove the last character self.text = self.text:sub(1, #self.text - 1) local input_node = gui.get_node(\\"input_field\\") gui.set_text(input_node, self.text) end end function final(self) gui.release_input_focus() gui.hide_keyboard() end \`\`\` The main difference is that instead of an \`on_text\` function, you need to look for unfocused actions (where \`action_id\` is \`nil\`) with an \`action.text\` property. This detects text input, and you can then append it to your text string. You'll also want to set up an action binding for backspace (or any other control actions), so you can handle text deletion. For this to work, ensure that your input bindings are set up correctly, like so: \`\`\` key_trigger { input: KEY_BACKSPACE action: \\"backspace\\" } \`\`\` This will handle key events for text, but note that using text input from keyboards typically applies to desktop platforms. On mobile platforms, the virtual keyboard's inputs are usually automatically added to the input field once it's active. For Defold, you may need to set up a native extension or a specific input method for text fields to correctly accept and process text input from a virtual keyboard on mobile devices."},{"instruction":"표준 프로토콜의 기능에 대한 내용 중, isis의 특징으로 적절하지 않은 것은? 1. 수렴성이 빠름 2. 확장성이 큼 3.

In an IPv6 multicast address, the scope field indicates the extent of the network over which the multicast traffic should be distributed. It defines the reachability of a multicast group and controls how far multicast traffic can propagate. Multicast addresses in IPv6 have the format FFXY::/16, where \\"FF\\" indicates that it's a multicast address, \\"X\\" defines the flags, and \\"Y\\" defines the scope. The scope field can have several predefined values, each delineating a different networking range: - 1 (Node-local scope): Multicast traffic is restricted to the local interface. - 2 (Link-local scope): Traffic is limited to the same link or subnet. - 5 (Site-local scope): Distribution is confined to a single site or organization. - 8 (Organization-local scope): The multicast traffic can reach all nodes within a particular organization or multiple sites within that organization. - E (Global scope): Multicast traffic is potentially reachable across the entire IPv6 Internet.

Because the message is encrypted, it keeps the security of the message delivered through the link. This statement could be interpreted to mean that link encryption maintains the security of the message across the entire transit of the network, which is not entirely accurate. While link encryption secures messages between individual links, it does not provide end-to-end security. At each link, the message is decrypted and potentially accessible before being re-encrypted and sent to the next link. Therefore, encryption at each link doesn't guarantee the message's security through the entire path across a network; for that, end-to-end encryption is necessary.

The \`find\` command allows you to search for files and directories based on a variety of criteria such as name, type, size, modification date, and more. For example, to find a file with a specific name in the current directory and all subdirectories, you can use: \`\`\`bash find . -name \\"filename\\" \`\`\` Here, \`.\` indicates the current directory and \`-name\` specifies the name of the file you're looking for. You can replace \`\\"filename\\"\` with the actual name or pattern of the file you want to find. Other useful flags for the \`find\` command include: - \`-type f\` to find files - \`-type d\` to find directories - \`-size\` to find files of a specific size - \`-mtime\` to find files modified within a specific number of days The \`find\` command is a powerful tool for locating files and directories based on various search criteria, and it's widely used for system administration and file management tasks in Linux."},{"instruction":"In Linux, what command shifts a given parameter one place to the left in a shell program?","output":"In Linux shell scripts, the \`shift\` command is used to shift the positional parameters to the left by a specified number of places or by one place if no number is given. Each time you use \`shift\`, the current positional parameters \`2\`, \`3\`, \`4\`, ..., are shifted to the left, and \`1\` is discarded, effectively reducing the number of parameters by one and moving the remaining arguments down. If you specify a number with \`shift\`, for example \`shift 2\`, it shifts the parameters two places to the left. Here's how you might use it in a script: \`\`\`bash #!/bin/bash echo \\"Before shift: 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3\\" shift echo \\"After shift: 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3\\" \`\`\` If you call this script with some arguments, like \`./script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3\`, the output will show how the parameters have shifted: \`\`\` Before shift: 1 = arg1, 2 = arg2, 3 = arg3 After shift: 1 = arg2, 2 = arg3, 3 = \`\`\` This is useful in shell scripts where you need to process each argument in a loop or discard the first argument after you've processed it."},{"instruction":"What Did Birmingham New Street Train Station Look Like During 1994?","output":"In 1994, Birmingham New Street Station looked significantly different from how it appears today after its major redevelopment completed in 2015. During that time, the station was characterized by its 1960s architecture since its previous major reconstruction was during the mid-1960s. Key features of Birmingham New Street Station in 1994 included: 1. Dark and Enclosed Interior: The station was often criticized for its dark and unwelcoming interior. Natural light was limited and the overall atmosphere was considered gloomy. 2. Brutalist Architecture: The station design was a product of the brutalist architectural movement, which was popular during the post-war era. It was characterized by concrete structures and an emphasis on function over form. 3. Complex Layout: The layout of the station could be quite confusing for passengers, with multiple levels and a complicated system of ramps, escalators, and pedestrian subways. 4. Concourse and Facilities: There was a main concourse area with ticket offices, small retail outlets, and basic passenger amenities, but these facilities were less extensive compared to what modern transit hubs offer. 5. Platform Access: Platforms were accessed via a set of escalators and lifts from the concourse level. Passengers often had to navigate through congested areas to get to their trains. 6. Iconic Signal Box: The New Street signal box was a prominent feature, with its distinctive \\"flying saucer\\" design, which stood near the station entrance until it was decommissioned. 7. The Pallasades Shopping Centre: The station was integrated with a shopping center called The Pallasades (now renamed Grand Central) that was positioned above the railway tracks, adding to the retail and pedestrian activity in the area. 8. Traffic and Congestion: As one of the busiest stations in the United Kingdom, even in 1994, Birmingham New Street dealt with a lot of foot traffic and train movements, which contributed to its congested atmosphere. It's worth noting that by 1994, the station may have had some minor updates since the 1960s, but it still retained the overall aesthetic and design principles from that era. It was not until 2015, after significant investment and a major redevelopment project, that Birmingham New Street was transformed into the much brighter, modern, and spacious station it is today, complete with sunlit atriums and an improved passenger experience."},{"instruction":"Qual é a resolução no caso do filme:: Deus Não Está Morto 2","output":"\\"Deus Não Está Morto 2\\" é a sequência do filme \\"Deus Não Está Morto\\" e foi lançado em 2016.

O advogado argumenta que Grace não violou a separação entre igreja e estado porque sua intenção não era proselitista, mas meramente educacional. Durante o julgamento, o advogado enfrenta diversos desafios, incluindo testemunhos hostis e a pressão da opinião pública. Ele trabalha para demonstrar que Grace tem o direito de responder às perguntas dos alunos sem censura, especialmente quando essas perguntas se referem a tópicos que estão sendo discutidos em um contexto histórico e educacional. A estratégia de defesa inclui trazer especialistas e testemunhas que podem falar sobre a relevância histórica de Jesus Cristo e sobre a liberdade de expressão de professores em sala de aula.

Este é um movimento incomum e arriscado, mas ele o faz com o objetivo de demonstrar que a motivação para o processo não era a preocupação com a separação entre igreja e estado, mas sim uma espécie de perseguição pessoal contra a fé de Grace. Durante o interrogatório da promotora, Tom consegue mostrar que a própria promotora tem um entendimento limitado sobre Jesus e a Bíblia, apontando assim a hipocrisia de julgar Grace por discutir esses tópicos em sala de aula. Ele argumenta que a discussão de Grace com seus alunos sobre Jesus como uma figura histórica foi relevante para a aula e não uma violação da separação entre igreja e estado. Além disso, ele destaca a importância da liberdade de expressão e o direito de Grace de responder a perguntas dos alunos dentro do contexto educacional. Esse movimento ajuda a virar a opinião do júri a favor de Grace, levando a um veredito de inocência.
