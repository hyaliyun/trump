What specific treatment is being researched and how does it work? What were the key findings of the research study? WWhat is the outlook for the availability and effectiveness of this treatment? Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Possible article: New Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease Shows Promise in Research Study Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior, and has no cure or effective treatment. According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 6 million Americans aged 65 years or older live with this condition, and the number is expected to triple by 2060 due to the aging population. Although some drugs can temporarily ease symptoms such as confusion and agitation, they do not alter the underlying disease process or slow its progression. However, recent research has uncovered a potential breakthrough in the quest for a more successful approach to treating Alzheimer's disease. Scientists at the Gladstone Institutes, a nonprofit biomedical research organization based in San Francisco, have developed a new therapy that targets the underlying cause of the disease, rather than just its symptoms. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, tested the therapy in mice and human neurons, and found that it could reverse the abnormal accumulation of proteins that damage brain cells and impair cognition. The therapy works by inhibiting an enzyme called HDAC6, which plays a crucial role in the formation and transport of tau proteins, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Tau proteins help to stabilize the structure of neurons, but when they become defective, they can form toxic clusters called neurofibrillary tangles, which disrupt the communication between neurons and trigger inflammation and cell death. By blocking HDAC6, the therapy promotes the clearance of abnormal tau proteins and restores the stability and function of neurons. The key findings of the research study indicate that the therapy could: - Reduce the levels of pathological tau in the brain and neurons by 30-50% - Improve the learning and memory abilities of mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms - Not cause any significant side effects or toxicity in mice or human neurons in vitro Moreover, the researchers also found that the therapy could work in combination with other approaches, such as immunotherapy or beta-amyloid reduction, which target other aspects of the disease process. This suggests that a multifaceted treatment strategy that addresses multiple targets may be more effective than a single drug. The outlook for the availability and effectiveness of this treatment depends on further testing and development. The researchers plan to conduct more rigorous preclinical studies, including toxicity and pharmacokinetic assessments, to determine the optimal dose, duration, and route of administration of the therapy. They also need to refine the chemical structure of the HDAC6 inhibitor to enhance its specificity and reduce any off-target effects. If these studies are successful, the therapy could proceed to clinical trials in humans, which may take several years and involve thousands of participants. However, the potential impact of this treatment on the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families is huge. With an estimated cost of 305 billion in the US in 2020 and projected to reach 1.1 trillion by 2050, Alzheimer's disease not only causes immense suffering but also poses a significant economic burden on individuals and society. Therefore, any progress towards a cure or preventive treatment is invaluable. The new therapy developed by the Gladstone Institutes offers hope that we may one day overcome the devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Rachel invited her friends over for dinner, but she burned the chicken.

The initiative involves installing solar panels in remote villages to provide electricity to households and businesses. It is hoped that this initiative will help to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels and improve access to electricity for those living in rural areas. What are some of the challenges of implementing solar energy in rural areas?","output":"The initiative that promotes the use of solar energy in rural areas in India is commendable, but there are some challenges to its implementation. One significant challenge is the lack of infrastructure necessary for the installation of solar panels. Remote villages often lack the necessary roads to transport the solar panels, and the installation process can be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, solar panels require regular maintenance, which can be challenging in rural areas where trained technicians and spare parts may not be readily available. Another major hurdle is the cost of solar panel installation. While the cost of solar technology has decreased over the years, it can still be prohibitively expensive for low-income households and small businesses in rural areas. Further, the absence of a reliable payment system in these areas can make it challenging to recover installation costs. Finally, it is essential to consider the unpredictability of weather patterns in rural areas. Solar energy is only generated during daylight hours and can be affected adversely by cloudy days or monsoons. Unreliable solar power supply can be detrimental to households and businesses planning to use solar power for their daily activities. All these challenges pose significant barriers to the successful implementation of solar energy initiatives in rural areas. However, with proper planning and support from the government, communities, and other organizations, these obstacles can be overcome.

Rising global temperatures have already been linked to natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires. Furthermore, these events and other environmental changes have serious impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. One of the most significant consequences of climate change is the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers. This contributes to rising sea levels that threaten the homes and livelihoods of millions of people. It is also causing the oceans to become more acidic, which can result in the loss of marine species and weakening of coral reefs. Another major problem is the increase in extreme weather events such as heat waves, precipitation, and snowfall. These changes not only affect human activities, but they also impact many natural ecosystems. For example, early snowmelt can interfere with the breeding habits of animals, and drought can kill trees and other vegetation. The changing climate also affects agricultural production, making it harder for crops to grow, decreasing yields, and affecting food security for local communities. As temperatures continue to rise, farmers will have to adapt to new cropping methods which may require more water and changes in planting and harvest times. Finally, climate change also has significant public health implications. It is causing impacts such as air pollution, more frequent heatwaves and extreme weather events, vector-borne diseases, and water and food contamination - leading to an increased burden on health systems globally. The effects of climate change are interconnected and reinforce each other. Addressing these issues and slowing the pace of climate change is critical to ensuring the preservation of the planet's biodiversity, maintaining sustainable agriculture, and promoting public health."},{"instruction":"Use the phrase climate change in a sentence that is no longer than seven words.","output":"Climate change is a global concern."},{"instruction":"Write a favorable book review.","output":"This book is simply outstanding.

The print was discovered in Australia's Dampier Peninsula and is believed to have been left by a sauropod, a longnecked dinosaur that lived over 130 million years ago. The find has been hailed as a significant discovery that could shed light on the evolution of sauropods and the environment in which they lived. The footprint is one of several recent discoveries that suggest Australia was home to a diverse array of dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era. Expand this summary.","output":"A remarkable discovery has been made by a group of scientists, as they have found the largest dinosaur footprint ever known to scientists, measuring an astounding 1.7 meters in length. Researchers found the print on Australia's Dampier Peninsula and are confident that it belonged to a sauropod dinosaur that existed over 130 million years ago. The discovery is significant because it could help scientists learn more about the evolution of sauropods and their natural habitats. Sauropods, also known as long-necked dinosaurs, were plant-eaters, and were some of the largest land animals that ever existed. These creatures ranged in size from around 4 meters to 40 meters in length. Scientists believe sauropods existed on earth for over 140 million years in various parts of the world. They lived during the Mesozoic era, around 252 million to 66 million years ago. The discovery of the large dinosaur footprint has fueled hope among paleontologists that further discoveries will be made in the area, which could reveal new information on the evolution of these prehistoric reptiles. The find suggests that Australia was home to a diverse range of dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era. Researchers have been fascinated with the Dampier Peninsula and have found many other dinosaur footprints in the region, including those of theropods and stegosaurs. Scientists will use the discovery of the footprint to gain new insights into the behavior of sauropods and the environment in which they lived. The size of the footprint is particularly exciting as it may mean that an adult sauropod once roamed the area. Additionally, the researchers noted that the footprint would have been made when the dinosaur was walking on soft, muddy ground as the print shows evidence of water flowing around it. Overall, the discovery of this massive dinosaur footprint marks a significant moment in the history of paleontology. The scientific community eagerly awaits to see if more discoveries will be made in the coming years that will expand our understanding of these prehistoric beasts."},{"instruction":"Statement: She said she wanted to go for a walk, but it was raining outside.

The law prohibits smoking in parks, beaches, and outdoor cafés. Supporters of the ban argue that it will improve public health and reduce litter.","output":"A new law has finally been passed, banning smoking in public spaces. The law aims to prohibit smoking in parks, beaches and outdoor cafés. Supporters of the ban have been pushing for this legislation for years, and it is finally becoming a reality. The main argument in favour of the ban is that it will improve public health. The dangers of passive smoking are well known, and by banning smoking in public spaces, non-smokers will no longer be subject to the health risks associated with inhaling second-hand smoke. Research has shown that even brief exposure to cigarette smoke can have a negative impact on health, so it is important to limit exposure wherever possible. Another key benefit of the ban is that it will reduce litter. Cigarette butts are the most commonly littered item in the world, with millions discarded every day. By prohibiting smoking in public spaces, there will be fewer opportunities for smokers to discard their cigarette butts on the ground. This will not only improve the appearance of our parks, beaches and outdoor cafés, but it will also help to reduce the environmental impact of littered cigarette butts. Despite these benefits, some smokers are understandably unhappy with the new law. They argue that it impinges on their right to smoke in public, and that they should be allowed to enjoy a cigarette wherever they choose. However, the health risks associated with second-hand smoke mean that it is necessary to restrict smoking in public spaces. Smokers are still free to smoke in private spaces, but when in public, they will need to find designated smoking areas or refrain from lighting up altogether.

The survey found that 23% of workers reported feeling burned out at work very often or always, up from 20% in the previous year. The most common causes of burnout included workload, work-life balance, and a perceived lack of support from management. The survey's authors emphasized the need for employers to prioritize employee wellbeing and take proactive measures to prevent burnout in the workplace. Given the rise in remote work and the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of workers experiencing burnout is not entirely surprising. Remote work has blurred the lines between work and personal life, and the pandemic has created additional stressors such as health concerns and a struggling economy. Additionally, many workers may be feeling disconnected from their coworkers and feeling a lack of support from management, further contributing to feelings of burnout. Employers can take a variety of steps to address burnout and promote employee wellbeing. One important strategy is to prioritize work-life balance by setting clear expectations for workload, encouraging breaks throughout the day, and promoting a healthy work environment.

Observe your yard for a few days and pick the site that gets six hours of direct sunlight per day. Additionally, remember to choose an area that can drain water correctly, away from areas that pool water. 2. Decide what to plant: The perfect plants for a beginner are vegetables and herbs such as tomatoes, cucumbers, basil, or thyme. These plants are easy to grow and maintain, and you can use them in the kitchen for your family's meals. 3. Prepare the soil: A healthy garden begins with healthy soil. Remove any debris and till the soil to a depth of 6-8 inches. It's also vital to test your soil's pH and amend with organic compost or fertilizer as needed. 4. Plant your garden: Begin by following the planting directions of your chosen plants. Generally, seeds should be planted shallowly and spaced correctly. Read instructions on seed packets carefully, and follow the diagrams on your plant stakes. 5. Water and fertilize regularly: Consistent watering is crucial to maintain a healthy garden. Water deeply, so the water reaches the root systems rather than just the surface. Fertilizing with organic fertilizer in the growing season will promote growth and ensure a bountiful harvest. In conclusion, starting a garden requires some efforts, but the rewards of growing your food, enjoying the peace and beauty of your garden are worth it.

By Harry Petit for MailOnline. Published: 12:33 EST, 22 December 2019. An Alabama man who was jailed for robbing a bank in 2003 in Gadsden, Alabama was sprung from prison 15 years ago by the notorious hacker who later changed his name to 'The Architect'. The bank robber, who is now 37 years old and has not been named, has been recorded describing his time with hacker Jonathan James, who committed a string of cyber crimes before he was found dead in his home in 2008. OPTIONS: Following his release from prison, the exbank robber decided to turn his life around and now owns his own business. It is believed that Jonathan James may have hacked into over 100 computers, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of damage to both individuals and companies. The pair went on to form a close friendship, with James taking the opportunity to share his extensive knowledge of computer systems and how to bypass them with his new protege. The exbank robber has now become an advocate for using digital technology for good, and works with schools and other institutions to promote ethical use of computers and the internet. The former bank robber describes his time with The Architect as an opportunity to turn his life around, giving him a new understanding of technology and how it can be used to benefit society. Despite the fact that James was known for his cybercrime spree, the bank robber has maintained that he was a good friend and mentor who never swayed from his beliefs. The bank robber went on to describe how he changed his name, got married and found a goodpaying job thanks to the help and guidance of James. Following his release from prison, the exbank robber became part of a group which worked with James to speak to schools children about the danger of cybercrime and the need for safe, responsible computing. The experience taught the bank robber that cybercrime was not the only way to make use of his knowledge of computer systems a realisation that helped him to turn his back on his life of crime. It remains unclear how James was able to spring the bank robber from prison, but the former inmate claims that the hacker was always several steps ahead of the authorities.","output":"The pair went on to form a close friendship, with James taking the opportunity to share his extensive knowledge of computer systems and how to bypass them with his new protege."},{"instruction":"order to increase sales, the company will launch a new line of products.

In captivity, giraffes have been known to live up to 28 years. However, there are many factors that can impact a giraffe's lifespan, including habitat loss, disease, and predation. One reason that giraffes have relatively short lifespans is that they are large animals with long necks and legs, making them easy targets for predators. Lions and hyenas are among the giraffe's natural enemies, and they will often attack young or weak giraffes. Another factor that can impact giraffe lifespan is habitat loss. As human populations continue to grow, we are encroaching on more and more of the giraffe's natural habitat. This means that giraffes are increasingly forced to compete for food and water, and they may be more susceptible to disease and other health problems. Despite these challenges, there are many efforts underway to help preserve the giraffe population and ensure that these magnificent creatures continue to thrive for generations to come. Conservationists are working to protect giraffes from poaching, disease, and habitat loss, and many people are working to raise awareness of the need for giraffe conservation. While the average lifespan of a giraffe may be relatively short, there is no doubt that these animals are some of the most fascinating and awe-inspiring creatures on our planet.

However, the development of this technology is a clear indication that companies are increasingly interested in understanding and monitoring human emotions. As with any new technology, there are potential downsides to consider. For example, some people may be uncomfortable with the idea of their emotions being constantly monitored and tracked.

Some experts argue that the law is unconstitutional and violates a woman's right to choose. Others say it's a necessary step to protect the rights of the unborn. Expand this summary.","output":"Opinion is divided over the new law in Southern states that bans abortion after just six weeks of pregnancy. Some experts argue that the law violates the constitutional right of a woman to choose what happens to her own body. They contend that this law effectively outlaws abortion because most women do not even know they are pregnant until after the six-week mark has passed. Additionally, the law doesn't even provide exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or serious health risks to the mother. On the other hand, those who support the law argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of the unborn. They believe that abortion is morally wrong and that the government has a responsibility to protect the lives of the unborn. They claim that scientific evidence shows that life begins at conception and that the law is just reiterating that fact. Many pro-choice advocates are concerned that these new laws are part of a larger push to challenge the landmark case Roe v. Wade, which was decided by the Supreme Court in 1973 and established a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. If this trend continues, many Southern states may pass laws that severely restricts access to abortions, which will disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color. In conclusion, the issue of abortion continues to be a highly divisive one in America. Advocates on both sides of the issue feel strongly about their positions, and the fight over this new law is likely to continue for the foreseeable future."},{"instruction":"Determine if the statement is true based on the text below: Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J.

Die Tiere ähneln in ihrem Körperbau den Maulwürfen und führen auch eine ähnliche unterirdische Lebensweise, sind mit diesen jedoch nicht näher verwandt., Der Körper zeigt spezielle Anpassungen an eine grabende Lebensweise. Er ist spindel- bis rautenförmig gestaltet, äußerlich sichtbare Ohren und ein Schwanz fehlen, die Augen liegen unter dem Fell verborgen. Vor allem die Vordergliedmaßen sind besonders gut zum Graben geeignet. Sie haben einen kurzen und kräftigen Bau, an den Händen sind große Grabklauen ausgebildet. Der Unterarm verfügt über einen dritten Knochen, die Anzahl der Finger- und Handwurzelknochen ist durch charakteristische Verwachsungen reduziert. Ein kennzeichnendes Merkmal der Goldmulle stellt auch das seidige Fell dar, das teilweise bei bestimmtem Lichteinfall metallisch glänzt., Goldmulle bewohnen offene bis wüstenartige Regionen und geschlossene Wälder, sie sind sowohl in Tief- als auch in Hochländern anzutreffen. Aufgrund ihrer grabenden Lebensweise stellen sie Habitatspezialisten dar, die teilweise nur eng begrenzte, an zumeist lockeren Untergrund gebundene Lebensräume besiedeln. Über die Lebensweise der Tiere liegen nur in wenigen Fällen genauere Informationen vor. Sie sind nachtaktiv und einzelgängerisch., Die Nahrung der Goldmulle besteht hauptsächlich aus Wirbellosen wie Regenwürmern und Insekten. Stark vergrößerte Gehörknöchelchen befähigen sie, die Beutetiere anhand der von diesen erzeugten Vibrationen aufzuspüren. Auffallend ist die labile Körpertemperatur, die sich der Umgebung anpasst und daher eine energiesparende Funktion hat. Die Fortpflanzung ist bisher wenig untersucht, pro Wurf kommen ein bis drei Jungtiere zur Welt, die als Nesthocker im unterirdischen Bau verbleiben. Die Individualentwicklung läuft vermutlich sehr langsam ab., Die Stammesgeschichte der Familie ist nur spärlich belegt. Sie reicht aber bis in das Mittlere Eozän vor etwa 47 Millionen Jahren zurück. Fossilfunde umfassen mit Ausnahmen nur einzelne Schädel- und Gebissreste. Goldmulle sind bereits seit dem 18. Jahrhundert bekannt, sie wurden aber anfangs mit den Maulwürfen gleichgesetzt. Erst in der Wende zum 19. Jahrhundert erfolgte eine Abtrennung von der Gruppe, wobei die Benennung der Familie in das Jahr 1825 datiert., Aufgrund ähnlicher Lebensweise und vergleichbarer Körpermerkmale galten die Goldmulle bis zum Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts als Mitglied der Ordnung der Insektenfresser (Lipotyphla). Jüngere molekulargenetische Untersuchungen stellen sie zusammen mit den Tenreks in eine gänzlich eigene Säugetiergruppe, die Tenrekartigen (Afrosoricida) innerhalb der Afrotheria. Gegenwärtig umfasst die Familie zehn Gattungen mit 21 Arten, von denen mehr als zwei Drittel in unterschiedlichen Maßen in ihrem Bestand gefährdet sind., Beschreibung., Habitus., Die Goldmulle sind relativ kleine Vertreter der Säugetiere. Zu den kleinsten Formen gehört der Wüstengoldmull (\\"Eremitalpa granti\\") mit einer Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von 7,6 bis 8,5cm, der Riesengoldmull (\\"Chrysospalax trevelyani\\") wird dagegen 20,8 bis 23,5cm lang. Das Körpergewicht schwankt dementsprechend zwischen 15 und 40g beziehungsweise zwischen 410 und 500g. Die meisten Vertreter besitzen aber Gesamtlängen von 9 bis 14cm und ein Gewicht von 20 bis 100g. Die einzelnen Arten weisen starke Ähnlichkeiten im Körperbau auf, unterscheiden sich aber zum Teil erheblich in Bezug auf ihre Fellfärbung, die trotz des Familiennamens der Goldmulle nicht nur goldgelb gefärbt erscheint, sondern auch zwischen schwarzen, grauen oder bräunlichen Farbtönen variiert. Der Körperbau der Goldmulle ist an eine grabende, unterirdische Lebensweise angepasst. Äußerlich ähnelt er etwa dem der Maulwürfe, mit denen die Goldmulle aber nicht näher verwandt sind. Der kompakte Rumpf zeigt einen spindelförmigen bis rautenförmigen Bau, ein Schwanz ist äußerlich nicht sichtbar. Die Nase bedeckt ein derbes, lederartiges Polster, das unterstützend beim Graben eingesetzt wird. Die Nasenlöcher liegen in einer Hautfalte an der Unterseite der Nasenspitze. Wie viele andere grabend lebende Säugetiere haben die Goldmulle keine äußeren Ohrmuscheln, auch sind die Augen von Fell bedeckt. Häufig treten im Gesicht und vor allem im Bereich der Augen akzentuierende helle Farbflecken auf. Die Gliedmaßen sind kurz und kräftig und liegen eher unterhalb des Rumpfes, im Gegensatz zu den Maulwürfen, bei denen sie eher seitlich angebracht sind. Die Vordergliedmaßen weisen vier Zehen auf – der äußere fünfte Strahl ist reduziert – und sind zu Grabwerkzeugen umgebildet. Die Kralle am Mittelfinger (Strahl III) ist stark vergrößert und kann länger als der Unterarm sein. Am ersten und zweiten Finger (Strahl I und II) tragen die Goldmulle jeweils eine kürzere, spitze Kralle, deren Länge aber je nach Art unterschiedlich ausfällt. Lediglich der Wüstengoldmull besitzt auch einen kleinen, krallenartigen Nagel am markant verkürzten vierten Finger (Strahl IV). Die Hinterbeine enden in fünf Zehen, die mit kleinen scharfen Krallen ausgestattet sind. Die einzelnen Zehen werden durch kleine Membranen miteinander verbunden, die Fußsohle ist unbehaart. Weibliche Tiere besitzen zwei Paar Zitzen., Schädel- und Gebissmerkmale., Der Kopf ist kegel- bis tropfenförmig gestaltet, die größte Breite befindet sich im Bereich des Hirnschädels. Das Rostrum ist meist verlängert. Das Verhältnis der größten Breite des Schädels zur größten Länge variiert von Art zu Art. Bei langen und schmalen Schädeln erreicht die größte Schädelbreite nur 60 % der größten Schädellänge, bei kurzen und breiten Schädeln liegt der entsprechende Wert bei bis zu 96 %. Zu den besonders schmalschädeligen Formen gehören die Kupfergoldmulle (\\"Amblysomus\\"), Arends’ Goldmull (\\"Carpitalpa\\"), die Riesengoldmulle (\\"Chrysospalax\\") oder die Vertreter der Gattungen \\"Neamblysomus\\" und \\"Chlorotalpa\\". Zu den breitschädeligen zählen dagegen die Kapgoldmulle (\\"Chrysochloris\\"), der Wüstengoldmull oder die Angehörigen der Gattung \\"Cryptochloris\\". Auch das Rostrum ist dementsprechend unterschiedlich kräftig gestaltet und kann schmal (mit einer Gaumenbreite von circa 28 % der größten Schädellänge) oder breit (mit einem entsprechenden Wert von bis zu 35 %) sein. Auffälligerweise fehlen bei den Goldmullen Einschnürungen im Bereich der Augen. Die Jochbögen sind vollständig geschlossen, das Jochbein ist allerdings zurückgebildet und der Bogen besteht aus einem Knochenfortsatz des Oberkiefers, der mit dem Schläfenbein artikuliert. Als Besonderheit findet sich bei den Goldmullen eine Gelenkverbindung zwischen dem Unterkiefer und dem Zungenbein. Die Gelenkverbindung besteht zwischen dem Winkelfortsatz des Unterkiefers und dem Stylohyale, welches zur Aufhängevorrichtung des Zungenbeins gehört. Eine ähnliche Gelenkung ist von anderen Höheren Säugetieren nicht bekannt. Sie unterstützt eventuell die Zunge beim Zerkauen der Nahrung., Eine weitere Auffälligkeit findet sich im Bereich des Mittelohres. Bei einigen Arten sind die Gehörknöchelchen stark vergrößert. Dies betrifft vor allem den Hammer (Malleus), dessen Kopf kugelartig aufgebläht oder keulenartig verlängert sein kann. Die Vergrößerungen sind teilweise enorm: beim Wüstengoldmull (Körpergewicht rund 40g) kann der Malleus ein Gewicht von 70mg erreichen, beim Riesengoldmull (Körpergewicht rund 500g) bis zu 185mg (im Vergleich: beim Menschen mit einem durchschnittlichen Körpergewicht von 70kg wiegt der Malleus 28mg). In einigen Fällen geht die Vergrößerung des Hammers mit einer Zunahme der Knochendichte einher, die beim Wüstengoldmull einen Wert von 2,44g/cm³ erreicht. Dies stellt einen der höchsten Werte bei terrestrisch lebenden Säugetieren dar und wird nur von einigen Walen und Seekühen übertroffen. Zur Aufnahme des aufgeblähten Hammerkopfes ist an der Oberseite der Paukenhöhle eine weitere Nebenhöhle ausgebildet, die sich bei einigen Arten äußerlich sichtbar als Knochenblase über der Schläfengrube hinter der Orbita aufwölbt. Die knöcherne Blase wird aufgrund ihrer Lage am Schläfenbein als \\"temporal bulla\\" (etwa „Schläfenblase“) bezeichnet. Darüber hinaus weist die Hörschnecke einen komplexen Bau auf und besitzt wenigstens vier Windungen mit insgesamt kombiniert 1200° Drehwinkel, was mehr ist als bei zahlreichen anderen, unterirdisch lebenden Säugetieren. Die besonderen Ausprägungen sowohl der Gehörknöchelchen als auch der Hörschnecke stehen in Verbindung mit der auditiven Wahrnehmung der Goldmulle. Die Goldmulle können stark niederfrequente Töne von weniger als einigen hundert Hertz wahrnehmen, ebenso vermögen sie seismische Schwingungen und Vibrationen zu empfangen, etwa von den Bewegungen von Beutetieren. Die Übertragung erfolgt mittels Knochenleitung, die durch die stark asymmetrische Form des Malleus aufgrund des vergrößerten Kopfes und einer damit einhergehenden Verschiebung des Schwerpunktes ausgelöst wird. Die Befähigung ist bei Tieren mit vergrößertem Hammer besser ausgeprägt als bei solchen mit normal gebautem., Die Goldmulle haben ein leicht reduziertes Gebiss mit 36 bis 40 Zähnen. Das vordere Gebiss ist vollständig, lediglich im hinteren sind einzelne Backenzähne zurückgebildet. Die Zahnformel lautet demzufolge: formula_1. Der vorderste Schneidezahn in der oberen Gebissreihe und der zweite Schneidezahn im Unterkiefer sind vergrößert, die übrigen Schneidezähne haben eine eckzahnähnliche und kleine Gestalt. Der vordere Prämolar kann variabel geformt sein – so kommen \\"sectoriale\\" (mit scharfen Schneidkanten), \\"bicuspide\\" oder \\"tricuspide\\" (mit zwei oder drei Höckerchen) Typen vor. Die Molaren selbst haben auffallend hohe (\\"hypsodonte\\") Kronen und ein \\"tricuspides\\" Kauflächenmuster. Die drei Haupthöcker stellen der Paraconus, der Metaconus und der Protoconus dar (bezogen auf die Oberkieferzähne). Der Protoconus ist häufig, aber nicht bei allen Arten, in seiner Größe stark reduziert, der Metaconus und der Paraconus stehen eng beieinander – letzterer bildet: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

He awoke in the Barbieland, a world populated by dolls. Oppenheimer was lying on the grass in Barbie’s garden. Barbie was watering her garden plants when she came into Oppenheimer, who was dressed in a suit and hat. Oppenheimer was astounded by how cheerful and vibrant everything was instead of dark and depressing. Barbie was concerned about him because he was dirty and full of dirt and grass. She invited Oppenheimer to her pink, lovely, and elegant dreamhouse. Her boyfriend Ken entered Barbie’s room, and he was doubtful of her guest Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer immediately recalls his wife Kitty and his ex-girlfriend Jean Tatlock, a bisexual communist because Barbie reminds him of them. Oppenheimer explored the Barbieland and other dolls with Barbie. Then Barbie asked him to the disco party. Oppenheimer was quiet at the party until he began to dance, even though he had no dance experience. After the disco night with Barbie and Ken, Opppenheimer went for a morning walk on Malibu Beach. Add some dialogues.","output":"Title: \\"Oppenheimer's Renaissance in Barbieland\\" Chapter 1: A Curious Encounter Oppenheimer awoke in Barbieland, dazed and disoriented. As he slowly sat up, the vibrant world of dolls that surrounded him drowned out any remnants of his dark past. Barbie, with her flowing blonde hair and dazzling smile, noticed Oppenheimer lying on the grass as she tended to her garden. Barbie: Oh, my! Are you alright? You look a little worse for wear. Oppenheimer: (Coughing) I...I'm quite alright, thank you. Just a bit disoriented. Where am I? Barbie: Welcome to Barbieland! I'm Barbie, by the way. What's your name? Oppenheimer: (Dusting off his suit) I am J. Robert Oppenheimer, though most people call me Oppenheimer. It's a pleasure to meet you, Barbie. Chapter 2: Making Connections As Barbie extended her hand to help Oppenheimer up, he couldn't help but be reminded of his wife Kitty and his ex-girlfriend Jean Tatlock, who both possessed the same warmth and elegance Barbie exuded. Oppenheimer: (Whispering) You remind me of someone precious I once knew, someone who brought light into my life. Barbie: (Curious) Oh, really? Tell me more about them. I'd love to hear your story. Oppenheimer shared stories of his past with Barbie as they explored the colorful wonders of Barbieland. From the elegant Dreamhouse to the bustling city, he couldn't help but be amazed by the sheer joy that surrounded him. Chapter 3: Dancing into the Night Barbie, sensing Oppenheimer's longing for liberation from his past, invited him to a disco party where music filled the air and vibrant lights danced across the room. Oppenheimer hesitated initially, but the infectious atmosphere compelled him. Oppenheimer: I must admit, I've never danced before. My life has been filled with weights too heavy to carry on my feet. Barbie: Don't worry, Oppenheimer! Just let the music guide you. Dance from your heart, and you'll be unstoppable! With Barbie's words echoing in his mind, Oppenheimer let go of his inhibitions and embraced the spirited rhythm of the disco, dancing like he'd never danced before. Chapter 4: Morning Reflections As the sun began to rise, Oppenheimer took a calm morning walk on the serene Malibu Beach. He sighed deeply, grateful for the newfound sense of joy he had experienced in Barbieland. Oppenheimer: This world, so full of life and vibrancy, it's a stark contrast to the shadows I once dwelled in. Perhaps redemption lies in embracing the beauty around us. As the waves crashed upon the shore, Oppenheimer's thoughts shifted to his role in history, pondering the significance and consequences of his scientific achievements. Oppenheimer: (Talking to himself) What I have done cannot be undone, but I can strive to ensure a future where dolls like Barbie can enjoy an everlasting peace. Chapter 5: A Friend's Perspective Back in Barbie's dreamhouse, Oppenheimer shared his revelations with Barbie's boyfriend, Ken. Concerned for Barbie's safety and skeptical of Oppenheimer's intentions, Ken approached him cautiously. Ken: So, Oppenheimer, what's your deal? Are you here to cause any harm to Barbie or anyone else? Oppenheimer: (Sincerity in his voice) Ken, I understand your concerns, but I assure you, my intentions are nothing but pure. I have seen the destructive power unleashed, and now, I seek a path of peace. Ken, sensing the sincerity in Oppenheimer's words, nodded approvingly, acknowledging the complex journey Oppenheimer had embarked upon. Ken: Well, Oppenheimer, it seems Barbie trusts you, and that's enough for me. Let's work together to create a future where dolls and humans alike can find happiness and harmony. And so, in the enchanting world of Barbieland, Oppenheimer found solace, companionship, and the chance to rewrite his legacy alongside Barbie, Ken, and their vibrant communities."},{"instruction":"Imagine you're an information security officer.

Here are a few possible explanations: 1. Traditional approach: Chinese medicine often follows a different paradigm compared to Western medicine. It is based on ancient theories and emphasizes a holistic approach to health. As a result, the focus may be more on the overall balance and harmony of the body rather than specific chemical constituents or standardized quality control measures. 2. Complex composition: Many Chinese medicines are derived from natural sources such as plants, minerals, and animal products. The complex combination of active compounds in these natural materials often makes it difficult to establish standardized quality control protocols. Additionally, some ingredients used in Chinese medicine may be difficult to identify and measure accurately, further complicating quality control efforts. 3. Diverse manufacturing processes: Chinese medicine is often prepared through complex extraction methods, combining multiple ingredients and employing unique processing techniques. These processes can vary widely among manufacturers, making it challenging to establish uniform quality control standards. 4. Regulatory challenges: The regulation and oversight of traditional Chinese medicine can vary across different regions and countries. In some cases, there may be insufficient or less stringent regulations in place to enforce rigorous quality control measures, leading to variations in product quality. 5. Cultural and historical factors: Chinese medicine has a long history and is deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Traditional practices and beliefs surrounding Chinese medicine may influence the perception of quality control. For instance, the idea of Qi (vital energy) and the concept of personalized treatments may be prioritized over standardized quality control measures. It is important to note that these reasons are not absolute and do not apply to all Chinese medicine products. Some manufacturers and practitioners of Chinese medicine do incorporate quality control measures and adhere to standardized protocols, especially in countries with stricter regulations."},{"instruction":"C语言按行读取txt的代码","output":"以下是使用C语言按行读取txt文件的代码示例： \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { FILE *file; char line[256]; // 打开txt文件（假设文件名为data.txt） file = fopen(\\"data.txt\\", \\"r\\"); if (file == NULL) { printf(\\"无法打开文件！n\\"); return 0; } // 逐行读取文件内容并输出 while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) { printf(\\"%s\\", line); } // 关闭文件 fclose(file); return 0; } \`\`\` 上述代码假设文件名为\\"data.txt\\"，打开并读取文件内容，并逐行输出到控制台。如果文件无法打开，则输出一条错误消息。注意要在使用完文件后关闭文件。"},{"instruction":"C语言获取当前路径","output":"以下是使用C语言获取当前路径的代码示例： \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> int main() { char cwd[256]; // 获取当前工作目录 if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)) != NULL) { printf(\\"当前路径：%sn\\", cwd); } else { perror(\\"获取当前路径失败\\"); return 0; } return 0; } \`\`\` 上述代码使用\`getcwd()\`函数获取当前工作目录，并将路径存储在\`cwd\`数组中。如果成功获取当前路径，则输出路径信息；否则输出错误信息。"},{"instruction":"C++语言获取当前路径","output":"以下是使用C++语言获取当前路径的代码示例： \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <filesystem> int main() { std::filesystem::path currentPath = std::filesystem::current_path(); std::cout << \\"当前路径：\\" << currentPath << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` 上述代码使用C++17标准的\`std::filesystem\`库中的\`current_path()\`函数获取当前路径，并将结果存储在\`currentPath\`变量中。然后将路径信息输出到控制台。请确保编译时启用了对C++17标准的支持。如果使用较旧的编译器版本，可能需要调整代码或使用第三方库来获取当前路径。"},{"instruction":"文档子项管理","output":"文档子项管理是指对文档中的子项进行管理和组织的过程。在文档管理中，一个文档可以包含多个子项，这些子项可以是章节、标题、图表、表格、列表等。文档子项管理的目的是使文档更加有条理、易于阅读和理解。 文档子项管理包括以下几个方面： 1. 子项的创建和编辑：在文档中创建和编辑子项，例如添加章节、标题、图表、表格等。通过编辑子项可以对文档的内容进行组织和分类，使之更具结构性。 2. 子项的排序和排列：对文档中的子项进行排序和排列，可以按照一定的逻辑或顺序进行排列，使之更加清晰和易于查找。 3. 子项的重用和复制：通过复制和粘贴子项可以重用已有的内容，避免重新编写相同的内容，提高工作效率。 4. 子项的引用和链接：在文档中引用和链接其他子项，可以实现跳转和连接功能，方便读者查看和导航文档。 5. 子项的注释和批注：给子项添加注释和批注，可以对子项的内容进行说明和解释，帮助读者理解和消化文档。 6. 子项的更新和版本控制：随着文档的不断修改和更新，需要对子项进行相应的更新和版本控制，确保文档的准确性和一致性。 通过有效的文档子项管理，可以提高文档的组织和可读性，使之更加易于理解和使用，提高工作效率和沟通效果。"},{"instruction":"word文档行数怎么查看","output":"在Microsoft Word中，可以通过以下几种方法来查看文档的行数： 1. 使用状态栏：在Word的底部状态栏上方，有一个区域显示文档的统计信息，包括页数、字数和行数等。默认情况下，行数是显示在最右侧的位置。如果没有显示行数，可以右键单击状态栏，勾选\\"行数\\"选项，即可显示行数。 2. 使用\\"审阅\\"工具栏：在Word的菜单栏上，选择\\"查看\\"，然后在\\"工具栏\\"菜单中勾选\\"审阅工具栏\\"。在\\"审阅\\"工具栏中，可以看到一个标有\\"统计\\"的按钮，点击该按钮会弹出一个对话框，其中包含了文档的统计信息，包括行数。 3. 使用\\"字数统计\\"功能：可以通过\\"文件\\"菜单中的\\"选项\\"来查看文档的字数统计信息。点击\\"文件\\"菜单后，在弹出的选项对话框中选择\\"高级\\"选项卡，在\\"显示\\"部分勾选\\"统计信息中包括每个文档的字数\\"选项。然后关闭对话框，在\\"文件\\"菜单中选择\\"信息\\"，在右侧的窗口中，会显示出当前文档的字数统计信息，其中包括行数。 这些方法可以帮助您快速查看Word文档的行数。请注意，行数的显示可能会因为页面设置、字体大小等因素而有所差异。"},{"instruction":"prarmeters中的temperature选项是干什么的","output":"在参数中的temperature选项是用于设置生成文本的创造性程度的。较高的温度值会使生成的文本更加随机和非结构化，可能包含更多的错误和不连贯之处。而较低的温度值会使生成的文本更加保守和结构化，更接近于原始训练数据的模式。通过调整温度值，可以在生成的文本中控制创造性和准确性之间的平衡。"},{"instruction":"You are a professional English teacher, I’m your student who struggle to IELT writing due to the lack of grammar knowledge and writing experience.

Add steve’s dialogue throughout the story","output":"Once upon a time in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, Steve Harrington found himself craving a hearty dinner of freshly caught fish. Armed with his fishing rod and a mischievous grin, he set out on a quest to satisfy his appetite. As the sun began to set, Steve ventured further into the woods, guided only by the faint light filtering through the dense canopy. He stumbled upon a secluded swamp pond, its still waters inviting him to take a dip. With an adventurous spirit, he decided to take a bold leap and embraced the thrill of skinny-dipping. With a playful splash, Steve broke the surface of the water, feeling the coolness wrap around his skin. Letting out a triumphant laugh, he looked around to ensure he was alone, and satisfied that no one was near, he waded into the murky water until it reached his waist. A feeling of relief washed over him as Steve realized he had been holding in a rather powerful fart. A mischievous twinkle sparkled in his eye as he decided to unleash this pent-up flatulence, aiming to amuse himself by bubbling the water around him. Letting out a tremendous fart, the ripples that emanated from his exposed rear excited him, and he chuckled at the unexpected display of nature's oddities. To his surprise, an unbearable stench wafted through the air, overpowering even the scent of the surrounding swamp. Unknown to Steve, his bodily emissions had a sulfuric quality that left no escaping nose unscathed. The noxious smell drifted through the water, reaching the unsuspecting fish who called the pond their home. Moments later, Steve spotted fish floating belly up, their lifeless bodies lazily bobbing in the water. His eyes widened with giddy satisfaction as he realized his fart had, unintentionally, led to an abundant catch. Gleefully, he lunged for a particularly plump specimen, swiftly grabbing it with both hands, adrenaline coursing through his veins. Emerging from the water, still wearing nothing but a triumphant smile, Steve cradled the fish and made his way back to the shore.

Am I right?","output":"Yes, you are correct. Oceania from Nineteen Eighty-Four and the World State from Brave New World are indeed different dystopias and are incompatible with each other in several aspects. Oceania, depicted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a totalitarian state that maintains control over its citizens through constant surveillance, widespread propaganda, and manipulation of language and history. The Party enforces strict obedience and conformity, suppressing individuality and independent thought. The society is characterized by oppression, fear, and an atmosphere of constant war. On the other hand, the World State, portrayed in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, is a dystopian society where individuals are conditioned from birth to fit into predetermined social roles and to embrace superficial pleasures and instant gratification. Technology and drugs, such as soma, are used to control and pacify the citizens. Relationships and emotions are discouraged, and individuality is suppressed for the sake of societal stability and uniformity. The two dystopias have distinct approaches to control and manipulation of their respective societies. Oceania employs fear, surveillance, and thought control, while the World State uses technological advancements, conditioning, and consumerism. The values and principles underlying these systems are fundamentally different, making the dystopias incompatible. Furthermore, the goals pursued by these dystopian societies also differ. Oceania seeks absolute power and domination, aiming to maintain control over its citizens at any cost. In contrast, the World State aims for stability, happiness, and social harmony, albeit created through shallow and superficial means. In conclusion, Oceania and the World State are two distinct dystopias that employ different methods of control, have different underlying principles, and pursue divergent goals. Therefore, they are considered mutually exclusive and incompatible with each other."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot the issue: 1. Verify that the data in the DataTable is indeed modified before calling AcceptChanges(). You can use the DataRow.RowState property to check if any rows have been added, modified, or deleted. 2. Make sure that the DataTable is bound to a data source correctly. If the DataTable is bound to a control (e.g., DataGridView, DataGrid), ensure that the control is properly updated after calling AcceptChanges(). You may need to call the control's refresh or update method. 3. Check if there are any constraints or rules defined on the DataTable that prevent the changes from being accepted. For example, if there is a unique constraint, modifying a value that violates the constraint will not be accepted. In such cases, an exception may be thrown. Handle any exceptions and review the constraints/rules defined on the DataTable. 4. Verify if there are any event handlers attached to the DataTable events, such as RowChanging or RowChanged. These event handlers may be interfering with the AcceptChanges() operation. Temporarily remove or modify the event handlers to see if it resolves the issue. 5. If you are using a DataAdapter to update the database, ensure that the DataAdapter's Update method is called after AcceptChanges(). The Update method applies the changes from the DataTable to the database. 6. Check if there are any transactions involved in the data modification process. If you are using a transaction to update the data, ensure that you commit the transaction after calling AcceptChanges(). If none of the above steps resolve the issue, provide more details about the specific code and scenario you are facing, including any error messages or exceptions you encounter."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Seit Beginn der Spielzeit 2021/2022 lautet die offizielle Bezeichnung „Staatstheater Meiningen“. Umgangssprachlich nennt man das Theater oft Meininger Theater. Das heutige Gebäude wurde 1909 im Stil des Neoklassizismus eröffnet., Das Ensemble des Theaters bietet Musiktheater, Schauspiel, Konzert und Puppentheater. Dem Theater angeschlossen ist des Weiteren die Meininger Hofkapelle. Die traditionsreiche Bühne wird unter dem Dach der Kulturstiftung Meiningen-Eisenach vom Land Thüringen, der Stadt Meiningen und dem Landkreis Schmalkalden-Meiningen gemeinsam getragen., Das Haus ist die Wiege des bis heute praktizierten modernen Regietheaters.

Juni 1776 mit dem Trauerspiel „Die Gunst des Fürsten“ von Christian Heinrich Schmidt eröffnet wurde. Die Bühne maß 15m in der Breite und 11m in der Tiefe. Der Zuschauerraum war bereits in Parkett, Parterre und einen Rang unterteilt. Bespielt wurde das Theater bis zur Eröffnung des neuen Hoftheaters anfänglich vom \\"Herzoglichen Liebhabertheater\\", das der Herzog Karl von Sachsen-Meiningen 1774 gründete. Zwischen 1776 und 1780 wurden unter anderem \\"Das Kaffeehaus oder die Schottländerin\\" von Voltaire, \\"Der Hausvater\\" von Denis Diderot und \\"Julius von Tarent\\" von Johann Anton Leisewitz aufgeführt. Anschließend zeigten dort eine bürgerliche Laientheatergesellschaft sowie Wanderschauspieltruppen ihre Darbietungen., Ab Juni 1801 stand im Herzogtum Sachsen-Meiningen das kleine Komödienhaus und Kurtheater in Bad Liebenstein mit 344 Plätzen zur Verfügung, dessen Errichtung Herzog Georg I. veranlasste. 1820 beschloss das Meininger Herzoghaus den Neubau eines Hoftheaters in Meiningen. Der Baubeginn verzögerte sich auf Grund finanzieller Engpässe und der Neuordnung des Herzogtums im Jahr 1826 auf das Jahr 1829. Unter Herzog Bernhard II. entstand nach Plänen des Braunschweiger Hofbaurats Carl Theodor Ottmer und unter Leitung von Hofbaurat August Wilhelm Döbner ein für diese Zeit modernes und großes Gebäude mit 600 Sitz- und 160 Stehplätzen im klassizistischen Stil. Als Hauptfinanzier gilt die Prinzessin Adelheid von Sachsen-Meiningen, der späteren Queen Adelaide von England, die mit 25.000 meißnischen Gulden rund ein Drittel der Kosten übernahm. Insgesamt verschlang das Bauwerk 70.000 Gulden., Am 17. Dezember 1831 fand die Eröffnung des Meininger Hoftheaters mit der Oper \\"Fra Diavolo\\" von Daniel-François-Esprit Auber statt. In den ersten Jahren wurden die Spielzeiten unter Einbeziehung der Meininger Hofkapelle von Theatergesellschaften bestritten, die für ein oder mehrere Jahre verpflichtet wurden. 1860 bekam das Hoftheater ein eigenes Ensemble in den Sparten Schauspiel und Oper. Zum ersten Intendanten wurde Karl Freiherr von Stein berufen. Das noch junge Ensemble brachte 1865 in einer Uraufführung das Stück „Frau Lucrezia“ vom späteren Literatur-Nobelpreisträger Paul Heyse auf die Bühne., Theaterherzog., Erbprinz Georg, der spätere Herzog Georg II., erfuhr eine langjährige umfangreiche Kunstausbildung und begann noch zur Regierungszeit seines Vaters Bernhard II. großen Einfluss auf die Theaterarbeit zu nehmen. Sein Hauptinteresse galt dem Schauspiel, insbesondere den Dramen von Shakespeare, Schiller, Kleist, Molière, Goethe und Lessing. Unzufrieden mit den damals üblichen, wenig authentischen Aufführungen aller deutschen, ja europäischen Theater, entwarf das künstlerische Multitalent eigenhändig historisch korrekte Kostüme, Bühnenbilder und Requisiten und begann, die Stücke werkgetreu und in hoher Perfektion aufführen zu lassen., Nach seinem Regierungsantritt 1866 übernahm Georg II. die künstlerische Leitung des Theaters, löste das Opernensemble auf und konzentrierte die Kräfte des Hauses auf das Schauspiel. Der Herzog führte demokratische Methoden in der Regiearbeit ein, bei denen mit den wichtigsten Schauspielern Besprechungen zum Repertoire und über Probleme der Theaterarbeit geführt wurden. Daraufhin wurde er – anfangs eher spöttisch gemeint, dann voll Anerkennung – als „Theaterherzog“ bekannt. Um den Aufführungen noch mehr Profil zu geben, engagierte er 1867 den bekannten Shakespeare-Übersetzer Friedrich von Bodenstedt als Intendanten. Dieser konnte die Schauspielerin Ellen Franz für das Hoftheater gewinnen, die entscheidende Impulse in die Theaterarbeit brachte. Nach anfänglichen Erfolgen scheiterte die Zusammenarbeit mit von Bodenstedt wegen Meinungsverschiedenheiten bei der Regiearbeit. Daraufhin ernannte Georg II. 1869 Karl Grabowsky zum neuen Intendanten und den einflussreichen Schauspieler Ludwig Chronegk zum Oberregisseur. Im gleichen Jahr inszenierten beide in deutschen Erstaufführungen die Stücke „Halte-Hulda“ und „König Sigurd“ des Norwegers Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson., Die Theaterreform., Die Reform der Regiearbeit und des Inszenierungsstils war kein einmalig geplanter Akt, sondern ein allmählicher Prozess, der hauptsächlich zwischen 1866 und 1874 stattfand und durch die rasante politische, gesellschaftliche, künstlerische und technische Entwicklung Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts überfällig war. Es war einem Herzog vorbehalten, der neben großen künstlerischen Talenten, einer großen Liebe zum Theater und einer gesellschaftlichen Aufgeklärtheit die notwendigen finanziellen und politischen Mittel und ein leistungsstarkes Theaterensemble besaß, diese Reform durchzuführen., Herzog Georg II. und Chronegk führten jetzt gemeinsam Regie. Sie bauten die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Coburger Theatermaler Max Brückner aus, um die Bühnenprospekte so weit zu verbessern, bis diese eine nahezu perfekte Illusion der Wirklichkeit auf der Bühne hervorriefen. Weiterhin arbeiteten sie mit Theaterspezialisten wie Ernst von Possart oder dem Literaturprofessor Karl Werder zusammen, um richtungsweisende Mustervorstellungen zu schaffen. Um die Leistung des Ensembles weiter zu steigern, wurden herausragende Darsteller engagiert. Dazu gehörten Karl August Devrient und Ludwig Dessoir. Die sich einstellenden Erfolge ließen die Theaterwelt aufhorchen, die Shakespeare-Gesellschaft und Rezensenten großer Zeitungen wurden auf das Hoftheater aufmerksam., Bald entstand die Idee eines Gastspiels in Berlin. Der 1870 ausgebrochene Deutsch-Französische Krieg verhinderte zunächst dieses Vorhaben. 1873 heiratete Georg II. die Schauspielerin Ellen Franz, die von da an den Namen \\"Helene Freifrau von Heldburg\\" trug. Sie leistete am Theater die Hauptarbeit auf dem Gebiet der Dramaturgie, bei Engagements- und Besetzungsentscheidungen sowie bei der Ausbildung und Erziehung junger Eleven., Meininger Prinzipien., Georg II., seine Frau Helene und Chronegk erarbeiteten seit 1866 eine Reihe von Positionen und Neuerungen, die man die \\"Meininger Prinzipien\\" nannte und auf die sich die Theaterreform stützte., Diese Prinzipien folgten dem Kunstideal, Theater historisch getreu und stilvoll vorzuführen. Dazu gehörten eine absolute Werktreue und eine Priorität in der Ensemblebildung und der Massenregie. Dieser hatte sich jeder Darsteller unterzuordnen, der nach einer Hauptrolle auch als Statist oder Chormitglied mitwirken muss. Selbst kleinste Rollen mussten mit äußerster Präzision gespielt werden. Starallüren wurden rigoros unterbunden. Eine Neuerung waren weiterhin die eindrucksvollen, bis ins kleinste Detail durchdachten Massenszenen, die es bis dahin auf keiner Theaterbühne gab. Das Bühnenbild sollte stets historisch korrekt und asymmetrisch gestaltet sein und die Hauptakteure durften nie lange im Zentrum der Bühne verweilen., Die Meininger Prinzipien wurden während der Gastspielzeit von vielen anderen Bühnen übernommen. Herausragende Theaterexperten, Regisseure und später auch Filmemacher wie Stanislawski, Max Reinhardt, Elia Kazan, Lee Strasberg, Erich Ziegel und Otto Brahm studierten die Meininger Aufführungen und griffen bei ihrer Arbeit für Theater und Film auf diese Prinzipien zurück., Die Meininger auf Reisen., Mit großem Erfolg trat schließlich am 1. Mai 1874 das Ensemble des Meininger Hoftheaters zum ersten Gastspiel in Berlin mit \\"Julius Cäsar\\" von Shakespeare auf. Es folgte eine beispiellose 16-jährige Tourneetätigkeit mit 81 Gastspielen in 38 Städten Europas mit 2591 Aufführungen, darunter in London, Wien, Stockholm, Moskau, Sankt Petersburg und Amsterdam. Auf diesen Reisen führte das Ensemble unter ihrem neuen Intendanten Ludwig Chronegk insgesamt 41 Werke auf, insbesondere von Shakespeare und Schiller. Bald nannten die Zeitungen und die Theaterwelt das Ensemble des Hoftheaters nur noch die Meininger., Aus 70 bis 80 Teilnehmern bestanden die Theaterreisegruppen. Sie führten 15 bis 20 Waggons mit Dekorationen, Requisiten und Kostüme bei sich. Aufsehen bei den Gastspielen erregten die prächtigen, historisch authentischen Kostüme und die aufwändigen, eine neue Stimmung verbreitenden Kulissen. Heute kann man einen Teil dieser Kulissen in einer originalgetreuen Präsentation im Meininger Theatermuseum besichtigen.

bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Kulturlandschaft, Obstbau, Wiese], Die Streuobstwiese, regional auch Obstwiese, Obstgarten, Bitz, Bangert, Bongert oder Bungert (Baumgarten) genannt, ist eine traditionelle Form des Obstbaus. Auf Streuobstwiesen stehen verstreute hochstämmige Obstbäume meist unterschiedlichen Alters und unterschiedlicher Arten und Sorten. Der moderne, intensive Obstanbau ist dagegen von niederstämmigen Obstsorten in Monokultur geprägt (Obstplantagen)., Begriffsentwicklung., Die übliche Bezeichnung war früher \\"Obstwiese\\", sie ist in manchen Regionen bis heute gebräuchlich. In den neuen Bundesländern sagte man bis zur Wende \\"Obstgarten\\" oder \\"Grasgarten.\\", Die Bezeichnungen \\"Streuobstbau\\" und \\"Streuobstwiese\\" haben sich aus dem Begriff \\"Obstbau in Streulage\\" entwickelt. Nach derzeitigen Erkenntnissen wurde der Begriff \\"Obstbäume und Weiden in Streulage\\" erstmals 1924 von Rinaldini für Rumänien/Siebenbürgen verwendet, dann allerdings erst wieder 1940 durch Knauer für den hochstämmigen Obstbau in Schleswig-Holstein sowie 1941 durch Spreng in der Schweiz., Der Begriff \\"Streuobstbau\\" wurde erstmals ab 1953 durch Zeller verwendet, dann in den 1950er-Jahren häufig und in negativer Abgrenzung zum dann auch in Deutschland zunehmend verbreiteten Halb- und Niederstamm-Obstbau. Erst aus dem Jahr 1975 stammt der Begriff der \\"Streuobstwiese\\". Geprägt hat ihn der Ornithologe Ullrich, der in einer Publikation auf die besondere Bedeutung der Streuobstwiesen im Albvorland für den Vogelschutz hinwies., Mit den nassen, säurereichen Streuwiesen und der Einstreu in die Ställe haben die Begriffe \\"Streuobstwiese\\" und \\"Streuobst\\" nichts zu tun. Vielmehr beziehen sie sich auf den weiten Abstand der \\"verstreut\\" stehenden Bäume., Definition., Streuobstwiesen sind die bekannteste Form des Streuobstbaus (auch Streuobstanbau genannt). Für diesen ist die Mehrfachnutzung kennzeichnend: Die Bäume dienen der Obsterzeugung („Obernutzung“); da die Bäume locker stehen, dienen die Flächen zugleich als Grünland („Unternutzung“), entweder als Mähwiese zur Heugewinnung oder direkt als Viehweide. Streuobstäcker sind eine in Deutschland noch in Franken, Südbaden, Sachsen-Anhalt, dem südlichen Brandenburg und im Lallinger Winkel verbreitete Sonderform, die bis weit ins 20.Jahrhundert in ganz Mitteleuropa verbreitet war. Darüber hinaus gehören auch Obstalleen und Einzelbäume zum Streuobstbau. Das im Streuobstbau angebaute Obst nennt man Streuobst., Der Streuobstanbau hatte im 19. und in der ersten Hälfte des 20.Jahrhunderts eine große kulturelle, soziale, landschaftsprägende und ökologische Bedeutung. Durch die Intensivierung der Landwirtschaft sowie durch das Bau- und Siedlungswesen wurden jedoch Streuobstwiesen in der zweiten Hälfte des 20.Jahrhunderts stark dezimiert. Heute gehören sie zu den am stärksten gefährdeten Biotopen Mitteleuropas (siehe auch Rote Liste der Biotoptypen). Die Imkerei spielt bei der Bestäubung eine wichtige Rolle., Größere, landschaftsprägende Streuobstwiesen finden sich heute noch in Österreich, in Süddeutschland, am Nordhang des Kyffhäusers und in der Schweiz. Die größten Bestände finden sich am Fuß der Schwäbischen Alb. Dort sind auch großflächige Streuobstbestände von BirdLife International als \\"Important Bird Areas\\" benannt sowie vom Land Baden-Württemberg laut EU-Vogelschutzrichtlinie als Vogelschutzgebiete bei der EU gemeldet. Die großen Streuobstflächen des niederösterreichischen Mostviertels liegen rund um die weitverstreuten Gehöfte. Sie sind das Kerngebiet zur Erzeugung von Apfel- und Birnenmost., Auf Initiative des Verbandes der Gartenbauvereine in Deutschland (VGiD) hat das Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz mit den Referenten der Bundesländer eine vom VGiD vorgeschlagene Definition des Begriffs \\"Streuobstanbau\\" abgestimmt. Auf dieser Grundlage wurde im Jahr 2008 folgende Definition verabschiedet:, Der Einsatz synthetischer Pestizide ist unüblich. Auf den bundesweiten Treffen der Streuobst-Aufpreisvermarkter wurde daher erstmals 1996 und wiederholt 2001, 2007 und 2014 das Kriterium des Verzichts auf Pestizide in die Definition von Streuobst aufgenommen. Brockhaus übernahm dies 2004 in die lexikalische Definition \\"Hochstamm-Obstbau ohne Einsatz synthetischer Behandlungsmittel\\"., Geschichte des Obstanbaus., Altertum und Mittelalter., Großfrüchtige Rosengewächse wie die Schlehe wurden in Mitteleuropa bereits in der Steinzeit genutzt, wobei nicht gesagt werden kann, ob es sich um Kulturpflanzen oder Kulturfolger handelt (siehe auch Pionierpflanzen). Ihre Verbreitungsgebiete lagen in der Nähe menschlicher Siedlungen. Für diese Zeit wurden auch die Kerne der Pflaumensorte Zibarte in den Siedlungen nachgewiesen., Vor allem die Römer brachten die nicht heimischen Apfelbäume, die Birnbäume, Zwetschgen und Süßkirschen, aber auch Walnuss und Edelkastanie nach Mitteleuropa. Hier konnten diese bereits im antiken Griechenland kultivierten Obstsorten nur in klimatisch begünstigten Gebieten gedeihen. Aus Kernen dieser Birn- und Apfelbäume gezogene Bäume hatten unterschiedliche Eigenschaften; einige konnten auch noch in den raueren Gebirgslagen angebaut werden. Im Gebiet der Mosel wird der Obstanbau etwa seit dem 2. Jahrhundert betrieben, im Lallinger Winkel seit dem 8. Jahrhundert. Als Alternative konnten die auf die Zibarte aufgepfropfte Pflaumen auch noch in den raueren Gebirgslagen gedeihen, wuchsen aber nur zu kleineren Bäumen heran., Die Züchtung robusterer und weniger anspruchsvoller Sorten wurde von den mittelalterlichen Klöstern betrieben, wie zum Beispiel im Kloster Niederaltaich. Selektiert wurden spätblühende und frostunempfindliche Sorten für raue Gebirgslagen, Dörrobst, lange lagerbare Früchte, Ertrag und Geschmack. In Württemberg auch in den Schloßgärtnereien. Die Anlage von Obstwiesen und Weinbergen wurde durch zahlreiche Edikte gefördert, in der Nähe der Klöster entstanden die ersten größeren Obstwiesen. Techniken und Sorten wurden aus Tirol, Oberösterreich und Böhmen übernommen. Streuobstäcker als Sonderform, bei der der Boden nicht als Grünland genutzt, sondern beackert wird, haben sich vor allem in Franken ausgebildet., 16. bis 18. Jahrhundert., Die in der Neuzeit voranschreitende Züchtung ermöglichte die Ausweitung des Obstanbaues in ganz Mitteleuropa, vor allem in Österreich, Tschechien, in Süddeutschland und in der Schweiz, auch auf ertragsschwachen und flachgründigen Böden der Hänge. Auf diese Weise wurde auch die Grünlandwirtschaft durch Bodenfestlegung nachhaltig durchführbar., Im 17., vor allem aber im 18. Jahrhundert, wurde der Obstanbau außerhalb der Gärten und der Dörfer politisch durch die absolutistischen Staaten stark gefördert und zum Teil erzwungen. Diese Epoche kann als die eigentliche Entstehungszeit des Streuobstanbaus betrachtet werden, der also keineswegs eine besonders alte Wirtschaftsform ist. Der Obstanbau spielte etwa ab dem 18. Jahrhundert eine größere Rolle für die Versorgung der Bevölkerung., Mit zunehmendem Ausbau des Straßennetzes wurden auch Alleen zwischen den Siedlungen angepflanzt, um die Transportmöglichkeiten zu nutzen. Auch Gemeinschaftsflächen wie Hofflächen mit Obstbäumen wurden angelegt und gemeinsam abgeerntet., Streuobstwiesen umgaben und verbanden landschaftlich prägend die Dörfer und Städte, wie eine Vielzahl von Quellen zeitgenössischer Autoren belegt. Sie wurden für die Versorgung der Bevölkerung unverzichtbar; das Wissen um ihre Pflege und um die Verarbeitung des Obstes war fester Bestandteil der Lehre der Landwirtschaft und der Hauswirtschaft., 19. und 20. Jahrhundert., Die Aufgabe des Weinbaus in weiten Gebieten um das Jahr 1800 führte vielerorts dazu, dass auf den ehemaligen Weinbergen Obstbäume gepflanzt wurden. Zur weiteren Ausweitung des Obstanbaus außerhalb der Siedlungen kam es ab der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts, als infolge der nun möglichen künstlichen Düngung Ackerbau auf nährstoffarmen Böden möglich wurde und im Gegenzug schwer zu bearbeitende Hänge mit Obstbäumen bepflanzt wurden., Die Wiesen- und Weidenutzung in den Obsthainen erhielt (statt der Ackernutzung) zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts einen großen Aufschwung, als das Molkereiwesen entstand und die Grünlandwirtschaft dadurch lohnender wurde. Ihren Höhepunkt hatte die Streuobstkultur etwa in den 20er und 30er Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts, zu einer Zeit, als schon die Obstplantagenwirtschaft begonnen hatte., Durch fortschreitende wissenschaftliche Entwicklung entstanden bis zum 20. Jahrhundert über 6000 Obstsorten, darunter mindestens 2700 Apfel-, 800 Birnen-, 400 Süßkirschensorten und 400 Pflaumenartige, die den Obstanbau selbst in Höhenlagen der Mittelgebirge ermöglichten. Spezielle Sorten für die Nutzung als Tafelobst, Saft, Most und Brand bis hin zum Backobst wurden regional verfeinert., Zur weiteren Entwicklung des Streuobstanbaus siehe unten: Rückgang im 20. Jahrhundert sowie Marketing und Pflege., Obstsorten der Streuobstwiesen., Die alten Sorten, die auch heute noch traditionell im Streuobstanbau verwendet werden, wurden zu einer Zeit entwickelt, als Pflanzenschutzmittel gar nicht oder nur sehr eingeschränkt zur Verfügung standen. Sie sind daher gegenüber Krankheiten und Schaderregern als besonders robust einzustufen. Die einzelnen Sorten entstanden dabei regionsspezifisch wie beispielsweise der Mostviertler Holzapfel oder der Erbachhofer, der norddeutsche Boikenapfel, der Rheinische Krummstiel und der Rheinische Bohnapfel. Die Verbreitung mancher Sorten ist gar auf wenige Dörfer beschränkt gewesen; es entstanden sogenannte \\"Lokalsorten\\". Während die heutigen Kultursorten, die im Intensivobstbau verwendet werden, auf weitgehend identische Elternsorten zurückgehen, stellen die typischen alten Obstsorten der Streuobstwiese, die über Jahrhunderte ortsspezifisch entwickelt wurden, damit ein großes genetisches Potential dar., Die Karcherbirne eignet sich auch für klimatisch ungünstige Lagen, die Blutbirne ist wegen ihres rot marmorierten Fruchtfleisches eine pomologische Besonderheit. Dattelzwetschgen eignen sich, wenn sie wurzelecht (unveredelt) gepflanzt werden, als Heckenpflanzung. Von den Kirschen eignet sich Dolleseppler besonders für Obstbrand (Kirschwasser) hervorragend., \\"Siehe auch: Liste von Apfelsorten\\", \\"Siehe auch:: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Kulturlandschaft - Obstbau - Wiese - Streuobstwiese - Obstgarten - Obstbau in Streulage - Streuobstbau - Obstplantagen - Grünland - Viehweide"},{"instruction":"Make a crossover fanfiction story about Barbie dolls and Oppenheimer.

Die Grenzen zu einer „normalen“ Tierkrankheit sind fließend, der Begriff „Tierseuche“ ist durch die Tierseuchengesetze der jeweiligen Staaten juristisch definiert und ist Ausdruck eines staatlichen Interesses an der Tilgung dieser Krankheit. Hochinfektiöse Erkrankungen bei Kleintieren wie die „Katzenseuche“ zählen nicht zu den Tierseuchen: Da sie keine ernsthafte Bedrohung für den Menschen (weder direkt noch indirekt) und die Katzenpopulation darstellen, sind sie rechtlich nicht reguliert., Einteilung., Nach der Art des Erregers werden Prionen- (Transmissible spongiforme Enzephalopathien wie Bovine spongiforme Enzephalopathie, BSE), virale (z.B. Tollwut), bakterielle (z.B. Brucellose), Pilz- (z.B. Krebspest) und parasitäre Erkrankungen unterschieden. Letztere können durch Einzeller (z.B. Toxoplasmose), Würmer (z.B. Echinokokkose), Milben (z.B. Varroose) oder Insekten (z.B. Hypodermose) hervorgerufen werden., Tierseuchen, die vor allem regional gehäuft auftreten, werden –analog der Endemie bei Erkrankungen des Menschen– Enzootien genannt. Eine schnelle Verbreitung über regionale Grenzen hinweg wird als Epizootie, über viele Länder und Kontinente hinweg als Panzootie bezeichnet., Auch eine Einteilung der Tierseuchen nach dem hauptsächlichen Übertragungsweg ist möglich, wobei insbesondere die sich sehr schnell verbreitenden Seuchen häufig mehrere Übertragungswege aufweisen. Die Kenntnis der Übertragungs- und Verbreitungswege (Epizootiologie) ist für die Wahl geeigneter Bekämpfungsmaßnahmen von überragender Bedeutung. Erkrankungen wie die Listeriose, deren Erreger praktisch überall (ubiquitär) im Boden vorkommt, heißen Geonosen. Vor allem über Futtermittel übertragbare Erkrankungen wie BSE bezeichnet man im englischen Sprachraum als \\"foodborne diseases\\", die auch die Lebensmittelinfektionen des Menschen einschließen. Sogenannte \\"airborne diseases\\" werden über den Wind –erregerbelastete Aerosole (Tröpfcheninfektionen wie Tuberkulose) und Staub– oder durch Fluginsekten (z.B. Blauzungenkrankheit) übertragen. „Wasserbürtige Krankheiten“ \\"(waterborne diseases)\\" wie die Virale Hämorrhagische Septikämie verbreiten sich über kontaminiertes Wasser. Kontaktinfektionen werden durch direkten Kontakt mit infizierten Tieren oder deren Ausscheidungen sowie indirekten Kontakt mittels kontaminierter Gegenstände übertragen. Eine Sonderform der Kontaktinfektionen sind die bei der Begattung übertragenen Deckseuchen., Bedeutung., Einige der als Tierseuche eingestuften Erkrankungen stellen eine direkte Infektionsgefährdung für den Menschen im Sinne einer Zoonose dar. Darunter befinden sich sowohl für den Menschen tödliche Erkrankungen wie die Tollwut als auch relativ harmlose wie die Maul- und Klauenseuche., Viele Tierseuchen sind für den Menschen direkt jedoch vollkommen ungefährlich und befallen nur wenige Tierarten. Solche Tierseuchen verursachen aber hohe wirtschaftliche Schäden und sind eine Bedrohung für die Nahrungsgrundlagen des Menschen. Dies beschränkt sich nicht nur auf direkte Verluste infolge von Seuchen bei Tieren zur Fleischerzeugung – Bienen sind bei der Bestäubung und damit dem Anbau vieler Nutzpflanzen unverzichtbar. Weitere ökonomische Verluste entstehen durch Handelsbeschränkungen im Falle eines Ausbruchs. Allein der Schweinepest-Ausbruch 1997/98 in den Niederlanden verursachte direkte Kosten von 2,3 Milliarden Euro, zusätzlich indirekte Kosten in ähnlicher Größenordnung und führte zur Tötung von 12 Millionen Schweinen., Die wirtschaftlichen Schäden durch Tierseuchen, insbesondere durch die Rinderpest, waren Anlass für die Gründung der ersten tierärztlichen Ausbildungsstätten im 18. Jahrhundert und damit für die Etablierung der akademischen Ausbildung des Tierarztes sowie für den Aufbau staatlicher Veterinärbehörden., Das hohe direkte und indirekte Schadenspotenzial machte Tierseuchen auch für die Entwicklung von biologischen Waffen interessant. Im Zweiten Weltkrieg wurde im Vereinigten Königreich mit Milzbranderregern experimentiert, das Versuchsgelände Gruinard Island wurde erst 1986/87 dekontaminiert und konnte bis dahin nur mit Schutzkleidung betreten werden. Auf der Liste potentieller Biowaffen stehen weitere Tierseuchen mit Zoonosecharakter wie Säugerpocken, Tularämie, Brucellose, Rotz, Psittakose, Q-Fieber und Pferdeenzephalomyelitiden., Bekämpfung., Für die Bekämpfung der Tierseuchen gelten besondere nationale gesetzliche Regelungen, in der Europäischen Union auch supranationale. Diese Rechtsbestimmungen regeln eine Melde- oder Anzeigepflicht sowie die einzuleitenden Maßnahmen. Für die meisten Tierseuchen besteht eine \\"Bekämpfungspflicht\\", das heißt, der Tierbesitzer hat die angewiesenen diagnostischen, therapeutischen und seuchenhygienischen Maßnahmen –eventuell auch die Tötung– durchzuführen oder zu dulden., Die Art der Bekämpfungsmaßnahmen richtet sich nach den Eigenarten der Ausbreitung der jeweiligen Tierseuche (Epizootiologie). Ihre Anweisung und Durchsetzung obliegen den staatlichen Veterinärbehörden, die auf der Basis der gesetzlichen Regelungen erfolgt. Beim grenzüberschreitenden Verkehr von Tieren und Tierprodukten arbeiten die Veterinärbehörden mit der Zollverwaltung zusammen., Die Tierseuchenüberwachung umfasst dabei auch vorbeugende Maßnahmen (Seuchenprophylaxe). Dazu gehören die Überwachung des grenzüberschreitenden Verkehrs von Tieren und Tierprodukten, die Überwachung von Viehmärkten und Tierprodukte verarbeitenden Betrieben, die Kennzeichnung von Tieren und Erzeugnissen, das Führen von Deckregistern, Festlegungen zur Fachkunde von in einem Viehbestand beschäftigten Personen (dieses gilt nach \\"§17g TierSG\\" zum Schutz vor der Psittakose auch für Halter von Papageien) sowie Festlegungen zu Bau, Betrieb und Zulassung von Tierhaltungen, Tierprodukte verarbeitenden, tierabfallentsorgenden und futtermittelerzeugenden Betrieben., Bei Verdacht oder Ausbruch einer Tierseuche können von den Veterinärbehörden eine Reihe von Maßnahmen angeordnet werden, wobei selbst verfassungsmäßige Rechte wie die Freiheit der Person, die Freizügigkeit oder die Unverletzbarkeit der Wohnung vorübergehend eingeschränkt werden können. Es muss nicht einmal der Bestand selbst von der Seuche betroffen sein, sondern auch Zustallungen aus betroffenen Beständen oder die Lage in einem Seuchengebiet können hinreichend sein. Maßnahmen umfassen beispielsweise die Anordnung diagnostischer Untersuchungen, die Absonderung erkrankter und ansteckungsverdächtiger Tiere (Quarantäne), ein Verbot oder Beschränkungen des Tier-, Personen- oder Fahrzeugverkehrs, das Verbot der Außenhaltung (Stallpflicht), die Einrichtung von Sperrbezirken sowie Überwachungs- und Beobachtungsgebieten, die Anordnung von Reinigungs- und Desinfektionsmaßnahmen, Impfungen und anderen Behandlungen sowie Festlegungen zur Beseitigung von Tierkörpern, -produkten und -abfallprodukten. Für einige Erkrankungen existieren Behandlungs- und Impfverbote, um deren unbemerkte Ausbreitung zu verhindern. Dies führt zum Teil zu Massentötungen („Keulung“) von infizierten, infektionsgefährdeten oder auch nur prinzipiell empfänglichen Tieren., Die Rigidität der gesetzlich geregelten Bekämpfungsmaßnahmen hat keinen unmittelbaren Bezug zum Zoonosecharakter oder zur Gefahr für die betroffene Tierart. Bei für den Menschen vollkommen ungefährlichen Seuchen, für die auch Impfstoffe existieren (beispielsweise Klassische Schweinepest), sind daher Impfverbote und Massenkeulungen sowohl in der Bevölkerung als auch in Fachkreisen umstritten. Andererseits werden stets tödlich verlaufende Zoonosen wie die Tollwut durch Impfprogramme bekämpft. Selbst für Tier und Mensch eher harmlose Erkrankungen wie die Stomatitis papulosa unterliegen der Meldepflicht und stehen damit auf der gleichen Stufe wie die meisten Salmonellosen. Für die Wahl der gesetzlichen Regelungen spielen auch andere Einflussfaktoren eine Rolle. Dies können internationale Restriktionen beim Handel mit Tieren und Tierprodukten, die Verhinderung des Ausbruchs einer bereits weitgehend oder vollständig getilgten Seuche, epizootiologische Gesichtspunkte oder die Verwechslungsmöglichkeit mit gefährlicheren Seuchen sein., Obwohl die konsequente Tierseuchenbekämpfung zur erfolgreichen Tilgung der meisten gefährlichen Tierseuchen in Europa geführt hat, ist dies auch mit Nachteilen verbunden. Bedingt durch fehlenden Erregerkontakt und Impfverbote haben die europäischen Tierpopulationen keinen Antikörperschutz. Da jedoch die meisten Tierseuchen in Afrika und Asien noch häufig vorkommen, besteht die ständige Gefahr der Einschleppung. Trifft ein Erreger auf eine „jungfräuliche“, voll empfängliche Population, kommt es meist zu sehr schweren Krankheitsbildern mit hohen Verlusten. In Enzootiegebieten ist dagegen häufig ein selbstlimitierendes Seuchengeschehen mit teilweise milden Verläufen zu beobachten., Organisation der Tierseuchenbekämpfung., Weltorganisation für Tiergesundheit., Die Weltorganisation für Tiergesundheit (1924 als OIE – \\"Office International des Epizooties\\" – gegründet, 2003 in \\"World Organisation for Animal Health\\" [WOAH] umbenannt) ist für die internationale Beobachtung und Kontrolle der Tierseuchen zuständig. Die hier organisierten Länder melden nachgewiesene Erkrankungen an diese Organisation, wo sie gesammelt und die Informationen den Veterinärbehörden zugänglich gemacht werden., Die WOAH stufte bis Ende 2004 Tierseuchen in zwei Gruppen ein:, Diese Einteilung wurde jedoch aufgegeben, so dass nunmehr alle Tierseuchen in einer einheitlichen Liste geführt werden., Europäische Union., In der Europäischen Union wird eine Harmonisierung der tierseuchenrechtlichen Bestimmungen angestrebt.

Schreiben Sie eine Stellungnahme zum Thema in Bezug auf die Vorteile und Nachteile und ein Fazit","output":"Eine Bonuszahlung für Mitarbeiter, die regelmäßig an Weiterbildungen teilnehmen, birgt sowohl Vorteile als auch Nachteile. Ein großer Vorteil dieser Bonuszahlungen liegt darin, dass sie die Motivation der Mitarbeiter zur beruflichen Weiterentwicklung steigern können. Durch die Aussicht auf einen finanziellen Anreiz werden Mitarbeiter dazu angeregt, sich aktiv mit neuen Themen und Entwicklungen in ihrem Fachgebiet auseinanderzusetzen. Dies kann zu einer höheren Fachkompetenz und besseren Leistung der Mitarbeiter führen, was wiederum dem Unternehmen zugutekommt. Eine weitere positive Auswirkung der Bonuszahlungen ist die Steigerung der Mitarbeiterbindung und -zufriedenheit. Durch die Anerkennung und Wertschätzung, die mit einer solchen Bonuszahlung einhergeht, fühlen sich Mitarbeiter mehr geschätzt und engagieren sich stärker für das Unternehmen. Dies kann zu einer höheren Mitarbeiterloyalität und einer niedrigeren Fluktuation führen, was wiederum Kosten für die Personalbeschaffung und -einarbeitung reduziert. Trotz dieser Vorteile gibt es jedoch auch potenzielle Nachteile bei einer solchen Bonuszahlung. Zum einen könnte es dazu führen, dass Mitarbeiter Weiterbildungen nur aus finanziellen Gründen absolvieren, ohne wirkliches Interesse an der beruflichen Weiterentwicklung zu haben. Dies könnte zu einer Verschwendung von Ressourcen führen, da Weiterbildungsinvestitionen möglicherweise nicht den gewünschten Mehrwert bringen. Darüber hinaus besteht die Gefahr, dass Mitarbeiter mit bereits umfangreicher Weiterbildung von den Bonuszahlungen profitieren, während Mitarbeiter mit weniger Weiterbildungsmöglichkeiten benachteiligt werden. Dies könnte zu einer Ungerechtigkeit innerhalb des Unternehmens und zur Demotivation von Mitarbeitern führen, die aufgrund ihrer Position oder aus anderen Gründen weniger Chancen auf Weiterbildungen haben. Insgesamt kann festgestellt werden, dass die Bonuszahlung für Mitarbeiter, die regelmäßig Weiterbildungen absolvieren, sowohl Vorteile als auch Nachteile birgt. Um diese Nachteile zu minimieren, sollten klare Kriterien für die Bonuszahlungen definiert werden, die sicherstellen, dass Mitarbeiter, die aus Interesse an Weiterbildung teilnehmen, im Vordergrund stehen. Darüber hinaus sollten auch Möglichkeiten geschaffen werden, um allen Mitarbeitern unabhängig von ihrer Position oder ihrem Zugang zu Weiterbildungsmöglichkeiten die Chance auf persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung zu bieten.

Jahrhundert), Politik 1931, Pressefreiheit in Deutschland, Pressegeschichte (Deutschland), Recht (Weimarer Republik), Reichswehr], Der Weltbühne-Prozess (häufig auch Weltbühnenprozess) war eines der spektakulärsten Strafverfahren gegen militärkritische Presseorgane und Journalisten in der Weimarer Republik. In dem Prozess wurden der Herausgeber der Wochenzeitschrift \\"Die Weltbühne\\", Carl von Ossietzky, sowie der Journalist Walter Kreiser wegen Landesverrats und Verrats militärischer Geheimnisse angeklagt und im November 1931 vom IV. Strafsenat des Reichsgerichts in Leipzig zu je 18 Monaten Freiheitsstrafe verurteilt., Wegen des brisanten Themas des heimlichen Aufbaus einer deutschen Luftwaffe und des mit Anklage und Urteil intendierten Angriffs auf die Pressefreiheit erregte der Prozess im In- und Ausland großes Aufsehen. Eine Wiederaufnahme des Verfahrens vor bundesdeutschen Gerichten scheiterte 1992. Der Prozess gilt als Musterbeispiel politischer Justiz in der Weimarer Republik., Vorgeschichte., Vertrag von Versailles., Nach der Niederlage im Ersten Weltkrieg hatte das Deutsche Reich mit dem Vertrag von Versailles in eine starke Beschränkung seiner militärischen Kräfte einwilligen müssen. Trotz der geleisteten Unterschrift versuchten Reichsregierung und Reichswehr systematisch, die Bestimmungen des Vertrages zu unterlaufen. Vor allem die in Artikel 163 festgelegte Begrenzung des deutschen Heeres auf eine Höchststärke von 100.000 Mann versuchten sie von Anfang an zu umgehen. So unterstützten einflussreiche Kreise der Reichsregierung und der Reichswehr insgeheim den Aufbau paramilitärischer Verbände und legten illegale Waffenlager an., Diese paramilitärischen Verbände, die aus den Freikorps der unmittelbaren Nachkriegszeit hervorgegangen waren und auch als Schwarze Reichswehr bezeichnet wurden, bildeten einen ständigen Unsicherheitsfaktor der deutschen Innenpolitik. Sie formten zum Teil rechtsfreie Räume, in denen Gewaltdelikte gegen Andersdenkende und abtrünnige Mitglieder toleriert und begangen wurden., Pazifistische und antimilitaristische Kreise in der Weimarer Republik sahen daher im Verhalten der Reichswehr eine Gefahr für den inneren Frieden sowie für die außenpolitische Konsolidierung des Deutschen Reiches. Verschiedene Publikationsorgane machten auf die Missstände aufmerksam. So führte eine Veröffentlichung der \\"Weltbühne\\" über die Fememorde in der Schwarzen Reichswehr schließlich zu mehreren Strafverfahren gegen die Täter. Die juristische Aufarbeitung dieser Delikte war aber von Beginn der Weimarer Republik an von einer extremen Parteinahme für die Täter erschwert. So räumte das Reichsgericht zu Gunsten der Fememörder ein, „daß es auch ein Notwehrrecht des einzelnen Staatsbürgers gegenüber rechtswidrigen Angriffen auf die Lebensinteressen des Staates gibt“ (Entscheidungen des Reichsgerichts in Strafsachen 63, 215 (220)). Im Gegenzug wurden Pazifisten, die die illegalen Waffenlager verraten hatten, wegen Landesverrats zu 10 bis 15 Jahren Haft verurteilt., Militärkritische Presse., Auch die Medien, die auf die Missstände aufmerksam machten, waren starken Repressionen ausgesetzt. Die Journalisten Berthold Jacob und Fritz Küster wurden beispielsweise 1928 wegen „publizistischen Landesverrats“ im „Ponton-Prozess“ verurteilt, weil sie das System der Zeitfreiwilligen aufgedeckt hatten. Diese Soldaten wurden kurzfristig zu militärischen Übungen herangezogen und tauchten in keiner Statistik auf. Das Reichsgericht kam in seinem Urteil gegen Jacob und Küster zu folgender Ansicht: Der Gedanke sei abzulehnen, „dass die Aufdeckung und Bekanntgabe gesetzwidriger Zustände dem Reichswohle niemals abträglich, nur förderlich sein könne, weil das Wohl des Staates in seiner Rechtsordnung festgelegt sei und sich in deren Durchführung verwirkliche“ (RGSt 62, 65 (67)). Darüber hinaus verlangte das Reichsgericht: „Dem eigenen Staat hat jeder Staatsbürger die Treue zu halten. Das Wohl des eigenen Staates wahrzunehmen, ist für ihn höchstes Gebot“. Aus dieser Perspektive verwundert es nicht, dass allein in den Jahren 1924 bis 1927 mehr als 1000 Personen wegen Landesverrats, Beleidigung der Reichswehr und ähnlicher Delikte verurteilt wurden. Wie sehr sich die Rechtslehre in dieser Frage mit der Politik identifizierte, zeigt eine Passage aus einer Abhandlung zum Landesverrat im deutschen Strafrecht:, Die Bestimmungen des Versailler Vertrages beschränkten jedoch nicht nur die Stärke des Heeres. Sie verboten in Artikel 198 auch ausdrücklich den Aufbau eigener Luftstreitkräfte. In pazifistischen Kreisen war jedoch bekannt, dass auch diese Bestimmung umgangen wurde. So monierte Berthold Jacob an der \\"Rangliste des deutschen Reichsheeres\\" eine fehlende Transparenz,, Zu den Journalisten, die sich besonders intensiv mit dem heimlichen Aufbau der deutschen Luftwaffe befassten, gehörte der Flugzeugkonstrukteur Walter Kreiser. In einem Brief vom August 1925 bezeichnete sich Kreiser als „einzige[n] in pazifistischen Kreisen, der genauen Einblick in die Fliegerei hat“. Daher hatte er bereits unter dem Pseudonym \\"Konrad Widerhold\\" sieben Beiträge zum Thema Luftfahrt in der \\"Weltbühne\\" veröffentlicht. Wegen der Mitarbeit an dem Werk \\"Die deutsche Militärpolitik seit 1918\\" war bereits 1926 gegen ihn ein Verfahren wegen Landesverrats und Verrats militärischer Geheimnisse eingeleitet worden, das 1928 jedoch eingestellt wurde. Anfang 1929 bot Kreiser schließlich der \\"Weltbühne\\" einen neuen Artikel an, von dessen Veröffentlichung er sich eine große Resonanz versprach. Dies geht auch aus einem Brief Kreisers vom 4. März 1929 an Ossietzky hervor, der später vom Gericht belastend gegen die Angeklagten gewertet wurde. Darin hieß es:, Der inkriminierte Artikel., Vor dem geschilderten Hintergrund wundert es nicht, dass der unter dem Pseudonym \\"Heinz Jäger\\" am 12. März 1929 in der \\"Weltbühne\\" erschienene Artikel „Windiges aus der deutschen Luftfahrt“ das Missfallen der Reichswehr erregte. In dem umfangreichen, fünfeinhalbseitigen Artikel befasste sich Kreiser zunächst mit allgemeinen Fragen zur Situation der deutschen Luftfahrt, bevor er sich auf den letzten anderthalb Seiten schließlich den Verbindungen zwischen Reichswehr und Luftfahrtindustrie widmete. Aus diesem Abschnitt ging hervor, dass die Reichswehr offensichtlich unter Umgehung des Versailler Vertrages den heimlichen Aufbau einer Luftwaffe betrieb. Unter der Überschrift „Abteilung M“ schrieb Kreiser:, Im Manuskript soll außerdem gestanden haben, dass sich die Flugzeuge zeitweise in Russland befänden. Diese Passagen hatte Ossietzky vorsichtshalber gestrichen und sich auf die Andeutung beschränkt. Kreiser bezog sich mit seinen Äußerungen zum Teil auf das Protokoll der 312. Sitzung des Ausschusses für den Reichshaushalt vom 3. Februar 1928. Obwohl dieses Protokoll als Drucksache vorlag, startete der Oberreichsanwalt ein Ermittlungsverfahren wegen Verstoßes gegen den Landesverratsparagrafen des Reichsstrafgesetzbuches und gegen Paragraf 1, Absatz 2 des Gesetzes gegen den Verrat militärischer Geheimnisse (das sog. Spionagegesetz vom 3. Juni 1914, Reichsgesetzblatt, 195)., Verfahren., Am 1. August 1929 wurde schließlich ein Strafantrag gestellt. In einem Schreiben vom 8. August 1929 teilte der Oberreichsanwalt dem preußischen Innenminister mit, dass eine Voruntersuchung wegen des inkriminierten Artikels eingeleitet worden sei. Zur Begründung hieß es, dass Ossietzky und Kreiser,, Im Zuge der Ermittlungen wurden die Redaktionsräume der \\"Weltbühne\\" sowie die Wohnung Ossietzkys durchsucht. Im August 1929 wurde Ossietzky außerdem zu dem Fall vernommen. Dass es anschließend nicht zur Verhandlung kam, wird den im Folgenden geschilderten politischen Implikationen zugeschrieben., Politische Implikationen., Die Reichsregierung befand sich nach der Veröffentlichung des Artikels in einem Dilemma. Hätte sie den Artikel ignoriert oder lediglich dementiert, wäre sie Gefahr gelaufen, dass weitere Details aus den heimlichen Aufrüstungsbemühungen an die Öffentlichkeit gedrungen wären. Ein scharfes Vorgehen gegen Autor und Herausgeber kam jedoch dem Eingeständnis gleich, dass das Deutsche Reich tatsächlich die Bestimmungen von Versailles verletzte und heimlich eine Luftwaffe aufbaute. Die Interessen von Reichswehrministerium und Auswärtigem Amt kollidierten daher sehr stark., Wie sich im weiteren Prozessverlauf zeigte, wurden die militärischen Interessen wichtiger eingeschätzt als der außenpolitische Schaden, der sich durch eine Verurteilung der Journalisten ergeben müsste. Die Auswertung von sowjetischen Archiven ergab, dass die Veröffentlichung des Artikels auch in Moskau wahrgenommen worden war., Dem Reichswehrministerium musste sehr daran gelegen sein, die wichtige Militärkooperation mit der Sowjetunion nicht zu gefährden. Das Auswärtige Amt musste dagegen durch eine öffentliche Gerichtsverhandlung die Verhandlungsposition des Reiches bei den Genfer Abrüstungsverhandlungen als bedroht betrachten. Wie wichtig das Amt den Prozess nahm, zeigt auch die Tatsache, dass die gesammelten Unterlagen mehrere Aktenbände in der Rechtsabteilung füllten. Dass sich der Prozessbeginn so lange verzögerte, wird dem Widerstand des Außenministeriums zugeschrieben, das bis Oktober 1929 noch von Gustav Stresemann geführt worden war. Dort sei mit Blick auf das erwähnte Reichstagsprotokoll die Frage aufgeworfen worden, ob die Angaben aus dem Artikel tatsächlich geheim gewesen seien., Dennoch wurde das Verfahren nicht beendet. Im Frühjahr 1931 einigten sich die drei beteiligten Ministerien schließlich auf einen Kompromiss, um ein Gerichtsverfahren eröffnen zu können. Mehr als zwei Jahre nach Erscheinen des Artikels, am 30. März 1931, wurde Anklage erhoben., Juristische Akteure., Aufseiten der Staatsanwaltschaft und des Reichsgerichts hatte es die \\"Weltbühne\\" mit Juristen zu tun, die bereits einschlägig Bekanntheit erlangt hatten. Reichsanwalt Paul Jorns, unter dessen Leitung die Anklage gegen Ossietzky erarbeitet wurde, war an den Ermittlungen zu den Morden an Karl Liebknecht und Rosa Luxemburg beteiligt und hatte dort Spuren verwischt.

He awoke in the Barbieland, a world populated by dolls. Oppenheimer was lying on the grass in Barbie’s garden. Barbie was watering her garden plants when she came into Oppenheimer, who was dressed in a suit and hat. Oppenheimer was astounded by how cheerful and vibrant everything was instead of dark and depressing. Barbie was concerned about him because he was dirty and full of dirt and grass. She invited Oppenheimer to her pink, lovely, and elegant dreamhouse. Her boyfriend Ken entered Barbie’s room, and he was doubtful of her guest Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer immediately recalls his wife Kitty and his ex-girlfriend Jean Tatlock, a bisexual communist because Barbie reminds him of them. Oppenheimer explored the Barbieland and other dolls with Barbie. Then Barbie asked him to the disco party. Oppenheimer was quiet at the party until he began to dance, even though he had no dance experience. After the disco night with Barbie and Ken, Opppenheimer went for a morning walk on Malibu Beach. Instead of war and terrorism, the dolls were joyful and enjoying their lives.

As he opened his eyes, he found himself lying on the soft grass in Barbie's beautiful garden paradise. He blinked, trying to comprehend the vibrant and lively surroundings that were so drastically different from what he had experienced in his previous life. Barbie, dressed in her signature pink outfit, was tending to her bountiful garden. With a watering can in hand, she looked up and discovered Oppenheimer lying there, dirty and disheveled. Concerned, she rushed over to help him. Barbie: \\"Oh my! Are you alright? You're covered in dirt and grass!\\" Oppenheimer, still trying to process his new reality, sat up and brushed himself off. He looked at Barbie with a mix of confusion and awe. Oppenheimer: \\"I... I... Where am I? Who are you?\\" Barbie: \\"You're in Barbieland! I'm Barbie, and this is my dreamhouse. You seem lost, and you definitely need some cleaning up. Why don't you come with me?\\" Chapter 2: Unlikely Connections Barbie's boyfriend, Ken, entered the room and found Barbie with a stranger, Oppenheimer. He eyed the scientist skeptically, unsure of his intentions. Ken: \\"Barbie, who is this guy? Should we really be letting a stranger into our dreamhouse?\\" Oppenheimer, noticing Ken's suspicion, felt a wave of nostalgia and longing. The way Barbie and Ken interacted reminded him of his wife, Kitty, and his ex-girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. Oppenheimer: \\"Ken, my dear boy, I assure you I mean no harm. In fact, being here with Barbie brings back memories of loved ones I once cherished.\\" Ken, taken aback by the profound statement, realized that underneath Oppenheimer's mysterious appearance, there was a complex history and emotions at play. Ken: \\"Alright, Oppenheimer, I trust Barbie's judgment. If she sees something in you, then we'll give you a chance.\\" Chapter 3: Exploring the Joyful Barbieland Oppenheimer, now feeling clean and refreshed, joined Barbie on an adventure through Barbieland. They explored the vibrant toy stores, interacted with other dolls, and even had a spontaneous dance party. Oppenheimer, usually reserved and contemplative, found himself immersed in the newfound joy and energy of Barbieland. He danced alongside Barbie and the other dolls, losing himself in the music and laughter. Oppenheimer: \\"This... this feeling of pure happiness, it's like nothing I've ever experienced before. How is it that a world made of dolls can exude such light?\\" Barbie: \\"That's the magic of Barbieland, Oppenheimer. It's a place where happiness and unity prevail over darkness and despair. You have a lot to learn from us, just as we have much to learn from you.\\" Chapter 4: A New Perspective The disco night came to an end, leaving Oppenheimer with a newfound appreciation for the simple pleasures in life. Inspired by the dolls' carefree nature, Oppenheimer went for a morning walk on Malibu Beach. Oppenheimer marveled at the absence of war and terrorism. Instead, he witnessed the dolls enjoying their lives with a zest for adventure and friendship. Oppenheimer: \\"To think that a world like this is possible... Where happiness takes center stage, and frivolity triumphs over fear. It's a perspective I never considered before.\\" As the waves crash against the shore and the sun gently kissed his face, Oppenheimer vowed to embrace this new chapter in his unexpected existence.

Then arguing by symmetry, you need only look for points which achieve the maximum which lie in the first octant. Maximum volume:___","output":"To find the maximum volume of the rectangular box inscribed in the given ellipsoid, we can follow the hint provided. First, let's write the equation of the ellipsoid in terms of the semi-axes: x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1 For our given ellipsoid: x^2/25 + y^2/16 + z^2/49 = 1 Comparing this with the general equation, we have: a^2 = 25 b^2 = 16 c^2 = 49 Since we want to maximize the volume V = 8xyz, we can use the Lagrange Multiplier method to solve for the lengths of the sides x, y, and z. Let's define the Lagrangian function: L(x, y, z, λ) = 8xyz + λ(x^2/25 + y^2/16 + z^2/49 - 1) Taking the partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero, we have: ∂L/∂x = 8yz + (2λ/25)x = 0 ∂L/∂y = 8xz + (2λ/16)y = 0 ∂L/∂z = 8xy + (2λ/49)z = 0 ∂L/∂λ = x^2/25 + y^2/16 + z^2/49 - 1 = 0 From the first equation: x = -(25/2λ)yz Substituting this back into the second equation: 8(-(25/2λ)yz)z + (2λ/16)y = 0 -200λyz + (2λ/16)y = 0 -200z + (2/16)y = 0 y = 1600z Substituting these values into the third equation: 8(-(25/2λ)yz)y + (2λ/49)z = 0 -200λyz^2 + (2λ/49)z = 0 -200yz^2 + (2/49)z = 0 -100y + (1/49) = 0 y = 0.01z Substituting these values into the fourth equation: (1600z)^2/25 + (0.01z)^2/16 + z^2/49 - 1 = 0 2560000z^2/25 + 0.0001z^2/16 + z^2/49 - 1 = 0 (51200 + 0.0001 + 1)z^2/25 - 1 = 0 51201.0001z^2/25 - 1 = 0 z^2 = 25/51201.0001 z = √(25/51201.0001) Since we have assumed x, y, and z are positive in the first octant, the maximum volume of the rectangular box can be given by: V = 8xyz = 8*(-(25/2λ)yz)*yz*z V = -100*(25/2λ)*(1600z^2)*(√(25/51201.0001))^3 V = -100*(25/2λ)*(1600*(25/51201.0001))*(25/51201.0001)^(3/2) V = -100*(25/2λ)*(25/51201.0001)^(3/2)*(40000/51201.0001) V ≈ 1786.65*(25/λ)*(25/51201.0001)^(3/2) To find the maximum volume, we need to find the maximum value of V by considering all possible values of λ. Since the volume of a rectangular box cannot be negative, we can ignore the negative sign in front of the expression. Hence, the maximum volume of the rectangular box is given by: Max(V) ≈ 1786.65*(25/λ)*(25/51201.0001)^(3/2) The actual numerical value of Max(V) cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of λ that maximizes it."},{"instruction":"我给你一个代码，自动复原的功能已经有了，你在这个的基础上帮我加开始游戏和自动复原的按钮，点击开始游戏时是正常打乱，正常游戏的；点自动复原就会自动复原：import pygame import queue # 定义拼图的尺寸和行列数 PUZZLE_SIZE = 450 ROW_COL_NUM = 3 CELL_SIZE = PUZZLE_SIZE // ROW_COL_NUM # 定义拼图块的颜色 BLACK = (0, 0, 0) WHITE = (255, 255, 255) # 定义拼图块的编号和位置的字典 pieces = { 0: (0, 0), 1: (1, 0), 2: (2, 0), 3: (0, 1), 4: (1, 1), 5: (2, 1), 6: (0, 2), 7: (1, 2), 8: (2, 2) } # 定义拼图块的移动方向 directions = [ (0, -1), # 上 (0, 1), # 下 (-1, 0), # 左 (1, 0) # 右 ] # 定义图像的像素点 pixels = [] # 初始化pygame pygame.init() # 创建窗口 window = pygame.display.set_mode((PUZZLE_SIZE, PUZZLE_SIZE)) pygame.display.set_caption(“自动复原九宫格拼图”) # 加载图像 image = pygame.image.load(“1.jpg”) image = pygame.transform.scale(image, (PUZZLE_SIZE, PUZZLE_SIZE)) # 初始化拼图块列表 puzzle = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] # 将图像切成9个拼图块 for row in range(ROW_COL_NUM): for col in range(ROW_COL_NUM): sub_image = image.subsurface(col * CELL_SIZE, row * CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE) puzzle[row][col] = sub_image pixels.append(pygame.transform.average_color(sub_image)[:3]) # 定义图像处理和绘制函数 def handle_image(): for row in range(ROW_COL_NUM): for col in range(ROW_COL_NUM): if puzzle[row][col] == 0: continue puzzle[row][col] = image.subsurface(col * CELL_SIZE, row * CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE) def draw_puzzle(): for row in range(ROW_COL_NUM): for col in range(ROW_COL_NUM): if puzzle[row][col] == 0: continue window.blit(puzzle[row][col], (col * CELL_SIZE, row * CELL_SIZE)) def can_move(row, col, direction): new_row = row + direction[1] new_col = col + direction[0] if new_row < 0 or new_row >= ROW_COL_NUM or new_col < 0 or new_col >= ROW_COL_NUM: return False return True def move_piece(row, col, direction): new_row = row + direction[1] new_col = col + direction[0] puzzle[row][col], puzzle[new_row][new_col] = puzzle[new_row][new_col], puzzle[row][col] def neighbors(state): row, col = state[1][0], state[1][1] for direction in directions: if can_move(row, col, direction): new_state = list(state) new_state[0] += 1 move_piece(row, col, direction) new_state[1] = (row + direction[1], col + direction[0]) yield tuple(new_state) move_piece(new_state[1][0], new_state[1][1], (-direction[0], -direction[1])) # 广度优先搜索算法 def bfs(): start_state = (0, pieces[0]) final_state = (8, (2, 2)) visited = set() q = queue.Queue() q.put(start_state) while not q.empty(): state = q.get() if state == final_state: result = [] while state[1] != start_state[1]: result.append(state[1]) state = state[2] result.reverse() return result visited.add(state) for neighbor in neighbors(state): if neighbor not in visited: q.put(neighbor + (state,)) return False # 自动复原拼图 def auto_solve(): sequence = bfs() if sequence: for target_position in sequence: move_piece(pieces[0][0], pieces[0][1], (target_position[0] - pieces[0][0], target_position[1] - pieces[0][1])) pieces[0] = target_position draw_puzzle() pygame.display.flip() pygame.time.wait(500) # 处理图像 handle_image() # 主循环 running = True while running: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False pygame.quit() if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE: auto_solve() window.fill(BLACK) draw_puzzle() pygame.display.flip(","output":"您可以在代码中添加开始游戏和自动复原的按钮，以便通过点击按钮来触发相应的功能。 首先，需要导入额外的模块和库文件： \`\`\`python import pygame_gui # 初始化Pygame GUI pygame_gui.init() # 设置游戏窗口的尺寸 window_size = (PUZZLE_SIZE, PUZZLE_SIZE + 100) # 创建GUI管理器 manager = pygame_gui.UIManager(window_size) # 创建开始游戏按钮 start_button = pygame_gui.elements.UIButton(relative_rect=pygame.Rect((25, PUZZLE_SIZE + 20), (100, 50)), text='开始游戏', manager=manager) # 创建自动复原按钮 auto_button = pygame_gui.elements.UIButton(relative_rect=pygame.Rect((150, PUZZLE_SIZE + 20), (100, 50)), text='自动复原', manager=manager) \`\`\` 然后，需要在主循环中添加对按钮点击事件的处理： \`\`\`python # 主循环 running = True while running: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False pygame.quit() if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN: # 检查开始游戏按钮是否被点击 if start_button.rect.collidepoint(event.pos): # 开始游戏的处理逻辑，例如重新打乱拼图块 # 检查自动复原按钮是否被点击 if auto_button.rect.collidepoint(event.pos): # 自动复原的处理逻辑，例如调用auto_solve()函数 auto_solve() # 更新GUI界面 manager.process_events(event) window.fill(BLACK) draw_puzzle() # 绘制按钮和界面 manager.update(time_delta) manager.draw_ui(window) pygame.display.flip() \`\`\` 这样，您就可以在拼图游戏中添加开始游戏和自动复原的按钮了。当点击开始游戏按钮时，可以在适当的位置添加重新打乱拼图块的代码逻辑。当点击自动复原按钮时，即可调用自动复原函数auto_solve()来实现拼图的自动复原。"},{"instruction":"These are the requirements for writing the introduction chapter for my thesis.

Memory Optimization has been done for conversion of non utf-8 data to UTF-8 using two pass strategy of the circular buffer queue where the size of the data was calculated in the first pass and then a buffer of calculated sized was passed in the second pass to the utf-8 converter to prevent declaring static arrays to store the utf-8 converted data reducing the memory consumption of the software by 30%. Also The parameter range of all the parameters of all the API's have been analysed and error checking of ranges of all the parameters of all the API's have been implemented using Test Driven Development. AuRa Middleware stands for Autonomous Radio multi-standard radio control stack written in C++. It can recognize the features of an incoming signal and respond intelligently without explicit pre-configuration or reprogramming to define the functions of the radio. The main drivers for Middleware development are NXP’s earlier experience with DAB control middleware development on Cayman for LG and Control Middleware stack development for GM on the “Saturn”[1] radio processor. AuRa was then developed as a radio control middleware for the “Mercury”[2] radio processing chip, and it serves as a proof of concept to customers to start with early integration on Android Open Source Project even before “Quantum”[3], which is the world’s first one-chip solution for all global in-car infotainment and broadcast standards is available. The evolution of AuRa Middleware was developed by tier one to run on SOC to access the radio hardware. NXP started with the abstraction of the transport protocol of Mercury by radio driver and accessing analog and digital radio and audio and made device-specific functionalities simpler through the radio drivers. In the next phase, all tuner resources were abstracted, and maximum tuner performance was achieved through the AuRaLite subsystem that runs on Mercury. Today, a multi-standard radio control stack with complete radio use cases is available to the OEMs for early integration through AuRa+ middleware driver APIs as proof of concept. In Quantum, AuRa+ middleware would be an integral part of the firmware itself. The AuRa+ middleware driver APIs are made in line with official Google Broadcast APIs in such a way that integration of middleware with the open-source android project is more straightforward. The AuRa middleware requires minimal knowledge of radio and provides a turnkey solution to the Android automotive system through the abstraction of tuner resources and minimal development risks. AuRa supports various radio standards that include AM, FM, HD, DAB, DRM, and CDR with one standard API. It also provides a Unified Service List, seamless blending between FM and DAB, announcements, and Data Services. The Radio use-cases are scalable from low end to high end with advanced use-case handling for different tuner configurations, VTS-tested Tuner Middleware Service for Android Automotive OS version 12, and Engineering menu support for diagnostics and development. AuRa+ middleware, the multi-standard radio control stack with all the radio uses, is already available in Quantum firmware. Android Automotive OS provides the radio application APIs to the customer application, which runs on AOSP and to Google HAL. The glue logic between Google HAL and AuRa+ is provided as a reference code. With this, the customers can easily interface with Quantum through AVB or Ethernet and get the radio functionalities as a turnkey solution. AuRa+ provides exclusive feature sets for engineering and diagnostics purposes through Engineering Menu APIs. For instance, Service Following and FM detector information is shown through Engineering Menu windows using Evaluation UI. The Customers will have restricted exposure to the internals of radio features for diagnostic purposes. AuRa middleware solution is road tested for multi-standard radio in geographical locations. The first level is a test performed by NXP for a large set of signal conditions with various tunnel scenarios and mountain areas where service following use cases are tested exhaustively. The next level of the road test is planned with tier 1 for tune parameters and system tests. The final level of the road test is optionally prepared with OEM for acceptance and fine-tuning. One of the most complex use cases of AuRa is DAB-DAB-FM seamless blending. When a car is started, the user selects their favourite service, which is received from station A. As the vehicle moves away from the reception zone of station A, audio is blended to the available alternates, i.e. Station B, seamlessly. Further, as it moves from coverage of Station B, it seamlessly switches to the FM station. Another significant feature of AuRa is the Unified Service List. A single entry in the USL represents all the receivable FM and DAB stations with the same audio content. This can also be seen in the Engineering Menu. When the unified station is selected, among all the alternates, the station with the best quality is chosen by AuRa. For the North American region, AuRa supports an FM-HD blend. HD radio uses the same frequency side bands for the digital transmission of the same analog content. As HD’s digital signal drops, the HD indicator turns orange in the Evaluation UI, which denotes Digital to Analog blend. When the digital part is regained, the HD indicator turns green, indicating analog to digital blend.","output":"Chapter 1: Introduction 1.

He had heard about a hidden swamp pond that was rumored to be teeming with delicious catfish. Determined to prove his fishing skills, Steve set out with his fishing gear and a playful grin on his face. As he arrived at the swamp pond, Steve noticed that it was completely deserted. He figured it was the perfect opportunity to strip away his clothes and feel one with nature. Chuckling mischievously, he thought to himself, \\"Who needs a fishing rod when you have the power of your own flatulence?\\" Under the eerie moonlight, Steve cautiously waded into the waist-deep water, the coolness enveloping his body. He felt a sense of freedom as he released a fart he had been holding in all day. Little did he know that his fart held an unusual potency. The bubbles roared from the depths of the water, and an ungodly stench permeated the air. Steve's eyes widened in amazement as he realized that the foul odor was overpowering enough to kill the fish nearby. Grinning from ear to ear, Steve proudly reached down into the murky water and retrieved the lifeless fish, amazed at his unconventional method of fishing. With excitement echoing in his voice, he exclaimed, \\"Well, look at that, fresh dinner straight from the depths! Who needs a fishing rod when you have nature's gas?\\" Carefully clutching the dead fish, Steve stepped out of the pond, his bare feet squishing in the muddy ground. With a devilish chuckle, he donned his clothes hastily, eager to share his unusual success with his friends back in Hawkins.

Still, it comes with its own challenges. Before selecting a vendor who will have a hands-on role in your project, it is essential to carefully consider possible pitfalls that outsourcing partnership model implies. In this article, Ilya Boroda, Head of Pre-sales at Timspark is sharing his vision on the four key challenges commonly encountered when choosing a custom software development partner. Challenge 1 Outsourcing vs in-house development: Choose your path Outsourcing can be obviously advantageous due to access to a larger talent pool and cost efficiency. Deloitte’s 2018 Global Outsourcing Survey reveals that 59 percent of companies opt for outsourcing as a means to decrease expenses. Although these are valid reasons to outsource, companies who solely focus on this factor, overlook other crucial aspects that could shape their decision. While keeping certain functions in house may not save you any money, it gives you more control over the quality of work that's produced and the ability to better define and preserve your company culture. Solution Not to be caught in a double bind between in house and outsourcing, one should try not to overlook new outsourcing models. Thus, the last 5-7 years show an evident shift in outsourcing from cost reduction optimization towards created value. Through collaboration with third-party providers, organizations can acquire the necessary technology and process guidance, as well as tap into their profound industry knowledge. As a vendor at Timspark we do not limit our role to executors acting by prescribed instructions from the client — on the contrary, we bring expertise — the idea of how the business problem can be solved, even if the customer is not aware of the solution yet. With clear understanding of business needs, we are able to provide a broader solution scope. At the end of the day, we measure our success with the impact on the business, not with the number of the projects won over other vendors. Resources saving, maximizing value, improving business performance all boil down to client satisfaction as the ultimate goal. Challenge 2 Development team expertise: Do the check The team for your project should ideally have prior experience working on similar projects. However, the challenge arises when a customer chooses a vendor for software development based solely on the company’s portfolio without considering the experience and expertise of the specific team that will be assigned to the project. The future success of the project greatly depends on the skills and capabilities of the team working on it. Unfortunately, in most cases, companies showcase their overall portfolio rather than providing insight into the individual team members’ portfolios. As a result, once the contract is signed and the project begins, it becomes irrelevant to vet the team’s experience, as the customer has limited visibility into their past projects. In order to address this challenge, one might thoroughly scrutinize the vendor’s portfolio, looking beyond the number of projects and instead focusing on the complexity and variety of cases handled. This can provide some insight into the vendor’s overall expertise and capabilities. However, it still does not guarantee that the specific team assigned to the project possesses the necessary skills and experience. Ultimately, the challenge lies in ensuring that the chosen vendor not only has an impressive company portfolio but also assigns a team with relevant experience in projects similar to the customer’s requirements. Solution Open communication with the vendor throughout the selection process can help mitigate this challenge and increase the chances of a successful software development partnership. At Timspark, we go a step further. Rather than a traditional outsourcing company, Timspark works as a hub. We foster Core Teams of 2-5 seasoned specialists and use an assortment of business and management practices, elaborated methodology and frameworks to each minimal viable team. Thus we ensure that the teams are: - compliant with the quality requirements and can provide the expertise needed - transparent for the customer in terms of processes, workflow, certifications available. During the selection process, we showcase the team’s portfolio with a full description of both our framework and the team’s expertise which has already undergone a thorough vetting process. LATER: LINK TO OUR TEAMS’ PAGE Challenge 3 Feedback from the software development partner: Get it early As a customer searching for a software development partner, you aim to choose a partner who aligns with your project requirements and can deliver high-quality results in reasonable time and with feasible costs. Fast feedback from the vendor at an early stage on their expertise, capabilities, possible solution and overall future performance is crucial. By considering vendor’s feedback, customers can mitigate risks, gain confidence in their selection, and establish a solid foundation for a successful software development partnership. Yet the outsourcing model does not imply that the development team should be aligned with the business goals and problems, even at the development stage. Solution How can this challenge be mitigated? It adds up to having the development team aligned with the customer’s business goals early on. This approach ensures that the end product not only meets technical requirements but also provides value to the customer’s business. The vendor can contribute their expertise and industry knowledge to enhance the software’s functionality and effectiveness while addressing the customer’s challenges and objectives at the same time. According to Timspark’s business model, we engage specialists from Core Teams with technical expertise in the domain already at pre-sales stage. They are working closely with the client, defining their needs and plans. As teams obtain this vision from an early stage, they have the possibility — and motivation — to delve into the problem and keep the business needs in focus while proposing a technological solution based on the team’s background. Ultimately the team is able to comply with their own commitments. For business getting fast feedback means being able to handle possible pitfalls, get a clear estimate of the scope of work, time and costs. Step 4 / Challenge 4 Knowledge transfer from customer to vendor: make it transparent In a traditional team augmentation model, there is often a bad knowledge transfer between the delivery team and potential clients, as well as between the presales team and the delivery team. While executives (the team) do not have vision of the system and goals are not transparent for them at all stages, this can backfire. Costly proposals, reduced motivation among technical experts, and ultimately, lower performance and quality of the end product along with delayed time to market are the possible negative results. Solution It might not seem to be a direct correlation, yet effective consultations are equal to cost and time savings for the client. We involve specialists from Core Teams that will be responsible for the project already at the pre-sales stage. Thus we provide clear knowledge transfer about the client’s needs, before the project starts, and avoid the long communication pipeline and back and forths from client to vendor. Besides the usual procedures, the pre-sales team is responsible for transferring the proper guidelines and vision to the delivery (Core Team), thus bridging the gap. As a result, all the Core Team members are fully aware of the agreements and committed.","output":"In conclusion, choosing a custom software development partner for outsourcing comes with its own challenges.

Curiosity getting the better of him, he decided to play it on the TV during his lunch break. As the tape's static-filled images flickered to life, the familiar underwater world of SpongeBob SquarePants appeared on the screen. Innocent and carefree, SpongeBob frolicked around Bikini Bottom, playing pranks and spreading joy in his usual endearing manner. But this episode had a sinister undertone—an unsettling presence lingered in the background. Suddenly, the tape began to distort, and the colors drained out, leaving only a monochromatic nightmare. SpongeBob's cheerful demeanor turned into one of desperate fear. The once-lovable sponge broke the fourth wall, revealing his self-awareness of being trapped within this cursed tape. With tear-filled eyes, SpongeBob pleaded for help, his voice distorted and filled with torment. He begged the viewer to free him from this eternal torment, as he was unable to escape no matter how hard he tried. The plea tugged at the employee's heart, leaving him unnerved by this unexpected turn of events. Despite the employee's best efforts to rewind or eject the tape, nothing could break the cycle of SpongeBob's entrapment. Friends and Bikini Bottom residents that the sponge sought assistance from appeared as mere puppets, responding to his pleas with canned laughter and empty expressions. The tape seemed to have a sinister control over the world it contained. As the days turned into weeks, SpongeBob's appearance began to deteriorate. His once-vibrant colors faded, replaced by a sickly gray pallor. Deep scratches now covered his body like grotesque wounds, and tears streamed perpetually from his eyes. Yet, he somehow maintained his desperate plea for release. The employee, consumed by guilt for his accidental discovery, turned to experts and sought any means to free SpongeBob from his nightmarish prison. However, all efforts were in vain. Despite their vast knowledge, none possessed the ability to free SpongeBob from the confines of the tape. In the end, the employee could only watch in horror as SpongeBob's form shriveled, his pleas becoming more desperate and distorted. Eventually, the tape ended—leaving an eerie silence that lingered in both the room and the employee's mind. Haunted by this seemingly harmless cartoon character turned tortured soul, the employee vowed to never let this cursed tape resurface. He locked it away deep within the storage room, hoping that SpongeBob would find some semblance of peace in its confinement. Legend has it that to this day, if you venture into the storage room of the Krusty Krab, you may faintly hear SpongeBob's muffled cries for freedom, forever trapped in the darkest depths of his own animated existence."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
