Endocrinologists are medical professionals who monitor patients during pregnancy, so it would make sense for them to see patients periodically. Step 2: Evaluate each option: a) six: This option suggests endocrinologists see patients every six months. Considering pregnancy lasts for about nine months, this would mean they see them only once or twice, which may not be enough. b) two: This option suggests endocrinologists see patients every two months. This would result in more frequent check-ups and seems more plausible. c) zero: This option does not make sense, as it implies they never see the patients. d) three: This option suggests endocrinologists see patients every three months. This would mean they see them about three times during pregnancy, which is also plausible. Step 3: Compare the plausible options (b and d). Seeing the patients every two months (b) allows for better monitoring and care during pregnancy. So, option b is the most appropriate choice.

Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.  M: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?  W: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.  M: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?  W: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.  M: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?  W: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.  What was said before this conversation? Answer:","output":"Before this conversation, there was a question about human memory. The speaker (W) explained that human memory is similar to a computer's hard disc drive, but people can train their memories to expand and work better. This led to a discussion about memory being affected by diseases like Alzheimer's and how brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Mental activity and education were mentioned as factors that can lower the risk of developing the disease.

Answer:","output":"Sir Francis Bacon, an eminent Elizabethan politician, philosopher, and essayist, was the individual fined £40,000 for taking bribes. Born on January 22, 1561, in London, England, Bacon played a pivotal role in the intellectual fervor that characterized the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras in England. Sir Francis Bacon served the court of Elizabeth I for many years, initially as a lawyer before eventually becoming the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. Throughout his political career, he held various esteemed positions, including Member of Parliament, Attorney General, and Lord Chancellor. As a true Renaissance man, Bacon was also heavily involved in the realm of philosophy, pioneering the scientific method and authoring an array of essays. However, Bacon's ascent to the highest levels of power was not without controversy. As Lord Chancellor, he found himself at the center of a bribery scandal. In 1621, Bacon was accused of accepting bribes in exchange for delivering favorable judgments in his capacity as Lord Chancellor. This was a severe violation of the judicial code of ethics and undermined the integrity of the legal system. A parliamentary committee was established to investigate the charges. Extensive evidence was presented to validate the accusations, leading to Bacon's admission of wrongdoing in the House of Lords. In a dramatic turnaround for someone who had previously enjoyed a distinguished career, he was fined £40,000, stripped of his position as Lord Chancellor, and banned from holding public office for life. Furthermore, Bacon was briefly imprisoned in the Tower of London but was subsequently released due to his failing health and the influence of his friends and supporters. Despite his ignominious fall from grace, Bacon's reputation as a profound and innovative thinker continued to endure. Today, he is hailed as one of the key figures in the transition from the medieval world to the scientific revolution and modernity. His works, divided into three primary categories - natural philosophy (Novum Organum), moral teachings (essays, such as \\"Of Truth,\\" \\"Of Studies,\\" and \\"Of Friendship\\"), and civil knowledge (De Sapientia Veterum) - greatly contributed to the intellectual landscape of his time and beyond. In summary, Sir Francis Bacon, an influential Elizabethan politician, philosopher, and essayist, was fined £40,000 for accepting bribes during his tenure as Lord Chancellor. Although his political career ended in scandal, his profound impact on the fields of philosophy and science has ensured his enduring legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Stealth Context: U.S. Navy pilots Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), Henry Purcell (Jamie Foxx), and Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) are the best of the best. Captain George Cummings (Sam Shepard) chose them out of 400 pilots to fly the next generation of stealth fighter jets called Talons. After their flight training in the Talons, they have become a cohesive unit and a highly efficient fighting team. Captain Cummings adds a new \\"wingman\\" to the team, an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) that is being flown by \\"EDI\\", a computer with an artificial intelligence brain mounted in a ball inside the cockpit. On their first mission, EDI begins to learn the skills and attitudes of the other pilots, and quickly understands that he can fly the plane better and faster than men. EDI has the capability to process data faster, and under extreme speeds will not blackout. Returning to the aircraft carrier, EDI is struck by lightning, which begins to change the computer's circuits. On the next flight, EDI refuses to scrub a mission despite the potential for massive civilian casualties. Upon return to base, Ben implores Captain Cummings to remove EDI from duty for further testing; Cummings ignores Ben's objections, and EDI's computer tech (who was beginning to suspect EDI was going rogue) is mysteriously replaced by much more docile techs. EDI begins to think for itself, and assigns itself a mission to take out a radical element in China. EDI cuts his link with the flight controller on the carrier, and he will not take a direct order from Ben. Henry locates and chases EDI, and gives it an ultimatum: return to base, or he will take it out. EDI declines to return to base. Henry fires his missiles, misses EDI, and is himself killed by the explosions. If you thought it was unbelievable up 'til now, it gets worse.

Given the context: Why did Aubrey do this? Answer:","output":"Aubrey's journey of baking too many cookies while experimenting with various recipes can be attributed to several factors that revolve around her personal interests, exposure to new recipes, development of baking skills, and potential emotional triggers. We can break down and analyze these reasons to understand her actions better, which eventually resulted in her having to consume cookies every night for a while. 1. Personal interests and hobbies: Aubrey might be passionate about baking and trying out different recipes. For some people, the kitchen serves as a creative and therapeutic space where they can unwind, relax, and express themselves through the art of baking. As a home cook, Aubrey could be indulging in her curiosity for exploring different ingredients, flavor combinations, and developing a wide array of baking techniques. This enthusiasm for baking drove her to make an excess of cookies. 2. Skill enhancement and practice: It is often said that \\"practice makes perfect.\\" Aubrey might have been working on improving her baking skills by making a variety of cookies, and as such, continued baking to ensure she gained valuable hands-on experience. It's possible that she utilized different recipes as a way to broaden her knowledge, refine her skills, and become adept in the art of cookie-making. This quest for perfection and the need to experiment and fine-tune her skills could have led her to bake more cookies than necessary. 3. Exposure to new recipes: In today's digital age, a plethora of recipes is available at our fingertips. Aubrey could have stumbled upon a goldmine of cookie recipes through social media, food blogs, cooking shows, or cookbooks. The exposure to these new recipes may have piqued her curiosity and excitement, propelling her to try each one to compare and contrast the final products. The desire to taste and analyze these different recipes might have led Aubrey to bake more cookies than she could consume in a reasonable time frame. 4. Emotional triggers and stress relief: Baking is often considered a stress-relieving activity that many people turn to when dealing with challenges or seeking a mental break from daily life. Aubrey may have been experiencing emotional triggers or stressors that led her to seek solace and comfort in the kitchen. In such situations, baking an excessive amount of cookies might have served as a coping mechanism, providing her with a sense of accomplishment and control while also allowing her to channel her energy into a creative and constructive outlet. 5. Socializing and sharing: Aubrey might have initially baked the cookies with the intention of sharing them with friends, family, or colleagues. Sharing homemade baked goods is a way for people to connect and build relationships with others. However, plans might have changed, or perhaps she didn't find the opportunity to share the cookies as initially expected, which left her with an overwhelming amount of cookies to consume on her own. In conclusion, a combination of personal interests, skill development, exposure to new recipes, emotional triggers, and socializing intentions could have motivated Aubrey to bake an excessive amount of cookies, resulting in her need to consume them every night for a while."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

Options:  -yes.  -it is not possible to tell.  -no.","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"A person is outside.\\" Let's examine this logically: The statement mentions \\"A person is riding a unicycle on the street with many other people around.\\"  Here are the key points of this statement to consider: 1. The person is riding a unicycle: This action usually requires a considerable amount of space to be performed, and it is typically an outdoor activity as it entails movement from one place to another, similar to riding a bike or a scooter.  2. The person is on the street: This information specifically points to an outdoor location. The term \\"street\\" generally refers to a public road in a town or city, which is basically an open, outdoor space. 3. There are many other people around: This point suggests a public place which is usually outside, like a park, a square, a fair, a street, etc. While there can be many people in an indoor space too, coupled with the other information this suggests an outdoor location. All these points hint at the person being somewhere outside. While it is theoretically possible to create a scenario where a person rides a unicycle on an indoor 'street' with many people around, in common understanding, the context provided almost certainly refers to an outdoor location. Therefore, yes, it logically follows from the statement that the person is outside.  Although there could be exceptions, such as a large indoor imitation city or exhibition space, in most contexts when interpreting phrases such as the one provided, the logical assumption would be that \\"on the street\\" implies being outdoors.  Therefore, in everyday context, the answer would be yes - if \\"A person is riding a unicycle on the street with many other people around,\\" it does logically follow that \\"A person is outside.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Body shaming is not okay ... and not something to joke about.\\" ||||| Los Angeles police have located the woman whom Playboy model Dani Mathers photographed naked in a gym locker room this summer, the city attorney’s office confirmed.      “We did receive the case from the LAPD. It’s currently under review from our office. We will be making a final decision soon, but there’s no timetable at this point,” Office of Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer told ABC News today. ABC News has reached out to the Los Angeles Police Department for comment, but it did not immediately respond.      Mathers, 29, took the photo of a nude woman at an LA Fitness in Los Angeles and posted it to Snapchat in July with the caption, “If I can’t unsee this then you can’t either.” The 2015 Playboy playmate of the year has faced widespread criticism for sharing the picture and body-shaming the woman.      The woman has not been publicly identified, and it is not clear if she knew she was being photographed by Mathers at the time.      Mathers later apologized for posting the picture and said it was inadvertent.      “I just wanted to acknowledge a photo I accidentally posted here on Snapchat earlier today and let you know guys know that was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do,” she said in a video posted to Snapchat. “I know that body-shaming is wrong. That is not the type of person I am.”      Mathers also apologized on Twitter.      “I’m sorry for what I did,” she wrote in a tweet on July 14. “I need to take some time to myself now to reflect on why I did this horrible thing. Goodnight.”      Mathers deleted the controversial image from Snapchat and has since set some of her social media accounts to private.      The LAPD opened an investigation into the incident after receiving a report of “illegal distribution,” Capt. Andrew Neiman told The Los Angeles Times on July 17.      LA Fitness reported the Snapchat post to police, and authorities have been investigating the incident, which took place at the health club chain’s branch in the Playa Vista neighborhood. Mather’s membership has been revoked, Jill Greuling, LA Fitness’ executive vice president of operations, told ABC News in an email.      The company posted a statement on Twitter when the incident made headlines this summer, calling Mathers’ behavior “appalling.”      Her behavior is appalling & puts members @ risk. We ended membership & she can't use any club.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. Warnings have been issued about a 'catastrophic' security flaw affecting one of the most important interfaces powering the web. Known as the 'Bash' bug, the flaw could be 'bigger than Heartbleed' which put every computer user at risk earlier this year. Experts claim the bug may pose a serious threat to computers using Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Apple's Mac OS X - and in turn, could spread to all internet-connected devices. Errata security researcher Robert Graham tweeted (pictured) an example of how the bug can be exploited, and how code can be added, to websites on Macs running OSX. He warned that Bash is 'probably a bigger deal than Heartbleed' because it could threaten the security of millions of websites Unlike","output":"Heartbleed, which was a vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic library, the Bash bug directly affects the Unix-based operating systems, making it potentially more widespread. Security experts from around the world are urging users to take immediate action to mitigate the risks by updating their systems as soon as patches become available. To address the growing concern, major tech companies, such as Apple, have started working on security updates to protect the devices running on their operating systems. Open-source software projects, like Linux, are also expected to release patches soon. Meanwhile, governments and cybersecurity agencies, including the US National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), have issued alerts about the dangers of the Bash bug. They are urging users and organizations to monitor their systems for any suspicious activity and to report anything out of the ordinary. As the severity of the bug becomes apparent, the tech industry is bracing itself for potential repercussions that could lead to massive data breaches and targeted cyberattacks. Some experts speculate that the full extent of the damage may not be known for quite some time, as vulnerable devices could keep getting compromised until all affected systems have been secured. In order to prevent further damage and ensure users' security, it is crucial for both individuals and organizations to remain vigilant about the potential threats associated with the Bash bug. It is essential to regularly update all software, closely monitor the news for any developments related to the flaw, and employ strong security measures to keep sensitive information safe. In conclusion, the discovery of the Bash bug raises questions about the security of widely-used software and the need to constantly update and protect the systems that power our digital world. As experts scramble to mitigate the effects of this potentially devastating vulnerability, it is a sobering reminder that the stability and safety of our interconnected world can often hinge on a single vulnerability."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of vowels (letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') / consonants (all letters other than vowels) in the given sentence.

Background: The Outfield were an English rock band based in London, England. The band achieved success in the mid-1980s and are best remembered for their hit single, \\"Your Love\\". The band's lineup consisted of guitarist John Spinks, vocalist and bassist Tony Lewis, and drummer Alan Jackman. They had an unusual experience for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the US, but never in their homeland. Context: Bassist/singer Tony Lewis, guitarist/keyboardist and songwriter John Spinks and drummer Alan Jackman played together in the late 1970s in a straightforward power pop band called Sirius B. After rehearsing for about six months and playing several gigs, their style did not match the punk rock that was surging in popularity in England and they broke up. Several years afterward, the three gathered back together in London's East End under the name The Baseball Boys. They performed in and around England until a demo got them signed to Columbia/CBS Records in 1984.  Spinks adopted the name 'Baseball Boys' from a teen gang called \\"The Baseball Furies\\" in the cult film The Warriors, a movie that he had just seen. Although he used the name as a joke and \\"just to be outrageous\\", record company people responded favourably. The band got a reputation as a very \\"American-sounding\\" group and signed in the US after playing for just a few months in England. Their manager, an American living in England, recommended a new band name with a similar attitude since 'Baseball Boys' seemed too \\"tacky\\" and \\"tongue-in-cheek\\". Spinks has said, \\"the Outfield was the most left-wing kind of thing we liked.\\"  Spinks expressed an interest for the American sport of baseball, while also being a devoted fan of association football. He claimed that the group \\"didn't know what an outfield was\\" until they came to the US, and that \\"We're just learning about baseball. It's an acquired taste and we're trying to acquire a taste for it.\\" He expounded upon this in a Chicago Tribune piece:  The thing about American sports - baseball and football - is that they're far more show business, far more a spectacle, than British sports. In England, it's just sort of everyday soccer matches. You get 30,000 people in the freezing cold in the middle of winter watching guys chase around in mud. In America, you have the sunny days, and the baseball diamond is really nicely laid out. In England, you'd see these guys covered in mud within 10 minutes. It's not such a nice spectacle to watch.  Their debut album, Play Deep, produced by William Wittman, was issued in 1985, and was a success. The album would go on to reach triple platinum sales status and the Top 10 in the US album charts; it also featured a Top 10 single entry with \\"Your Love\\", which peaked at No. 6. It went on to be featured in a number of 80s-themed compilation albums, and over 1,000 covers and remixes by other artists have been released physically and/or online. The band toured extensively, opening for Journey and Starship. Spinks made a point of mentioning in interviews that the band was \\"totally into not smoking or doing drugs\\". Question: Did he play with anyone else? Answer:","output":"Yes, Tony Lewis, John Spinks, and Alan Jackman played together in the late 1970s in a power pop band called Sirius B before forming The Outfield. After Sirius B didn't work out, they later regrouped and performed under the name The Baseball Boys before finally becoming The Outfield. They played with other bands too, like opening for Journey and Starship during their tours."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Around Christmas last year, we were heading to Grandma's house. The drive was an hour long, so we had plenty of time to chat. We were waiting to get onto the freeway when my daughter Hayley noticed a homeless man, no sign in hand. \\"Mom, is that man homeless?\\" I told her I believed he was. We got onto the freeway and drove away. But the chatting had stopped. Hayley was quiet all the way there. We spent a few hours at Grandma's then packed up to head home. As we drove back, Hayley rustled  around in her seat, trying to reach something on the floor of the car. I asked her to sit still, worried her seatbelt would slip from the booster seat. She mumbled something and sat back. \\"Mom, will the homeless man still be outside tonight?\\" I told her I was not sure, maybe. It was a freezing night, and I started to think of the man now too, and how cold he must be. All of a sudden, as we got onto the freeway exit, Haley shrieked  : \\"There he is! There he is!\\" and started rolling down her window. \\"Mom, I found these gloves and scarf back here. Can I give them to him? Can I?\\" she asked. I pulled over to the edge of the road, and beckoned  the man to come over. Haley smiled at him and handed him her gift. I looked in the front passenger seat, loaded with leftovers from Grandma's house, and handed those out to him as well. The man thanked us, he clutched   my hand in his and I could feel the bitter cold of them.

Walking's for suckers: Caribbean Segway tours In the classic movie, Island of Doctor Moreau, the human/beast mutants chanted, “Two legs good, four legs bad.” In the Caribbean, travelers taking a Segway tour might find themselves chanting a variation: “Two wheels good, four wheels bad.” A Segway is a two-wheeled, battery-operated vehicle with the sole occupant/driver in a standing position, steering with a set of handlebars. The vehicle is self-balancing and is very responsive to any change in a rider’s position. Beginners can be reassured that Segway tour operators always include an orientation before setting out. As odd as a Segway might appear the first time it’s seen in motion, by most accounts it’s a captivating way to roll through a Caribbean destination. The fact that a Segway is eco-friendly and leaves no carbon footprint is an additional check in the plus column. Most tour operators have requirements as to who can join the Segway tours, such as age and weight limits. A general rule of thumb is pregnant women and children under the age of 10 can’t participate, and weight must fall between 80-290 pounds. It’s smart to check ahead, since these requirements can vary slightly among tour operators. One other bit of advice: when riding a Segway, wear closed shoes instead of flip flops or sandals. The city of San Juan in Puerto Rico is a good match for a Segway, having a variety of surfaces, from steep, cobblestone streets to the rolling hills surrounding the 16th century San Felipe del Morro Fort. Segway Tours PR, Inc. offers several options for tours, with one of the most popular being their Fortifications Segway Guided Tour. The two-hour tour includes a spin through Old San Juan, with stops for photo ops at many historic sites, including The Fortaleza, the oldest governor’s house in the hemisphere still in use; and the outside wall of Ponce de Leon’s original mansion. The piece de resistance is a roll across the expansive grounds of San Felipe del Morro Fort. The tour is offered three times a day, and reservations are required. Caribbean Segway Tours offers outings that zip around Nassau Harbor. The 90-minute tour begins at the company’s base of operations, just behind Nassau’s Cricket Club.

After the tour is concluded, there’s the option to have the company’s van drop riders back at Junkanoo Beach, which is famous for its fried fish restaurants. Riders should pack a swimsuit if they want to take a dip (there are changing rooms at the beach). The company also provides complimentary round-trip van service which picks up cruise passengers at the Port of Nassau. Caribbean Segway Tours also operates on St. Maarten, where it offers a Segway beachfront, boardwalk tour. The experience kicks off at the waterfront Holland House Beach Hotel, the company’s base in Philipsburg. Once on the roll, the group passes beachfront stores, cafes, bars and restaurants. At the eastern end of the boardwalk there’s a stop to take photos and score a cool drink. After visiting a local crafts market, the 90-minute tour concludes with a ride along a white sand beach. At tour’s end, participants will be in perfect position for a dip in the sea, or to walk across the street to explore Philipsburg's famous duty-free shopping scene. Segway Antigua offers tours that zip along through the island’s beach parks, and past historic sites, such as colonial-era sugar mills and forts. The company’s Antigua Historic West Coast and beach tour is two hours long, with the option to add up to three hours of beach time. Tour highlights include Fort James Picnic Park, Marina Bay, Saint John’s Harbour, Old Runway Bay, and McKinnons Salt Pond and Natural Habitat Observatory. Segway Antigua also offers group discounts, with a minimum booking of eight participants. Since Saint Lucia is famous as one of the most romantic destinations in the Caribbean, it’s only fitting that LucianStyle Development Corporation offers a sunset Segway tour with dinner on the beach. Participants first orient themselves on the company’s practice track, before setting off on a two-mile well-groomed Segway track. They'll roll past Rodney Bay, glimpse scenic views of Pigeon Island, while having ample stops to learn about the flora and fauna of Saint Lucia. The tour concludes on Reduit Beach with a toes-in-the-sand dinner timed to coincide with the setting of the sun.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do I increase mileage? How can I increase the mileage of my vehicle? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information, which is how to improve the fuel efficiency or fuel economy of a vehicle, commonly referred to as mileage. There are several ways to increase mileage, ranging from vehicle maintenance to adopting better driving habits. Here's a detailed and long answer on how to improve your car's fuel efficiency: 1. Regular maintenance: Keep your vehicle well-maintained with regular oil changes, filter replacements, and tire checks. A properly maintained vehicle runs more efficiently, resulting in better gas mileage. Check your owner's manual for suggested maintenance intervals and follow them accordingly. 2. Tire pressure: Check your tire pressure at least once a month and ensure they are inflated according to the manufacturer's recommended levels. Under-inflated tires create more rolling resistance, which reduces mileage. Over-inflated tires can also negatively impact fuel efficiency and cause uneven wear on tires. 3. Remove excess weight: Remove any unnecessary items from your car, especially heavier ones. A heavier vehicle requires more energy to move, which leads to higher fuel consumption. Removing unneeded items from your car can lighten the load, and subsequently, improve your mileage. 4. Aerodynamics: When roof racks, bike racks, or other accessories are not in use, remove them from your vehicle. These items can cause increased wind resistance, leading to higher fuel consumption. Close windows and sunroofs at higher speeds to further reduce aerodynamic drag. 5. Acceleration and deceleration: Gradual acceleration and gentle braking will help improve fuel efficiency. Avoid sudden starts and quick stops, as they can significantly increase fuel consumption.  6. Speed: Driving at high speeds results in higher aerodynamic drag, which can lower your fuel economy. It is generally more fuel-efficient to maintain a consistent speed, ideally below 60 mph (96.5 km/h) for most vehicles. 7. Use cruise control: Cruise control helps maintain a constant speed, which can improve fuel economy on long trips or drives with minimal traffic. 8. Limit idling: Idling for long periods is a waste of fuel. Turn off the engine when your vehicle will be stationary for extended periods, such as waiting in a parking lot or at a drive-thru. 9. Plan your route: Plan your trips to minimize distances and avoid heavy traffic conditions. Use GPS navigation to find the most efficient route possible, and consider combining multiple errands into one trip. 10. Use the right fuel: Follow your vehicle manufacturer's recommendations regarding the type of fuel and octane rating suitable for your car. Using a higher-octane fuel than required can be a waste of money and does not necessarily improve mileage. 11. Right gear: When driving a manual transmission car, shift gears at the appropriate engine RPM to maximize fuel efficiency. With automatic transmissions, ease onto the pedal smoothly, allowing the transmission to shift gears at optimum RPM. 12. Limit the use of in-car accessories: Minimize the use of power-hungry accessories such as air conditioning, heated seats, and electronic gadgets when they are not needed. These accessories may place additional strain on your engine, leading to higher fuel consumption. By following these tips, you can work towards improving your vehicle's fuel efficiency, thereby increasing its mileage. Keep in mind that individual results may vary depending on factors such as vehicle type, condition, driving style, and environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Face/Off Context: September 1991:In a flashback, FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is taking his six year old son Michael for a ride on the Griffith Park carousel in downtown Los Angeles. As they ride around, Archer runs his hand over Michael's face and smiles.Meanwhile, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) sets up a suppressed sniper rifle on the hill overlooking the carousel. He takes aim at Archer, waits until he gets a clean shot, and fires. The bullet hits Archer in the back, and he and his son fall off the horse, leaving a noticeable bloodstain on the horse's mane. Three balloons are seen drifting away into the sky.Moments later, Archer is shown lying on his stomach, in pain, the bullet having gone cleanly through his body as bystanders rush over to him. Though bleeding, he sees Michael lying a few feet away, dead, the bullet having struck him in the head. Tears stinging his eyes, Archer crawls over and holds his dead son's body while Castor looks up from the scope of his rifle, stunned to see that he has just killed a child. The carousel horse Archer was riding on spins round and round and quickly fades out.Six Years Later:Archer is the field agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office and has been relentlessly pursuing Castor ever since the assassination attempt. Castor is a career terrorist, responsible for countless terrorist bombings, aircraft hijackings, and political assassinations, among other crimes. Archer looks at a wall documenting a long list of commendations given to him for his years of dedicated hard work and service, then somberly holsters his pistol and approaches his coworkers. We see that Archer carries the burden of his son's death on his shoulders at all times from his walk. He is agitated that his closest agents, Tito Blondi (Robert Wisdom), Wanda (Margaret Cho), Buzz (James Denton), and Loomis (Matt Ross) have no information on Castor's latest whereabouts.Meanwhile, Castor poses as a minister to sneak into the Los Angeles Convention Center, where he assembles and arms a big bomb called...

To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties.  But I can use this background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull.

Here is a question about this article: After World War I the US Army started developing a dual-role (AA/ground) automatic 37 mm cannon, designed by John M. Browning. It was standardised in 1927 as the T9 AA cannon, but trials quickly revealed that it was worthless in the ground role. However, while the shell was a bit light (well under 2 lbs) it had a good effective ceiling and fired 125 rounds per minute; an AA carriage was developed and it entered service in 1939. The Browning 37mm proved prone to jamming, and was eventually replaced in AA units by the Bofors 40 mm. The Bofors had attracted attention from the US Navy, but none were acquired before 1939. Also, in 1931 the US Army worked on a mobile anti-aircraft machine mount on the back of a heavy truck having four .30 caliber water-cooled machine guns and an optical director. It proved unsuccessful and was abandoned. What is the answer to this question: How many rounds did this cannon fire per second?","output":"To find out how many rounds the cannon fired per second, we need to first look at the information given in the text. It states that the 37mm cannon designed by John M. Browning fired 125 rounds per minute. Step 1: Convert the number of rounds per minute to rounds per second. To do this, we need to divide the number of rounds per minute by 60 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). Step 2: Calculation. 125 rounds per minute ÷ 60 seconds = 2.083 rounds per second So, the 37mm cannon fired approximately 2.083 rounds per second."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Während dieser Zeit trugen muslimische Gelehrte erheblich zum Fortschritt verschiedener Disziplinen bei und hinterließen ein reiches Erbe des Wissens, das für die spätere Entwicklung der europäischen Renaissance von entscheidender Bedeutung war. Mit der Zeit jedoch wandten sich die Muslime von diesem offenen Geist der Forschung und dem Streben nach Wissen ab, der das Goldene Zeitalter auszeichnete. Einige im Islam wandten sich gegen das Studium der \\"säkularen\\" Wissenschaft und Mathematik und argumentierten, dass es im Widerspruch zu religiösen Überzeugungen und Prinzipien stünde.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. 15 ways things will get worse in 2015 The new year ought to bring with it new hope and optimism for the time to come. But it's hard to feel positive after a 2014 marked by so much conflict and tragedy. Scanning the globe, here are WorldViews' gloomy predictions for how things may get worse in 2015. Syria's civil war and Iraq's spiraling violence: Yes, the extremist militants of the Islamic State are on the backfoot, pinned down by a U.S.-led bombing campaign and increasingly undermined by their own incompetence. But the jihadist organization that rose so dramatically last year won't fade as quickly, and eradicating it will require not just a concerted military campaign, but a larger vision for how to address the crises in Iraq and Syria. That involves reckoning with the stubborn Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which has presided over a brutal civil war that has seen at least 200,000 Syrians die and millions flee their homes. And it also involves reckoning with Iraq's dangerous dysfunctions, where political discord led to renewed violence that spawned a refugee crisis bigger than what took place during the sectarian conflict that raged between 2006 and 2008. There are no easy solutions in either place, and countless innocents will continue to suffer as a result. In recent years, we've witnessed upheaval and dislocations on a scale that we haven't seen in the Middle East since perhaps the establishment of Israel in 1948. Expect more unraveling in 2015 -- but not, sadly, any clear sense of the new politics that may bring stability. Russia's economic crisis: Slumping oil prices hit Russia hard toward the end of 2014, cratering its currency and piling pressure on the country's demagogic President Vladimir Putin. Russian banks and companies owe some 600 billion to the outside world, and Moscow's spending a good chunk of its reserves bailing out leading financial institutions. A thaw with the West (and an easing of sanctions) would soften Putin's plight, but there's little sign of rapprochement right now. And pain on the domestic front may lead to more bellicose chest-thumping abroad. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process: Thwarted this week at the U.N. Security Council, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas is now pushing for recognition of Palestine's statehood status at the International Criminal Court, which could then lead theoretically to the prosecution of senior Israeli officials on alleged war crimes. That could kill off the faint hope for a revival of talks between Israel and Abbas's Palestinian Authority, although many would argue the prospect of a two-state solution was long dead. Meanwhile, Israel is preparing for fresh parliamentary elections that could end the reign of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But, judging from the the potential opposition coalition preparing to challenge him, not much may change vis a vis Israeli policy toward the Palestinians. The project of the European Union: In 2015, a host of major European countries will go to the polls, including Britain, Spain and crisis-hit Portugal. Beginning with a snap election in Greece this month, euro-skeptic and anti-austerity parties are expected to make considerable gains — and may dial back progress toward further European integration. Post-war Afghanistan: The United States announced the formal conclusion of its war effort in Afghanistan at the end of December. But Washington leaves behind a weak government in Kabul, still vulnerable to the Afghan Taliban, whose appetite for battle and destruction did not slacken despite 13 years of American occupation. Sri Lanka's election: The island nation's presidential election, scheduled for Jan. 8, was expected to be a formality for sitting President Mahinda Rajapaksa. But surprising defections from his camp in recent months means the race will be one of the closest Rajapaksa has ever fought. And given critics' fears of the president's authoritarian tendencies, don't discount the prospect of street violence, voting irregularities and darker dealings in the days ahead. The crises in Yemen and Libya: In the shadow of a coup in Egypt and the disastrous conflict in Syria and Iraq, democratic transitions in Yemen and Libya unraveled horribly in 2014. In Libya, battle lines have hardened between two parallel governments -- one backed by secular forces and elements of the old Gaddafi regime, the other by Islamist militias -- and led to astonishing scenes, such as the burning of key oil facilities (above). In Yemen, the Houthis, a political movement that is in part led by members of the Zaidi Shiite sect, have swept aside the central government and are now clashing with Sunni militias, including al-Qaeda fighters. The death toll and dysfunction will likely only rise in 2015, while what's left of the unified Yemeni and Libyan states continue to fall apart. Hawkish Iranian and American rhetoric: There is no question that both President Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani want to arrive at an agreement on Iran's controversial nuclear program before a July deadline for negotiations to succeed. But hawks and hardliners in both Tehran and Washington will do their best to scuttle the move toward rapprochement. A deal with Iran would be another diplomatic feather in Obama's cap after his dramatic opening with Cuba in December -- but it still looks only a distant possibility. Ebola in West Africa: Global health authorities struggled to combat the deadly epidemic in 2014, which swept through three ill-prepared and unequipped West African countries. Now, one American study estimates there may be as many as 1.4 million cases of infection by Jan. 20. Some experts suggest the outbreak won't be eradicated without a vaccine, something that could be available by mid-year, but still may not wholly effective. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during their Nov. 10 meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. (Kim Kyung-Hoon/Pool via AP) Tensions in Asia-Pacific: 2015 is the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, which is bound to stir up nationalist rhetoric in both China and Japan. Who can forget November's painfully awkward meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe? Tokyo and Beijing are still squabbling over an archipelago, administered by Japan but claimed by both governments. Observers also warn of new potential flare-ups in the South China Sea, where China's assertive stance -- it claims virtually the entire body of water as its maritime territory -- has led to naval standoffs and skirmishes with Vietnamese and Philippine vessels. The specter of U.S. naval involvement, particularly in concert with Manila's interests, also looms. Global inequality: Surveys toward the end of 2014 highlighted the overwhelming concern of the majority of the planet: the threat of joblessness and, parallel to that, deepening social inequities. While the big banks have recovered from the Great Recession, millions of ordinary people are still coping with reduced incomes and the toll of government austerity measures. The trends suggest that, in some places, income inequality will only get worse in 2015. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un applauds as he provides field guidance to female pilots in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency in Pyongyang. (KCNA/Reuters) North Korean craziness: We went through the Looking Glass with Pyongyang in 2014, with a decidedly terrible Hollywood movie turning into one of December's main geopolitical flash points. Kim Jong Un's regime is the world's most opaque and mysterious, and probably its most awful. The Council on Foreign Relations says a military provocation by North Korea, sparked perhaps by internal instability, may be one of the graver threats facing U.S. foreign policy makers in 2015. The plight of the Rohingya: Spare a thought for one of the world's most prominent \\"stateless\\" communities. The Rohingya of western Burma number more than a million and can trace their existence in the country back generations. Yet they are not recognized as citizens by the Burmese state, which considers them Bengali Muslim interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh. Those who have been displaced by sectarian violence and racist, Buddhist mobs live in \\"apartheid-like\\" conditions, according to reports. As Burma readies for potential elections in 2015, even its most prominent opposition figure, the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has so far refused to speak up on the Rohingya's behalf.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Two soccer players had a friendly match one on one after work.

Which entity is this text about? Charles Edward \\"Charlie\\" Haden (August 6, 1937 - July 11, 2014) was an American jazz double bass player, bandleader, composer and educator known for his deep, warm sound, and whose career spanned more than fifty years. In the late 1950s, Haden was an original member of the ground-breaking Ornette Coleman Quartet. Haden revolutionized the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz. About him, German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt commented, \\"His ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Coleman's free-form solos (rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies) was both radical and mesmerizing. Haden often said that he moved to Los Angeles in 1957 in search of pianist Hampton Hawes. He turned down a full scholarship at Oberlin College, which did not have an established jazz program at the time, to attend Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles. His first recordings were made that year with Paul Bley, with whom he worked until 1959. He also played with Art Pepper for four weeks in 1957, and from 1958 to 1959, with Hampton Hawes whom he met through his friendship with bassist Red Mitchell, For a time, he shared an apartment with the bassist Scott LaFaro.  In May 1959, he recorded his first album with the Ornette Coleman Quartet, the seminal The Shape of Jazz to Come. Haden's folk-influenced style complemented Coleman's microtonal, Texas blues elements. Later that year, the Quartet moved to New York City and secured an extended booking at the avant-garde Five Spot Cafe. This residency lasted six weeks and represented the beginnings of their unique, free and avant-garde jazz. Ornette's quartet played everything by ear, as Haden explained: \\"At first when we were playing and improvising, we kind of followed the pattern of the song, sometimes. Then, when we got to New York, Ornette wasn't playing on the song patterns, like the bridge and the interlude and stuff like that. He would just play. And that's when I started just following him and playing the chord changes that he was playing: on-the-spot new chord structures made up according to how he felt at any given moment.\\"  In 1960, addiction to narcotics caused him to leave Coleman's band. He went to self-help rehabilitation in September 1963 at Synanon houses in Santa Monica, California and San Francisco, California. It was during the time he was at Synanon House that he met his first wife, Ellen David. They moved to New York City's Upper West Side where their four children were born: their son, Josh, in 1968, and in 1971, their triplet daughters Petra, Rachel and Tanya. They separated in 1975 and, subsequently, divorced.","output":"This text is about Charlie Haden. He was an American jazz double bass player, bandleader, composer, and educator.

Write an article based on this \\"Ministers have said they will not oppose calls to scrap the so-called \\"tampon tax\\" when the issue comes to a vote in the House of Commons.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Breaking the Shackles of the Tampon Tax: A Step Towards Equality and Social Justice Introduction In a progressive move to uphold gender equality and social justice, ministers in the United Kingdom have declared they will not oppose calls to repeal the controversial \\"tampon tax.\\" The tax, which refers to the Value Added Tax (VAT) applied to feminine hygiene products, has long been criticized as discriminatory and unjust. As the issue heads to a vote in the House of Commons, the decision of the ministers to support the removal of this tax is likely to have a transformative impact on the lives of millions of women across the country. The Origin and Impact of the Tampon Tax The tampon tax has been a contentious subject for years, primarily because it is rooted in the classification of essential and non-essential items. While essential items are exempted from VAT, non-essential products are taxed at various rates. For a long time, sanitary products were labeled as non-essential, which pushed them into a higher tax bracket. Consequently, this subjected young girls and women to a financial burden that their male counterparts did not face. Critics argue that the tampon tax perpetuates structural inequalities and undermines essential human rights, including the right to access affordable menstrual healthcare products. Studies have shown that the inability to afford these items often leads to \\"period poverty,\\" which adversely impacts girls' education and women's participation in the workforce. This not only perpetuates social stigmas and taboos around menstruation but also has long-term ramifications on the nation's socio-economic fabric. Steps Towards Repealing the Tampon Tax Acknowledging the need to reassess outdated conceptions of essential and non-essential items, in recent years, several countries worldwide have eliminated, reduced, or revised their tax codes concerning menstrual products. Countries like Canada, Australia, and Ireland have successfully scrapped the tax, while others like the United States have seen the tax removed or reduced in various states. These developments have propelled the United Kingdom to follow suit and reconsider its tax policies on feminine hygiene products. Backed by the efforts of supportive lawmakers, non-governmental organizations, and women's rights activists, several campaigns have strived to bring the tampon tax issue to the forefront of political discussions in the UK. Public opinion has increasingly favored recognizing menstrual products as basic necessities and exempting them from VAT to make them more accessible and affordable. A Path Towards Equality and Social Justice As the House of Commons prepares to cast its vote on the tampon tax, the ministers' decision not to oppose its removal reflects the nation's commitment to challenging discriminatory norms and fostering a more inclusive society. A tax system that does not discriminate between genders is crucial to upholding the values of fairness and redistribution embedded within a welfare state. Moreover, by easing the financial burden on those in need of menstrual products, the UK government would take a significant stride in alleviating period poverty. Resources could be redirected to initiatives that promote education and awareness about menstruation, thereby eradicating the associated stigmas and taboos. Additionally, removing the tax would bolster women's participation in the labor market, leading to substantial economic benefits. Conclusion The decision of UK ministers not to oppose the calls for scrapping the tampon tax is a testimony to the persistent efforts of campaigners who have fought to ensure menstrual equity and justice. As this important issue heads to a vote in the House of Commons, it is time for the United Kingdom to join the ranks of countries that have marched towards gender equality and inclusivity by eliminating this discriminatory tax. Repealing the tampon tax signifies a crucial step in the pursuit of not only menstrual but also economic, social, and political justice for women and girls across the nation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Premise: Three construction workers are standing on a boat while one of the men points at something. Hypothesis: Three workers are standing on a boat .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Without knowing the specific context of the situation, it can be challenging to definitively conclude the hypothesis. However, based on the provided premise, we can make a reasoned assumption that supports the hypothesis.  The premise states that there are three construction workers standing on a boat. One of these workers is pointing at something, which further emphasizes the presence of three individuals on the boat. The connection between the construction workers and the boat is made through the description of their location. This information can be used to draw conclusions about the hypothesis, which is that three workers are standing on a boat. To evaluate this hypothesis, first, let's break down the hypothesis into its core components: 1. Construction workers 2. The boat 3. The workers are standing on the boat Based on the premise, we can identify all three components in the situation. We know that there are construction workers, a boat is being mentioned, and the workers are described as standing on the boat. Additionally, the fact that one of the workers is pointing at something provides further evidence of their position on the boat because they are interacting with their surroundings. To further support the hypothesis, we can examine the logical consistency of the given information. The presence of a boat and construction workers, along with the fact that they are standing on the boat, does not contradict any known facts. Although it might be unusual for construction workers to be standing on a boat, it is not an impossible scenario. So, based on the available information and logical analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the given hypothesis is accurate - that three workers are standing on a boat.

Detectives Mike Parnell (David Rasche) and Danny Scalise (Richard Young) are cops specializing in drug busts who also frame people and steal drugs that should be declared evidence so that they can use it for their own recreational drug use and selling to dealers.

Article: The latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not I.Q., a generally bad predictor of success. Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday.  This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field. She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings.  Then she would practise writing. Her practice would be slow, painstaking and error-focused. By practising in this way, she delays the automating process. Her mind wants to turn conscious, newly learned skills into unconscious, automatically performed skills. By practising slowly, by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating, she forces the brain to internalize a better pattern of performance. Then she would find an adviser who would provide a constant stream of feedback, viewing her performance form the outside, correcting the smallest errors, pushing her to take on tougher challenges. By now she is redoing problems--how do I get characters into a room--dozens and dozens of times. She is establishing habits of thought she can call upon in order to understand or solve future problems.  The primary quality our young writer...

From 1974 to 1976, Dierdorf started every game at right tackle for the Cardinals during a three-year span in which the team compiled records of 10-4, 11-3, and 10-4 under head coach Don Coryell. In 1977, Dierdorf sustained a broken jaw and missed two games to injury as the Cardinals fell to 7-7. In 1978, Dierdorf started all 16 games at right tackle for the Cardinals.  During his peak years from 1974 to 1978, Dierdorf was regarded as one of the best offensive lineman in the NFL. He was selected by the National Football League Players Association as the Offensive Lineman of the Year for three consecutive years from 1976 to 1978. The Cardinals' offensive line, led by Dierdorf, Conrad Dobler, and Tom Banks, led the NFL with the fewest sacks allowed for three years (and the National Football Conference for five years) in the mid-1970s. In 1975, the group set an NFL record, allowing only eight sacks in 14 games.  Dierdorf did not allow a sack during the entire 1976 and 1977 seasons. His streak ended in the first game of the 1978 season when Chicago Bears defensive end Tommy Hart tallied two sacks against Dierdorf. Dierdorf had not given up a sack since the 1975 NFC Divisional playoff game when Jack Youngblood sacked Jim Hart.  Dierdorf was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for five consecutive years from 1974 to 1978.

Someone who lived in a big house would have a servant light his way by holding a candle. The expression meant that the person who cannot hold a candle to you is not fit even to be your servant. \\"Hold out\\" is an expression one hears often in sports reports and labor news. It means refusing to play or work. Professional football and baseball players hold out if their team refuses to pay them what they think they are worth. Members of labor unions hold out and refuse to work until they get the work agreement they want. The expression \\"hold up\\" has several different meanings. One is a robbery. A man with a gun may say, \\"This is a hold up. Give me your money.\\" Another meaning is to delay. A driver late for work may tell his boss, \\"I was held up by heavy traffic.\\" Someone who was robbed on the way to work might say, \\"Sorry, boss, I was held up by a hold up.\\" Still another meaning of the expression is for a story to be considered true after an investigation. The same driver late for work could say, \\"My boss did not believe a hold up held me up. But the police confirmed what I said so my story held up.\\" \\"Hold on\\" is another expression. Often it means wait or stop. As you leave for school, your brother may say, \\"Hold on, you forgot your book.\\" Hold on is also used to ask a telephone caller to wait and not hang up his telephone.

The rally is held on very dusty, rough and rocky mountain roads around Athens during the Greek hot summer period. The rally is known for being extremely tough on the competing cars and drivers. The highlight of the rally was the Super Special Stage in the Athens Olympic Stadium (SSS). In 2005, it was announced the Rally of the Year.  - Mikko Hirvonen (born 31 July 1980, Kannonkoski) is a Finnish former rally driver, and a current Rally-Raid driver, who drove in the World Rally Championship. He placed third in the drivers' championship and helped Ford to the manufacturers' title in both 2006 and 2007. In 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 he finished runner-up to Sébastien Loeb. Hirvonen's co-driver has been Jarmo Lehtinen since the 2003 season.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - A co-driver is the navigator of a rally car in the sport of rallying, who sits in the front passenger seat. The co-driver's job is to navigate, by reading off a set of pacenotes to the driver, often over a radio headset, due to the high level of noise in the car. The co-driver tells the driver what lies ahead, where to turn, the severity of the turn, and what obstacles to look out for. This role is particularly critical in high-end rally competitions such as WRC. Co-drivers are also often called on to perform maintenance on the car during road sections and special stages, such as changing a wheel.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Jarmo Lehtinen ( born 3 January 1969 ) is a rally co-driver from Finland .

Lehtinen started co-driving in 1988 alongside friend Jari Mikkola . He later partnered Marko Ramanen in the Finnish Rally Championship , and he made his WRC debut in the 1997 Rally Finland . In 1999 Lehtinen partnered Ramanen in the British Rally Championship and accompanied Jouni Ampuja to sixth in Group N in the Finnish Championship . He worked with Ampuja in the Finnish Championship for another two seasons . In 2002 he took up a new role in the gravel crew for Skoda driver Toni Gardemeister on the world championship . He also began to work with Hirvonen on international events . The pair have worked together on all their WRC outings since 2003 , with Subaru in 2004 and with Ford since 2006 , becoming runners - up in 2008 . He won his first world rally at the 2006 Rally Australia . Lehtinen and Hirvonen competed for Citroën in 2012 . Lehtinen lives in Lahti with his wife Tanja .  - In rallying, pacenotes are a commonly used method of accurately describing a rallying route to be driven in extreme detail. As well as dictating the general route to be taken, in terms of turnings, junctions, etc., all notable features of the route which might affect the way it is driven at speed are included. These details include the distance between each feature, the degree and severity of bends, adverse camber, crests and hill jumpings, surface type and conditions, potholes, special instructions to the driver, etc.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Sébastien Loeb (born 26 February 1974) is a French professional rally, racing, and rallycross driver.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this and answer the question In this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a \\"table\\" of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing \\"sparse\\" databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty. The relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables (or relations), with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Complex Tissue Structure A hallmark trait of animals is specialized structures that are differentiated to perform unique functions. As multicellular organisms, most animals develop specialized cells that group together into tissues with specialized functions. A tissue is a collection of similar cells that had a common embryonic origin. There are four main types of animal tissues: nervous, muscle, connective, and epithelial. Nervous tissue contains neurons, or nerve cells, which transmit nerve impulses. Muscle tissue contracts to cause all types of body movement from locomotion of the organism to movements within the body itself. Animals also have specialized connective tissues that provide many functions, including transport and structural support. Examples of connective tissues include blood and bone. Connective tissue is comprised of cells separated by extracellular material made of organic and inorganic materials, such as the protein and mineral deposits of bone. Epithelial tissue covers the internal and external surfaces of organs inside the animal body and the external surface of the body of the organism.

Review: Title: Disappointing Experience with Ringdroid (2/5) I recently installed the Ringdroid app (com.ringdroid) hoping it would be a helpful tool for creating and editing ringtones. Although it has potential, I'm giving it a 2-star rating due to a number of frustrating issues. Some aspects of the app did work - for example, the user interface was relatively simple to navigate, and I appreciated the range of audio formats it supported. However, these positive aspects couldn't outweigh the negative experience I had using Ringdroid. The primary issue I faced was the app's slow performance and frequent crashing. While trying to edit audio files, the app would freeze and unexpectedly close, causing me to lose progress and start over. Repeatedly dealing with this made the app feel unreliable and frustrating to use. Furthermore, the quality of the audio output varied greatly, with some files sounding garbled or noisy after saving. To improve Ringdroid, I suggest the developers address the performance issues and stabilize the app to avoid crashing. Additionally, they could work on enhancing the audio processing quality so that the final ringtones sound more polished and clear. In conclusion, the Ringdroid app has some potential, but the recurring performance issues, crashing, and inconsistent audio quality led me to give it a 2-star rating. Until these are resolved, I'm unable to recommend it as a reliable ringtone maker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A lawyer representing the 16-year-old Texas boy who killed four people and critically injured two others while driving drunk lashed out Thursday at the news media for their focus on the use of \\"affluenza\\" to describe the boy's privileged upbringing. Of the two experts who testified in defense of Ethan Couch, only one used the word and he used it just once, attorney Reagan Wynn told CNN's \\"New Day.\\" \\"That term was not used by either of the lawyers that represented Mr. Couch, and it was not our defense, simply put.\\" He added, \\"I think it is ridiculous for anyone who knows anything about the criminal justice system or the juvenile justice system to think that we walked into court and said, 'Hey, judge, this is a rich, white kid,' and she went, 'Oh, OK, probation.' \\"  OPTIONS: - Affluenza's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. - CNN's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. - Couch's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. - Ethan Couch's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. - New Day's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. - Reagan Wynn's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. - Texas's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. - Wynn's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said.","output":"Reagan Wynn's attack on the media's focus on \\"affluenza\\" was rich, the prosecutor said. In response to Wynn's comments, the prosecutor emphasized that while it may be true that the term \\"affluenza\\" was only mentioned once during the trial, it nevertheless played a significant role in the case, as it captured the public's attention and became a central point of discussion. The prosecutor pointed out that while defense attorneys may not have explicitly used the term \\"affluenza\\" as the linchpin of their argument, they did present evidence and arguments that revolved around the concept. Specifically, they argued that Ethan Couch was raised in a privileged environment that failed to teach him the necessary level of responsibility for his actions, ultimately leading to the tragic accident. The term \\"affluenza\\" quickly became a lightning rod for public outrage, as many in the community and across the nation saw it as a prime example of wealth and privilege being used to excuse heinous actions. Critics argued that Couch's sentence — 10 years of probation with no jail time — demonstrated a double standard in the criminal justice system, where those with financial resources could effectively escape the consequences of their actions. In the media's coverage of the case, the emphasis on \\"affluenza\\" led many to question whether the outcome would have been different had the accused been from a less affluent background. The intense scrutiny on the term and its implications underscored a broader conversation about income inequality, privilege, and access to justice in the United States. While the defense may argue that the focus on \\"affluenza\\" was overblown or misplaced, the prosecutor maintained that the very presence of such a concept in the trial speaks to larger, systemic issues in the criminal justice system. By invoking the idea of a privileged upbringing as a factor that could mitigate responsibility, the defense's strategy inadvertently highlighted perceived disparities in the treatment of wealthy defendants as compared to their less fortunate counterparts. In the years since the trial, the debate around \\"affluenza\\" and its implications has persisted. Some legal experts have questioned whether the term and its underlying concepts have any real merit in the courtroom, while others see it as a symptom of deeper societal issues relating to wealth and privilege. Regardless of one's stance on the term, it is clear that the case of Ethan Couch and the controversy surrounding \\"affluenza\\" will continue to serve as a touchstone for discussions on fairness and equity in the criminal justice system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism","output":"The phrase \\"direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism\\" can be considered positive in the context of film criticism or audience appreciation. Let's break down the elements of the phrase and analyze them individually and as a whole. 1. \\"Direction to give the film a soul\\": This part of the phrase refers to the director's ability to infuse the film with a distinctive personality, essence, or spirit that makes it meaningful and engaging. A film with a soul resonates with audiences on a deeper level, fostering a strong emotional connection. As such, stating that a director gives the film a soul implies that their work has imbued a certain level of depth and substance, which is generally regarded as a positive quality. 2. \\"An unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism\\": Escapism, in the context of entertainment like movies, refers to their ability to provide audiences with a temporary reprieve from everyday life, allowing them to immerse themselves in a different world and forget about their problems. \\"Good old-fashioned escapism\\" implies a sense of nostalgia or a return to simpler times, as well as a recognition that the movie doesn't shy away from or attempt to downplay the goal of providing pure entertainment, which is often perceived as a virtue. \\"Unabashed\\" means that this quality is embraced without apology or reservation. When considering these elements together, the phrase as a whole suggests that the film successfully achieves a balance between providing a meaningful emotional experience and offering an entertaining, immersive escape from reality. By attributing these positive qualities to the direction of the film, it can be inferred that the director has skillfully navigated the challenging task of producing an engaging, well-rounded movie. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this phrase carries a positive connotation, praising the director's ability to endow the film with depth and substance while also providing a much-needed, enjoyable respite from the complexities and challenges of the real world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who gives Eep a shell horn? from the following article ?  A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time.

Repeat this up to 4 times a day, as needed. This will help the hair rise to the surface. You can also use a hot water bottle as a warm compress. Wet the area around the ingrown hair with warm water. Then, apply soap to your fingers and gently massage the hair for 10-15 seconds. Finally, rinse the area with warm water to wash away the soap. The gentle massage and heat from the water may draw the hair out. An exfoliator can remove the dead skin cells that cover the ingrown hair, which might help it surface. Rub your exfoliator over the area, then let it sit for 10 minutes. Next, wet the exfoliator with warm water and gently rub it into your skin as you rinse it off.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom?  Hint: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom.

Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury.

Is the following review positive or negative? Visit date 3/21/11:  So this is my fiance's favorite restaurant (ie: \\"the best meal I've ever had\\")  and we were there with our friends from France. One of whom is a chef. So I was hoping this would live up to his claims. We all were going to go for the prixe fix menu until we noticed that it may be cheaper to go a la carte. I was the only one who strayed and did three appetizers. I was going to get the scallops as a main but there was a special of scallops offered as an app and I was already afraid of having too much food. Looks like I was right because even ordering three starters overfilled me. Not a happy stuffed, but an uncomfortable stuffed. The little freebie desserts weren't even touched and went straight into a box for our table. We were all overfed and would've preferred smaller portions.   For the food: Overall very nice but my scallop appetizer was a miss. It was too sweet with the sweet potatoes and not a good flavor pairing. The parmesan souffle was to die for. I ordered the mixed baby greens but was brought a different salad that was delicious, so no hard feelings. It had shallots that were so good I made everyone at the table try a bite (must re-create at home!). Fiance got the veal porterhouse and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked. The desserts that others ordered were passed around but everyone could only manage a bite or two being so full from the previous two courses. I wasn't too impressed with the desserts. Nothing memorable.   The two dings against the restaurant... Our friends pointed out a couple of errors with the French that was written on menu/labels. I hope they get that fixed! The second was a lady's night where girls eat half off/ free. I thought our waitress was talking about something on the strip until I realized it was for this restaurant. Kinda left a bad taste in my mouth... why cheapen your fine establishment with... ladies night? Weird.   Would I return? Absolutely. I would just order two courses though.","output":"This review is a mix of both positive and negative feelings about the restaurant. The person writing the review liked some of the food and their fiance's favorite meal is there, which is positive. They also said they would return to the restaurant. However, they didn't like the portion sizes, one of their appetizers, and the idea of a 'Ladies Night' at the restaurant, which are negative points.

Some of the sounds he captured have a very high frequency and others are very low frequency. When he is done he begins to edit the sound with a computer program.  But I can use this background: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is  What is an answer for this question: Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds? Answer:","output":"The high-frequency sounds have a shorter wavelength than the low-frequency sounds. This can be understood by examining the relationship between wavelength and frequency, as described in the background information you provided. As mentioned, wavelength and frequency are inversely related. This means that when one of these properties increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. The equation that relates the two is: v = fλ In this equation, v represents the speed of the wave, f represents the frequency, and λ (lambda) represents the wavelength. For sound waves, the speed (v) is determined by the medium they travel through— in this case, air— and remains constant. Therefore, when the frequency (f) of the sound increases, the wavelength (λ) must decrease to maintain the same wave speed. Conversely, when the frequency decreases, the wavelength increases. In Bill's sound studio, he has captured sound effects with high frequency and low frequency. High-frequency sounds have more wave cycles passing a given point per unit of time compared to low-frequency sounds. Because frequency and wavelength are inversely related, as the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases. Therefore, the high-frequency sounds captured by Bill have shorter wavelengths than the low-frequency sounds. In conclusion, when comparing high-frequency and low-frequency sounds in a sound studio, one can determine that high-frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths, while low-frequency sounds have longer wavelengths. Understanding this relationship can help Bill during the editing process, as he can adjust the sounds accordingly and create the desired effects for his short film."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grubbs and Woods allegedly had plans to hook up even as he and Nordegren were due to give birth to their second child, Charlie.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What band did Zappa criticize because he felt they were only in it for the money?  Though it reached No. 130 on the Billboard chart, Freak Out! was neither a major commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: I guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of \\"artistry\\". If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tell me what in hell is going on ... The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled Freak Out, which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax. The album developed a major cult following in the United States by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972.  At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted in an attempt to keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out! Zappa criticized the Beatles, as he felt they were \\"only in it for the money\\".Freak Out! was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, ranked at number 243 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" in 2003, and featured in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Question: What is the last name of the person whose first opera was L'Orfeo?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... Answer:","output":"Monteverdi"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption.  suppose a person has a lung disease and the lungs are not functioning properly happens, how will it affect the lava keeps flowing and does not cool.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The scenario presents a question that links two unrelated systems: the geological process of volcanic eruptions and magma hardening, and the biological system of a human body experiencing a lung disease. Consequently, it's crucial to analyze the two processes separately before attempting to find a link between them. The volcanic process specifically underlies several steps: 1. Magma rises from deep within the earth. 2. This magma goes into volcanoes. 3. The pressure within the volcanoes pushes the magma upward. 4. This pressure forces the magma to push through the surface of the volcano, leading to an eruption. 5. The erupted magma, now called lava, begins to cool once it reaches the surface. 6. This cooling lava eventually solidifies and forms new rock. 7. New magma continues to be pressurized toward the surface of the volcano. 8. Over time, enough pressure might build to cause the volcano to burst through the previously formed rock, leading to a fresh eruption. On the other hand, the person in this scenario is suffering from lung disease. When lungs don't function properly, oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide expulsion are often hampered. Given these two contexts, the question proposes a relationship where the person's lung disease somehow affects the process of lava continuing to flow and not cooling. In the context of geological science, such a connection is not possible. The mechanism of a volcano's magma flow and the human lung function are separate and distinct processes that work independently of each other. The cooling and solidification of lava depend on external factors like temperature, air exposure, and the specific minerals present in the magma, not on human health or physiological functions. So, considering the question, the supposed perturbation - a person's lung disease - would be 'not impacting any step of the process.' There's no direct or indirect way a person's lung disease will affect the process of the lava flowing and not cooling, as the two systems (geological and biological) are essentially isolated from each other."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Test sentence: \\"John paid a dollar for a head of lettuce.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, the test sentence, \\"John paid a dollar for a head of lettuce,\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. Let's break down the elements that contribute to its grammatical correctness: 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"John,\\" which is a proper noun and functions as a singular subject. In English, a sentence needs to have a subject to provide information about who or what is performing the action in the sentence. 2. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"paid,\\" which is the simple past tense of the verb \\"to pay.\\" The verb is essential since it conveys the action that the subject is performing. In this case, the action is paying for something. 3. Direct Object: The direct object of the sentence is \\"a dollar.\\" A direct object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb. In this case, the noun phrase \\"a dollar\\" is the object of the verb \\"paid,\\" indicating the amount paid by John. 4. Preposition: The preposition \\"for\\" follows the direct object and introduces a prepositional phrase, providing additional information about the purpose or reason for the action in the sentence. Prepositions are words that indicate relationships between nouns, pronouns, and other words in a sentence. 5. Object of the Preposition: The object of the preposition \\"for\\" is the noun phrase \\"a head of lettuce.\\" In this sentence, the prepositional phrase \\"for a head of lettuce\\" explains the purpose for which John paid a dollar. Overall, the sentence has a clear subject (John), a verb (paid), a direct object (a dollar), and a prepositional phrase (for a head of lettuce) that provides additional context. The syntax is correct, and no grammatical errors are present in the sentence.

Air Niugini operated their Boeing 707 from Auckland to Port Moresby via Hong Kong in a tripartite agreement with Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific .","output":"The two sentences convey a similar overall meaning, but they contain differences in specific details. Both sentences describe that Air Niugini used a Boeing 707 for a flight route and had a tripartite agreement with Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific. However, there are semantic differences between them: 1. Pronoun usage: The first sentence uses 'her' to refer to Air Niugini, which is a more personified way of attributing ownership, while the second sentence uses 'their,' which is a neutral possessive pronoun. This difference doesn't impact the overall message, but it does change the tone of the sentence. 2. Route details: The biggest difference between the two sentences is the order of the flight route. In the first sentence, the flight route is described as \\"from Auckland to Hong Kong via Port Moresby,\\" which means the flight starts in Auckland, stops in Port Moresby, and then finally arrives in Hong Kong. In the second sentence, the route is described as \\"from Auckland to Port Moresby via Hong Kong,\\" which means the flight starts in Auckland, stops in Hong Kong, and then arrives in Port Moresby. This variation significantly impacts the specific details of the route. To sum up, while both sentences have a similar overall meaning, providing information about Air Niugini's involvement in a tripartite agreement while operating a Boeing 707, the order of the flight route and the pronoun usage create subtle but meaningful differences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you believe that the insurance company undervalued your car in their report, gather and copy any records you have that show that your car was valuable and well-maintained. This includes receipts and other proof of:  Optional features Upgrades, add-ons, and customizations Repairs Regular maintenance Any documents you received from the car's previous owner Spend some time finding evidence that your insurer undervalued your vehicle or overvalued the cost of repair. Kelley Blue Book is a good place to start. KBB is the go-to authority on car values, and lets you calculate the value of your vehicle with reference to its condition and your geographic location. You can also find for-sale listings online or in a newspaper for the make and model in a similar condition in your area. Finally, you may be able to get a quote for repairs from a mechanic. Have him or her put the quote in writing. Vehicle owners are often surprised to find out that their car has depreciated substantially since they purchased it. Remember that the value of your car is based on its resale value, not on what you paid for it. Your insurance adjuster should have prepared the initial report by calculating the average values and cost of repairs for similar vehicles in your area. Submit a detailed collection of evidence showing that the adjuster's valuations were inaccurate. The adjuster will review your supporting documentation. Do your own calculations by averaging the values of several different comparable vehicles in your area. The adjuster will certainly check your math, but your evidence will be more persuasive if you present the conclusion of your research up front. Your insurance company may or may not have had the vehicle appraised in person. Re-read your insurance policy, or ask if your policy guarantees you the right to an independent appraisal. The insurance company will either hire an appraiser inspect your vehicle, or they may simply offer you more money to settle the claim and avoid the trouble of hiring an appraiser. The adjuster may also want to avoid the possibility that the new appraisal will be substantially higher than the initial valuation. Your insurance company has a lot of power in declaring a vehicle a total loss, because they have the money that you need to either repair your car or buy a new one. However, if you can afford to wait, you can exercise some power of your own by refusing to settle right away. Insurance adjusters are typically under a lot of pressure to settle cases quickly. Some sources report that adjusters usually have discretion to increase a settlement amount by up to 500 during negotiations. To get more, you will need to present compelling evidence that their initial calculations were off and demonstrate that you are not in a hurry to settle. Insurance companies are required by law to settle claims in good faith. If you believe that your insurer has acted in bad faith by making an unreasonably low offer, you can file a complaint with your state's Department of Insurance. You can find a directory of links to each Department of Insurance's consumer complaint website here.

It's not that she's taken months to figure out what to do for her birthday, but it's because she has two - a real one and an official one. Queen Elizabeth II was born on 21 April 1926 but has an official birthday usually celebrated on the second Saturday of June. So why two birthdays for the Queen and how does she celebrate them? Official celebrations to mark a King or Queen's birthday in the UK have often been held on a day that isn't their actual birthday. Usually the official birthday happens in summer because there is a better chance of good weather in the UK during the summer months. The two birthday tradition was started more than 250 years ago by King George II in 1748. How does she mark her birthdays? The Queen usually spends her actual birthday privately, but the day is marked publicly by gun salutes in central London. On her official birthday, Her Majesty is joined by other members of the Royal Family at the Trooping the Colour parade. Hundreds of officers, horses and musicians take part in the event in London. The parade starts at the Queen's official residence, Buckingham Palace, along The Mall to Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall, near to Downing Street, and back again.","output":"Queen Elizabeth II has two birthdays, her actual birth date on April 21 and an official one in June, with the two-birthday tradition dating back to King George II and celebrations including private time, gun salutes, and the Trooping the Colour parade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Lord Rennard questions whether Nick Clegg is still leading a 'major party' The Lib Dem peer was suspended early this year after a series of women accused him of making sexual advances. Barbed comments will be seen as revenge for not being welcomed back. Article:","output":"Title: Lord Rennard Raises Doubts About Nick Clegg's Leadership Amidst Controversy Introduction:  In the wake of his suspension earlier this year, Lord Rennard is raising questions about whether former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is still leading a \\"major party.\\" The Lib Dem peer's comments have come to light after a series of women accused him of making sexual advances. This recent development can be viewed as a means of seeking revenge, as Rennard was not welcomed back into the party. Body: 1. Suspended Lib Dem peer criticizes Clegg's leadership - Lord Rennard, who is currently suspended from the Liberal Democrat party, has openly questioned Nick Clegg's leadership abilities. - This comes as a surprise, given Rennard's former influence and loyalty within the party. 2. Controversial accusations against Rennard earlier this year - Several women within the Liberal Democrat party accused Rennard of making inappropriate sexual advances towards them, leading to his suspension in early 2021. - Rennard has since faced significant backlash and negative public opinion as a result of these accusations. 3. The potential motive behind Rennard's comments - It is speculated that Rennard's recent statements questioning Clegg's leadership may be an act of revenge. - This comes as a response to Rennard's suspension and lack of support from party members, including Clegg. 4. Implications of Rennard's criticism - Rennard's remarks may also be seen as a reflection of the growing dissension within the Liberal Democrats. - As a result, this could potentially further damage the image and credibility of the party, which has already faced challenges in recent years. Conclusion: The recent barbed comments made by suspended Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard against Nick Clegg could have significant implications for the party's current status and public image. Whether Rennard's actions are solely based on personal motives or indicate a broader dissatisfaction within the party remains to be seen. Regardless, the unfolding events have brought the issue of leadership and unity within the Liberal Democrats to the forefront."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.

Please answer the following question: Background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  Paragraph: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which location most probably didn't suffer land loss or similar processes, location A or location B? A:","output":"Location A most probably didn't suffer land loss or similar processes. The paragraph states that location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary, suggesting that the environmental degradation that led to the loss can be reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience. In contrast, location B's loss of biodiversity is permanent, which implies that it may have experienced land loss or other irreversible processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.  I am facing a new situation today: Humans have just discovered the ability to asexually reproduce if they wish. Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis. Jimmy was born by sexual reproduction and one of his parents has the same genetic disease as Billy's parents.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis? A:","output":"A: Jimmy is less likely to have Horkrumatis. The reason for this answer is based on the genetic differences between asexual and sexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, the offspring (Billy) is genetically identical to the parent. This means if the parent has the genetic disease Horkrumatis, the offspring will also inherit that disease gene without fail. In sexual reproduction, on the other hand, the offspring (Jimmy) inherits a mix of genes from both parents. In this case, only one parent has the Horkrumatis gene. This means that Jimmy has a chance to not inherit the disease gene from the affected parent, making it less likely for him to have Horkrumatis compared to Billy, who is an exact genetic copy of his parent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active - The animal has entered hibernation mode -   Question: suppose more movement happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"More movement during the hibernation process can negatively affect the animal's ability to hibernate properly. When an animal starts hibernating, its body undergoes significant physiological changes to conserve energy. Increased activity or disturbance during this period can disrupt these processes, making it difficult for the animal to enter and maintain a proper hibernation state. The second effect mentioned is the animal finding a place to hibernate. If there is more movement or perturbation, it might cause the animal to spend more time and energy searching for a suitable hibernation spot. This can lead to greater energy expenditure, which may deplete the stored fat that the animal relies on during hibernation. In turn, this could reduce the overall effectiveness of hibernation and potentially harm the animal. In summary, more movement during the hibernation process can have a negative effect on an animal's ability to hibernate properly, as well as influence its ability to find a suitable hibernation spot by causing it to expend more energy than necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The chocoholic duo  managed to lose eight stone combined after ditching their beloved treat. Lorraine, 45, and Fay, 19, from Lichfield, West Midlands, would munch on their favourite chocolate bars throughout the day, even skipping meals in favour of the snack. Then and now: Lorraine and Fay Fisher have managed to lose eight stone between them, right, by cutting out their favourite chocolate snacks. What a difference a year makes: Over the course of 15 months Fay lost more than five stone. Needs a new wardrobe: At her biggest Fay was a size 26 and felt unhappy about her body. Fay said: 'I used to eat at least four bars of chocolate a day - as well as chocolate on toast for breakfast and a chocolate pudding in the evening. But I hated how much weight I'd put on, I was a size 26 and couldn't look at myself in the mirror.' As a result of her sweet tooth, Fay weighed 18st 2lbs and said her size made her feel low in confidence. She said: 'People would call me fat and obese, and stare at me in the street. I couldn't fit in a pair of jeans, the only things I could ever wear was leggings.' It was an embarrassing incident abroad that was the last straw for Fay. She said: 'I was going on holiday with my friends to Greece and I couldn't fit the plane seat belt around me. I had to be given an extension and it was just mortifying. 'The holiday was horrible because I felt so awful - walking around in the heat made me so hot, and lying on the beach made me feel so uncomfortable. 'I realised I finally needed to sort my weight out, that's when I told Mum I was going to join Weight Watchers.' At the time, Lorraine was 16st 2lbs and had been advised by her doctors to lose weight. Thanks to her daughter's decision to diet, the mother-of-three decide the time was right for her to also finally try and beat the bulge. She explained: 'The doctors had referred me to a weight loss management programme, but apart from half a stone here and there I wasn't very successful. 'But when Fay told me she wanted me to go with her (to Weight Watchers) I thought it was the perfect opportunity. Before I was eating massive portions - I'd pile my food up into a mountain on my plate. I wouldn't eat anything at lunch, instead I'd just munch on chocolate and junk food throughout the day.' Bad habits: Before embarking on their diet Fay and Lorraine would snack on chocolate bars every single day, even having chocolate for breakfast. Transformed: Lorraine was told by her doctor that she needed to lose weight (left) but she struggled to get herself motivated before Fay decided to do it with her. Simmed down:  Fay proudly shows off her weightloss certificate  and new figure. The pair went to their first Weight Watchers meet just 15 months ago and haven't looked back. Fay, a student, has lost 5st 10lb, dropping to 12st 12lbs, while Lorraine has lost 2st 13lbs and is now 13st 5lbs. The pair said they couldn't have done it with each other's support. Lorraine revealed: 'It's been an amazing experience to have with my daughter. Fay has kept me going and her weight loss has been an inspiration to me. 'If it wasn't for her I'd have given up months ago. I feel so much better now and I go to the gym between four and five times a week.' Fay added: 'I couldn't have done it without my mum's support. We've been there for each other from the beginning and it's even brought us closer.' Fay and Lorraine managed to loose eight stone between them. Now they have a much healthier diet which includes a lot less chocolate! Breakfast. Four pieces of chocolate spread on Toast. Snack. Chocolate bar and pringles. Lunch. Sandwiches with lots of egg mayo. Snack. Chocolate bar. Dinner. Whatever Lorraine cooked - sometimes big portions of chicken and potato, with a warm chocolate pudding for dessert. Breakfast.

The answer to the question: What two locations in Sicily was the development of the new Baroque style evident? is inside the article: Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque..., can you guess it ?","output":"The two locations in Sicily where the development of the new Baroque style was evident are Noto and Catania. These cities witnessed significant architectural reconstruction after the devastating earthquake of 1693. The new generation of Sicilian architects, such as Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi, and Tommaso Napoli, brought a unique and innovative approach to Baroque style as they rebuilt these cities. This distinct version of Baroque architecture, characterized by elaborate external staircases, ornate façades, and vibrant church interiors, contributed to the strong individuality of the Sicilian Baroque style and its influence on the island's culture and artistic expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We arrived on the scene first , and had to survey , making sure they were in the ditch somewhere ( in my drunken state , i still did not look forward to finding someone with a mashed in head in teh ditch , and call 911 . Question: What may have happened to the person ?","output":"Based on the given information, it seems that an accident occurred where a car crashed into a power pole. The vehicle's airbags were deployed and the windshield was shattered, likely because a person's head impacted it. However, upon arrival at the scene, no one was found inside the car or nearby.  To derive a possible scenario of what may have happened to the person, we can follow these stages: 1. Understanding the circumstances: Given that the windshield was shattered and airbags were deployed, it's likely the car was going at a relatively high speed or the impact was forceful. Moreover, the mention of \\"a drunken state\\" suggests the possibility of alcohol involvement, increasing risk of reckless driving or sudden accidents.  2. Considering possible outcomes: We are left with three fundamental possibilities as to the current state of the missing person:      - The person managed to walk or run away after the accident, which is possible in cases where the shock temporarily overcomes pain or injury. They could be in a hidden location to avoid law enforcement, especially if drunk driving was involved.     - The person was picked up by someone else, either a passerby who took them to a hospital, an accomplice, or in worst-case scenarios, someone who meant harm.     - The person might still be at the scene, but not immediately visible, possibly in the ditch or nearby undergrowth. They could be unconscious or critically hurt. Given the severity of the crash, this is a grave possibility. 3. Proposed course of action: The user should immediately call 911 to report the accident if not already done. Authorities would be able to conduct a more thorough search of the crash site, look for any signs of blood or other forensic evidence, trace the owner of the car, and possibly check nearby hospitals or health centers. Thus, without further information, precise conclusions cannot be made about the missing person's situation post-accident. The best course of action is to report the incident to authorities and allow them to initiate investigation procedures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If you don’t remove the spacers before applying grout, you’ll have problems with your grout in the future. If the spacer won't come out, use a flathead screwdriver to pry it out. Be careful not to damage the tile. While you can mix your own grout, it is much easier to purchase premixed grout and apply it without preparation. However, make sure you don’t open the grout until you’re ready to use it. If you open it earlier, it may begin to dry before you use it. Scoop up a generous amount of grout from your bucket with your float. Spread the grout over the spaces between your tiles. Apply extra grout, as you want to make sure you’re completely filling all grout lines. Avoid filling the space between your tiles and your counter, appliances, or windows. You’ll fill these in with caulk later. Run your float lightly across the grouted portions of your tile. Use it to scope up as much excess grout as you can. By removing grout, you’ll make your cleanup process a lot easier. You’ll also be able to use the excess grout elsewhere in your project. Take a rounded tool and run it along your grout lines. This will give a slightly concave appearance to your grout lines. It will also help to compact the grout and fill any pockets that aren’t already filled. Dampen a sponge in cool clean water. Wipe your tiles in a back-and-forth fashion. Rinse your sponge after you’ve wiped down one 4 foot (1.2 m) row of tiles. Continue to wipe your tiles until you’ve removed any grout or grout haze that remains on them. Use a caulk that closely matches the color of the grout you used. Squeeze your caulk gun or the tube slightly to push out just enough caulk to fill the gap. Finally, dampen one of your fingers in warm water and use it to smooth the caulk.  You can use a rounded end of a pen, pencil, or another object instead of your finger. Place painter's tape on the face of the tiles adjacent to where you’ll caulk. Remove the tape shortly after you’ve applied the caulk. What is a summary?","output":"A summary for this article would be: When putting tiles on a surface, you need to wait 12 hours for them to stick properly. Then, you remove little pieces (spacers) between the tiles and put a special paste (grout) between them so they stay strong and look nice. Be careful not to put grout between tiles and other things like counters or windows - you'll use a different sticky material (caulk) for those areas later. Clean up extra grout and make the lines between tiles look nice with a tool and sponge. Then, use caulk for the edges and make it smooth. This helps your tiles look good and stay in place for a long time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who was abandoned after her mother's death? , can you please find it?   The film is set in Australia 1919, just a year after World War I. Australia begins to question the value of continuing as an outpost to the British Empire. Since his sister's death years ago, Jack Dickens has raised his niece Sally, aided by his sharp-tongued maid Hannah. Sally's father, Alexander Voysey, abandoned her after her mother's death and took off for the bright lights of the city, ostensibly making a name for himself as a literary critic and writer in London. Jack and Sally have sacrificed their own hopes and dreams to run the farm while Voysey disports himself in the city. Despite the claims of success, Voysey is a self-centered, self-aggrandizing, pompous windbag with no visible means of support beyond leeching off his brother-in-law's labor on the farm. Voysey has remarried a younger woman, Deborah, who has come to regret her marriage. Voysey subjects Deborah to cruel behavior from him, such as fetching things he's dropped at his whim and making advances to other women right in front of her. Deborah is deeply unhappy, and feels that she has wasted her youth and squandered her life in marrying Voysey. Both Jack and the town doctor are soon smitten by Deborah, while Sally pines for the town doctor herself.  The true natures, characters, and hopes and dreams within the family are revealed as things fall apart. The answer to this question is:","output":"Sally was abandoned after her mother's death.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choices: (a). no (b). yes","output":"To answer the first question, let us define SQL Server 2008: SQL Server 2008 is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is a software product designed to store, retrieve, and manage data in a structured format using SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard language for managing relational databases. Key features of SQL Server 2008 include support for data encryption, improved data compression, and better performance optimization. Now, let us define log shipping in SQL Server: Log shipping is a high availability and disaster recovery feature in SQL Server that allows you to maintain a redundant copy of a primary database on a secondary server. It involves backing up the transaction log of the primary database and then restoring it on the secondary server. This process is useful for maintaining a standby server that can take over if the primary server fails or for load balancing read-only queries across multiple servers. Comparing the definitions of SQL Server 2008 and log shipping in SQL Server, we can see that they are two distinct concepts. SQL Server 2008 refers to the database management system itself, while log shipping refers to a specific feature within that system.

If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease.  Paragraph: Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium.

Q:Information:  - The Luna programme (from the Russian word  \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation.  - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures.  - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys .  - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\").  - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

This wise and funny film works small miracles in describing such a moment when kids turn from the wishfulness of childhood into shaping the world for themselves. The sweetly reflective hero, a sixth-grader named Koichi, starts out by wishing for a volcano to erupt. Not just any volcano, but the one that towers above his town, smoking heavily and giving off ash. An eruption would lead to a withdrawing, which would lead, at least in his mind, to a reunion with his father and kid brother, who've been living in Hakata while Koichi lives with his mother and retired grandparents in Kagoshima. The volcano, knowing nothing of this, refuses to erupt, but Koichi hears of another approach to realizing the desired miracle. One of the pleasures of I Wish is watching how kids behave -- how Koichi attacks his dinner, for example. Another pleasure is rediscovering how kids think. These kids can be logical and ever so tricky. But children's thought processes can also be fancy. A boy wishes he could play baseball like one of baseball stars, who eats curry for breakfast; so he, too, starts eating curry for breakfast, instead of practicing on the field. Another boy tries to wish his dead dog, Marble, back to life. And what does Koichi finally wish for? I wish you'd see this delightful film to find out.

Which county is using a unit mesured with millimeter, Germany or United States? The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, I will analyze the units of pressure used in each country and determine which one is measured in millimeters. 1. In France, they use atmosphere (atm) and Pascal (Pa) as pressure units:    - 1 atmosphere (atm) is defined as 101325 Pascal (Pa)    - Pascal is derived from the basic SI unit for pressure - the newton per square meter (N/m²).    - Both atm and Pa are not measured in millimeters. 2. In Germany, they use torr as a pressure unit:    - 1 torr is defined as 1/760 of an atmosphere (atm).    - Torr is also known as millimeter of mercury (mmHg) because it was originally defined as the height of a column of mercury that would exert the same pressure, and the height of that column is measured in millimeters.    - Thus, torr is measured in millimeters. 3. In the United States, they use psi as a pressure unit:    - Psi stands for pounds per square inch, which is a unit of pressure based on avoirdupois units.    - Psi is not measured in millimeters.

We know that flow in a very smooth tube or around a smooth, streamlined object will be laminar at low velocity. We also know that at high velocity, even flow in a smooth tube or around a smooth object will experience turbulence. In between, it is more difficult to predict. In fact, at intermediate velocities, flow may oscillate back and forth indefinitely between laminar and turbulent. An occlusion, or narrowing, of an artery, such as shown in Figure 12.17, is likely to cause turbulence because of the irregularity of the blockage, as well as the complexity of blood as a fluid. Turbulence in the circulatory system is noisy and can sometimes be detected with a stethoscope, such as when measuring diastolic pressure in the upper arm’s partially collapsed brachial artery. These turbulent sounds, at the onset of blood flow when the cuff pressure becomes sufficiently small, are called Korotkoff sounds. Aneurysms, or ballooning of arteries, create significant turbulence and can sometimes be detected with a stethoscope. Heart murmurs, consistent with their name, are sounds produced by turbulent flow around damaged and insufficiently closed heart valves. Ultrasound can also be used to detect turbulence as a medical indicator in a process analogous to Doppler-shift radar used to detect storms.

Background: Ripken was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland, the son of Violet \\"Vi\\" Ripken (nee Roberta) and Cal Ripken Sr. He has German, English, and Irish ancestry. Though the Ripkens called Aberdeen, Maryland, their home, they were often on the move because of Cal Sr.'s coaching duties with the Baltimore Orioles organization. Cal Sr., in fact, was in Topeka, Kansas with one of his teams when his son was born. Context: Ripken owns several minor league baseball teams. In 2002, he purchased the Utica Blue Sox of the New York-Penn League and moved them to his hometown of Aberdeen, renaming them the Aberdeen IronBirds. The team is the Short-season Single-A affiliate team in the Orioles' system and plays at Ripken Stadium. On June 28, 2005, he announced that he was purchasing the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a Single-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. At the end of the 2008 season, Ripken purchased the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the Single-A advanced Florida State League and moved them to Port Charlotte, Florida, where they were renamed the Charlotte Stone Crabs.  On January 10, 2007, Ripken expressed interest in purchasing the Baltimore Orioles if current owner Peter Angelos were to sell the team. He had yet to be approached about the potential purchase of the team. Though he has not purchased them, Ripken was quoted in a July 17, 2010, Associated Press article as saying he would consider rejoining the Orioles part-time as an advisor and full-time after his son graduated from high school in 2012.  In October 2007, Ripken began working as a studio analyst for TBS Sports during the 2007 Major League Baseball playoffs. He has continued to serve in this role since then.  Ripken is on the Board of Directors of ZeniMax Media. On February 28, 2008, Ripken announced his venture into the massively multiplayer online sports game market with \\"Cal Ripken's Real Baseball\\".

Make sure you are there for the people around you and spend time with them when you can. Showing that you are truly interested in their happiness and well-being will make them see that you are a true friend. This could mean sending texts to check in, bringing them soup when they aren’t feeling good, offering your time when they need help, and opening yourself up to them. It may make you feel vulnerable doing this, but it increases your chances of finding a best friend. People generally like to talk about themselves. This isn't done in an arrogant way--it's just how they best relate to others, through their own stories. Find out all you can about potential friends. Show interest in them by asking questions that get them talking. Ask questions like, “What’s your favorite thing to do?” “Why did you choose this career path?” or “Who is the person who influences you most?” Asking different questions like this allows you to get to know them on a personal level and opens up the beginnings of a great friendship. It’s difficult to maintain a relationship with someone you don’t see. You also may make them feel like they aren’t worth your time if you don’t see them often. Do what you can to share your time with them and they will see that you think they are worth the effort. Although going out and attending events together is fun, you don’t always have to do something. Just being in the same room together and chatting about what is going on with your life is often more fulfilling. Part of being a good friend is acting as a cheerleader. You have the ability to make others feel good about themselves, and this is something you should take on for your friend. When you are able to lift up their spirits and support them, they will likely be grateful to you and your friendship, which can allow it to become stronger. What makes a best friend stand out from other friends is your ability to share anything with them. Best friends have secrets that are kept between them. You can show your capacity to be a best friend by being honest with your friends and keeping their secrets.  If a friend tells you something, don't share it with anyone else. Unless, of course, your friend is in danger, you should keep your lips zipped. Trustworthy people are also honest. If your friend asks you a serious question, tell the truth, even if it hurts. For instance, if a close pal asks, \\"Do you think I should go to second-base with Josh?\\" Show your concern by saying \\"I think you should wait until you're sure he really cares about you.\\"","output":"This article says that to be a good best friend, you should be there for people, show interest in their lives, spend time together, lift their spirits, and be honest and trustworthy while keeping their secrets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you have any more interesting information regarding the history?   Yes, please.   Yes, in 1960 a nationalist movement led by Lumumba won the parliamentary elections.   Sure. Would you like to learn about their history? A:","output":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), also known as Congo-Kinshasa or DR Congo, is a Central African country with a rich and complex history. It is the second largest and fourth most populous country in Africa, spanning over 2.34 million square kilometers, and is home to over 101 million people. The DRC is known for its diverse culture and abundant natural resources. It has a tumultuous history marked by colonization, rebellions, wars, and political upheavals. In the late 19th century, Belgium's King Leopold II acquired control of the Congo territory, naming it the Congo Free State. The Free State was infamous for its brutal exploitation of the local population, especially in the rubber industry. It is estimated that millions of Congolese died as a result of this exploitation. In 1908, due to international pressure, the Congo Free State became a Belgian colony, known as the Belgian Congo. The Belgians continued to rule and exploit the region until the mid-20th century. In response to growing nationalist sentiment, the Democratic Republic of the Congo gained independence from Belgium on June 30, 1960. However, following independence, the country faced immediate conflicts over leadership and regional tensions. Patrice Lumumba, a key figure in the nationalist movement, became the first Prime Minister of the country. However, his tenure was short-lived as he was assassinated in 1961 in a plot widely believed to have been backed by Western powers. After a series of coups and political turbulence, Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in 1965, ruling the country for more than three decades under a dictatorship. During this time, the nation was named Zaire. Mobutu's regime came to an end in 1997 when rebel forces led by Laurent Kabila ousted him from power. Kabila then became the President and changed the country's name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kabila faced numerous challenges, including civil wars and foreign intervention, which further destabilized the country. In 2001, Laurent Kabila was assassinated, and his son Joseph Kabila succeeded him as the President. Joseph Kabila faced internal conflicts, ongoing violence, and political crises during his tenure. In 2019, Félix Tshisekedi was elected as the new President of the DRC, marking the first peaceful transition of power since the country's independence. The Democratic Republic of the Congo's history is characterized by its struggle for independence, political instability, conflicts, and exploitation. Today, the nation continues to face various challenges, including poverty, corruption, and ongoing armed conflicts, as it strives towards a more peaceful and prosperous future."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

European web users can now ask search engine Bing to remove links they don’t like. The move comes after a court ruling in May gave people in the EU the ‘right to be forgotten’ on the internet. The Microsoft-owned search giant has created an online request form that lets people identify specific web pages they want omitted. European web users can now ask search engine Bing (pictured) to remove links they don't like, following the 'right to be forgotten' court ruling in Luxembourg in May. This ruling requires search engines to remove information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - or face penalties. Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under. Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to. ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to. them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This. particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child,. when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was. collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the. storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’ The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who. has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps,. including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. ‘We will use the information that you provide to evaluate your request,’ said the Bing request form. ‘This information will help us to consider the balance between your individual privacy interest and the public interest in protecting free expression and the free availability of information, consistent with European law. ‘As a result, making a request does not guarantee that a particular search result will be blocked.’ The site added it will also consider other sources of information beyond the form to verify or supplement the information, and create a case for removal. It also said submissions may be re-evaluated over time, and this could lead to previously deleted results reappearing. People submitting requests are required to prove who they are, and whether they are a public figure such as a politician or celebrity. They are also asked to explain why they feel the data should be removed. Examples given include if the information is ‘out-of-date, false, incomplete or inappropriate’. The Microsoft-owned search giant has created an online request form (pictured) and said not all requests will be removed, and submissions will be re-evaluated over time. People submitting requests are required to prove who they are, and whether they are a public figure such as a politician or celebrity. The court ruled that individuals have the right to have links to information about them deleted from searches in certain circumstances, but only if they meet specific criteria. If search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30. When searches are made on Google, a warning message now appears at the bottom of the page that tells users results 'may have been removed.' This warning appears on all results regardless of the name searched. The decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google (pictured) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30. Earlier today, Microsoft announced plans to cut up to 18,000 jobs this year as the company to reposition itself for the future. Following the Nokia acquisition, completed in April, Microsoft had roughly 127,104 employees. This means meaning the cuts could reduce nearly 15 per cent of its workforce. Microsoft said the vast majority of the cuts will come in the next six months, and will fully implemented over the next year. 'There's many open questions,' Google. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at the company's annual shareholder. meeting in response to a question about the ruling and its implications. on Google's operations. 'A simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know. 'From Google's perspective that's a balance,' Schmidt added. 'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.' European citizens can submit take-down requests directly to Internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress from the courts. The ruling seems to give search engines. more leeway to dismiss take-down requests for links to webpages about. public figures, in which the information is deemed to be of public. interest. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice (pictured). It comes after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy. Google told MailOnline it is 'disappointed' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index.","output":"European web users can now ask Bing to remove links they don’t like, after a court ruling in May allowed the 'right to be forgotten' on the internet.

The man, sweating under the stress of labor and the warmth of the day, trudges on with his task methodically. With each swipe of his towel, every rinse from the pressure washer, and every wipe on the wheel, it's clear the car is a cherished possession. The particular focus on his task and the cleanliness of this car isn't just the typical indication of a car owner's regard for their vehicle. It's a slightly deeper connection, reminiscent of an artist dedicating their time and energy into crafting a masterpiece. The task continues and among the car's gleaming exterior, a subtle yet distinctively noticeable aspect becomes evident - the car's emblem. It's not just any badge, but a mark of identity that's associated with a story or history of the car. There's a certain prestige, a certain cachet associated with these emblems. As the man drenches the car under the cascades falling from his pressure washer, the soap suds begin to slip down the vehicle's contoured body. Just as the sudsy water navigates the car's surface and takes its eventual course downwards, the audience's eyes are guided to the car's emblem. It's more than just a piece of metal. The emblem is a spectacle itself, flashing enticingly under the sun. The emblem appears on the screen as suds slip down a car, complementing perfectly to the narrative of diligent care and effort. In essence, the way the man is washing the car, the focus on each detail and the prominent emphasis on the emblem, all points towards the admiration and earnest relationship he has with the vehicle - highlighted by the symbol of its distinct identity. These are scenes that might not say much at a glance, but when pieced together, they deliver a story of strong connection, attention to detail, and a deeper understanding of cherished relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There is now a plaque across from it on the Canadian side, explaining the history of the wreck. In recent years, the rate of deterioration on the scow has advanced significantly, with some speculating it will no longer be visible by 2030 What's the best answer to this question: is there a boat stuck in niagara falls?","output":"Yes, there is a boat stuck in Niagara Falls, specifically an old steel barge called \\"the Iron Scow.\\" The scow has been trapped in the Niagara River, approximately 800 meters upstream from Horseshoe Falls, since August 6, 1918. The boat began to move again in 2019 after a severe storm, but managed to get lodged again only 50 meters from its original spot, remaining highly visible to this day. The Iron Scow became stuck after breaking away from its tugboat during a dredging operation when attempts were being made to send sand and silt 1,000 feet into the Niagara River. The two men on board, Gustav F. Lofberg and James H. Harris, were successful in grounding the barge on the shoal to avoid being swept over the falls. They managed to escape the boat with the help of the Niagara Falls Fire Department, and their rescue effort became a popular spectacle of bravery and skill. A plaque now stands on the Canadian side of the Niagara Falls, detailing the unique history of the scow and its notable role in the region's past. Over the past century, the elements have taken a toll on the scow, and it has continued to deteriorate steadily. Experts have predicted that it may no longer be visible by 2030 due to the unrelenting force of the water and natural wear-and-tear. In conclusion, it is accurate to state that there is indeed a boat stuck in Niagara Falls, known as the Iron Scow. It has been trapped in the area since 1918 and has become an iconic part of the falls' history. While it remains visible today, experts believe that, due to deterioration, it may not be seen beyond 2030."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On tärkeää, että eri maat ja alueet voivat ylläpitää ja edistää omia ainutlaatuisia kulttuuriperinteitään samalla, kun ne osallistuvat laajempaan eurooppalaiseen kulttuurien vuoropuheluun. Yksittäiset kulttuurisen erinomaisuuden keskukset ovat merkittäviä eurooppalaisen kulttuurin edistäjinä. Ne tarjoavat paikallisen, alueellisen ja kansallisen identiteetin lujittamista sekä mahdollistavat kulttuuriperinnön säilyttämisen ja kehittämisen. Nämä keskukset, kuten museot, taidegalleriat, teatterit ja festivaalit, tuovat esille eurooppalaisen kulttuurin moninaisuutta ja rikkautta ja rohkaisevat ihmisiä arvostamaan ja vaalimaan tätä ainutlaatuista perintöä. Samalla Euroopan mantereena meidän on oltava sitoutuneita kulttuuriseen vuoropuheluun ja yhteistyöhön, jotta voidaan edistää yhteistä kulttuurista ymmärrystä ja kunnioitusta. Euroopan unioni on tässä suhteessa erittäin tärkeä toimija, sillä se pyrkii edistämään kulttuurista monimuotoisuutta ja kulttuurien välistä vuoropuhelua jäsenmaiden välillä. Unioni tarjoaa monia ohjelmia ja rahoitusmahdollisuuksia, jotka tukevat kulttuurivaihtoa, koulutusta ja yhteistyöhankkeita sekä parantavat kulttuuripolitiikkojen koordinointia ja kehittämistä. Eurooppalaisen kulttuurisen identiteetin vahvistaminen ja monimuotoisuuden arvostaminen on tärkeää myös globalisoituvassa maailmassa. Kulttuuriset erot ja vahvuudet tekevät Euroopasta ainutlaatuisen ja kiinnostavan alueen sekä matkailijoille että kansainväliselle yhteisölle.

For example, a bite from the venomous brown recluse may cause a red, blistering sore, while other spider bites could cause little to no reaction. Regarding the term \\"not splotchy,\\" it can be subjective, but in general, spider bites are more defined and localized compared to bed bug bites, which often appear in clusters or rows and may spread out (often known as splotchy).

This rather surprised me as I am not a great fan of either 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights'; I consider the heroine of the former to be a self-righteous bore, and the latter piece of work as overblown claptrap. 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall', like the aforementioned works, is also somewhat depressing in parts. However, the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, the breathtakingly wild and beautiful landscape of Yorkshire, and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. This film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. At best they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny as portrayed by the treatment of the womenfolk in the Markham household. At the other end of the scale, there is the unfortunate Helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate, but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect. She runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but, as a women of mystery living alone in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the subject of spiteful gossip and speculation. Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering Helen Markham. Not only incredibly beautiful (in spite of that terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film. Tara is dignified and aloof while, at the same time, allowing us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves IS the depraved, yet curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could never imagine another actor playing that part. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as does the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the Good Things in Life. Finally, I could watch this film for Toby Stephens alone; he is so good-looking,rugged, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way). I am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! If there is a fault with the film it is the use of flashbacks which I felt both interfered with the flow of the story and made it slightly confusing. Other people, who have watched this film with me, also had problems with this, and I found I had to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact retrospective. I am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film. Not only did I puchase the video (a rare occurrence), but it led me to buy Anne Bronte's superb novel. Naturally, this was better than the film, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend that anyone interested should watch the film and then read the book in that order.  Choose your answer.

Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest political party. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"The modern-day Democratic Party is more than 150 years old.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information given in the paragraph, we can conclude that \\"The modern-day Democratic Party is more than 150 years old.\\" The paragraph states that the Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson. If we take the current year, 2022, and subtract 1828, we get 194 years. This means that the modern-day Democratic Party has existed for approximately 194 years, which is indeed more than 150 years old. It is important to note that the Democratic Party has undergone significant ideological and policy shifts over these 194 years. The party initially supported a limited federal government and championed states' rights, which was in line with the beliefs of its early founders, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, from the Democratic-Republican Party. Over time, however, the Democratic Party came to embrace a more progressive platform that included support for social safety nets, civil rights, and labor rights. Throughout its long history, the Democratic Party has produced numerous U.S. Presidents, Senators, Representatives, and other political figures who have shaped the nation's policies and direction. In recent years, the Democratic Party has been characterized by its commitment to social and economic equality, environmental sustainability, and a diverse and inclusive platform that reflects the demographics of modern-day America. In conclusion, based on the established foundation date of the Democratic Party in 1828, we can confirm that the modern-day Democratic Party is more than 150 years old, having a rich and complex history that continues to evolve to meet the needs and aspirations of the American people."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which country had an increased food supply?  two countries of similar natural resources had different populations. Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population.  Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.","output":"Based on the paragraph provided, it can be inferred that Italy had an increased food supply. Comparing the two countries, Italy is described as having a small population, while Spain had a very large population. As the hint suggests, small population sizes typically correspond with an abundance of food and resources for each individual. In natural ecosystems, the availability of resources impacts the birth rate and ultimately population growth. A high availability of resources like food enables a more comfortable reproduction process and higher birth rates. Conversely, when the food supply or other vital resources decrease due to the larger population, the death rate increases, leading to a decrease in the birth rates and resulting in slower population growth. In this example, the smaller population of Italy indicates that there is likely a higher food supply per individual, enabling increased reproduction and higher birth rates, as opposed to Spain, which faced a decrease in necessary resources due to its larger population. Thus, Italy had an increased food supply in comparison to Spain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Whenever I quarreled with my mother, I would turn to my father for comfort. He was everything to me. Time flies like a bird. As I got older, I became silent and found it hard to start a conversation with my father. The gap  between us began to grow. He had done so much for me but I always took it for granted . Last time our school gave us two days off, and daddy gave me a ride home on his motorbike. I was tired and fell asleep on his back. Later my mother said he was very happy because it had been a long time since we got close last. Suddenly I felt a little shamed. I realized that I had paid no attention to him a lot during the last few years. The next day I stayed in bed and when daddy tried to wake me up to have breakfast, I pretended  that I couldn't hear him. At last he brought a bowl of noodles to my bed, and said, \\"Come on, dear, have your breakfast and then continue your dream.\\" I got so angry with him for troubling my sleep that I shouted, \\" _ .\\" As I said this, I sat up quickly, and the bowl of noodles broke on the floor. Hearing the noise, mum came in and shouted at me, \\"What do you think your father is? Who else treats you as well as he does?\\" I was shocked and didn't know what to say. Finally I rushed with tears all over my face. I went to the pool where I used to go fishing with daddy. A few minutes later, I heard the sound of daddy's motorbike.

Is the review positive or negative? A:","output":"The review in question can be considered primarily negative in nature. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the toy's design, as the springs are too tight for the target age group (babies and toddlers). This issue makes the toy difficult for young children to operate, potentially leading to frustration and disappointment. While the review briefly mentions a positive aspect - the inclusion of dinosaurs as a refreshing change from familiar characters - this positive point does not outweigh the negative sentiments conveyed overall. By analyzing the review's content, it becomes clear that the user finds the toy faulty in serving its primary purpose, to provide entertainment and stimulation for babies and toddlers. The reviewer suggests other pop-up boxes they have encountered require less hand strength, making them a more rewarding experience for children. This comparison adds to the negative tone of the review, as they state that the product in question falls short of competing items in this regard. Additionally, the title \\"Requires too much strength for toddlers\\" further emphasizes that the main focus of the review is the difficulty that young children would face in operating the toy. This poses a significant issue, as it directly affects the usability and enjoyment factor for the intended audience. As a result, the negative aspects mentioned in the review carry more weight than the single positive comment about the dinosaur theme, solidifying the review as primarily negative. In conclusion, the review is predominantly negative, with the user expressing dissatisfaction with the toy's design features and functional issues that render it inappropriate for its target audience. The reviewer mentions a positive aspect, but it is not enough to overcome the predominant negative sentiments expressed in the review."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: Who refuses to drink a toast to Von Richthofen? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Von Richthofen and Brown Context: Manfred von Richthofen (John Phillip Law) is a German cavalry officer newly assigned to an air squadron under the command of Oswald Boelcke (Peter Masterson). Richthofen quickly becomes an ace; his career is presented as a series of scenes intercut with those of another pilot across the lines, a Canadian named Roy Brown (Don Stroud), who arrives at a British squadron commanded by Victoria Cross holder Lanoe Hawker (Corin Redgrave). The two pilots are very different; Brown ruffles the feathers of his squadron mates by refusing to drink a toast to Richthofen, while the Baron awards himself silver trophies in honour of his kills, and clashes with fellow pilot Hermann GÃ¶ring (Barry Primus) when Boelcke is killed after a mid-air collision and Richthofen assumes command of the squadron. Richthofen becomes outwardly energized by the war. Outraged by an order to camouflage his squadron's aircraft, he paints them in bright conspicuous colours, claiming that gentlemen should not hide from their enemies. The toll on both squadrons is highlighted when Richthofen is wounded during an aerial battle and Lanoe Hawker is killed. The war becomes personal for both when Brown and his squadron attack Richthofen's airfield, destroying their aircraft on the ground. Revenge comes when Richthofen, with the help of a batch of new fighters from Anthony Fokker (Hurd Hatfield) launches a counterattack on the British airfield. Back at their aerodrome, Richthofen rants at GÃ¶ring for leaving the formation and strafing medical personnel. He says: \\"You're an assassin!\\" GÃ¶ring defends himself by saying: \\"I make war to win.\\" Richthofen tells him: \\"Get out of my sight!\\", threatening that if GÃ¶ring does something similar again, he will personally go to the Kaiser to make sure Goring is shot.

Finance Watch - WSJ In this week's Finance Watch, we explore recent financial developments that have captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. From the impressive stock market rally to the growing debate on cryptocurrency regulations, a number of issues have emerged at the forefront of financial discussions. As the economy continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, experts weigh in on the implications of these developments for businesses and individual investors. Stock Market Rally The impressive stock market rally recently observed has caught many by surprise, with the S&P 500 hitting new record highs and the Nasdaq surging past 15000 points. Earnings reports from major technology companies, such as Apple and Amazon, showcased unprecedented growth amidst the pandemic, fueling investor confidence. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's decisions to maintain low interest rates and continue its bond-buying program have provided solid support for the market. Cryptocurrency Regulations Cryptocurrency has been increasingly capturing news headlines, as recent legislative moves by various governments trigger debates over the level of regulation required to manage this rapidly expanding market. China continues to crack down on cryptocurrency mining, while the U.S. is exploring options for a digital dollar with the intention of addressing illicit activity and ensuring stability. Leading experts share mixed opinions on the right regulatory approach, emphasizing the need to balance innovation and security. Inflation and Interest Rates The dilemma of increasing inflation rates looms over global central banks, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank taking center stage. The central banks have maintained that the current rise in inflation is transitory, mainly due to supply chain disruptions. Many experts and investors, however, remain skeptical and highlight potential long-lasting impacts on the economy. Conclusion The fast-paced financial landscape requires investors and analysts to stay abreast of emerging developments in order to make informed decisions. As the world continues to grapple with inflation, the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, and the transformative impact of technology on the stock market, the implications for the financial landscape remain uncertain.

The court's ruling will have a profound impact on the country's politics, legal system, and the legacy of one of its most controversial leaders. Jacob Zuma, who served as South Africa's president from 2009 to 2018, was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during his tenure. This trial, which has been long-awaited by both supporters and critics of the former president, focuses primarily on charges of fraud, racketeering, and money laundering in relation to a multi-billion-dollar arms deal signed in 1999. The accusations assert that Zuma received more than 4 million ZAR (around 270,000) in bribes from Thales, a French arms company. The hearings, conducted by the High Court in Pietermaritzburg, featured extensive testimonies, evidential submissions, and legal arguments from both the prosecution and defense teams. Some highlights from the hearings include defense claims of political conspiracies against Zuma, allegations of bias among the judiciary, and calls for the dismissal of the charges based on reasons such as insufficient evidence and expired statutes of limitations. The process was not without complications; the trial encountered numerous delays - some due to Zuma's hospitalization for an undisclosed illness, and others due to legal battles over evidence and procedural matters. The final days of the trial saw Zuma's defense team presenting their closing arguments, which reiterated their stance that the former president had been unfairly and unlawfully targeted by political adversaries. Next month's ruling will reverberate through South Africa's political landscape, regardless of the outcome. A conviction would not only solidify the assertions of wrongdoing by Zuma but also serve as a potent symbol of accountability in a country that has struggled to address corruption at the highest levels. A ruling in Zuma's favor, on the other hand, could vindicate his claims of being the victim of political persecution and weaken the credibility of the country's legal system. Beyond political concerns, the ruling will also carry significant social implications. Protests and demonstrations have occurred throughout the trial, illustrating the deep divides within South African society on this issue. Zuma's supporters argue that the former president has been unfairly targeted due to his role in the struggle against apartheid and his policy initiatives aimed at addressing inequality. Critics, however, view the trial as an opportunity to confront corruption and demand accountability from political leaders. In this context, the South African Court's ruling is anticipated with a combination of hope, anxiety, and uncertainty. The legal process has been exhaustive, shining a spotlight on the numerous challenges, complexities, and consequences of seeking justice in a high-profile corruption case. With the stage set for a historic decision, South Africa and the world will be watching intently as the court delivers its verdict on the fate of Jacob Zuma."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: after three-month recess microsoft trial resumes Text:","output":"Title: Microsoft Trial Resumes After Three-Month Recess: A Comprehensive Overview Introduction After an extensive three-month recess, the highly anticipated Microsoft trial has finally resumed. The trial, which originally began in October, was adjourned to allow for both parties to gather substantial evidence and prepare their cases. This legal battle has garnered significant attention from the public and the tech industry alike, due to the potential implications for Microsoft's dominance in the market and its future business practices. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the trial's background, the key players, and the potential consequences of the trial's outcome. Background The Microsoft trial was initiated by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and 18 state attorneys general in May 1998. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft violated federal antitrust laws by engaging in monopolistic practices that ultimately stifled competition in the market. The primary focus of the case is the company's aggressive marketing and integration of its Internet Explorer web browser into the Windows operating system, which critics argue unfairly prioritized Microsoft's product over competitors like Netscape Navigator. Key Players Numerous individuals have played pivotal roles in the case thus far, but a few key figures stand out. On the side of the prosecution, the DOJ is being represented by David Boies, a seasoned attorney known for his work in complex corporate litigation. Boies argues that Microsoft's bundling of its browser with the operating system is an illegal attempt to leverage its monopoly power in the OS market. For the defense, Microsoft has enlisted the help of a notable legal team, led by John Warden. The defense contends that Microsoft's actions are within the bounds of legal competition and emphasizes the benefits of a unified software experience for consumers. Microsoft founder and former CEO, Bill Gates, has also played an active role in the trial, testifying via videotape and contributing to the defense strategy. Potential Consequences The outcome of the Microsoft trial will have significant ramifications for both Microsoft and the broader technology sector. If found guilty of the antitrust allegations, Microsoft may be subject to various penalties, such as massive fines, structural changes within the company, divestiture of certain assets, or even the bifurcation of the company into smaller entities. Such consequences could significantly alter the landscape of the technology industry and set a precedent for future antitrust litigation. On the other hand, if Microsoft emerges victorious from the trial, it could signal a period of increased consolidation and monopolistic behavior within the tech sector. Critics argue that a favorable verdict for Microsoft might embolden other large corporations to manipulate markets and suppress competition with impunity, stifling innovation and consumer choice. Conclusion As the Microsoft trial resumes after a three-month hiatus, all eyes remain focused on the proceedings and the potential impact on the future of the technology industry as a whole. The case not only serves as a litmus test for antitrust enforcement but as a potential bellwether for future monopolistic behavior in the rapidly-evolving tech sector. With powerful arguments on both sides, the outcome remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the conclusion of this trial will leave a lasting mark on the world of technology and business for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - follicles  - capillaries  - urethra  - tubular ducts  A: A:","output":"Exocrine glands discharge their contents through tubular ducts. Let's explore this answer in more detail to help clarify this.  The exocrine gland is a type of gland that produces and secretes substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. This is different from endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream.  The word \\"exocrine\\" is derived from the Greek words \\"exo-\\" and \\"krinein,\\" which mean \\"outside\\" and \\"to separate,\\" respectively. This provides a hint to their function: these glands secrete substances out, away from the gland. Exocrine glands produce a wide variety of products, which may include sweat, salivary secretions, and digestive enzymes. The secretions of exocrine glands are delivered to their destination through a specialized network of tubular ducts.  The initial secretion of the exocrine gland often goes into a system of ducts that starts with the finest branches that are located adjacent to the gland's secretory cells. These ducts then join together, eventually leading to larger and larger ducts. In many cases, these ducts will leave the organ which contains the exocrine gland and then connect to the surface of the organ or the skin, where the secretions are finally released.  One classic example is the pancreas. The pancreas is a large gland in the human body which contains exocrine cells that produce digestive enzymes. These enzymes are secreted into a network of small ducts that soon combine into larger ones, finally leading to the pancreatic duct. The pancreatic duct then carries the enzymes through the pancreas and eventually into the small intestine, where they aid in digestion. Let’s explore the other choices: - Follicles: These are involved in the growth of hair, not the discharge of glandular contents. - Capillaries: These are tiny blood vessels that connect the smallest arteries (arterioles) to the smallest veins (venules). They play a major role in the exchange of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other nutrients and waste substances between the blood and the surrounding tissues. They don’t serve as a pathway for exocrine gland secretions. - Urethra: This is the tube that connects the urinary bladder to the urinary meatus for the removal of body waste fluids from the body. While some glands do discharge into the urethra (like the male prostate), it’s not a common pathway for most exocrine glands. In summary, while there are many types of ducts and structures within the body, when it comes to the excretion of substances produced by exocrine glands, tubular ducts are the structures that these glands use to discharge their secretions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, we can infer that the user had a positive user experience. However, without more extensive inputs about other features of the app like functionality, usability, error response, content or any other form of critique, it's hard to make an exact assessment. Further, star ratings are quite subjective and can differ considerably between individuals, depending also on what each star represents to a specific user. Some people may use a full five-star rating to indicate the highest level of satisfaction with a product, while others may reserve this highest rating for something exceptionality satisfying or groundbreakingly superior. Now, if we assume a generally positive experience with no outstanding issues or exceptionally positive wow-factors, we can probably align on a four-star rating (★★★★★). This reflects that the user found something particularly useful (the 'nifty' keypad layout) but without any specified exceptional feature to warrant that full five-star rating.

Answer:","output":"Ullapool, a picturesque fishing village, is situated on the shores of Loch Broom, in the northwest Highlands of Scotland. Loch Broom is a sea loch, meaning it is a long, narrow inlet of the sea that stretches inland from the coast. It spans approximately 14 miles (23 kilometers) in length and extends from the North Atlantic Ocean to the village of Ullapool, which is perched on the loch's eastern shore. Loch Broom has played an important role in the establishment and growth of Ullapool since the village's inception in the late 18th century. Established by the British Fisheries Society in 1788, Ullapool was designed by engineer Thomas Telford to serve as a herring port, and the loch's deep waters and sheltered location provided an ideal setting for the thriving fishing industry. Over time, Ullapool grew into a bustling fishing village and trading hub, thanks in part to the natural advantages of Loch Broom. In addition to its rich history, Loch Broom offers a stunning natural environment that attracts both visitors and locals alike. Surrounded by striking mountain ranges such as An Teallach, Beinn Dearg, The Fannichs, and The Sgurr Mor, the loch is an incredibly scenic location that offers an array of outdoor recreational opportunities. The crystal-clear waters of Loch Broom support a diverse ecosystem teeming with wildlife, including dolphins, seals, and a variety of seabirds and fish species. Visitors to the area can enjoy boat trips, fishing excursions, and even offshore island explorations, appreciating the beauty of the loch up close. Loch Broom also serves as an important transport hub for the Scottish Highlands. Ullapool functions as the primary ferry port for crossing over to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, with regular ferry services operating from the village's harbor. In addition, the loch's location along the popular North Coast 500 tourist route, which circumnavigates the northern coast of Scotland, further highlights the importance of the area to Scotland's tourism industry. In summary, the Scottish village of Ullapool lies on the shores of the beautiful and geographically significant Loch Broom. A sea loch with deep historical roots and stunning natural surroundings, Loch Broom has contributed greatly to Ullapool's growth and development as a fishing village and continues to attract visitors with its array of recreational activities and transport connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: In many cases, you can allow the pregnancy to proceed normally, but make sure you have a vet on hand in case there are complications, which are more likely if your pig is older or younger or has not given birth previously. Try to find a vet who specializes in rodents and other small animals, rather than just a generic vet. If you have multiple sows, remove the male pig immediately to prevent others from becoming pregnant. Even if this is the only sow you own, you should still remove the male pig before she reaches 60 days in her pregnancy. It is best to house the male in an adjacent cage where he can still be close to the female.  A male guinea pig who can not see or hear his mate may develop stress, making him susceptible to illness.  Male guinea pigs will continue to mount pregnant sows, which can cause stress or pain to your pregnant sow late in the pregnancy (after the 50-day mark). She could also become pregnancy just two hours after she gives birth. You'll want to make sure your pig is getting sufficient food, water, and nutrients since these things are also helping the fetuses develop.  Feed your guinea pig alfalfa hay instead of timothy hay so that she gets more protein and calcium. Your pregnant sow will also need more vitamin C after 4 weeks, about twice as much, so incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C into her diet. In addition, you may want to increase your guinea pig's fiber intake. Increased fiber intake can prevent hair thinning, which is common in the last stage of pregnancy. You should weigh your guinea pig twice a week to make sure that is gaining weight (and not losing it) and is generally healthy (e.g., eating all her food, still social and interactive, etc.) and check she's healthy. If at any point her weight begins to fall or if she begins to show signs of illness, consult a vet immediately. Try to make your guinea pig's life follow a routine so as to minimize stress, which can aggravate the dangers that accompany guinea pig pregnancy.  Avoid making changes to a pregnant sow's cage, like removing toys or putting the cage in a totally new location. This could increase her stress and affect her eating and drinking habits.  Reduce her exposure to loud noises or bright lights, including direct sunlight. Reduce handling to a minimum and don't handle her within two weeks of the birth. Note that the gestation period is usually 66 - 72 days. Summary:","output":"When your guinea pig is pregnant, make sure to have a special vet for small animals ready in case of complications. Keep the male guinea pig nearby but separate from the female after 60 days to avoid stress. Give your pregnant guinea pig extra food, water, and nutrients, like alfalfa hay and more vitamin C. Keep her in a calm environment, and weigh her twice a week to make sure she's healthy. Talk to a vet if there are any problems.

Easy: Just live in the parking lot of the tech company's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. That's what Brandon S., 23, has been doing since he started working for Google in May, the Washington Post reports. Brandon got a taste of Bay Area rental prices during a summer 2014 internship with the company: He told Business Insider he spent roughly 65 a night on the cheapest corporate housing option, a four-person, 2-bedroom place. But he did little but sleep there, eating three (free) meals on Google's campus, where he also worked out and showered. After debating the pros (proximity, money savings) and cons (\\"social suicide,\\" upfront costs), he bought a 16-foot 2006 box truck with 128 square feet of indoor space and 157,000 miles on the odometer. It cost 10,000; he pays 121 a month for insurance and has installed amenities like a bed, dresser, clothes rack, and bike rack. He says Google security hasn't bothered him beyond cross-checking the truck's registration file with the company database. Brandon has a running tally on his blog as to how much he has saved by not spending what he estimated would be 2,180 a month in rent. This week he broke even and then crossed into profitable territory. He's saving money on food, too: He doesn't want to keep any in the truck for fear of a rodent infestation, so he still eats most meals on the Google campus. He tells Business Insider he's trying to spend only 10% of his after-tax income, putting the rest toward student loan debt and investments. But there are certainly some no-fun aspects of his living situation, like battling bugs. (A female software engineer is also creatively dodging high rents.) Article:","output":"Taking on the perceived challenge of towering rental costs in Silicon Valley, a 23-year-old Google employee named Brandon S. has adopted an ingenious approach to slash his living expenses dramatically. Forgoing the common expectations of renting an apartment or house, he has instead turned a 16-foot 2006 box truck in the parking lot of Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, into his home. Even with Silicon Valley's infamously sky-high rent prices, dispensing with a traditional home in favor of a truck is indeed an unconventional move. So what inspired this radical decision? It all started in the summer of 2014 when Brandon undertook an internship with Google. It was then that he encountered the frightening reality of Bay Area's rental prices. The cheapest available accommodation cost him approximately 65 per night, a price that covered a four-person, 2-bedroom apartment. However, Brandon found that he spent the majority of his time on Google's campus, only returning to his rental for sleeping. His routine involved eating three free meals provided on campus, followed by working out and showering at Google's facilities. Recognizing that his usage of rental space was disproportionate to the exorbitant prices he was paying, Brandon began contemplating alternatives. The alternative, it turns out, was a truck. Brandon weighed the pros and cons of this unconventional lifestyle. He considered the benefits of proximity to his workplace and the potential for large-scale monetary savings against the possible social implications of living in a vehicle (\\"social suicide\\") and the upfront costs involved in customizing the truck to his needs.  Convinced that the benefits outweighed the drawbacks, Brandon finally committed to his mobile abode. He acquired a 2006 box truck with 128 square feet of indoor space and 157,000 miles on the odometer all for 10,000. His monthly outlay dropped dramatically to just 121 a month for truck insurance. Brandon's truck is far from a ramshackle dwelling, as he has furnished it with basic amenities including a bed, a dresser, clothes rack, and even a bike rack. Remarkably, Google's security has thus far not interfered in his unusual living arrangement, beyond compiling a cross-check of the truck's registration with the company's database. As he navigates this innovative lifestyle, Brandon maintains a running tally on his blog, logging the amount of money saved by avoiding what he estimates to be about 2,180 a month in rental costs. Notably, this week marked a significant milestone as he broke even and moved into profitable territory.  Food costs have also been less of a concern for Brandon. He steers clear from storing food in the truck to avoid potential rodent invasion, relying instead on Google's free meals. Despite the unconventional living arrangement, Brandon remains fiercely disciplined about his finances. His goal is to spend only 10% of his after-tax income, directing the remainder toward managing student loan debt and investment.  However, swapping a conventional home for a truck isn't without its challenges. Battling bugs, for example, has emerged as a cumbersome task amid his adapted lifestyle. Brandon's innovative life hack is not only a testament of his commitment to financial prudence and ingenuity but also illuminating the severe struggle experienced by professionals amid high rental prices in areas like Silicon Valley. His story reflects a broader discourse on affordable living in the era of tech-boom driven skyrocketing rents. It might also inspire others, like a certain female software engineer who has also found creative ways to dodge high rents, to chart their unconventional paths in dealing with the high cost of living."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Article: In recent years, temperatures in the polar areas are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and the snow are melting at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk. A sheet of ice acts like a huge mirror, reflecting the sun's energy. But ocean water, which is darker than ice, absorbs a lot of it. This causes the ocean to warm, which in turn speeds up ice melting and which leads to even more open waters. The cycle continues until all the ice is gone. \\"As the ice melts, water flows into the oceans, making them less salty. That, along with warmer water temperatures, can harm the creatures that live in, under, and near the ice,\\" says zoologist Michael Stoddard. \\"Cold-adapted animals -- including polar bears, foxes, hares, and seals -- also need ice for travel and survival.\\" \\"Most species of fish, sea spiders, and many other animals and plants that live in the waters of Antarctica don't live anywhere else,\\" Stoddard says. \\"Many of them have special proteins in their bodies keeping them from freezing to death and have other adaptation to the cold that has yet to be explored.\\" Therefore, experts are urging us to reconsider the way we live.

Premise: When he died in 1624, he bequeathed his fortune to the education and upkeep of orphans, and the school was subsequently built for this purpose. Hypothesis: The school was built for the education of orphans. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.  The premise states that upon his death in 1624, an individual left his fortune for the purpose of the education and maintenance of orphans. The school was then erected based on the provisions made available from this bequest. The hypothesis based on this premise is that the school was built for the purpose of educating orphans.  Therefore, the hypothesis is a direct extrapolation and simplification of the information provided in the premise, with no addition of new or contradictory information. The hypothesis succinctly encapsulates the intention behind the construction of the school as outlined in the premise, i.e., for the edification of orphans.  Hence, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise. The direct connection between the death of the individual in 1624, his will to use his fortune for the benefit of orphans, and the subsequent construction of the school for the purpose of their education and care links the hypothesis to the premise provided.  The inference that the school was built to educate orphans is drawn from explicit statements in the premise, making it logically sound. The hypothesis doesn’t alter or contradict the premise's intentions or specifications, remaining within the scope of the initial premise's information, leading us to conclude that the hypothesis is a direct entailment of the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Math Problem Solve -2*k + 813 - 833 = 0 for k.","output":"Let's solve this math problem step by step, like we're helping a 5-year-old understand it: 1. We have the equation -2 * k + 813 - 833 = 0. 2. First, let's add and subtract the numbers. We have 813 - 833 which is -20. So now our equation looks like -2 * k - 20 = 0. 3. We need to make the equation simple and find the value of k. To do that, let's start by getting rid of the -20 on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 20 to both sides, and it looks like this: -2 * k = 20. 4. Now we have -2 * k = 20, but we still need to find out what k is. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -2.     It will look like this: k = 20 / -2. 5. We solve for k: 20 divided by -2 is -10. So k = -10. And that's it! We found k, and it's -10."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few \\"throwaway\\" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny. And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons. To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. And, if you don't like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"No, these questions are not the same. They are related in that they both concern Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting, the Mona Lisa, but they are asking different things.  The first question, \\"Why did Leonardo da Vinci paint the Mona Lisa?\\" is asking about the artist's motives and circumstances that led him to create this particular artwork. It calls for an exploration of historical context, biographical details about the artist, and perhaps some interpretation of the work itself. There could be multiple answers to this question, as it's often difficult to fully know an artist's intentions—particularly for an artist like da Vinci who lived centuries ago. There are several theories as to why Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa. One is that it was a commission from a wealthy patron, which was a common way for artists of the time to secure income. According to some historical records, the man who commissioned the painting was Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo - the husband of the lady we believe to have been depicted, Lisa Gherardini. Others suggest that da Vinci created the work for his own personal satisfaction and intellectual exploration. Da Vinci was known for his relentless curiosity and desire for knowledge, and it's possible he used the Mona Lisa as a means to explore and express ideas. The exact reasons why Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa are unknown and widely debated amongst historians and art enthusiasts. The second question, \\"Is the Mona Lisa overrated?\\" poses a judgment or assessment about the painting's status or value. It invites an examination of the painting's reputation, its impact and influence, and perhaps some consideration of personal taste or critical standards. The question could be interpreted in different ways. For example, one might argue that the Mona Lisa is \\"overrated\\" if they feel that its fame and acclaim outstrip its artistic merit, or if they believe that other works of art are more deserving of attention. However, others might defend the painting's reputation, citing its subtle techniques, its historical significance, its power to intrigue and mystify, or other factors.  Whether the Mona Lisa is overrated or not is a subjective matter, as opinions on art can vary greatly from person to person. Some people might feel that the painting is overrated because it is so well-known and ubiquitous, overshadowing many other significant works of art. Others might argue that the Mona Lisa is properly rated, given da Vinci's innovative techniques (such as the use of sfumato, or soft transitions between colors and tones), the skillful portrayal of the sitter's mysterious expression and delicate hands, and the painting's complex history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Things on the menu.\\"  In the end, comedian Kevin Nealon and his wife decided to name their son Gable. As in Clark Gable. They simply liked the sound of it, and most people will agree it's far better than Helsinki, 43rd Avenue or Never Ending Pasta Bowl.  This was 4Â½ years ago, but the former \\"Saturday Night Live\\" star still loves to talk about his son. In 2009, he even published a book about becoming a first-time dad called \\"Yes, You're Pregnant, But What About Me?\\"  \\"We finally got the pacifier away from him,\\" Nealon says of Gable. \\"And now we're potty training him. It would've been easier to get the pacifier away from him if we taught him how to pee on it.\\"  Nealon describes himself as a hands-on father but admits, \\"It's because I don't work that much.\\"  In that sense, he sort of sounds like his character, Doug Wilson, on Showtime's \\"Weeds,\\" a pot-smoking, former CPA-drifter with a pretty much nonexistent moral compass.

Sam has also had to have a mole removed. Despite getting the disease, Lucy still uses sunbeds. She said: 'I tried fake tan and it's just not the same' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Dangers of Sunbeds: A Tale of Twin Sisters and Their Battle with Skin Cancer Introduction Tanning has always been a fashionable statement for many, with people seeking out that perfect sun-kissed look. However, the desire for a bronzed appearance can come with serious health risks, especially when relying on artificial sources like sunbeds. UV radiation from sunbeds can lead to increased chances of skin cancer, as experienced by Lucy and Sam Simm, twin sisters from Morecambe. The Compelling Story of Twin Sisters Lucy and Sam Simm Lucy Simm, a 29-year-old from Morecambe, was diagnosed with skin cancer in her late twenties. She and her twin sister Sam started using sunbeds daily during their teenage years, aiming to achieve the perfect tan. Despite the cancer diagnosis, Lucy continues to use sunbeds, claiming that alternative methods such as fake tan just don't offer the same effect. Sam, Lucy's twin sister, has also faced skin cancer risks. She had a worrisome mole removed, which further highlights the potential dangers that they've exposed themselves to over the years. Yet, like Lucy, Sam persists in chasing that perfect glow using sunbeds.  Skin Cancer and Sunbeds: The Connection Sunbeds emit ultraviolet (UV) rays that stimulate the production of melanin in the skin, resulting in a darker skin tone. Although sunbeds may provide a convenient and quick solution for tanning, they come with an increased risk of skin cancer. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, people who use a sunbed before the age of 35 have a 75% increased risk of developing melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The case of Lucy and Sam Simm underlines the possible consequences of frequent sunbed use, with both sisters developing skin cancer at a young age. Yet, crucially, it also highlights the addictive nature of sunbeds. Despite being well aware of the significant risks associated with sunbeds, Lucy and Sam continue to prioritize their aesthetic desires over their health. Alternatives to Sunbeds While Lucy may argue that fake tanning does not provide the same effects as sunbeds, there are, in fact, several safe alternatives to achieve a golden tan without exposing oneself to harmful UV radiation. Some of these include: 1. Self-tanning lotions and sprays: These products contain dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an ingredient that temporarily darkens the outer skin layer. They are easy to apply, and most can last up to a week, offering a similar effect to sunbeds but without the risk of skin cancer. 2. Gradual-tanning moisturizers: Combining daily hydration with a touch of self-tanner, these moisturizers build up a subtle tan over time. They are perfect for those who want a more natural-looking tan throughout the year without resorting to sunbeds. 3. Spray tanning: A professional spray tan technician can customize the color to your preferred shade. It offers a natural-looking, streak-free result that can last up to 10 days. Conclusion As seen in the story of Lucy and Sam Simm, using sunbeds can come with severe consequences, including skin cancer. It's essential to raise awareness about the dangers associated with sunbed use and encourage healthier tanning alternatives. Taking care of one's skin and health should always come before achieving a temporary sun-kissed look. By swapping sunbeds for safer tanning methods, individuals can protect themselves from dangerous health risks and still achieve their desired glow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Surra (from the Marathi \\"sra\\", meaning the sound of heavy breathing through nostrils, of imitative origin) is a disease of vertebrate animals. The disease is caused by protozoan trypanosomes, specifically \\"Trypanosoma evansi\\", of several species which infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy which lead to weight loss and anemia. In some animals the disease is fatal unless treated.  - Trypanosomiasis or trypanosomosis is the name of several diseases in vertebrates caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosomes of the genus \\"Trypanosoma\\".  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions \\"assassin bug\\", \\"cone-nose bug\\", and \\"kissing bug\\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.  - A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases can be found in Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HOCCH(NH)CHSH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920.  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \\"T. cruzi\\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \\"kissing bugs\\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \\"vinchuca\\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \\"barbeiro\\" (the barber) in Brazil, \\"pito\\" in Colombia, \\"chinche\\" in Central America, and \\"chipo\\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \\"T. cruzi\\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox...  - A catalytic triad refers to the three amino acid residues that function together at the centre of the active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and -lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.  - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.  - Cysteine proteases, also known as thiol proteases, are enzymes that degrade proteins. These proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad.  - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\".  - Cruzipain is a cysteine protease expressed by Trypanosoma cruzi . It is classified under EC 3.4.22.51 .  - In organic chemistry, a thiol is an organosulfur compound that contains a carbon-bonded sulfhydryl or sulphydryl (CSH or RSH) group (where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent). Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is a portmanteau of \\"thion\\" + \\"alcohol,\\" with the first word deriving from Greek  (\\"theion\\") = \\"sulfur\\". The SH functional group itself is referred to as either a \\"thiol group\\" or a \\"sulfhydryl group\\".    What is the relationship between 'cruzipain' and 'enzyme'? A:","output":"Cruzipain and enzyme share a direct relationship since cruzipain is a type of enzyme. Enzymes, which are macromolecular biological catalysts, speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. Cruzipain is a specific type of these enzymes, known as a cysteine protease, derived from Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasitic species that causes Chagas disease in humans. The descriptor \\"cysteine protease\\" informs us about the basic characteristics and function of cruzipain. Proteases are enzymes that carry out proteolysis – the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides or single amino acids. The \\"cysteine\\" part of the name denotes the vital role this specific amino acid plays in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Within cruzipain, a cysteine residue is part of what’s known as a catalytic triad – a set of three coordinated amino acids that regulate the enzyme's activity. This cysteine is a nucleophile, which means it can donate an electron pair to form a covalent bond. The cysteine's thiol side chain can engage in an enzymatic reaction, acting as a nucleophile to initiate the proteolysis. Cruzipain's function is an excellent example of how enzymes perform critical roles in biological systems. In the case of Trypanosoma cruzi, cruzipain contributes to the pathogen's virulence, enabling it to invade host tissues. It is also implicated in the interruption of the host's immune response, contributing to the persistent infection typical of Chagas disease. Thus, the term \\"enzyme\\" is the broader category under which cruzipain falls. It explains cruzipain's biological role and hints at its chemical behavior, just as the word \\"vehicle\\" would tell you that a car is a mode of transport, without delving into specifics like the model or make of the car. Meanwhile, \\"cruzipain\\" is a more exact term, revealing not just the enzyme's function but also its origin, mechanism, and associated biological implications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Because Jennifer shops so much, she spends a lot of her money and sometimes borrows money to buy more things. When you borrow money, you have to pay it back later, and that is called debt. On the other hand, Mary doesn't shop as much, so she doesn't spend all her money and doesn't need to borrow any. That means she has less debt to pay back.

Draw a line and learn from it.\\" Numan's Old Firm debut was a 5-1 defeat away to Celtic, in 1998, and he can still recall the reaction of his team-mate Ian Ferguson in the dressing room afterwards. Rangers were top of the league at the time, under manager Dick Advocaat, and recovered to secure the domestic treble that season, but Numan says the aftermath of the Old Firm defeat made him realise what the game means to people and how to handle it. \\"Scott Wilson was sent off after 25 minutes and we knew it would be very difficult and we got hammered,\\" Numan said. \\"I still remember Ian Ferguson after the game, he gave us such a hard time, because we had a lot of new boys like myself, Giovanni van Bronckhorst. \\"He said, 'you don't have a clue what it means to get beat against Celtic'. I said, 'we lost 5-1 but we're still eight points ahead'. \\"He said, 'I don't care, I'd rather beat them four times a year than win the league'. \\"So it was good to have a discussion a day after about that. I realised what it really means when you play against Celtic and lose. It takes a couple of days to recover from it, because everywhere you go the people will talk to you about it, Rangers or Celtic supporters. \\"The most important thing is try to move on and focus on the game the following week. You lose 5-1 but there are so many more games to play and you don't know what Celtic will do in Europe. \\"That can take its toll - you're travelling, playing a lot of games and players can pick up injuries. Rangers can maybe take advantage of that.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Following Rangers' 5-1 loss to Celtic, former player Arthur Numan believes the team's next four fixtures, including away games to Aberdeen and Hearts, are crucial. Celtic, currently the reigning champions, are aiming for their sixth consecutive top-flight title. Numan highlights that Rangers have a decent squad with a mix of young and experienced players, but Celtic is stronger, and it takes time to compete at that level. He advises the team to forget the loss, learn from it, and focus on upcoming games, while acknowledging that playing against Celtic can be emotionally challenging. Numan suggests Rangers may be able to capitalize on Celtic's European commitments, which could stretch their resources and lead to injuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Tony Way played the character of Thomas Nashe in the 2011 film about the life of Edward de Vere, titled \\"Anonymous.\\" Directed by Roland Emmerich, \\"Anonymous\\" is a historical drama that delves into the controversial theory of Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, being the real author behind the works attributed to William Shakespeare. The film presents a fictionalized version of history, weaving together political intrigue, illicit romance, and creative conspiracy to explore the Shakespearean authorship question. Tony Way, an English actor and comedian, portrayed Thomas Nashe, a significant figure in Elizabethan literature. Nashe was a playwright, poet, and satirist known for his controversial and provocative works, making him a fitting character for the film's narrative. Some of his well-known works include \\"The Unfortunate Traveller,\\" \\"The Choice of Valentines,\\" and \\"Pierce Penniless.\\" Critics praised Way's performance for bringing a vivid and genuine presence to his character amid the film's intricate plot. \\"Anonymous\\" boasts an ensemble cast featuring Rhys Ifans as Edward de Vere, Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I, Joely Richardson as young Queen Elizabeth I, David Thewlis as William Cecil, and Rafe Spall as William Shakespeare. The film's complex story is set against the backdrop of the Elizabethan era, rich with opulent costumes, grand settings, and intricate power dynamics. The film explores the idea that Edward de Vere, a highly educated and well-traveled nobleman, was the true author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare. It suggests that de Vere's involvement in the political turmoil of the time, as well as his personal relationships with figures such as Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Southampton, provided many of the experiences and inspirations reflected in the legendary works. Despite its engaging premise and strong performances, \\"Anonymous\\" faced criticism for its historical fabrications and distortions. Many scholars and experts on Shakespeare's life maintain that there is no solid evidence supporting the theory that de Vere was the actual author. However, the movie's thought-provoking exploration of the authorship question and the captivating performances from its cast, including Tony Way's portrayal of Thomas Nashe, have ensured its place as an intriguing and provocative entry in the realm of cinematic historical dramas."},{"instruction":"Q:FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of person who in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"? is inside the article: By the summer of 1906, Mahler had been director of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his..., can you guess it ?

More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern Nigeria in April by Boko Haram, in an act that drew international condemnation. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing.

White Lies is a story about the nature of identity: those who deny it and those who strive to protect it. Paraiti is a medicine woman. She is the healer and midwife of her rural, tribal people - she believes in life. But new laws are in force prohibiting unlicensed healers. On a rare trip to the city, she is approached by Maraea, the servant of a wealthy woman, Rebecca, who seeks her knowledge and assistance in order to hide a secret which could destroy Rebecca's position in European settler society. If the secret is uncovered a life may be lost, but hiding it may also have fatal consequences. So Paraiti, Maraea and Rebecca become players in a head on clash of beliefs, deception and ultimate salvation.In the Extras of the DVD, Witi Ihimaera, tells how his mother took him to Paraiti, a tohunga/healer who cured him of a breathing problem.

Article: There have been discussions about retire age limit recently. Does it make sense to make people retire at a particular age, say, 55? 60? Some people work well into their 70s and 80s, running families, countries or corporations while other people, despite being fit and highly talented, are forced to retire in their fifties or even earlier. Here I will examine whether people should be allowed to continue working as long as they want or whether they should be encouraged to retire at a particular stage. Some people think there are several reasons for allowing older people to continue working. Firstly, older employees are more experienced and their knowledge can be lost to his company or business if they are made to retire. Secondly, older employees are often extremely loyal and more willing to carry out company policies than younger staff. Another point is related to our society's attitudes to the old. To force someone to retire at 50 or 60 indicates that the society does not value the contribution of these people, which may be regarded as age discrimination. However, others believe that allowing older people to work indefinitely  is not a good policy. Age alone is no guarantee of ability. Old people are ambitious workaholics. Many young employees are more skillful than older staff, who may have been stuck in one area or unit for most of their working lives. _ . In addition, without age limits, many people would continue to work purely because they did not have any other plans. Another reason is that older people should be rewarded by society for their life's labor by being given generous pensions and the freedom to enjoy their leisure. We now have youngsters who can't find jobs because old people refuse to retire. This new generation of \\"old people\\" may think they will never die due to modern advances in medicine. With many young people unemployed or frustrated in low-level positions, older workers are expected to retire. However, this can affect their right to work. I feel that giving workers more flexibility...

The first sentence is distinct in terms of scenario and objects involved. It describes a scene where men are on a hill and they have a giant white ball with them. There's no assertion or implication about what they're doing with the ball or any other activities they're involved in. 2. The second sentence talks about a different scenario where men are flying kites but this time it's on a mountaintop not hill, which can mean different geographical features. The action of men (i.e., flying kites) mentioned in the second sentence is not implied anywhere in the first sentence. 3. To make a logical implication, the first statement (the premise) must provide enough information that could certainly lead us to the second statement (the conclusion). In this case, the first sentence gives no information about men flying kites on a mountaintop. So, based on the information given previously, we can't derive logically the second statement from the first one. Therefore, it does not logically follow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: who attempts to reach the gold? Movie title: The Italian Job Movie plot: John Bridger, a professional safecracker, has assembled a team to steal 35 million dollars worth of gold bullion from a safe held by Italian gangsters in Venice that had stolen it weeks earlier. The team includes Charlie Croker, a professional thief; Lyle, or Napster, a computer expert; Handsome Rob, their wheelman; Steve, their inside man; and Left Ear, their explosives expert. They successfully complete the theft by stealing the actual safe and stealing the gold from it after the safe lands underwater while the gangsters are occupied with a decoy led by Rob and Napster. After leaving the city, the team agrees to split up the gold and part ways once they return to the United States. However, Steve turns on them: in the Alps near Austrian border, he and his own men intercept their van on a bridge and take the gold. When John confronts him, Steve kills him. Rob drives the van into the lake off a bridge, where they keep themselves alive using oxygen tanks from the heist. Steve assumes they are dead and leaves with the gold. A year later, Charlie and the others have returned to the States and have located Steve under his new false identity, changing his last name to Frizelli, moving to Los Angeles and laundering the gold for money. Charlie goes to Philadelphia and meets with Stella Bridger, John's estranged daughter and also a skilled private safecracker working for the police, who is furious with him, believing that Charlie was responsible for the death of her father, but Charlie instead convinces her to help get revenge on Steve by helping with the heist to steal back the gold. The group monitor Steve's expensive mansion in Los Angeles, identifying the various security details. Charlie gets in contact with an associate, Skinny Pete, to obtain explosives for Left Ear, to blow the mansion gates, and Rob obtains three heavily modified Mini Coopers and calls in his friend Wrench, a car mechanic, to modify them so that they will be able to drive through the mansion and carry the gold out. Charlie guides Stella,...

Her aunt (by marriage we are left to presume) is trying to track down her long lost family in Europe. All they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box. The researcher heads to Europe and conducts her search in places like Milan, Budapest, and Vienna. The scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location (unlike a Murder, She Wrote where Jessica is supposed to be visiting a far-flung locale and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys. The dialogue, particularly the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that I stayed on just to see if it would get worse. It did.

Select from: (I) Dogs will be optimistic as long as they are left alone. (II) Dogs must be in a permanent bad mood when their owners left. (III) Dogs that express anxiety don't need treatment. (IV) Dogs may easily show their pessimistic outlook in learning ability. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Dogs can be worried and pessimistic just like people, researchers report in a new study in Current Biology. And they aren't talking about basset hounds  : those dogs just look as if they expect the worst. What the scientists say is that dogs that exhibit anxiety when left home alone by their owners may have bigger problems -- they may be in a permanent bad mood. This pessimistic outlook may not otherwise be easily apparent in a dog's other characteristics, like running speed or learning ability, the study reports. Dogs are similar to humans in the role that emotional state plays in decision making, said Michael Mendel, a veterinary scientist at the University of Bristol and the study's lead author. The study's researchers looked at 24 dogs in shelters in Britain. They placed the dogs in isolated settings and observed their reactions -- many barked, jumped on furniture and scratched at the door. Then they placed bowls in two rooms. One bowl contained food, while another was empty. After training the dogs to understand that bowls can sometimes be empty, and sometimes full, they began to place bowls in ambiguous locations. Dogs that quickly raced to the locations were more optimistic, and in search of food. Those that did not were deemed pessimistic. The more separation anxiety a dog expressed while in isolation, the more likely the dog was to have a pessimistic reaction, the researchers found. The study carries an important message for dog owners, Dr. Mendel said. Dogs that express serious anxiety when alone may need treatment, as it could be a sign of unhappiness and instability. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: A:","output":"From the passage, we can learn that dogs can experience emotions like worry and pessimism, similar to humans. The study found that dogs that exhibit anxiety when left alone by their owners may be in a permanent bad mood, indicating a pessimistic outlook. This emotional state might not be easily discernible through other characteristics such as running speed or learning ability. Emotional state plays a role in decision making for both dogs and humans, as illustrated by the way dogs reacted to food bowls placed in ambiguous locations in the study. The researchers observed that dogs who had higher levels of separation anxiety were more likely to show pessimistic reactions. These findings suggest that dogs experiencing significant anxiety while left alone may require treatment, as severe anxiety can indicate unhappiness and instability in dogs. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing the emotional well-being of our canine companions, as their emotions can impact not only their mental health but also their decision-making process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Last weekend, my partner and I had the opportunity to celebrate our anniversary at The Enchanted Bistro, and I must say, it was an absolutely remarkable experience. Words cannot fully express our gratitude to the staff and the entire team at The Enchanted Bistro for making our evening truly magical. From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were warmly greeted by the host who led us to our reserved table adorned with a sweet touch of rose petals and candlelight. It was evident from the beginning that attention to detail and providing a memorable experience were at the forefront of their priorities. The Enchanted Bistro's enchanting ambiance, coupled with soft instrumental music playing in the background, created the perfect atmosphere for a romantic and delightful evening. It's hard to find such alluring settings in the city these days, and for that, we greatly appreciate the thoughtfulness put into the restaurant's design. Now, let's talk about the pièce de résistance - the food. From appetizers to dessert, each dish was an exquisite palate-pleasing creation. The chef artfully balances bold flavors with delicate touches and creates culinary masterpieces that tantalize your senses. We started our gastronomic journey with the Pear and Gorgonzola Bruschetta, which was a heavenly blend of crispy bread, tangy cheese, and sweet caramelized pears - simply divine. For our main courses, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass, while my partner chose the Filet Mignon. Both dishes were perfectly cooked, impeccably seasoned, and presented like works of art on the plate. The Chilean Sea Bass was incredibly tender and flaky, cooked in a delectable lemon butter sauce and served alongside a delightful sun-dried tomato couscous. The Filet Mignon was a carnivore's dream - perfectly seared, juicy, and accompanied by heavenly truffle mashed potatoes and crisp asparagus. Dessert was the proverbial cherry on top of our meal. Our waiter suggested the Chocolate Lava Cake, and it was truly a dessert lover's fantasy. With a warm, rich, and gooey chocolate center, it was a match made in heaven when paired with the cool, velvety vanilla ice cream served alongside it. Service throughout the evening was impeccable, as our waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about creating an extraordinary experience for their guests. They truly went above and beyond to make our anniversary celebration a night to remember. In conclusion, our experience at The Enchanted Bistro was truly unforgettable. The enchanting atmosphere, delectable cuisine, and outstanding service all contributed to a magical evening that we will cherish forever. I would highly recommend The Enchanted Bistro to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or simply indulge in exquisite dining. We cannot wait to return and explore even more of their culinary delights. Thank you, The Enchanted Bistro, for an exceptional experience and for making our anniversary remarkable and memorable.

What are the safety precautions on handling shotguns proposed by the NRA in Minnesota? What are the safety precautions on handling shotguns proposed by the NRA in Mississippi? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Possible answers:  (1). no.  (2). yes.","output":"The answer is (1). No. Though both of your questions concern the safety precautions on handling shotguns proposed by the NRA (National Rifle Association), they address two different states: Minnesota and Mississippi.  While the NRA provides general guidelines on the proper handling of firearms, including shotguns, on a national level, the specifics can vary based on individual state laws. Each state has its own regulations and considerations when it comes to firearms, so the NRA's recommendations in Minnesota might differ slightly or significantly from those in Mississippi because of state laws, local practices, or traditions. Furthermore, the implementation of these safety precautions may be impacted differently based on specific regional factors including climate, terrain, or specific hunting seasons unique to the state. When discussing safety precautions on handling shotguns for both states, it is important to refer to four fundamental rules proposed by the NRA for safe gun handling: 1. Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. 2. Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot. 3. Always keep the gun unloaded until ready to use. 4. Always be aware of your target and what's beyond it. However, it is recommended to research more thoroughly the particular safety precautions for each state as there might be slight differences in local rules and practices. These can include restrictions on who can own a firearm, how they must be stored, how they may be used, and even specific stipulations regarding hunting and shooting sports. In conclusion, while there is a lot of commonality in NRA's shotgun safety precautions, the elements nuanced by local regulations, practices, and state firearm laws mean that the NRA's proposed safety precautions for handling shotguns in Minnesota and Mississippi would not be exactly the same.

Ferdinand Magellan ( or ; Portuguese: Fernao de Magalhaes, IPA: [fir'naw di maga'yajS]; Spanish: Fernando de Magallanes, IPA: [fer'nando de maga'yanes]; c. 1480 - 27 April 1521) was a Portuguese explorer who organised the Spanish expedition to the East Indies from 1519 to 1522, resulting in the first circumnavigation of the Earth, completed by Juan Sebastian Elcano. Born into a Portuguese noble family in around 1480, Magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer and was eventually selected by King Charles I of Spain to search for a westward route to the Maluku Islands (the \\"Spice Islands\\"). Commanding a fleet of five vessels, he headed south through the Atlantic Ocean to Patagonia, passing through the Strait of Magellan into a body of water he named the \\"peaceful sea\\" (the modern Pacific Ocean). Magellan was born in northern Portugal in around 1480, either at Vila Nova de Gaia, near Porto, in Douro Litoral Province, or at Sabrosa, near Vila Real, in Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. He was the son of Rodrigo de Magalhaes, Alcaide-Mor of Aveiro (1433-1500, son of Pedro Afonso de Magalhaes and wife Quinta de Sousa) and wife Alda de Mesquita and brother of Leonor or Genebra de Magalhaes, wife with issue of Joao Fernandes Barbosa.  In March 1505 at the age of 25, Magellan enlisted in the fleet of 22 ships sent to host D. Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of Portuguese India. Although his name does not appear in the chronicles, it is known that he remained there eight years, in Goa, Cochin and Quilon. He participated in several battles, including the battle of Cannanore in 1506, where he was wounded. In 1509 he fought in the battle of Diu. He later sailed under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in the first Portuguese embassy to Malacca, with Francisco Serrao, his friend and possibly cousin. In September, after arriving at Malacca, the expedition fell victim to a conspiracy ending in retreat. Magellan had a crucial role, warning Sequeira and saving Francisco Serrao, who had landed.  In 1511, under the new governor Afonso de Albuquerque, Magellan and Serrao participated in the conquest of Malacca. After the conquest their ways parted: Magellan was promoted, with a rich plunder and, in the company of a Malay he had indentured and baptized Enrique of Malacca, he returned to Portugal in 1512. Serrao departed in the first expedition sent to find the \\"Spice Islands\\" in the Moluccas, where he remained. He married a woman from Amboina and became a military advisor to the Sultan of Ternate, Bayan Sirrullah. His letters to Magellan would prove decisive, giving information about the spice-producing territories.  After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in Morocco, he was wounded, resulting in a permanent limp. He was accused of trading illegally with the Moors. The accusations were proved false, but he received no further offers of employment after 15 May 1514. Later on in 1515, he got an employment offer as a crew member on a Portuguese ship, but rejected this. In 1517 after a quarrel with King Manuel I, who denied his persistent demands to lead an expedition to reach the spice islands from the east (i.e., while sailing westwards, seeking to avoid the need to sail around the tip of Africa), he left for Spain.

Since the highly anticipated return of the popular series Arrested Development, fans have been buzzing about one particular detail: Portia de Rossi's seemingly altered appearance. As viewers eagerly tuned in to watch the latest episodes, they couldn't help but notice that de Rossi's character, Lindsay, looks strikingly different, sparking widespread speculation about possible cosmetic procedures. However, despite the rumors, there has been no official statement from the actress herself about having undergone any sort of plastic surgery. Instead, some clues may lie in a recent interview de Rossi gave to People magazine. The 40-year-old actress mentioned that she has been following a vegan diet for the past five years, leading her to believe this change has contributed to her youthful appearance. In addition, she also stated, \\"People do think I look younger than I am because I dress like a teenager.\\" For those still skeptical, an anonymous source close to de Rossi spoke to E! News, firmly denying any plastic surgery rumors. The source revealed, \\"She's absolutely not had plastic surgery. Her character is clearly wearing a wig, which ended up altering her entire look.\\" Another interesting theory surfaced through TV Guide's Liz Raftery, who suggested that the noticeable change in de Rossi's appearance may have been an intentional joke introduced by the show's creators. Raftery explained, \\"Some fans speculate that the jarring difference may have been intentional, to imply that the vain and self-absorbed Lindsay had a botched plastic surgery between Seasons 3 and 4.\\" So, is Portia de Rossi's changed appearance a result of her vegan diet, a creative wardrobe choice, or just a well-played joke by the series' writers? Although the mystery remains unsolved for now, the intrigue surrounding de Rossi's transformation has certainly added another layer of excitement to the already beloved Arrested Development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It was first released on 12 January 1969 in the United States and on 31 March 1969 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records. Featuring integral contributions from each of the group's four members, the album was recorded in October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London, and established their fusion style of both blues and rock music. It also attracted a large and devoted following to the band; Zeppelin's take on the emerging hard rock sound endeared them to parts of the counterculture on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In a 1990 interview, Page said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill. One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin's tour of Scandinavia in September 1968. As Page explained, \\"[the band] had begun developing the arrangements on the Scandinavian tour and I knew what sound I was looking for. It just came together incredibly quickly.\\"  In addition, since the band had not yet signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant paid for the sessions entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: \\"I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because I knew exactly what I wanted to do with these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ... It wasn't your typical story where you get an advance to make an album - we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic's reaction was very positive - I mean they signed us, didn't they?\\"  The group reportedly recorded their songs for PS1,782. Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis noted that \\"[w]ith the possible exception of the 12 hours that the Beatles took to record their first album at Abbey Road, rarely has studio time been used so economically. Led Zeppelin's debut album went on to gross more than PS3.5 million, just short of 2,000 times more than they invested!\\"  For the recordings, Page played a psychedelically painted Fender Telecaster, a gift from Jeff Beck after Page recommended his boyhood friend to the Yardbirds in 1965 as a potential replacement for Eric Clapton on lead guitar. This was a different guitar from those he favoured for later albums (most notably a Gibson Les Paul). Page played the Telecaster through a Supro amplifier. He also used a Gibson J-200, borrowed from Big Jim Sullivan, for the album's acoustic tracks. For \\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\\" he used an out-of-tune Fender 10-string steel guitar.  Two other songs from the sessions, \\"Baby Come on Home\\" and \\"Sugar Mama\\" both appeared on the 2015 Coda reissue (although \\"Baby Come on Home\\" was first released on the 1993 compilation Boxed Set 2.)Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why did it only take 36 hours?","output":"The album only took 36 hours of studio time to create because \\"the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin's tour of Scandinavia in September 1968.\\" As Page explained, \\"[the band] had begun developing the arrangements on the Scandinavian tour and I knew what sound I was looking for.

Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Answer:","output":"Kim studied less about wolves.

A scene may be shot from several camera angles simultaneously. This will give a different experience and sometimes emotion. The different camera angles will have different effects on the viewer and how they perceive the scene that is shot. There are a few different routes that a camera operator could take to achieve this effect. The typical shot measurements unit is the milliframe. Milliframes are used to calculate how much the shot should be moved to perfect the camera angles. One milliframe (mF) equals about .328cm (0.129 inches). However, the exact size of a milliframe is almost impossible to calculate since it is not a physical measurement.   - Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and microstate, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe.

As the investigation into the incident continues and further information comes to light, authorities are looking into the possibility of triple murder charges against those responsible for the explosion, which led to the death of 27-year-old Chris Noble and 31-year-old Bianka O'Brien, as well as her one-year-old son Jude. Adeel Khan, owner of the convenience store, denies any responsibility for the events that took place on that fateful day and has since been moved from intensive care to a regular hospital ward due to his injuries from the blast. With police now finding traces of an accelerant at the site, the investigation has taken a darker turn as they piece together the puzzle of what happened at the Rozelle convenience store. In the tight-knit community of Rozelle, the heartbreak stemming from the terrible event has left residents mourning the loss of the three individuals whose lives were tragically cut short. The heroic actions of Chris Noble, who managed to send a desperate text to his mother warning her of the danger he was in, paint a picture of bravery amid the chaos. His body was later recovered from the debris at the flame-engulfed site. On the other hand, the tragic loss of Bianka O'Brien, a loving wife, and her one-year-old son Jude, sent shockwaves through the close-knit community, where they were well-loved by friends and neighbors. With the investigation now suggesting that these innocent lives were taken deliberately, there is a sense of determination among investigators to bring those responsible to justice. The Rozelle explosion serves as a sobering reminder of the unpredictable ways that everyday life can be transformed by tragedy. As the community grieves, mourns, and stands united in support of the deceased and their loved ones, it is clear that the pain caused by this senseless act will linger for years to come. With the current state of the investigation, the possibility of a triple murder case being brought against those involved in igniting the blaze in the Rozelle convenience store has profound implications. Adeel Khan, the owner of the store who now denies responsibility, may be facing charges if the evidence points to his involvement. The police are diligently working to piece together all the available evidence, including the significant discovery of an accelerant found at the scene of the tragedy. This new information strengthens the possibility of a premeditated act designed to cause the explosion, and investigators are determined to leave no stone unturned in their pursuit of the truth. Although the investigation has made significant progress, there are still many unanswered questions, which only serve to heighten the community's grief, frustration, and anxiety in the wake of the Rozelle tragedy. As investigators press on in the face of this devastating event, the hope of finding closure and justice for the victims and their families hangs in the balance. The answers may be closer than we think, but as the community struggles to cope with the enormity of the tragedy, the path ahead will be fraught with pain and countless challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which comedian starred in the 1961 film 'The Rebel'?","output":"The comedian who starred in the 1961 film 'The Rebel' was Tony Hancock, an English actor and comedian who made a significant impact on British comedy and entertainment. Born on May 12, 1924, in Birmingham, England, Anthony John Hancock was widely known for his unique wit and comedic timing, making him one of the distinguished figures of British comedy history. Before carving out his career in film, Tony Hancock had already established himself as a successful radio and television comedian, predominantly known for his work on the popular BBC radio and television series 'Hancock's Half Hour.' The show ran between 1954 and 1961 and was created by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, two highly acclaimed British comedy writers. With a mix of situational comedy, satire, and observational humor, 'Hancock's Half Hour' presented the character of Tony Hancock as a perpetually frustrated and disillusioned individual, struggling to navigate the complexities of everyday life. In 1961, Tony Hancock made the transition to the silver screen, appearing as the lead character in 'The Rebel.' The film was directed by Robert Day and, once again, written by the talented duo of Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. In 'The Rebel,' Hancock stars as Anthony Hancock - a dissatisfied, bored, white-collar office worker, residing in London, who decides to pursue a career as a full-time artist. Convinced of his own artistic genius, he abandons his job and relocates to Paris, immersing himself in the world of bohemian culture and modern art while grappling with challenges, misunderstandings, and numerous absurd situations. The film delves into the themes of reinvention and self-discovery, with Tony Hancock's portrayal of the protagonist resonating significantly with the audience. Hancock's performance in 'The Rebel' showcases his unique comedic timing, nuanced acting, and unmistakable charisma, thereby solidifying his status as one of the all-time great British comedians. Despite having a successful career that spanned radio, television, and cinema, Tony Hancock struggled with his personal demons, battling substance abuse and depression, which eventually culminated in his untimely death in 1968. Regardless, his work in 'The Rebel' and in British comedy as a whole, has left a lasting legacy and influence, which continues to be felt and celebrated decades later."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Tragic Loss of a Young Life: Police Investigate the Death of a 14-Year-Old Girl and Hospitalization of Two Teenagers Introduction A tight-knit community was struck by tragedy this week. A young life was tragically cut short when a 14-year-old girl passed away, leaving behind a neighborhood in shock. Two other teenagers were also taken to the hospital after falling ill, causing further distress to the already-grieving community. A police investigation is currently under way, and the authorities are working relentlessly to uncover the details behind the heartbreaking incident. A Community in Mourning In the wake of the tragic loss, the community has come together to honor the memory of the young girl and support her grieving family. Neighbors, friends, and even strangers have taken it upon themselves to show that they stand with those most affected by this devastating event. From setting up memorial sites filled with flowers and heartfelt messages to organizing fundraisers for the family's expenses, the outpouring of love has been remarkable. The Unexpected Incident Reports indicate that the 14-year-old girl was found unresponsive in her home by family members. Emergency services were immediately called, but despite their best efforts, they were unable to save the young girl's life. The exact cause of her death remains uncertain, pending the results of an autopsy. The two other teenagers, believed to be friends of the deceased, were also found in the household and had reportedly fallen ill. They were quickly transported to a nearby hospital for medical attention, with their conditions currently unknown but monitored closely by medical professionals. The Police Investigation As the community mourns the unparalleled tragedy, local law enforcement has launched an investigation into the incident. Authorities are working meticulously to piece together the events that unfolded, interviewing family members, friends, and neighbors to gather crucial information that might shed light on the cause of the girl's death as well as the illness affecting the other teenagers. In a statement to the media, a spokesperson for the police department explained that they are exploring all possible angles and conducting a thorough investigation, emphasizing that no stone will be left unturned. The spokesperson also requested that the grieving family and community be given the respect, space, and privacy they need during this unbearably difficult time. Moving Forward Together While the search for answers continues and the community grapples with immense grief, it is evident that the love and support shown towards the family of the young girl are unwavering. As the community navigates its way through this dark chapter, the strength, unity, and compassion of its people shine through, proving that in times of sorrow, the power of a close-knit community can transcend the most devastating of circumstances. Conclusion As the police investigation unfolds, the community anxiously awaits the answers that will hopefully bring them a sense of closure and understanding. However, what remains clear is that the memory of the young girl, with her vibrant spirit, will forever be etched in the hearts of those who knew her, and her legacy will live on through the love, support, and unity of her community.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: What's in a name? Well, apparently, our general happiness. Psychologists say that what we are called has a direct connection with our well-being  .       Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality becomes shaped to fit it. Dr David Holmes said, \\"This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name. For example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.\\"      Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet.

His wife accompanies him. On the island, a local, Mario Ruoppolo, is dissatisfied with being a fisherman, like his father. Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail (the island has no cars). Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry. Meanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works in her aunt's village cafe. He is shy with her, but he enlists Neruda's help. Mario constantly asks Neruda if particular metaphors that he uses are suitable for his poems. Mario is able to better communicate with Beatrice and express his love through poetry. Despite the aunt's strong disapproval of Mario, because of his sensual poetry (which turns out to be largely stolen from Neruda), Beatrice responds favourably. The two are married. The priest refuses to allow Mario to have Neruda as his best man because of politics; however, this is soon resolved. This was because Di Cosimo was the politician in office in the area with the Christian Democrats. At the wedding, Neruda receives the welcome news that there is no longer a Chilean warrant for his arrest so he returns to Chile. Mario writes a letter but never gets any reply.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What can fire do to a sapwood?\\"  Context: \\"It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Fire can have a significant impact on the sapwood of a tree, which is the outer layer of the tree's xylem, responsible for transporting water and nutrients throughout the tree. This living and functional portion of the tree is younger, softer, and more vulnerable to various factors compared to the older, stronger, non-living heartwood at the center. Given the context provided, we can analyze the various ways in which fire can affect sapwood. 1. Thermal damage: When exposed to fire, sapwood can suffer direct thermal damage. This may cause the cells to die, compromising the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients, which can eventually lead to the decline and death of the tree. The extent of this damage depends on the fire's intensity and the duration of exposure. 2. Physical wounds: Fire can cause deep wounds in the sapwood due to the burning and charring of the outer surface. These wounds expose the inner tissues to various elements, such as diseases, insects, and decay-causing fungi. If not managed or healed by the tree's natural defenses, these wounds can become entry points for pathogens that may spread throughout the tree, causing structural weaknesses and potentially leading to its death. 3. Exacerbation of existing weaknesses: The presence of existing weaknesses, such as insect tunnels or cracks in the sapwood, can be worsened by fire exposure. Fire might lead to the expansion of existing tunnels or cracks, which makes the sapwood even less structurally sound and more prone to decay, insect infestation, or even failure under stress. 4. Changes in microhabitat: Fire can cause alterations in the microhabitat of the tree, such as changes in temperature, humidity, and light exposure. These variations can influence the tree's defense mechanisms, making it more susceptible to attacks from insects, disease, or decay, particularly in the sapwood, which is the most vital living part of the tree for survival and growth. 5. Stress responses: Trees often exhibit complex physiological stress responses after fire exposure, such as changes in growth patterns, water uptake, and nutrient allocation. These stress responses may contribute to reduced sapwood functionality and increased susceptibility to decay and infestation by microorganisms and insects. 6. Regenerative capacity: Depending on the severity of the fire, a tree may lose some or all of its outer protective bark, which exposes the sapwood underneath. The ability of the tree to regenerate bark and heal the damaged sapwood area may be limited after a fire, making it more vulnerable to decay and further damage. In conclusion, fire can have profound and lasting effects on the sapwood of a tree. The resulting damage may include thermal injury, physical wounds, exacerbation of existing weaknesses, changes in microhabitat, stress responses, and impaired regenerative capacity. These factors can significantly compromise the tree's structural integrity and overall health, potentially leading to decay, infestation, and, in severe cases, death."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the quiz \\"what gets contracted when fibers get shorter?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"muscle contraction occurs when muscle fibers get shorter\\" and \\"muscles in the upper arm called biceps are used to flex the arm\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the quiz question \\"what gets contracted when fibers get shorter?\\" would be \\"muscle contraction\\" or more specifically, \\"biceps contraction.\\" Muscle contraction occurs when muscle fibers get shorter, as explained by the teacher. These contractions are the result of interactions between myosin and actin, two proteins found in muscle fibers. When a muscle contracts, the myosin protein moves along the actin filaments, pulling the ends of the muscle fibers closer together. This movement reduces the overall length of the muscle fiber, causing the muscle to contract or flex. The second hint given by the teacher revolves around the specific example of the upper arm muscles called the biceps. The biceps muscle is primarily responsible for flexing the arm at the elbow. This movement is a result of the biceps contraction, which allows for the bending of the arm. The biceps muscle has two heads - the long head and the short head, both of which work together during contraction to achieve effective arm flexion. To summarize, when muscle fibers in the biceps get shorter, it results in the contraction of the biceps muscle. This contraction is what allows the upper arm to flex, bend, or perform other movements. Thus, the best answer to the question is muscle contraction with a focus on biceps contraction in this given context."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt. Alexander, is ordered to Mobile, Alabama, and a young soldier who had been volunteering to join the crew is allowed to do so.  Guess a valid title for it!

Options: - toy store - basement - school - rest area - building  Explain why a human would choose \\"rest area\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"rest area\\" as the most suitable answer to the question above because of the following reasons: 1. Availability of Electrical Outlets: Rest areas are specifically designed to cater to the needs of travelers with recreational vehicles (RVs) and those seeking a temporary stop during their road trips. These facilities are equipped with electrical outlets to provide power for RVs, enabling people like John to use electricity for appliances like stoves and microwaves to cook their meals. 2. Convenience: Rest areas are strategically located along highways and major travel routes, providing easy access for people who are on long drives or road trips. They offer a convenient place for RV owners like John to stop, park their vehicles, and recharge both physically and electrically in a safe, designated space. 3. Amenities: Rest areas typically provide a range of amenities necessary to make travelers' journeys more comfortable. These may include restrooms, picnic areas, water supply, vending machines, and even on-site staff for assistance. In this way, choosing a rest area for John to plug in his RV not only provides him with electricity but also access to essential services. 4. Safety and Security: Being purpose-built and authorized spaces managed by government or private organizations, rest areas provide a secure and controlled environment for RV users. This ensures that John can plug in his RV with the peace of mind that he is in a safe and monitored location. 5. Social Interaction: Rest areas serve as hubs where travelers, including RV owners, can converse, share experiences, and offer each other advice or assistance. John may choose to plug in his RV at a rest area to benefit not only from the services provided but also to engage in social interactions with fellow travelers. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"rest area\\" as the appropriate choice for John's RV to obtain electricity for cooking lunch because rest areas are specifically designed to cater to the needs of travelers with RVs, providing them with access to electricity, convenience, amenities, safety, and social interaction opportunities. Other options like a toy store, basement, school, or building do not have the same level of accessibility or infrastructure needed to support the needs of an RV user like John and are not primarily intended for this purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: For a clearer picture of what the student knows, most teachers use another kind of examination in addition to objective tests. They use \\"essay\\" tests, which require students to write long answers to broad, general questions such as the following: \\"Mention several ways in which Benjamin Franklin has influenced thinking of people in his own country and in other parts of the world.\\" One advantage of the essay test is that it reduces the element of luck. The student cannot get a high score just by making a lucky guess. Another advantage is that it shows the examiner more cares about the student's ability to put facts together into a meaningful whole. It should show how deeply he has thought about the subject. Sometimes, though, essay tests have disadvantages, too. Some students are able to write rather good answers without really knowing much about the subject, while other students who actually know the material have trouble expressing their ideas in the essay form. Besides, in an essay test the student's score may depend upon the examiner's feelings at the time of reading the answer. If he is feeling tired or bored, the student may receive a lower score than he should. Another examiner reading the same answer might give it a much higher mark. Because of _ , the objective test gives each student a fairer chance, and of course it is easier and quicker to score. Whether an objective test or an essay test is used, problems arise. When some objective questions are used along with some essay questions, however, a fairly clear picture of the student's knowledge can usually be gotten.

Choose from: (a). unacceptable; (b). acceptable;","output":"The test sentence you provided, \\"The well gushed oil,\\" is indeed a correct grammatical English sentence. This makes the answer to your question: (b). acceptable.  To offer a detailed and long explanation, let's analyze the sentence structure and grammar: 1. The sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure in English. In this case, \\"The well\\" is the subject, \\"gushed\\" is the verb, and \\"oil\\" is the object. The SVO structure is natural and familiar to English speakers, contributing to the sentence's acceptability. 2. The subject of the sentence, \\"The well,\\" is a noun phrase that consists of a definite article \\"the\\" and a common noun \\"well.\\" This combination is grammatically correct in English, as the definite article accurately refers to the specific well being discussed. 3. The verb in the sentence, \\"gushed,\\" is a transitive verb that requires an object to make the sentence complete. In this case, the verb is paired with the appropriate object, \\"oil,\\" creating a sensible and grammatical combination. 4. The object, \\"oil,\\" is a common, uncountable noun. It accurately receives the action of the verb \\"gushed\\" and makes logical sense within the context of the subject (the well) gushing oil. Since it's uncountable, there's no need for an article, making it grammatically correct. 5. The sentence is concise and contains no superfluous words; each word is necessary for the meaning and grammaticality of the sentence.

Given the question: Given the below context:  In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed.  Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films.  Guess a valid title for it!

As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more.

Today, we are going to learn how to make a special tea using rose petals. Roses are not just pretty to look at, but they can also make a tasty and healthy drink. Plus, it will make you feel like a magical nature chef. Are you ready? Let's start! Step 1: Choose the right rose petals First, we need to find the best rose petals for our tea. If you have roses in your garden, you can use those, but make sure they haven't been sprayed with any bad chemicals called \\"pesticides.\\" Pesticides are used to keep bugs away, but they can also be harmful to us if we drink them in our tea. So be sure to ask an adult to help you find pesticide-free petals. You will need 1 to 2 cups of rose petals for this recipe. Step 2: Prepare the pot After you have collected your rose petals, grab a saucepan from your kitchen. A saucepan is a small, round pot with a handle, just like the one you use when cooking with your mom or dad. Fill the saucepan with 3 cups of water—that's like filling a big cup 3 times!  Step 3: Add the rose petals Now, gently place your rose petals into the saucepan with the water. Make sure they're all nice and cozy in there! Step 4: Boil the rose petal tea We are almost done, little chef! Ask your mom or dad to help you boil the water and rose petals on the stove. This means they will turn the heat on so the water gets hot and starts bubbling. You need to be patient and boil the tea for five minutes. Step 5: Sweeten and enjoye After the tea is boiled, it's time to do the final step. If you like your tea sweet like candy, you can add some honey. Honey is a yummy, sticky, golden liquid made by bees. Or, if you like the natural taste of rose petals, you can enjoy it without adding anything else. And there you have it, little nature chef! You just made your very own rose petal tea. Now, you can share this magical drink with your family and friends. They'll be so impressed by your cooking skills!

An oxygen molecule consists of two oxygen atoms. This means it is composed of a diatomic molecule, which consists of two atoms of the same element. 2. Each of the atoms in an oxygen molecule shares a pair of valence electrons. This sharing of electrons creates a covalent bond, and since the electrons are shared equally, these are nonpolar covalent bonds. 3. There are two types of covalent bonds: polar, where electrons are shared unequally, and nonpolar, where the electrons are shared equally. In an oxygen (O2) molecule, the atoms share electrons equally, making the bonds nonpolar. 4. In an oxygen molecule, each oxygen atom needs two additional electrons to complete its outer shell. Therefore, each oxygen atom shares two electrons with the other, resulting in two covalent bonds. 5. A double covalent bond is formed between the two oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule.

Washington (CNN) -- State visits to the White House are full of show and symbolism, and Tuesday's visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is no exception. But Singh's visit, the first state visit hosted by the Obama administration, reflects India's growing political and economic importance to the United States and the deepening partnership between Washington and New Delhi. The 2005 civil nuclear cooperation deal between the two countries symbolized a new status in U.S.-India relations. But that deal, yet to be ratified by the Indian parliament, was not in a vacuum. The Bush administration followed that up with agreements for increased cooperation on security, science and technology and education. The relationship is not without its irritants, however, the biggest one being India's nuclear neighbor,","output":"Pakistan. Tensions between India and Pakistan have long been a source of concern for the US, as they strive to maintain stability in the region. The two nations have fought multiple wars and skirmishes over the years, mainly due to disputes over the Kashmir region. The US has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to diffuse tensions between the two nuclear-armed powers, understanding that any full-scale conflict risks impacting the broader South Asian region and beyond. Another point of contention in the US-India relationship is the issue of trade. While trade between the two nations has grown significantly over the past few years, reaching nearly 160 billion in 2019, there have been disagreements on matters such as tariffs and intellectual property rights. Both countries have occasionally imposed new trade barriers on each other's products, displaying their occasional friction in the economic sphere. Despite these challenges, the leaders of the two countries have worked to strengthen their strategic partnership. High-level meetings, such as the one between President Obama and Prime Minister Singh, demonstrate the commitment on both sides to engage and collaborate on various issues, including defense, counter-terrorism, and climate change. The US and India also conduct joint military exercises to build ties and improve their interoperability on the battlefield. In conclusion, while the relationship between the US and India has its share of challenges, the overall trajectory points to a growing convergence of interests and deepening cooperation in various spheres. The first state visit by Prime Minister Singh to the Obama White House was an unmistakable sign of the importance the US places on fostering its ties with India, acknowledging its increasing clout on the world stage. As both countries continue to develop their strategic partnership, they will aim to overcome their differences and focus on shared objectives for mutual benefit and to ensure regional and global stability. It remains to be seen how this relationship will evolve amid geopolitical shifts and changing domestic political landscapes, but there is no denying the significant progress made in recent years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen.  Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily  (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom.  Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning.

The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: What does Wally Stevens think of fish farming?

Pavel Nedved (Czech pronunciation: ['pavel 'nedvjet] ( listen); born 30 August 1972) is a Czech retired footballer who played as a midfielder. Described as one of the best footballers of his generation, he is also regarded as one of the most successful players to emerge from the Czech Republic, winning domestic and European accolades with Italian clubs Lazio, including the last Cup Winners' Cup, and Juventus, whom he led to the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final. Nedved was a key member of the Czech team which reached the final of Euro 1996, during which he attracted international attention. He also captained the national team at UEFA Euro 2004, where they were defeated in the semi-final by eventual champions Greece, and Nedved was named as part of the Team of the Tournament. Nedved made his league debut for Lazio on 7 September 1996 in a 1-0 away defeat against Bologna. He scored his first league goal for the club against Cagliari on 20 October 1996, finishing the 1996-97 season with seven goals. He became an integral part of the side, scoring four goals in three matches early in the 1997-98 season. The club had a 24-match unbeaten streak from November 1997 to April 1998, ending with a league match against Juventus in which Nedved was sent off. That season, Lazio won the 1997-98 Coppa Italia and reached the final of the 1997-98 UEFA Cup. Nedved and Lazio began the 1998-99 season with a victory in the Supercoppa Italiana, Nedved scoring as the club defeated Juventus 2-1. He played a role in Lazio's road to the last-ever Cup Winners' Cup, scoring against Lausanne in the first round and in both legs of Lazio's 7-0 aggregate quarter-final victory over Panionios. In the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, Nedved scored the decisive goal against Mallorca for Lazio's 2-1 win. This proved to be the last goal of the tournament, which was later discontinued.  Nedved was one of the ten highest-paid footballers in the Italian league in 1999. He played in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup against Manchester United at the beginning of the season, where Lazio won the match by a single goal. The club went on to win the Serie A title and Coppa Italia, completing a domestic double in 2000 with Nedved's help. In 2000, he won the Supercoppa Italiana with Lazio for a second time. With Sinisa Mihajlovic, Nedved was one of two Lazio players sent off in the quarter-final of the 2000 Coppa Italia held in December, where the defending champions lost 5-3 on aggregate to Udinese.  Nedved played UEFA Champions League football with Lazio, scoring against Real Madrid in a 2-2 draw in the second group stage before the Italian side was eliminated. In Lazio's final Champions League match of the season, Nedved was criticised by Leeds United manager David O'Leary for a challenge on Alan Maybury (although the referee did not call a foul), and he received a three-match suspension from European competitions from UEFA.  Despite Nedved's signing a new four-year contract with Lazio in April 2001, the club tried to sell him and teammate Juan Sebastian Veron that summer, triggering fan protests against club chairman Sergio Cragnotti. The players were ultimately sold to Juventus and Manchester United respectively. Entity:","output":"Pavel Nedved"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hundreds of demonstrators cheered ecstatically when, after hours of mounting tensions, the outnumbered police were ordered to retreat rather than risk an escalating confrontation. The action was centered on Nathan Road in the volatile Mong Kok neighborhood, an area teeming with shops and neon signs where demonstrators had blocked streets with barriers and tents and had snarled traffic for nearly three weeks, demanding a democratic ballot for choosing Hong Kong’s next leader. The police moved in early Friday morning and swiftly reopened all but a small area to traffic. But by evening the move had backfired, drawing the biggest crowds in weeks to the area and forcing the police to deploy hundreds of officers, many of them in full riot gear with helmets, batons and shields. Three officers were injured in the clashes, one with an unspecified head injury, the police said in a statement. It was not known how many protesters were hurt. As they have several times recently, the police used pepper spray to help quell the crowds. Alex Wong, a bank worker in his 20s wearing a medical mask, goggles and towel on his head, said he had come to Mong Kok to show his anger at the police operation. “I’m very scared,” Mr. Wong said. “But I’m here to fight for the future of Hong Kong. The price of democracy and freedom is not cheap.” Like many other protesters, he said he did not trust established political parties and student groups to negotiate effectively with the government. “Mong Kok is more the true voice of Hong Kong citizens,” he said. Guidelines issued by China’s national legislature in late September effectively guarantee that only pro-Beijing candidates can appear on the ballot for chief executive, the top position in Hong Kong, in the elections scheduled for 2017. The protesters say those rules violate commitments Beijing made when Britain returned the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule. Before the last three weeks, clashes between police and angry crowds were uncommon in Hong Kong, one of the world’s richest cities. It has a reputation for stability and good governance, and is home to the Asia headquarters for scores of multinational corporations, law firms and banks. The 1997 agreement called for the city’s British-based legal system and civil liberties to be preserved for 50 years after the handover to China. The scene at Nathan Road on Friday turned into a churning confrontation between hundreds of masked protesters and the police, who stripped away the protesters’ umbrellas and struggled to contain flare-ups with the surging crowd. Nearby, on Argyle Street, the police struggled on Friday to contain crowds as they chanted “Open the road,” and “Cross the street.” Several young men were hauled away by the police, prompting roars of disapproval from the crowd. Several of the masked protesters said they had no intention of charging at the police but wanted to show their support for the Mong Kok protest, which was more diverse and raucous than the main sit-in outside the government’s headquarters in Admiralty, where students dominate. “I came here to be a witness if there is police violence,” said Mani, an office assistant who declined to give her surname. “We don’t want violence. Most of the police are not bad men, but we’ve seen the illegal things they have done.” Though many protesters in the crowd wore goggles and surgical masks, now customary protections against pepper spray, most appeared reluctant to challenge the police cordons. “I want to reoccupy Mong Kok,” said one goggled university student who gave only his first name, Simon. “This was supposed to be our road for occupy.”","output":"\\"Democracy Defiant: Hong Kong Protesters Reclaim Street after Police Clearance\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In a society where pressure to do well in school and find highly-paid jobs is intense, a former lawyer came up with an extreme relaxation idea. Kwon Yong-seok created the \\"Prison Inside Me\\"--a stress-reduction center with a punishment theme. People come here to cut themselves off from the outside world and pay to be kept in 60-square-foot (5.6-square-meter) cells  . Located on the outskirts of Hongcheon, about 58 miles (93 km) northeast of Seoul, \\"Prison Inside Me\\" came to life after Mr. Kwon voluntarily asked to spend time behind bars for \\"healing reasons,\\" but his request was turned down. \\"I didn't know how to stop working back then,\\" he said. \\"I felt like I was being swept away against my will, and it seemed I couldn't control my own life.\\" So, Kwon and his wife Roh Ji-hyang decided to take matters into their own hands, and designed and built a prison-like spiritual center. The construction was completed in June last year and cost about 2 billion won (19 million). The facility includes 28 cells, furnished with only a toilet, a sink and a small table, where guests can spend time alone, thinking about life and enjoying private thinking periods. Moreover, guests can also join group thinking periods in the hall, where they are given instructions on how to free themselves from what Mr. Kwon calls the \\"inner prison\\" to find inner peace. According to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of stressed South Koreans are checking in at the stress-reduction facility to think about their lives and regain control of it. A two-night stay at \\"Prison Inside Me\\" costs 150,000 won (146). Mr. Kwon and his wife explained that at the beginning they had a different plan for the \\"relaxation center,\\" and imagined a longer stay for their guests, but, given that people weren't able to take more time off, they had to reduce the length of stays to just two days.

She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses. An anonymous text message leads Leo to a black-market bazaar run by Stuart. Bill and Josie are there, and Bill takes Josie away as Stuart confronts Leo. Suddenly remembering that Naadirah wrote an address on his notepad a while back, Leo leaves the bazaar after using charcoal to read the imprint.  Naadirah's address leads Leo to Oswald. When Leo expresses interest in a picture of Naadirah, Oswald assumes Leo works for Maksim's underling Nicky Simsek, who is skimming money from Maksim's prostitutes.

How does overdosing on painkillers or sleeping pills cause death? How many sleeping pills could kill someone? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"I will address each question separately and then compare them to determine if they are the same. Question 1: How does overdosing on painkillers or sleeping pills cause death? Step 1: Understand the context of the question: The question is asking about the potential lethal effects of taking an overdose of painkillers or sleeping pills. Step 2: Address the first part of the question - painkillers: An overdose of painkillers, particularly opioids, can cause death primarily by depressing the central nervous system (CNS). When the CNS is depressed, it slows down vital functions such as breathing and blood circulation. An overdose can lead to slowed or stopped breathing (respiratory depression), which reduces oxygen intake, potentially resulting in hypoxia, organ failure, and ultimately death. Step 3: Address the second part of the question - sleeping pills: An overdose of sleeping pills, particularly sedative-hypnotic drugs such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates, can also lead to CNS depression. In excessive amounts, they can cause severe drowsiness, loss of muscle control, decreased blood pressure, and slowed or stopped breathing. In some cases, an overdose can lead to a coma or death. Question 2: How many sleeping pills could kill someone? Step 1: Clarify the factors that affect the lethal dosage: The number of sleeping pills that could result in a lethal overdose varies depending on individual factors, such as age, weight, health status, drug tolerance, and the type and strength of the sleeping pill. Additionally, mixing substances, such as sleeping pills with alcohol or other drugs, can increase the risk of a lethal outcome even at lower dosages. Step 2: Emphasize the importance of following medical guidelines and avoiding self-medication: It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage given by a medical professional and to never exceed the recommended daily intake. Self-medication and altering dosages without a doctor's supervision can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Comparison of the two questions: While both questions deal with overdose and the potentially lethal outcomes of painkillers and sleeping pills, they are not the same. The first question seeks to understand the mechanism by which an overdose of these types of substances can cause death. The second question, on the other hand, inquires about the approximate number of sleeping pills that could result in a fatal outcome. Although related, they ask for different aspects of the topic."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The closure has left 500 individuals unemployed, dealing a crushing blow to both the local economy and the centennial heritage.  Fortunately, not all hope is lost for these jobless workers. One of the laid-off employees has taken a proactive approach by creating a website dedicated to listing the names and skills of their former colleagues. This incredible initiative aims to help the unemployed find new opportunities with prospective employers who can match their skill sets and expertise. The website facilitates the search process by categorizing former factory workers based on their specific job titles, such as engineers and electricians. This streamlined system allows potential employers to effortlessly pinpoint the right person for a job opening, simplifying the arduous search process by which job seekers are usually exposed. In the midst of uncertain times, this initiative serves as an inspiration and a lifeline, rekindling hope for the jobless in this tight-knit community. The website creator's resourcefulness and empathy have galvanized those around them, fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared resilience among the factory's former workforce. Currently, the website has generated promising results, with 30 job guarantees in the pipeline. Though the majority of these available positions are for unskilled labor, it marks a significant and encouraging milestone for the laid-off individuals in their quest for new jobs.  As the days go by, the website has the potential to attract even more prospective employers and create a space for networking and collaboration, not just for the displaced factory workers, but for the overall community. The cigar factory's closure serves as an impetus for change and adaptation, pushing these skilled workers to explore new opportunities in different industries and sectors.  The story of the shuttered cigar factory and the subsequent outpouring of support is one that resonates far beyond Tampa. It captures the essence of human resilience as well as the importance of innovation and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. The tenacity showcased by the factory workers and the creator of the website is a beacon of inspiration for anyone grappling with unemployment or economic hardship. Despite the setback, this community continues to embody the spirit of perseverance that has defined it for over a century. With a wealth of experience under their belts, these former cigar factory employees are more than ready to face new challenges and prove their worth in the ever-evolving job market. As the website continues to grow and expand its reach, it becomes an important representation of both the hardships faced by the jobless and the enduring strength of the human spirit to adapt and overcome. As Tampa, Florida bids a somber farewell to one of its fabled cigar factories, it simultaneously embraces its future, a renewed sense of unity and hope for the jobless workers that remain part of its storied history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin. The grandmother, who is addicted to soft drinks, shares the same dream of returning to her native village. Gloria's friends are her two neighbors: Cristal and Juani. Cristal is a prostitute with a heart of gold. Juani, is a bitter woman obsessed with cleanliness and vulgar ornaments, her daughter, Vanesa, has  telekinetic powers, which she uses to destroy their apartment., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Who constantly plays the song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen?\\" is Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver who is married to Gloria. Antonio constantly plays the song because it reminds him of his brief affair with a German singer named Ingrid Muller, for whom he worked as a driver fifteen years prior. This song is detested by Gloria, his wife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The answer is:","output":"The KDE Connect app (org.kde.kdeconnect_tp) has its merits as a tool for connecting your Android phone to your computer. I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars. While it does provide a good range of features like file sharing, remote control, and notifications sync, there is still room for improvement. On the positive side, the app is easy to set up and has a clean, intuitive interface. I found the file sharing feature particularly useful, as it allowed me to transfer files between my phone and computer seamlessly. The remote control feature also came in handy, turning my phone into a makeshift mouse and keyboard when needed. On the other hand, the app has its share of downsides. I experienced occasional connection issues that required me to restart the app in order to regain a stable connection. Additionally, some features could definitely use refinement, as they don't always work as expected, causing me to miss important notifications and messages. In conclusion, while KDE Connect does boast useful features that may appeal to many users, there are still some issues to work on to make it an even better app. With some improvements and bug fixes, it surely has the potential to become an indispensable application for phone-computer interaction."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This led to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757, in which the Bengal Army of the East India Company, led by Robert Clive, defeated the French-supported Nawab's forces. This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757. This was combined with British victories over the French at Madras, Wandiwash and Pondichéry that, along with wider British successes during the Seven Years' War, reduced French influence in India. The British East India Company extended its control over the whole of Bengal. After the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the company acquired the rights of administration in Bengal from de jure Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; this marked the beginning of its formal rule, which within the next century engulfed most of India. The East India Company monopolized the trade of Bengal. They introduced a land taxation system called the Permanent Settlement which introduced a feudal-like structure in Bengal, often with zamindars set in place. Now answer this question: How did the East India Company handle trade in Bengal?","output":"The East India Company handled trade in Bengal by taking full control over it. They made sure that they were the only ones allowed to trade in the area. They also set up a system called the Permanent Settlement to help manage the land and taxes. This system created a similar situation to having lords and helpers, also known as zamindars, in the region to help with organizing things. This way, the East India Company could make sure they stayed in charge of trade in Bengal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When asked where her mother is, Laurel just looks at the burning hospital. A few days later, a girl named Shelley (Meagan Good) is talking to her friend Leann (Azura Skye) on the phone, when she is scared by her pet cat. She looks over and it is gone. She walks over to the pond to see if it has fallen in, when it appears on the other side. She goes over to pet it, when a hand grabs her and pulls her into the pond, before pulling the cat in as well. After this, a hard candy floats to the top, and her phone begins to scroll through various numbers.After the credits roll, we are introduced to Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), who is having a party with her friends Brian (Johnny Lewis), and Taylor (Ana Claudia Talancon).

Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which sample would have lower boiling point, sample A or sample C?  Hint: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. The answer to this question is:","output":"Sample A would have a lower boiling point compared to sample C.  This is due to the fact that boiling points are greatly influenced by the type of intermolecular forces present within a given molecule. The stronger the intermolecular force, the higher the boiling point of the molecule. These forces include dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and London dispersion forces. Considering the provided information, sample A is a straight-chain molecule. Straight-chain molecules typically have fewer points of contact between their molecules, and this results in weaker intermolecular forces specifically London dispersion forces, which then contribute to a lower boiling point. On the other hand, sample C is a cyclic molecule. Cyclic molecules, due to their ring structure, pack together more efficiently, increasing the points of interaction between the molecules. This gives cyclic molecules generally stronger intermolecular forces and thus, higher boiling and melting points. Thus, in comparison, sample A, being a straight-chain molecule, would likely have a weaker London dispersion force, hence a lower boiling point than sample C, which is a cyclic molecule. This is, of course, assuming that the two samples are similar in terms of molecular weight and functional groups, as these can also have an impact on boiling points."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - St. Hanshaugen (Norwegian for St. John's Hill) is a district of the city of Oslo, Norway.  - Rapid transit, also known as heavy rail, metro, subway, tube, or underground, is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. Unlike buses or trams, rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way, which cannot be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort, and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways.  - Akershus Fortress or Akershus Castle is a medieval castle that was built to protect Oslo, the capital of Norway. It has also been used as a prison.  - The Furuset Line is a long line on the Oslo Metro between Hellerud and Ellingsrudåsen in Oslo, Norway. Running mostly underground, it passes through the southern part of Groruddalen, serving neighborhoods in the boroughs of Alna and Furuset. The line is served by Line 2 of the metro with four or eight trains per hour. The line is owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter using MX3000 trains.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Grini is a district in northeastern Bærum, Norway.  - Christian IV (12 April 1577  28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648. His 59-year reign is the longest of Danish monarchs, and of Scandinavian monarchies.  - Ruter AS is the public transport authority for Oslo and Akershus counties in Norway. Formally a limited company  60% of the shares in which are owned by the Oslo county municipality and 40% by that of Akershus  it is responsible for administrating, funding, and marketing (but not operating) public transport in the two counties, including buses, the Oslo Metro (\\"T-banen i Oslo\\"), Oslo Trams (\\"Trikken i Oslo\\"), and ferry services. Ruter also holds agreements with the Norwegian State Railways concerning the regulation of fares on commuter train services operated within the two counties.  - Sporveien T-banen AS is a limited company that is responsible for operating Oslo Metro, the rapid transit in Oslo, Norway. The company is owned by Sporveien, which is owned by the city council. Sporveien operates on a contract with Ruter, the public transport administration in Oslo and Akershus.  - Haakon V Magnusson (10 April 1270 - 8 May 1319) (Old Norse: \\"Hákon Magnússon\\"; Norwegian: \\"Håkon Magnusson\\") was king of Norway from 1299 until 1319.  - The Oslo Metro (or or simply ) is the rapid transit system of Oslo, Norway, operated by Sporveien T-banen on contract from the transit authority Ruter. The network consists of five lines that all run through the city centre, with a total length of , serving 101 stations of which 17 are underground or indoors. In addition to serving 14 out of the 15 boroughs of Oslo (all except St. Hanshaugen), two lines run to Bærum. In 2015, the system had an annual ridership of 94.4 million.  - Ekraveien is the last Oslo Metro station on the Røa Line within Oslo 's city limits . It is between the stations Røa and Eiksmarka . It was opened 22 December 1948 when the Røa Line was extended to Grini . Ekraveien itself is a road which runs north from the station to Bogstad . The neighborhood around the station is residential , consisting mostly of detached housing .  - The Kolsås Line is line of the Oslo Metro. It branches off from the Røa Line at Smestad Station and runs through western Oslo and Bærum to Kolsås Station. It serves the neighborhoods of Ullernåsen, Øraker, Jar, Bekkestua, Haslum, Gjettum and Kolsås. It is served by Line 3 of the metro at a 15-minute headway. The section from Jar to Bekkestua is build as a dual system with overhead wires, allowing Line 13 of the Oslo Tramway to continue from the Lilleaker Line to Bekkestua every ten minutes.  - A personal union is the combination of two or more states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.  - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars:  - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored.  - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\".  - Bærum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, Bærum is located on the west coast of the city.  - Røa was a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway up to January 1, 2004, when it became part of the Vestre Aker district.  Røa is also a suburb of Oslo, located approximately 7 kilometers away from downtown Oslo. It primarily consists of duplex houses and apartment blocks as well as single-family detached homes. It also has a small shopping mall.  - The Røa Line is a rapid transit line of the Oslo Metro, Norway, which runs from Majorstuen in Oslo to Østerås in Bærum. It serves neighborhoods such as Smestad, Hovseter, Huseby and Røa in northwestern Oslo, and Grini, Øvrevoll and Østerås in northeastern Bærum. The line is served by Line 2 of the metro, which connects to the city center via the Common Tunnel and onwards along the Furuset Line. The lowest part of the Røa Line, consisting of two stations, is shared with the Kolsås Line, and thus also served by Line 2 of the metro. The Røa Line is owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, and operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with the public transport agency Ruter.  - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015  25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066. In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Prior to becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire.  - The Common Tunnel, sometimes called the Common Line, is a long tunnel of the Oslo Metro which runs through the city center of Oslo, Norway.

But 23-year-old Powell, who came close to racing with Caterham in 2014, is confident female drivers can compete. \\"Someone definitely needs to prove him wrong,\\" she told BBC Sport. \\"Racing drivers are racing drivers and we know what the expectations are when we go into the sport. \\"Bernie's views aren't ever going to change unless a female does make it while he is still in charge.

The Scot was the first woman to take part in a grand prix weekend for more than 20 years. But making it on to the starting grid is not easy, with only 22 of the world's best drivers lining up for the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai last weekend out of the thousands who take up motorsport and hold F1 as their ultimate goal.

How is \\"I'll fly out of O'Hare, I'll meet you at the house.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, \\"I'll fly out of O'Hare, I'll meet you at the house.\\" can be translated as \\"Odletím z O'Hare, setkám se s tebou doma.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Odletím\\" - This is the Czech equivalent of \\"I'll fly out.\\" In this context, it implies leaving from the airport (O'Hare in this case). The verb \\"odletět\\" in the first person future tense (odletím) is used. 2. \\"z\\" - This preposition conveys the meaning of \\"from\\" or \\"out of\\" in English. When referring to a departure point or location, \\"z\\" is used in Czech. 3. \\"O'Hare\\" - O'Hare International Airport is located in Chicago, and since it's a proper noun, it does not change when translating to Czech. 4. \\"setkám se\\" - This phrase is translated as \\"I'll meet\\" in English. In Czech, the verb \\"setkat se\\" implies \\"to meet (someone).\\" In this case, the first person future tense (setkám se) is used. 5. \\"s tebou\\" - This means \\"with you\\" in English. The preposition \\"s\\" (with) is followed by \\"tebou,\\" which is the instrumental form of \\"ty\\" (you). 6. \\"doma\\" - This word translates to \\"at home\\" or \\"at the house\\" in English. It can refer to a specific house or simply imply being at one's own residence.

His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorce. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan (apparently) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch theorizes that the aliens are stealing their victims' skin and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty), and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and revealing that to her may cause her to leave.

Rugby is a fun sport where two teams of players run with a ball and try to score points by placing the ball behind the other team's goal area. These strong and fast Scots were getting ready for a big event called the \\"Six Nations.\\" This is a huge rugby competition that happens every year, with teams from six different countries: Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, France, and Italy. They all come together to see who will be the best at playing this super fun game. Now, the captain of Scotland's team, his name is Greig Laidlaw, had an important thought in his mind. He believed that if his team could win another game in a row, they would have an even better chance of doing great in the Six Nations competition. So, he encouraged everyone on his team to work extra hard and play with all their might. One day, the team from Scotland had a game against the team from a country called Georgia. This was a very important game for the Scots, because if they could win this match, it would help them be stronger and more confident in the Six Nations competition. Captain Greig knew that back-to-back wins would be excellent, because it is like having two yummy ice cream cones, one right after the other! The Scottish players trained and practiced, and they listened to Captain Greig's wise words and believed in themselves. They were all so excited to play against Georgia and give it their best. So, on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, the people from Scotland and Georgia came together on a special field designed just for playing rugby. And do you know what happened? The whole world was watching, waiting to see who would win, and which team would take another important step on their way to the big Six Nations event. Everyone in Scotland was cheering and hoping that Captain Greig and his strong and fast players would win this important game. While the two teams played their hardest on that Saturday, everyone learned an important lesson: that in sports and in life, we should always believe in ourselves and never give up.

Summarize this article: There are as many types of curators as there are types of museums - art museums, history museums, children’s museums, science museums, and a vast range of specializations in between. You will need to choose what sort of museum you want to work for in order to pursue the appropriate education.  Consider what experiences have influenced your desire to be a museum curator. Were you inspired by an Aztec history exhibit you saw on a school field trip? Do you dream of working in a place like the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Be as specific as possible. If you know you want to work in a science museum, think about what aspects of science interest you the most. Chemistry? Physics? Astronomy? The more specific your choice, the more extensively you can educate yourself in it. Many colleges offer Bachelor’s degrees in museology, or museum studies, but it’s not absolutely necessary that you choose this as your major. Museums will look for candidates with extensive education and experience in a field that is relevant to what they’re curating, such as art or history, as well as knowledge of business administration, marketing, and fundraising. Bachelor’s degrees typically take 4 years to complete, although it may take more if you choose a double major. By this time, you should have some idea of what subject you want to focus on. If you became particularly interested in African art while getting your Bachelor’s in art history, look for Master’s programs that have a focus in African art.  Look at the faculty of graduate departments as well as the programs. Who you work with can have a great impact on your education, as well as your career. Many curators find jobs through the recommendations of professors in their field, so building a good relationship with faculty is a must.  Graduate programs typically take between 1.5 and 3 years to complete. Many lower-level curatorial positions only require a Master’s, but if you want to become curator at a national museum, you’ll need a PhD. This should be in the field you wish to specialize in. Because of the competitive nature of this field, a specialized degree is increasingly necessary. You want to demonstrate as much expertise in whatever you hope to curate as possible.  When you choose a subject for your thesis, it’s ideal to find something unique that will stand out from other research in your field. Educate yourself on what research has already been done and aim to make a distinctive contribution. PhD programs typically take at least 5 years (the average length, however, is 8.2 years). Summary:","output":"This article talks about how to become a museum curator. A curator takes care of a museum's stuff and decides what to show. There are many types of museums, like art, history, and science. First, think about what kind of museum you want to work in and learn a lot about that subject. You might go to college to study museums or something like art, history, or science. After college, you might study even more about your favorite subject. It's important to make friends with your teachers because they can help you find a job. Some jobs need even more school, like a PhD.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  Now, I have a new situation: Matt is reheating some leftover pizza in the microwave for his stepchildren, Lauren and Emily. Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature when reheated so Matt cooks it for a long time. Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple seconds.  Answer this question please: Are the particles in Emily's pizza moving faster or slower than in Lauren's pizza? Answer:","output":"The particles in Emily's pizza are moving slower than in Lauren's pizza. Since Emily prefers her pizza at a lower temperature and it is only microwaved for a couple of seconds, the particles in her pizza have not gained as much kinetic energy as the particles in Lauren's pizza, which is heated for a longer time and at a higher temperature. Therefore, the particles in Emily's pizza are moving more slowly compared to those in Lauren's pizza, resulting in a cooler temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which animal will win: squirrel or scorpion? Which animal will win in a fight: a squirrel or a frog? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: A). no; B). yes;","output":"A). No, these questions are not the same. These questions present different scenarios and involve different sets of animals. The first question inquires about the outcome of a confrontation between a squirrel and a scorpion, while the second question asks about a fight between a squirrel and a frog. Although both questions involve a squirrel, the opponents are different, and as a result, the answers to the questions will vary. To address the first question, a squirrel and a scorpion inhabit different ecological niches and are unlikely to confront each other naturally. Squirrels are small mammals that mostly live in trees, while scorpions are arachnids that thrive in diverse environments, including deserts, grasslands, and forests. Squirrels primarily consume plant matter such as nuts and seeds, but they may occasionally eat small insects and nestling birds. In contrast, scorpions primarily feed on various insects and other small animals. If a squirrel and a scorpion were to fight, the outcome would be uncertain and would depend on factors like the size and species of the scorpion, as well as the squirrel's agility. A larger and more venomous scorpion might be able to sting the squirrel, possibly incapacitating or killing it. On the other hand, a smaller scorpion might not be able to harm the squirrel effectively, and the squirrel's agility and quick reflexes could allow it to escape or fend off the scorpion. In the second question, the scenario involves a squirrel and a frog, two animals that generally do not pose a threat to one another. Squirrels rarely feed on frogs, and frogs usually eat insects and small aquatic organisms. In a confrontation, the squirrel's speed and agility could give it an advantage, as it could dodge the frog's tongue and avoid its grasp. On the other hand, some frogs possess potent toxins that can deter or harm potential predators, which could work to the frog's advantage.

They break the rules and do not care about the property of the writer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Before we got married my husband and I lived in 4 different apartments all within the span of one year. The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. Question: How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above? Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, the writer feels that the family living above them is unstable. This can be inferred from the series of actions and behaviors exhibited by the upstairs neighbors, which include: 1. Excessive noise from blasting movies/music with the bass turned up late into the night. 2. Constant stomping, running, and loud sounds from their apartment throughout the day. 3. Overcrowded living situation with at least four adults and two children in a one-bedroom apartment. 4. Disregard for the nonsmoking policy of the complex and tossing cigarette butts onto the writer's porch. 5. A domestic violence incident that required the intervention of law enforcement. 6. Carelessness resulting in property damage, potential fire hazards due to fuel leakage, and spitting on the writer's porch. These actions and behaviors indicate that the family living above is unstable, as they struggle to maintain a peaceful and orderly living environment. Their frequent rule-breaking, carelessness, and dangerous actions further demonstrate a disregard for the property and well-being of others, which supports the writer's view of their instability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - vaporate - cool off - form crystals - melt - keep things cold  Explain why a human would choose \\"melt\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"melt\\" to answer the question above because when ice is not ice anymore, it typically means that the solid ice has gone through a phase transition due to an increase in temperature, causing it to change its state from solid to liquid. This process is known as melting. In essence, the temperature change allows the ice's molecules to gain more energy, vibrating at faster rates and essentially breaking the bonds that held them rigidly together in the solid state. As a result, the solid ice turns into liquid water. Now let's briefly explain why the other options are not the correct answer: 1. Vaporate: This option likely refers to 'evaporate' or the process of turning into vapor from the liquid state. For ice, it directly turning into vapor is referred to as 'sublimation' but that's not the process described in the question since it would still be ice. 2. Cool off: Cooling off would mean a decrease in temperature. In order for ice to stop being ice, it would need to gain heat, not lose it. 3. Form crystals: While ice itself is a crystalline structure, the question is asking about what happens when ice is not ice anymore — the ice would need to undergo a phase change, like melting, rather than forming more crystals. 4. Keep things cold: This does not describe a change in the state of the ice itself but rather the function ice serves when used to lower the temperature of other objects. To sum it up, a human would choose \\"melt\\" because it best explains the phase change from solid to liquid when ice is not ice anymore."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ben does so in full view of the man's workers, knowing his reputation will protect him.

He's visited by Harry Greenberg, an old friend who is irresponsible with his end of Siegel's organization and asks Siegel for money. Disgusted, Siegel gives Greenberg a large sum and dismisses him to sit under a UV lamp and work on his tan.Arriving in Los Angeles, Siegel is met by another old friend, the actor George Raft, who takes Ben to a studio where the movie Manpower is being shot. On the set, Ben notices a woman, Virginia Hill, who has a job as an extra. Ben is attracted to her immediately and talks to her briefly before she walks off, seemingly uninterested and insulting his ego. George drives Ben back to his hotel through Beverly Hills, pointing out the houses of famous Hollywood people. When George mentions opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, Ben asks George to leave him there. Ben meets with Tibbett himself and mildly coerces Tibbett into selling his house, offering straight cash and settling on an amount several thousand dollars more than Tibbett paid for the house. Tibbett agrees. A few scenes later, Siegel buys a luxury car from a random person on the street.Siegel meets with Dragna and his associates at Dragna's office. Dragna isn't interested in Siegel's offer to expand his own business, much less aid Siegel & his associates.

My Grandmother has been in the hospital since just befor Thanksgiving . I got a call last week that her functions were shutting down and they did not expect her to last much longer . It was quite a blow for me , from what I am hearing she is doing better but it is still too soon to tell . Then to make matters even better my HD crashed on my desktop at home , we are waiting for a replacement drive , but I still have homework to do and its causing some issues there as well . Question What will likely happen before Christmas ? Answer:","output":"It is challenging to predict the exact events that will occur before Christmas, as many variables are in play. However, I can provide potential scenarios and general insights based on the information provided. 1. Regarding your grandmother's health: It is essential to communicate regularly with the hospital staff and get updates on her condition. Sometimes, a patient's health can improve unexpectedly, even when the prognosis seems bleak. Keep in touch with her medical team and make sure to be emotionally supportive for your grandmother. Be prepared for any outcome, but also hope for the best and spend as much time with her as you can. Before Christmas, there might be a few possible scenarios: a. Your grandmother's health could continue to improve, and she may be able to come home or be transferred to a rehabilitation facility where she can receive appropriate care and start recovering. b. Her health might remain stable, neither improving nor deteriorating. In this case, her condition could be monitored more closely by the medical staff, and they will try to make necessary adjustments in her treatment plan to enhance her well-being. c. Your grandmother's health could worsen, in which case the medical staff will focus on providing her with the best possible care and ensuring her comfort. It is important to discuss her wishes and preferences about her care with her and the medical team, such as considering palliative or hospice care if necessary. 2. As for your desktop computer and the hard drive issues: Once the replacement hard drive arrives, you will need to either reinstall the operating system (if you had installation or recovery media) or work with a technician or a knowledgeable friend to help you get your computer up and running again. Before Christmas, there might be a few possible outcomes: a. The replacement drive arrives soon, and you successfully reinstall the operating system and necessary software. You are then able to catch up on your homework and continue working without major issues. b. The replacement drive takes longer to arrive, or there are additional hardware or software issues that delay the computer's repair. In this case, explore alternative options to complete your homework. You could use the computers at your school library, borrow a friend's laptop, or look into affordable temporary solutions such as renting a laptop. c. If the computer's repair process seems uncertain and your homework deadlines are pressing, consider discussing the situation with your teachers or academic advisors. They may be able to provide extensions or alternate methods of submitting your work. In summary, while it is not possible to predict the exact events that will happen before Christmas, it is crucial to remain flexible, emotionally supportive for your grandmother, and resourceful in finding solutions to computer-related issues.

If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike.  But I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  What is an answer for this question: Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than Matt's. This conclusion can be drawn from observing the natural skin color of the two individuals. The color of a person's skin is largely determined by the activity of the melanocytes, these are the cells in the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin) that produce melanin. Melanin is a pigment that provides the color of a person's skin, hair, and eyes. Those with a darker skin tone have melanocytes that produce more melanin, while those with a lighter skin tone have melanocytes that produce less melanin. In the case of Matt and Jesse, who are identical twins, they have the same number of melanocytes because they share identical genetic makeup. However, the way these melanocytes function may vary. From your description, Jesse has a darker skin complexion than Matt, indicating that Jesse's melanocytes naturally produce more melanin. However, your description also includes a scenario where Matt's skin became temporarily darker because he was out in the sun for a long time. This occurred because exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light – such as from the sun – stimulates melanocytes to increase their production of melanin as a way to protect the skin from UV damage. This resulted in a tan, or temporary darkening of Matt's skin, but it doesn't alter his melanocytes' usual production levels of melanin.  So, even though Matt's skin darkened temporarily due to exposure to the sun, that doesn't change the fact that under normal circumstances (without excessive sun exposure), Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than those of Matt.  However, it should be noted that individuals with darker skin, like Jesse, may be at a greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. This is because melanin blocks UV light – the very same light needed by the skin to produce vitamin D. Thus, Jesse needs to ensure he gets enough sunlight for adequate vitamin D synthesis without increasing his risk of skin damage from the sun.  In conclusion, Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than Matt's, based on their normal skin color. This could change temporarily with significant sun exposure, as experienced by Matt, but their inherent melanin production levels remain the same."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that killed the king of the people that had a limited measure of independence? , can you please find it?   Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

When Bill throws a boulder and a balloon, the difference in their falling speed is due to their weights and the effect of air resistance. The weight of an object depends on its mass and the acceleration due to gravity. Balloons are typically filled with air or lighter-than-air gases like helium, and they have thin material encasing. Boulder, on the other hand, is made of dense, heavy rock.  Due to their significant difference in mass, the balloon will weigh less compared to the boulder. Additionally, the air resistance acting on the balloon is higher relative to its weight because of its larger surface area compared to the boulder. It causes the balloon to experience an upward force that counteracts the force of gravity, resulting in a slower fall. So, the correct answer is (B) the balloon weighs less."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

William \\"Bill\\" Boss, a psychopathic prison warden, watches the end of The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) with his accountant, Dwight Butler. Bill says that he hates the films as his feet are massaged by his secretary, Daisy. Daisy replies that she enjoyed them. In response, Bill sucks his finger and inserts it into Daisy's vagina, telling her that women should not be allowed to voice their opinions. Dwight interrupts, attempting to pitch a \\"brilliant idea\\" to fix the prison's horrible retention and violence rates, but he is interrupted by a phone call. Bill and Dwight are then summoned to the scene of an assault within the prison. One of the officers has been stabbed by an inmate. As punishment, Bill decides to stomp on the arm of the prisoner, exposing the bone and causing immense pain. He promises to do it again when his bones are healed. Back in the Warden's office, Bill receives a mysterious package. After Dwight asks what it contains, Bill reveals that it is a jar of specially imported, dried African clitorises which he eats \\"for strength.\\" After eating a few, he receives a threatening prank phone call from one of the inmates.

Dominic became the spiritual father to several Albigensian women he had reconciled to the faith, and in 1206 he established them in a convent in Prouille. This convent would become the foundation of the Dominican nuns, thus making the Dominican nuns older than the Dominican friars. Prior Diego sanctioned the building of a monastery for girls whose parents had sent them to the care of the Albigensians because their families were too poor to fulfill their basic needs.

Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an \\"amicable separation.\\" Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months. His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for \\"personal reasons,\\" which he declined to specify. \\"There is no business reason for my departure,\\" nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. \\"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board,\\" he said.

Apart from a few Indian novels and an Australian book, my literature collection only consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I couldn't ever found anything in translation. My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles  behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task. With translations making up only around 4.5 per cent of literary works published in the UK, getting English versions of stories was tricky. One by one, the books from the countries on the list filled my heart with laughter, love, anger, hope and fear. Lands that had once seemed exotic and remote became close and familiar to me.

However, this information on its own is not sufficient to ascertain the man's objective or expectations regarding the amount of fish he plans or hopes to catch. While it is reasonable to assume that the man might intend to catch fish using his net, since he is in a boat with a fishing net, there are factors that we would need to consider to evaluate his potential success in catching \\"a large load of fish.\\" For example, we have no details about the location of the boat (whether it is in an area abundant with fish), the man's experience as a fisherman, or if the net he is using is suitable for catching a significant amount of fish. Moreover, the original statement does not provide any information on the man's intentions or preferences; he could be out for a leisurely fishing trip without a concern for the number of fish he catches, or he could be teaching someone else how to use a fishing net. In conclusion, while it is likely that the man is preparing to fish, given that he is untangling his net, it is not possible to tell with certainty that his goal is to catch a large load of fish in his net.

In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it.

In residential spaces, carpeting can be installed in living rooms, bedrooms, hallways, stairs, and basements, among other areas. Carpets provide insulation, help with sound absorption, and provide a comfortable surface to walk, sit, or play on. Homeowners have a wide variety of carpet types, materials, colors, and designs to choose from, making it easy to find a carpet that complements their interior design preferences and needs. Similarly, carpets can also be a great addition to office spaces and commercial buildings. Carpeting in office environments contributes to creating a professional, cozy, and welcoming atmosphere for employees and visitors alike. In addition, carpet tiles, specifically designed for office spaces, offer benefits such as durability, easy maintenance, and the ability to replace individual tiles if they become damaged or stained. While gym spaces, clubs, or specific locations like Istanbul might have areas where carpeting could be utilized, these options are not as widely applicable as home or office spaces. Gyms, for instance, usually require flooring that is more resilient and easier to clean, such as rubber flooring or interlocking foam tiles. Similarly, clubs and entertainment venues often opt for hard-surface flooring for easy maintenance and durability; however, carpeted areas might be chosen for more exclusive and comfortable lounge spaces. In summary, home or office spaces are the most suitable option for new carpeting due to the wide range of applications, benefits, and the availability of diverse carpet designs catering to various aesthetic and functional requirements. Installing carpets can enhance the comfort, visual appeal, and insulation of both residential and commercial spaces, making it the most fitting choice from the given options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  and the situation: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that.  Answer the following question: Whose joints will be more sore after skiing? Answer:","output":"After skiing, it is more likely that Kathy, the grandmother, will have more sore joints compared to Margaret. This is primarily because Kathy is in her late adulthood, making her more susceptible to age-related issues such as arthritis, a decline in strength and stamina, and an overall decrease in physical ability. In contrast, Margaret, as a high school sophomore, is younger and likely to have better joint health, strength, and stamina.

They were certainly right: Archaeologists are now confirming that it isn't just a ship, but perhaps the oldest found in the area, dating back to the 1700s, reports WBOC 16. Growth rings reveal it was made from oak cut down between the Potomac River and Annapolis and fastened with wooden pegs, reports WBAL-TV. The 45-foot cargo ship was likely built at a small shipyard or plantation in Maryland, and charring suggests it was torched by British sympathizers in the 1780s. \\"The day you find a shipwreck in Maryland waters is a momentous occasion,\\" says Julie Schablitsky, chief archaeologist with the State Highway Administration. \\"It doesn't get much better than this.\\" She and her husband, Navy underwater archaeologist Bob Neyland, have been analyzing the ship all summer.

Their suspicions have now been confirmed by archaeologists, who not only verified that it is indeed a shipwreck, but also believe it to be the oldest found in the area, dating back to the 1700s. According to WBOC 16, the ship was constructed from oak trees cut down between the Potomac River and Annapolis. The shipwrights utilized wooden pegs as fastenings, as reported by WBAL-TV. Measurements indicate that the 45-foot cargo ship was likely built at a small shipyard or plantation in Maryland. Evidence of charring on the timbers suggests that British sympathizers set it ablaze during the turbulent 1780s.

The fairly realm Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Enchanted Summons\\" Derek, a down-to-earth, pragmatic lawyer in a bustling city, lives a routine life filled with case files, courtrooms, and regulation court battles. One odd day, he receives a mysterious, gilded summons in the mail. The craftmanship is peculiarly old-world, and the language in the summons appears to be some ancient, arcane script which he can't identify, but for some reason, he can understand it clearly. The summons was from the Fairy Realm, a concept that is utterly ridiculous to his logical mind.  The summons outlines that he has been chosen to represent a client from their world - Queen Titania, the Fairy Queen, who is facing a wrongful dethronement lawsuit in the Fairy Realm. Derek brushes it off as a well-orchestrated prank - until it happens again, and this time with a fairy, Astoria, effectively startling him in his office, confirming the summons' authenticity. Astoria, a fearless fairy lawyer working under Titania, manages to convince a bemused and bewildered Derek to embark on this extraordinary journey into the Fairy Realm - a world unbeknownst to most humans, brimming with wonder, magic, and dilemmas quite unlike human ones. Derek is skeptical and incredulous, causing both comedic and conflict-filled situations, but the commitment to his profession compels him to see this through.  He wades through the labyrinth of fairy laws, their intricacies, and the astonishing magic-infused courtrooms, where he butts heads with Oberon, the Fairy King, who has initiated the lawsuit against Titania, his own wife. It's a high-stakes case, where the political structure, history, and future of the Fairy Realm lie delicately balanced. There are underlying threads of rebellion, manipulation, and deceit, all leading back to the duplicitous group of power-hungry fairies trying to overthrow Titania.  Complementing the legal battle, Derek's character experiences an arc of growing from a rigid, often dismissive person, to someone who learns to appreciate magic, the unexplainable, and learning to trust his intuition. His dynamic with Astoria, who herself learns about the rigidity and structure of human laws from him, showcases a beautiful cultural and professional exchange. In the climax, Derek skillfully uses his logic, human wit, combined with fairy laws and magic taught by Astoria, to dismantle the accusations at the trial. The truth unfolds shockingly in the court, proving Queen Titania's innocence and unmasking the traitors among the court. Derek's successful defense restores Titania to her rightful throne, peace in the Fairy Realm, and the perpetrators are justly punished.  Derek returns to his world, changed, humbled, and promising to keep the secret of the Fairy Realm. This whole unusual journey changes his perspective, not just on his profession but on life as well. His successful defense in the Fairy Realm makes him a fairy-tale legend, unbeknown to his human counterparts. However, in his heart, he now holds an irreplaceable respect for the Fae world and a secret ally in Astoria. The routine life he formerly led now glimmers with the enchanting remnants of his journey.  The movie closes on Derek in his regular life with a knowing smile, hinting at the unseen adventures he had, redefining the world he knew. As confusing as the summons had appeared in the beginning, he is now grateful for being a part of the Fairy Realm, if only for a short while."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was found that sciatic nerve block duration could be greatly increased and systemic toxicity greatly decreased if epinephrine was injected with tetrodotoxin. The mechanism that underlies epinephrine-mediated prolongation of tetrodotoxin nerve blocks is not known, but indirect evidence suggests that epinephrine may slow the clearance of tetrodotoxin from the site of injection. The authors hypothesized that tetrodotoxin causes vasodilatation at its injection site, which accelerates its systemic uptake, and that this vasodilatation is attenuated by coinjected epinephrine.', 'The radiolabeled microsphere technique was used to measure tissue blood flow in anesthetized rats before and after perisciatic injection of tetrodotoxin alone and in combination with epinephrine.', 'Tetrodotoxin, in a dose of 0.1 ml of a 60 microM solution, significantly increased blood flow in perisciatic muscle at the injected side compared with simultaneous contralateral control and ipsilateral preinjection baseline. Tetrodotoxin did not increase blood flow in the sciatic nerve. Coinjection of epinephrine with tetrodotoxin prevented tetrodotoxin-induced increases in perisciatic muscle blood flow over time and did not alter sciatic nerve blood flow. Arterial blood pressure was maintained with this dose of tetrodotoxin, although brain blood flow decreased. Coinjection of epinephrine with tetrodotoxin prevented decreases in brain blood flow.

One day, Kayla fell into a very deep sleep, almost like a spell had been cast on her. Sarah wanted to help her friend wake up, but no matter what she did, Kayla just wouldn't open her eyes. That meant that Sarah needed to find a new way to help her friend. Sarah tried tickling Kayla's feet, shaking her gently, and even putting a funny-smelling flower under her nose, but none of those tricks worked. She thought long and hard about what could possibly wake her friend up from this magical sleep. Then, Sarah remembered hearing a story about a sleeping princess who could only be woken up with a special kiss.  But Sarah thought, \\"I don't have any magical kisses! What else can I try?\\" She realized that maybe if she could find the source of the spell that put Kayla to sleep, she could break the spell and wake her up.  Sarah went on a big adventure, searching high and low for the magical source. She climbed tall mountains, swam across deep rivers, and even went into a dark and mysterious forest. Along the way, she met many friendly animals who also wanted to help Kayla. There was a wise old owl, a helpful squirrel, and a brave little mouse. Together, they traveled through the forest in search of answers. Finally, after many days of searching, they stumbled upon a hidden cave. Inside the cave, they found a bright, glowing crystal guarded by a dragon! The wise old owl told Sarah that this crystal had the power to break Kayla's deep sleep spell. Sarah knew she had to be very brave to face the dragon and get the crystal. She gathered all her courage, and with the help of her new animal friends, they were able to distract the dragon long enough for Sarah to grab the crystal.  With the crystal in hand, Sarah quickly returned to Kayla's side. She held the crystal up to the sunlight, making it sparkle and shine brightly. As the light from the crystal touched Kayla's face, the spell began to fade away.  All of a sudden, Kayla started to stir and slowly opened her eyes. She saw Sarah and their animal friends standing around her, and she knew they had saved her from the deep sleep spell. Kayla hugged Sarah tightly, thankful to have such a caring friend who never gave up on her. And from that day on, Sarah and Kayla knew that there was nothing they couldn't face together, as long as they had each other and the help of their new animal friends.

The structure that Adam was in was more unstable than that of Aaron's because  Options: (A). Adam was in a modern building.; (B). Aaron was in a modern building.;","output":"The structure that Adam was in was more unstable than that of Aaron's because Adam was in a modern building (Option A), while Aaron was in a modern building (Option B).  The difference in stability between the two structures might seem counterintuitive; one might expect a modern building to have better construction and materials, leading to increased stability. However, various factors can cause a modern building to be less stable than an older one.  Step 1: Consider the design and architectural elements of both structures. Modern buildings often prioritize aesthetics and functionality over stability. This can result in large glass windows, open floor plans, and thin walls that may not provide the same level of structural stability as older, more traditional buildings. In contrast, older buildings might have thicker walls, smaller windows, and dense structural support systems, all designed to maintain the building's stability. Aaron's older building, therefore, may be more stable due to these architectural differences. Step 2: Assess the construction materials used in both structures. Modern building materials like synthetic composites, lightweight steel, and glass might not be as robust as traditional materials like stone, brick, and timber. Additionally, modern construction techniques could lead to shortcuts or cost-cutting measures that compromise the building's structural integrity. Aaron's older building, built with traditional materials and methods, might have improved durability and stability, while Adam's modern building may be at a disadvantage. Step 3: Evaluate the location and surrounding environment of both structures. Geographical factors like soil quality, earthquakes, and flood risks can significantly affect a building's stability. A building's design and materials may not adequately account for these factors, leading to less stable structures over time. If Adam's modern building is in an area prone to geological risks, it could face more significant instability compared to Aaron's building. Aaron might be in a more structurally sound location, allowing his building to maintain better stability. Step 4: Examine the maintenance and upkeep history of both structures. Regardless of a building's age, regular maintenance and inspections are vital to ensure its stability and safety. If Adam's modern building has a history of poor maintenance, it may be more unstable than Aaron's older building if it has been well-maintained and regularly inspected. In conclusion, the structural stability of a building can depend on various factors such as its design, construction materials, location, and maintenance. Despite being a modern building, Adam's structure may be more unstable than Aaron's older building because of these factors. This highlights the importance of considering all aspects of a building's construction, materials, and upkeep when assessing stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background Wilkerson had told the freshman student's friends he was going to look after her following a St. Patrick's Day party. However, instead of protecting her, he took advantage of her vulnerability. Prosecutors, who demanded prison time, stated that Wilkerson \\"raped a helpless young woman after duping the people around her into believing he was going to care for her.\\" The Sentence Despite prosecutors’ pleas, the judge used his discretion to give Wilkerson a significantly lighter sentence than the four to 12 years in state prison the charge usually carries. Instead, he will be on probation for 20 years to life and serve two years in the county jail under a work-release program, allowing him to leave jail for school or work each day.

Let's break down this statement to further understand the situation and the relation between window washers and people working outdoors. \\"Window washers\\" refers to individuals or professionals who clean and maintain windows, typically on the exteriors of buildings. This may involve an array of equipment ranging from ladders, scaffolding, window washing tools, and in some cases, harnesses to ensure safety while working at great heights. In the given statement, the window washers are \\"outside a Chinese restaurant.\\" This provides two essential pieces of information:  1. The location: The statement indicates that the workers are operating outside, which means they are exposed to the elements and in an outdoor environment. 2. The type of establishment: In this case, the window washers are working on a Chinese restaurant's exterior. While this detail does not directly contribute to understanding whether these individuals are working outdoors, it adds context to the situation. Considering this information, it can be concluded that there are people working outdoors. Since window washing, by definition, involves cleaning and maintaining windows, this task is often carried out in outdoor settings. Furthermore, the fact that these window washers are outside a Chinese restaurant further reaffirms their outdoor presence.

He did so because he was feeling what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - pleasure - delight - bankruptcy - agony - owning  I believe the correct choice is \\"agony\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice indeed is \\"agony\\", and there are a few reasons that support this conclusion. Firstly, let us briefly analyze each of the given options to understand why \\"agony\\" is the most appropriate choice in this context. 1. Pleasure: This option doesn't align with John's situation as he is purchasing products for his swollen testicles, which indicates that he is experiencing discomfort or pain. Pleasure would imply that he is enjoying the situation, which is not the case here. 2. Delight: Similar to pleasure, this choice also goes against the context of the question. Delight implies satisfaction or joy, whereas John's actions of spending money on products for his condition suggest that he is trying to alleviate his distress. 3. Bankruptcy: This option refers to the financial state of an individual who cannot repay their debts, and it does not represent an emotion or sensation that John is feeling. Considering that the question concerns John's feelings as a reason to buy these products, bankruptcy is not a suitable answer here. 4. Agony: Agony is defined as extreme physical or mental suffering and matches the context of John's situation. As he is experiencing discomfort from his swollen testicles and spending money to alleviate his suffering, agony is the emotion that he is feeling, making it the most appropriate choice. 5. Owning: This option refers to the act of possessing or having control over something. It is not an emotion or sensation related to John's experience and therefore not a suitable answer to this question. Taking the above points into consideration, it becomes clear that \\"agony\\" is the correct choice in this context. John's decision to spend a significant amount of money on products for his swollen testicles is driven by the pain and suffering that he's experiencing. By purchasing these products, he aims to find relief and alleviate his discomfort, which characterizes the emotion of agony. The other provided options don't adequately capture the essence of what John is feeling in this situation, making \\"agony\\" the most fitting and reasonable answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Further visits by other English explorers followed, and, once Saint Helena’s location was more widely known, English ships of war began to lie in wait in the area to attack Portuguese India carracks on their way home. In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island.

Answer:","output":"Question: How did the discovery of Saint Helena by Sir Francis Drake and subsequent visits by other English explorers impact the trade and shipping routes of the Portuguese and Spanish in the late 16th century? Answer: The discovery of Saint Helena by Englishman Sir Francis Drake during his circumnavigation of the world (1577-1580) led to increasing visits by other English explorers. As Saint Helena's location became more widely known, English ships of war started to wait in the area to ambush Portuguese India carracks returning home. This strategic positioning disrupted the trade and shipping routes of the Portuguese and Spanish. Additionally, the Dutch began frequenting the island to develop their Far East trade, which added to the pressure on the Portuguese and Spanish ships. Consequently, the Portuguese and Spanish stopped regularly calling at the island for several reasons. One reason was their preference for ports along the West African coast, which may have been a strategic move to avoid the threat posed by the English and Dutch presence at Saint Helena.  Another reason was the hostile action taken against their vessels, as well as the desecration of their religious sites, such as chapels and icons. Furthermore, Dutch and English sailors were responsible for the destruction of Portuguese and Spanish livestock and plantation on the island. Ultimately, the discovery of Saint Helena by Sir Francis Drake and subsequent visits by other English and Dutch explorers significantly impacted the trade and shipping routes of the Portuguese and Spanish in the late 16th century, forcing them to adapt to the changing geopolitical landscape."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Q: Passage: While preparing to enter Maynooth College, Quarter was visited by a priest who had served as a missionary in the United States. The young man was moved by the priest's stories of the dreadful plight of Catholics in America (many of whom were without priests, churches, or the sacraments), and resolved to dedicate himself to the missions there. Having obtained permission from Bishop James Warren Doyle, Quarter departed from Ireland in April 1822 and later landed at Quebec, Canada. Following his arrival, he was rejected at the seminaries of both the Archdiocese of Quebec and the Diocese of Montreal on account of his young age but, journeying southward, was finally accepted at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland. While at Mount St. Mary's, he became professor of Greek and Latin, as well as sacristan, in 1823. He completed his theological studies in 1829 and then went to New York, where he was ordained a priest by Bishop John Dubois on September 19 of that year.  Link Information: James Warren Doyle, O.E.S.A. (1786–1834) Question: How old was the Bishop that gave Quarter permission to leave and be a missionary?

Both types can grow in either the pole- or bush-style, but the pods of the beans are what make them unique. Shell beans are primarily removed from their pod to be eaten, and are consumed fresh or dried to save for later. Snap beans are eaten inside their pod, and are only eaten fresh (not dried for later use). You can grow multiple styles of these beans directly adjacent to one another, because bean plants are self-pollinating and won’t cross-contaminate each other.  Popular shell beans include black beans, fava beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, and kidney beans. Popular snap beans include snap (green) beans, adzuki beans, mung beans, asparagus beans, and scarlet-runner beans. Pole beans are a type of beans that are vining and must be supported with a trellis or pole. Pole beans grow an average of 5- to 6-feet tall, and can grow either shell or snap bean. Pole beans generally thrive in cooler summer temperatures, as low as 50 °F (10 °C) in the summer. In the US, they thrive in the northern states. You can use whatever support system (trellis, pole, fence, arbor, etc.) that you want for pole beans. Bush beans are a type of beans that grow in off a bush, and do not need a trellis or pole for support. Generally, bush beans grow best in warm environments with summer temperatures reaching above 100 °F (38 °C). In the US, they thrive in the Southern states. Bush beans should be planted in large rows, requiring much more space than pole beans. A variety of bush beans called ‘half-runners’ is a bush/pole hybrid, and may require some support or placement near a fence for stabilization.

Striking Hollywood writers will be back at their keyboards Wednesday after voting overwhelmingly to end a 100-day walkout that essentially shut down the entertainment industry. Writers Guild of America member Steven Binder shows his approval as he votes Tuesday in Beverly Hills, California. More than 92 percent of the Writers Guild of America members who cast ballots Tuesday in Los Angeles and New York voted to end their work stoppage over residuals for writing in the digital age, including new media and the Internet. The new deal is for three years. \\"The strike is over. Our membership has voted, and writers can go back to work,\\" said Patric Verrone, president of the WGA's West chapter. Michael Winship, president of WGA's East guild, said, \\"The success of this strike is a significant achievement not only for ourselves but the entire creative community, now and in the future.\\" WGA members walked off the job November 5 after talks broke down over how writers are paid for the use of their material on the Internet and DVDs, among other issues. \\"It is not all that we hoped for, and it is not all we deserve,\\" Verrone said when a tentative deal was announced Saturday. But he added, \\"This is the best deal this guild has bargained for in 30 years.\\" Leslie Moonves, chief executive officer of CBS Corp., told The Associated Press, \\"At the end of the day, everybody won. \\"It was a fair deal and one that the companies can live with, and it recognizes the large contribution that writers have made to the industry.\\" The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents production companies and media conglomerates, has had no comment on the agreement. The vote meant that the Academy Awards ceremony on February 24 will be the usual scripted gala, the AP reported. \\"I am ecstatic that the 80th Academy Awards presentation can now proceed full steam ahead,\\" without \\"hesitation or discomfort\\" for the nominees, Sid Ganis, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which stages the Oscars, told the AP. As long as the strike continued, the traditional Oscars spectacular was in doubt since many Hollywood stars would not cross WGA picket lines. It's unclear how soon new episodes of scripted programs will start appearing, because production won't begin until scripts are completed, the AP reported. It will take at least four weeks for producers to get the first post-strike episodes of comedies back on the air; dramas will take six to eight weeks, the AP said. Verrone said the WGA achieved two of three goals through negotiations with the studios.  Watch Verrone explain what he thinks the strike accomplished ». The first goal relates to writers' \\"jurisdiction\\" in new media, Verrone said, meaning that any content written by guild members specifically for new media, such as the Internet or cell phones, will be covered by their contract. The second goal relates to reuse of content in new media, Verrone said. The agreement bases payment for reuses on a distributor's gross formula for residuals, \\"so that when they get paid, we get paid,\\" he said. It is the \\"first time in our history that a new delivery system pays on a residual formula superior to the prior existing system,\\" Verrone said. The third goal, which Verrone said the guild did not achieve, was to shore up writers' shares of the revenue from animation and reality television. \\"Giving up animation and reality was a heartbreaking thing for me personally,\\" he said. \\"But it was more important that we make a deal that benefited the membership, the town as a whole, that got people back to work and that solved the biggest problems in new media.\\" E-mail to a friend.

This is overproduced, euro-pop, U2-wannabe music with very little substance. Tom without Mark is half of a whole.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow.  Question: suppose there is less cloud cover happens, how will it affect LESS snow.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less To understand this answer, it is essential to first grasp the entire process of snow formation as outlined in the initial statement, and then to analyze how the presence of less cloud cover impacts each stage of the process. Snow forms through a series of steps that require specific atmospheric conditions to converge. The process commences when cold air, containing water vapor, cools to the point where tiny ice crystals start to form. Subsequently, these ice crystals interact and combine as they move through the air, eventually growing larger and amassing more ice particles. As this aggregation of ice crystals continues and becomes too unwieldy to stay in the atmosphere, snowflakes are generated. This results in the snowfall that reaches the ground. Cloud cover plays an integral role in the formation of snow. Clouds consist of water vapor, which is the essential ingredient for snow production. Clouds can also act as an insulator, trapping energy that keeps temperatures below the clouds colder. This aids in maintaining the optimal conditions for snow formation. Consequently, less cloud cover will have a direct impact on the amount of snowfall. Firstly, fewer clouds reduce the volume of water vapor available in the atmosphere. This directly impacts the earliest stages of the process, where ice crystals rely on atmospheric water vapor to develop. Secondly, decreased cloud cover also means there is less insulation to keep heat trapped, leading to warmer temperatures at ground level. This rise in temperature hinders the preservation of optimal conditions for snow formation, as temperatures must remain below freezing for ice crystals to form and accumulate. As a result, less cloud cover creates less favorable conditions for the formation and sustainment of snow. Reduced water vapor in the atmosphere and elevated temperatures at ground level both work against the process of creating snowfall. Thus, the correct answer is B: Less. With less cloud cover present, less snow will be produced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Dezember 1930 in Berlin) war ein deutscher Politiker der Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands (SPD).', 'David stand seit den 1890er Jahren auf dem rechten Parteiflügel. Nach ersten politischen und journalistischen Erfahrungen im Großherzogtum Hessen forderte er die Hinwendung der SPD zu ländlichen und bäuerlichen Wählergruppen. Im Revisionismusstreit verteidigte David die Thesen Eduard Bernsteins, der öffentlich zentrale Gesellschafts- und Revolutionsvorstellungen von Karl Marx bezweifelt hatte. Wie andere führende Sozialdemokraten aus Süddeutschland auch erstrebte David eine systematische Bündnispolitik mit gemäßigten Parteien und Gruppen des Bürgertums zur Durchsetzung von demokratischen und sozialen Forderungen. Diese Position wurde parteioffiziell bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs abgelehnt.', 'Die größte Wirkung entfaltete David in den Jahren von 1914 bis 1919. Er gilt als zentraler Wegbereiter der Burgfriedenspolitik, die für ein innenpolitisches Stillhalten während des Krieges sorgen sollte. David erhoffte sich ein Entgelten für die sozialdemokratische Stillhaltepolitik durch die Parlamentarisierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs. Mit der Oktoberreform von 1918 sah er sich am Ziel seines Weges. Auch persönlich erreichte er nun politische Spitzenämter. Er wurde zunächst Unterstaatssekretär, kurze Zeit darauf in der Weimarer Republik mehrfach Minister. Erst 1919 gab David seine Einschätzung auf, Deutschland habe im Ersten Weltkrieg einen Verteidigungskrieg geführt. Diese Annahme hatte zuvor die Basis seiner Politik gebildet.', 'Parlamentsmandate hielt David von 1896 an, zunächst auf Landesebene in Hessen, dann für den Deutschen Reichstag. Außerdem wurde er 1919 Mitglied der Nationalversammlung. Er war ihr erster Präsident und trat am 13. Februar in die Reichsregierung ein, in der er bis Juni 1920 blieb.', 'Jugend, Studium, Familie.', 'Eduard David kam als Sohn eines preußischen Rentmeisters zur Welt, wurde evangelisch getauft und wuchs in einer „erzkonservativen Beamtenfamilie“ auf. In Krofdorf nahe Gießen besuchte er die Volksschule. Die weitere Schulkarriere führte ihn auf Gymnasien in Gießen und Bielefeld. Noch vor dem Abitur unterbrach er seine Schullaufbahn und absolvierte in Berlin eine kaufmännische Lehre.', 'Nach Abschluss der Lehre holte er in Bielefeld das Abitur nach und nahm anschließend an der Ludwigsuniversität Gießen das Studium der Germanistik, Geschichte und Philosophie auf. Das Studium beendete er mit dem Staatsexamen für das höhere Lehramt. 1891 promovierte David zum Doktor der Philosophie mit einer Arbeit über „Die Wortbildung der Mundart von Krofdorf“. Während des Studiums trat er 1885 der Burschenschaft Arminia bei, die in Gießen im November 1885 neu gegründet worden war. Ihre Satzung wurde von David verfasst. Im Unterschied zur Praxis vieler anderer Burschenschaften gestattete sie die Aufnahme von Juden. Auch an der Formulierung der Satzung des liberalen Allgemeinen Deutschen Burschenbundes wirkte er mit. Er war auch Mitglied der Burschenschaft Neogermania Berlin.', '1891 trat David eine Stelle als Oberlehrer am Gymnasium in Gießen an. Im März 1894 bat er um Beurlaubung aus dem Schuldienst, weil sich seine inzwischen aufgenommene Tätigkeit für die SPD mit der Arbeit eines Beamten in Diensten des Großherzogtums Hessen kaum vertrug. Wenige Monate später folgte durch die Behörden seine endgültige Entlassung, nachdem er eine Anfrage, ob er sich für die Sozialdemokratie engagiere, positiv beantwortet hatte.', '1896 heiratete David Gertrud Swiderski, Tochter eines wohlhabenden Leipziger Ingenieurs und Maschinenfabrikbesitzers. Aus dieser Ehe ging seine Tochter Sonja hervor. Gertrud David arbeitete von 1907 bis 1916 in der Redaktion der Sozialistischen Monatshefte und gab zudem die \\"Socialstatistische Correspondenz\\" heraus. Später arbeitete sie als Filmregisseurin. 1911 wurde die Ehe gütlich geschieden, nachdem das Paar schon seit 1908 getrennt gelebt hatte. Im Juli 1918 verheiratete sich David mit Hermine Schmidt, einer Arzttochter aus dem badischen Lahr. Aus dieser Ehe ging sein Sohn Heinrich hervor.', 'Arbeit für die SPD bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg.', 'Politik im Großherzogtum Hessen.', 'Noch während seiner Zeit als Gymnasiallehrer engagierte sich David für die SPD in Hessen. Zusammen mit seinem ehemaligen Studienfreund Simon Katzenstein gründete er 1893 die \\"Mitteldeutsche Sonntagszeitung\\". Ihr Ziel war die Gewinnung von SPD-Wählern und -Mitgliedern in der Landbevölkerung, insbesondere unter Kleinbauern. Die erste Ausgabe der Zeitung wurde der regionalen Parteileitung in Frankfurt am Main vorgelegt. Dem skeptischen Hinweis, diese Ausgabe enthalte nicht ein einziges Mal den Begriff „Klassenkampf“, begegnete David erfolgreich mit dem Argument, genau dies erhöhe die Attraktivität des neuen Blattes in der Landbevölkerung. Im Übrigen verberge sich aber in jedem Satz der Zeitung der Klassenkampfgedanke. Zwei Jahre nach Gründung dieser Wochenzeitung gelang es David, den jungen Philipp Scheidemann als Redakteur zu gewinnen.', 'David wechselte 1896 nach Mainz, um dort als Redakteur der \\"Mainzer Volkszeitung\\" zu wirken. Die Mitarbeit in dieser sozialdemokratischen Parteizeitung war ebenfalls von kurzer Dauer, denn Eduard David errang bereits 1896 im Wahlkreis Friedberg-Büdingen einen Sitz in der \\"Zweiten Hessischen Ständekammer\\". Vor dem Hintergrund der mit diesem Parlamentssitz verbundenen Arbeit, der darüber hinausgehenden weiteren Parteiarbeit als SPD-Parteisekretär für das Großherzogtum Hessen ab 1897 sowie der eigenen schriftstellerischen Aktivitäten schied David 1897 aus der Mainzer Redaktion aus. Mainz blieb jedoch bis 1905 Lebensmittelpunkt Davids. Hier gründete er zusammen mit seiner Frau und weiteren Freunden 1899 die lokale Spar-, Produktions- und Konsumgenossenschaft.', 'In der Zweiten Kammer der Landstände des Großherzogtums Hessen, der er von 1896 bis 1908 (gewählt im Wahlbezirk Mainz I) angehörte, machte David insbesondere in Schul- und in Haushaltsdebatten auf sich aufmerksam. Politische Freunde nannten ihn anerkennend „unseren besten Mann im Felde“. Die im Vergleich zu Preußen und Sachsen liberalere politische Kultur des Großherzogtums Hessen prägte David nachhaltig, genauso wie die weniger auf Konfrontation zielende politische Kultur Süddeutschlands beispielsweise Georg von Vollmar in Bayern formte oder Ludwig Frank in Baden.', 'Engagement für Mutterschutz und Sexualreform.', 'Gemeinsam mit der Sexualreformerin Helene Stöcker, mit der er bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg befreundet war, engagierte sich Eduard David für Mutterschutz und Sexualreformen. Er publizierte in dem Organ des Bundes für Mutterschutz, der Neuen Generation, und hielt Vorträge zu dem Thema. Auch im Reichstag plädierte er immer wieder für diese Ziele.', 'Agrarpolitiker.', 'David hielt es für notwendig, neben der Industriearbeiterschaft auch andere Bevölkerungskreise für die sozialdemokratische Arbeiterbewegung zu interessieren, insbesondere in den überwiegend agrarischen Landesteilen. Schon mit der Gründung der \\"Mitteldeutschen Sonntagszeitung\\" war eine Stoßrichtung vorgegeben, die David über Jahrzehnte verfolgen sollte. Seine intensiven Studien der besonderen wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Verhältnisse auf dem Land und in der Landwirtschaft führten ihn in der Agrarfrage zu Thesen, die er parteiweit in Büchern, Aufsätzen und Reden nachdrücklich artikulierte. Den Kern seiner Annahmen bildete die These, dass die Entwicklungstendenzen in der Industrie nicht automatisch die der Landwirtschaft seien. Zwischen diesen beiden Wirtschaftssektoren gebe es deutliche Unterschiede. Bäuerliche Kleinbetriebe seien ferner keineswegs in allen agrarischen Produktionszweigen durch Konzentrations- und Industrialisierungstendenzen zum Untergang verurteilt; in bestimmten agrarischen Arbeitsfeldern sei der Kleinbetrieb keine untergehende, sondern im Gegenteil eine zukunftsfähige Unternehmensform. Klein- und Familienbetriebe böten nach Ansicht Davids außerdem gute Möglichkeiten für eine rationelle Unternehmensführung. Die Unterstützung solcher Betriebe sei darum langfristig nicht aussichtslos – im Gegenteil, die Förderung solcher Betriebsformen sei vielmehr sinnvoll und erforderlich, weil diese Betriebe zu einer besseren Ernährungsversorgung der Bevölkerung beitragen würden. Schließlich seien genossenschaftliche Organisationsformen in der Landwirtschaft eine Brücke zu den Verbrauchergenossenschaften in den Städten.', 'David meldete sich auf dem Frankfurter Parteitag der SPD in der Agrarfrage zu Wort. Dieser Parteitag, der vom 21. bis 27. Oktober 1894 tagte, war der erste, für den David ein Mandat erhalten hatte. Zusammen mit Gleichgesinnten forderte er die Ergänzung des Erfurter Programms durch ein Agrarprogramm, das die Interessen der Landarbeiter und der Kleinbauern aufnehmen sollte. Der Parteitag beschloss daraufhin, eine Kommission zur Ausarbeitung eines Programmentwurfs zu berufen. Ihr gehörte David an. In den folgenden Monaten erarbeitete diese Kommission auf der Basis von Studien dreier regionaler Unterausschüsse einen entsprechenden Vorschlag. David gehörte der Teilgruppe an, die unter der Federführung Georg von Vollmars die kleinbäuerlichen Strukturen in Süddeutschland untersuchte. Er trug auf dem Breslauer Parteitag (6.–12. Oktober 1895) die Ergebnisse und die programmatischen Schlussfolgerungen dieses Unterausschusses vor. Obwohl sich August Bebel hinter den Programmvorschlag der Agrarkommission gestellt hatte und sich vor den Delegierten für die Annahme dieses Agrarprogramms aussprach, scheiterte es an der Parteitagsmehrheit. Sie hielt es für falsch, Landarbeitern und Kleinbauern eine Verbesserung ihrer Lebensverhältnisse durch Unterstützung ihres Privateigentums in Aussicht zu stellen. Das sei der Revolution abträglich, dem „Ausbeuterstaat“ liefere man mit der Forderung nach entsprechenden staatlichen Unterstützungsprogrammen nur neue Machtmittel. Der Antrag zur Ablehnung des Agrarprogramms war von Karl Kautsky, dem damals führenden Theoretiker in der SPD, entworfen und unter anderem von Paul Singer, Ignaz Auer, Clara Zetkin, Richard Fischer und Arthur Stadthagen unterzeichnet worden. Eine Folge dieses Beschlusses war, dass anderen Parteien bei der politischen Agitation in der Landbevölkerung viele Jahre lang der Vortritt gelassen wurde.

Suleri's feminist approach is evident in her exploration of the themes of sisterhood, motherhood, and female agency. She describes the complexities and contradictions of the relationships between women in her family, as well as the challenges faced by her mother as a woman in a male-dominated society. Suleri also examines the ways in which women negotiate patriarchal power structures and subvert them to carve out spaces for themselves. Moreover, Suleri uses her memoir as a platform to critique the ways in which Pakistani culture perpetuates gender inequality. She exposes the oppressive nature of patriarchal norms, which limit women's freedom and agency, and she reflects on how these norms have affected her own life and identity as a woman.

Jahrhunderts, das zur Grundausstattung vieler deutscher Haushalte gehörte. Die vielen heute noch antiquarisch erhältlichen Exemplare zeigen, dass das Buch rege benutzt und mit Anmerkungen versehen wurde. Viele Familien vererbten das \\"Praktische Kochbuch\\" von Generation zu Generation weiter.', 'Das Kochbuch war jedoch nur ein Teil eines umfassenden Erziehungs- und Bildungsprogramms, das Henriette Davidis für Mädchen und Frauen konzipierte. Von der Puppenköchin über die junge unverheiratete Frau bis zur Hausfrau mit eigener Verantwortung für Haushalt und Personal boten Henriette Davidis’ Bücher sich als Lehrbücher und Nachschlagewerke an. Dahinter stand wohl die Erkenntnis, dass die Tätigkeit der Hausfrau ein eigener anspruchsvoller Beruf war, auf den die jungen Frauen des neu entstehenden Bürgertums oft nur unzureichend vorbereitet waren.', 'Davidis war, während sie ihre Bücher verfasste, selbst als Hauswirtschaftslehrerin, Erzieherin und Gouvernante, später nur noch als Autorin tätig. Obwohl ihre Bücher, insbesondere das \\"Praktische Kochbuch,\\" das im Jahr ihres Todes bereits in 21. Auflage erschien, schon zu ihren Lebzeiten sehr erfolgreich waren, konnte sie von den Erträgen nur ein eher bescheidenes Leben führen und bezog erst im Alter von 74 Jahren eine eigene Wohnung. Gelegentlich wird angegeben, „Henriette Davidis“ sei ein Pseudonym einer Helena Clemen, in Wirklichkeit handelte es sich bei Helena Clemen jedoch um eine Leserin, die Anregungen an die Autorin gesandt hatte, die auch verwendet wurden.', 'Heute erinnert das Henriette-Davidis-Museum in Wetter-Wengern mit Ausstellungen über Kochbücher und einer Schriftenreihe an sie. Das Deutsche Kochbuchmuseum im Westfalenpark in Dortmund widmet ihr ebenfalls einen großen Teil seiner Ausstellung. Teile eines steinernen Herdes, der aus dem Pfarrhaus in Wengern stammt, wurden mit einer Gedenktafel in das Widerlager der 1934 fertiggestellten Eisenbahnbrücke der Elbschetalbahn bei Wengern eingemauert, wo sie noch heute zu sehen sind. Das Pfarrhaus hatte dem Bau der Brücke weichen müssen.', 'Leben.', 'Jugend und Ausbildung.', 'Henriette Davidis wurde 1801 im westfälischen Wengern an der Ruhr, heute einem Stadtteil von Wetter, als zehntes von dreizehn Kindern des Pfarrers Ernst Heinrich Davidis und seiner holländischen Ehefrau Maria Katharina Litthauer geboren. Ernst Heinrich Davidis war 1780 in Amsterdam ordiniert worden, hatte neun Jahre in der niederländischen Stadt Breda als Garnisonsprediger gearbeitet und danach eine Stelle als Hilfsprediger in Wengern angetreten. 1792 übernahm er die Pfarrstelle.', 'Nach der Konfirmation verließ Henriette 1816 ihr Elternhaus und zog zu ihrer Schwester Elisabeth nach Schwelm, die dort mit dem Schlossherrn von Haus Martfeld verheiratet war. In Schwelm besuchte Henriette Davidis zwei Jahre lang die höhere Töchterschule. Sie kehrte 1818 in ihr Elternhaus zurück. Auch dort war sie Schülerin einer privaten höheren Töchterschule. Später zog sie nach Bommern zu ihrer Schwester Albertine, um in deren Landgut und mit der Erziehung der vier Kinder zu helfen. Als ihr Vater 1828 starb, kehrte sie nach Wengern zurück und kümmerte sich um ihre Mutter, bis diese 1838 ebenfalls starb. Danach begleitete sie eine kranke Dame in die Schweiz, bevor sie um 1840 nach Windheim zog.', 'Von 1841 bis 1848 arbeitete Henriette Davidis im Haus Heine als Erzieherin an einer Mädchenarbeitsschule in Sprockhövel. Während dieser Zeit erschien 1845 ihr \\"Praktisches Kochbuch. Zuverlässige und selbstgeprüfte Recepte der gewöhnlichen und feineren Küche,\\" 1847 und 1848 folgten die \\"Arrangements zu kleinen und größeren Gesellschaften\\" und die \\"Praktische Anweisung zur Bereitung des Roßfleisches,\\" die später als Anhang im \\"Praktischen Kochbuch\\" aufgingen. Für das \\"Praktische Kochbuch\\" hatte Davidis umfangreiche Recherchen betrieben und über einen längeren Zeitraum Rezepte zusammengetragen.', 'Arbeit als Lehrerin und Autorin.', 'Nach der Zeit in Sprockhövel arbeitete Henriette Davidis in Bremen als Erzieherin und Gouvernante. 1855 zog sie wieder nach Bommern zu ihrer Schwester Albertine, wo sie bis 1857 blieb. In dieser Zeit muss sie sich, möglicherweise durch den Erfolg des Kochbuches beflügelt, entschlossen haben, neben dem reinen Kochbuch auch eine umfassendere Hauswirtschaftslehre sowie erzieherische Schriften für junge Mädchen und Frauen zu verfassen. 1850 erschien dann \\"Der Gemüsegarten\\" als Teil I eines geplanten \\"Vollständigen Haushaltsbuches;\\" im selben Jahr verfasste sie auch noch ein unveröffentlichtes Buch über die Krankenpflege; es folgten 1856 \\"Puppenköchin Anna,\\" 1857 \\"Die Jungfrau\\" und 1858 \\"Puppenmutter Anna.\\" Das geplante mehrbändige Haushaltungsbuch kam allerdings nicht zustande. Nach einem Band mit Gedichten und Novellen erschien 1861 \\"Die Hausfrau. Praktische Anleitung zur selbständigen und sparsamen Führung des Haushaltes,\\" das den Abschluss des Bildungsprogramms für die angehende Hausfrau bildete.', 'Im Mai 1857 zog sie nach Dortmund, wo sie bis zu ihrem Tod lebte, zunächst zur Untermiete, später in einer eigenen Wohnung. Spätestens jetzt konnte sie vermutlich von ihren Veröffentlichungen leben. Neben der Arbeit an \\"Jungfrau\\" und \\"Hausfrau\\" überarbeitete sie ihre früheren Werke, die sich bereits gut verkauften, für neue Auflagen. Ab den 1860er Jahren schrieb Henriette Davidis, die nun bereits als anerkannte Autorität in Hauswirtschaftsfragen gegolten haben dürfte, auch regelmäßig für Zeitschriften wie \\"Daheim,\\" eine nach dem Vorbild der \\"Gartenlaube\\" gestaltete Zeitschrift, die sich an ein bürgerliches Publikum richtete und von 1865 bis 1944 erschien. In dieser Zeit veröffentlichte sie auch noch zwei weitere kleinere Schriften: \\"Diätetik für Hausfrauen. Die Gesundheits- und Krankenpflege im Hause …\\" und \\"Kraftküche von Liebig’s Fleischextract für höhere und unbemittelte Verhältnisse.\\" Letztere war eine im Auftrag der Firma Liebig abgefasste Werbeschrift, die die Darstellung der Vorzüge des neuentwickelten Liebig’schen Fleischextraktes mit dem „Gütesiegel“ der Fachfrau Davidis geschickt kombinierte.', 'Henriette Davidis blieb unverheiratet (zwei Verlobte starben jeweils, bevor es zur Heirat kam) und lebte selbst nicht das Leben der sich selbst zurücknehmenden hingebungsvollen Hausfrau, das sie in ihren Büchern propagierte. Als berufstätige Frau und erfolgreiche Autorin setzte sie sich scheinbar selbst in Widerspruch zu ihren Werken. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch heute nicht mehr zu ermitteln, auch weil das im Sommer 1874 erstellte Manuskript der Autorin \\"Erinnerungen aus meinem Leben und Wirken\\" ungedruckt blieb und verschollen ist. Henriette Davidis starb am 3. April 1876 in Dortmund. Ihr Grab befindet sich auf dem Dortmunder Ostenfriedhof.', 'Auseinandersetzungen mit den Verlegern.', 'Henriette Davidis war als Autorin des \\"Praktischen Kochbuchs\\" zunächst nicht in einer verhandlungsstarken Position gegenüber dem Verlag Velhagen &amp; Klasing, bei dem ihr erstes Werk erschien. Wie den meisten Autoren ging es ihr wohl zuallererst darum, das Buch überhaupt zu veröffentlichen. Vermutlich war sie weder über das erst im Entstehen begriffene Urheberrecht noch über gängige Honorare informiert und wurde als Frau von den Verlegern als Vertragspartnerin auch nicht allzu ernst genommen, denn sie übereignete dem Verlag das Kochbuch gegen ein Honorar von 450 Talern als Eigentum, ohne sich weitere Rechte an dem Text vorzubehalten. Später warf sie den Verlegern vor: „Gänzliche Unkunde in solchen Sachen, wie sie mir damals eigen war, konnte nur auf einen Kontract wie der unsrige eingehen (…),“ denn am Verkaufserfolg des Buches war sie nicht beteiligt und erhielt auch für die Überarbeitungen nur vergleichsweise geringe Honorare (50 Taler für die 2. Auflage, später 100, nach der 5. Auflage 200 Taler). Schon 1856 war sie jedoch so erfahren, dass sie das Puppenkochbuch bei Grote in Dortmund erscheinen ließ, weil ihr das von Velhagen &amp; Klasing gebotene Honorar zu niedrig war.', 'Bei der Überarbeitung der 12. Auflage des \\"Praktischen Kochbuchs,\\" für die sie wieder nur 200 Taler erhalten sollte, kam es 1867 zum Streit mit dem Verlag: „Miete, Steuer, sparsamen Lebensunterhalt, Kleidung und andere Ausgaben; niemals konnte ich davon erübrigen (…) während Sie, meine Herren, die reifen Früchte meiner Mühen genießen.“ Der Verlag reagierte schließlich auf die selbstbewusste Beschwerde mit einer Erhöhung des Honorars auf 300 Taler. Es folgten weitere Überarbeitungen, Erweiterungen und Auseinandersetzungen über Inhalt und Ausstattung des Buches, bis Henriette Davidis sich nach der erheblich erweiterten 20. Auflage bei den Verlegern schließlich im Juli 1875 für erhaltene 1000 Taler bedanken konnte.', 'Bedeutung als Autorin.', 'Henriette Davidis’ Werke lassen sich unter die \\"Frauen-Literatur\\" einordnen, wie sie in Form von Anstandsbüchern und Ratgebern, aber auch Lyrikanthologien, Zitatenschätzen und ganzen Bibliotheken speziell für Frauen aufbereiteter Klassiker in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts einen großen Teil des Buchmarktes beherrschte. Diese oftmals von Frauen für Frauen verfassten Haushaltungsbücher und Frauen-Breviere wirkten „neben ihrer originären Ratgeber- und Trostfunktion … norm- und systemerhaltend“. Auch wenn ihr eigener Lebensweg einer berufstätigen Frau als eher untypisch gelten kann und sie sich, wie die erhaltene Korrespondenz mit ihren Verlegern beweist, durchaus zu behaupten wusste, bewegte sich Henriette Davidis mit ihren Werken innerhalb eines vorgegebenen Rahmens gesellscha","output":"ftlicher Normen und Werte und vermittelte diese an Frauen und Mädchen.

Bekannt war sie vor allem für die Darstellung komplexer Charaktere. Auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Karriere spielte Davis überwiegend in Filmdramen mit, deren Handlung sich zumeist um das tragische Schicksal der weiblichen Hauptfigur dreht. Sie war jedoch auch in Historienfilmen und in der Spätphase ihrer Karriere in Filmproduktionen, deren starke Grand-Guignol-Elemente mitunter die Grenze zum Horrorfilm streiften, zu sehen. Davis’ Markenzeichen waren die großen, ausdrucksstarken Augen, ihre direkte Art und ihre allgegenwärtigen Zigaretten.', 'Bette Davis gewann zweimal den Oscar als Beste Hauptdarstellerin und wurde acht weitere Male für den Preis in dieser Kategorie nominiert. Sie kämpfte stets mit Vehemenz gegen die Restriktionen des Studiosystems und um gute Rollen und mehr Mitspracherechte bei der Auswahl der Filmrollen. 1936 verklagte sie, wenn auch vergeblich, in einem aufsehenerregenden Prozess ihr Filmstudio Warner Brothers. Als erste Frau stand Bette Davis der Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences als Präsidentin vor. Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs gründete sie mit anderen Schauspielern die \\"Hollywood Canteen\\".', 'Als erste Filmschauspielerin wurde Bette Davis 1977 mit dem Lifetime Achievement Award des American Film Institutes (AFI) geehrt. Bei einer Umfrage des AFI aus dem Jahr 1999 wurde sie auf Platz zwei der größten amerikanischen weiblichen Filmstars gewählt. Sie war trotz diverser Krankheiten bis zu ihrem Tod eine Person des öffentlichen Lebens und trat aufgrund ihrer Beliebtheit beim Publikum häufig in amerikanischen Talkshows auf.', '1983 schrieb Davis’ Tochter B. D. Hyman in dem stark umstrittenen Enthüllungsbuch \\"My Mother’s Keeper\\" über ihre negativen Kindheitserinnerungen.', 'Leben und Werk.', 'Kindheit und frühe Karriere.', 'Ruth Elizabeth Davis wurde in Lowell, Massachusetts, als Tochter von Ruth („Ruthie“) Favor und dem Rechtsanwalt Harlow Morrell Davis geboren. Ihre Schwester Barbara („Bobby“) wurde am 25. Oktober 1909 geboren. Die Familie war protestantischer Konfession und hatte englische, französische sowie walisische Wurzeln. 1915 trennten sich Davis’ Eltern. Im selben Jahr begann für die beiden Kinder die Schule an der \\"Crestalban School\\" in Lanesborough, Massachusetts.', 'Im Jahr 1921 zog Ruth Favor mit ihren Töchtern nach New York City, wo sie als professionelle Porträtfotografin arbeitete, um die Familie zu ernähren. Zu dieser Zeit äußerte Davis zum ersten Mal den Wunsch, Schauspielerin zu werden. Inspiriert wurde sie vor allem durch Rudolph Valentino in \\"Die vier Reiter der Apokalypse\\" (1921) und Mary Pickford in \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\" (1921), auch änderte sie ihren Namen in „Bette“ in Anlehnung an Honoré de Balzacs \\"La Cousine Bette\\". 1924 schickte Ruth Favor Davis ihre Töchter auf das \\"Northfield Seminary for Young Ladies\\", ein konfessionelles Mädchenpensionat. Ein Semester später wechselten die Mädchen auf die \\"Cushing Academy\\", eine Internatsschule in Ashburnham in Massachusetts.', '1926 sah Davis am \\"Repertory Theatre\\" in Boston eine Theaterproduktion von Henrik Ibsens \\"Die Wildente\\" mit Peg Entwistle in der Hauptrolle. Jahre danach sagte sie über die Aufführung: „Vor der Vorstellung wollte ich Schauspielerin werden. Danach musste ich Schauspielerin werden… genau wie Peg Entwistle.“ Davis nahm an einem Vorsprechen für die Aufnahme in Eva Le Galliennes \\"Manhattan Civic Repertory\\" teil. Le Gallienne befand jedoch, dass Davis’ Einstellung zum Theater nicht ernsthaft genug sei, und lehnte die Aufnahme ab. Später wurde Davis, auch durch den Einsatz ihrer Mutter, an der \\"John Murray Anderson School of Theatre\\" angenommen. So durfte Davis die Schule zunächst ohne Bezahlung besuchen, unter dem Versprechen, das Geld zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt zurückzuzahlen. Davis erhielt an der Schule unter anderem Tanzunterricht von Martha Graham.', 'Später verließ Davis die \\"Murray Anderson School\\" vorzeitig, obwohl sie ein Stipendium für das Studium erhalten hatte, um am \\"Provincetown Playhouse\\" für den Regisseur James Light zu arbeiten. Die Inszenierung wurde allerdings immer wieder verschoben und sie musste sich vorübergehend nach einem neuen Engagement umsehen. Sie sprach für George Cukors Repertoire-Theatergesellschaft vor. Obwohl er nicht begeistert war, gab er Davis ihre erste bezahlte Theaterrolle als Revuetänzerin in dem Stück \\"Broadway\\". Kurze Zeit darauf verletzte sich die weibliche Hauptdarstellerin Rose Lerner bei einer Aufführung und Davis durfte den Part übernehmen.', 'Cukor und Davis hatten während ihrer Zusammenarbeit ein angespanntes Verhältnis. Seine Kritik und Ratschläge bezüglich ihrer Arbeit ließ Davis selten unkommentiert. Schließlich feuerte er sie. Nach dem darauffolgenden Sommer begannen die Arbeiten am \\"Provincetown Playhouse Theatre\\" in New York City für das Stück \\"The Earth Between\\" von Eugene O’Neill. Gegen Ende der Spielzeit wurde Bette Davis ausgewählt, die \\"Hedwig\\" in Ibsens \\"Die Wildente\\" zu spielen. Die \\"Washington Post\\" lobte sie für ihre „exzellente“ Darstellung und widmete ihr als Theater-„Neuentdeckung“ ein kurzes Porträt. Anschließend an ihr Engagement dort gab Davis 1929 ihr Broadway-Debüt als rebellische Tochter von Donald Meek in der Komödie \\"Broken Dishes\\", gefolgt von der Satire \\"Solid South\\". Während einer Aufführung war ein Talentsucher der Universal Studios anwesend und lud sie zu Probeaufnahmen für die geplante Verfilmung des Bühnenstücks \\"Strictly Dishonorable\\" nach Hollywood ein.', 'Von der Bühne zum Film 1931.', 'Davis erhielt die Rolle in \\"Strictly Dishonorable\\" (1931) nicht und auch für den Film \\"A House Divided\\" (1931) konnte sie sich nicht empfehlen. Davis wurde allerdings zum Testen weiterer Bewerber eingesetzt. In einem 1971 geführten Interview mit Dick Cavett erinnerte sie sich: „Ich war die […] schamhafteste Jungfrau, die jemals auf der Erde lebte. Sie legten mich auf eine Couch und ich testete fünfzehn Männer […] Sie mussten sich alle auf mich legen und mir einen leidenschaftlichen Kuss geben. Oh, ich dachte, ich muss sterben.“', 'Ihr Filmdebüt gab Davis schließlich in dem Remake \\"The Bad Sister\\" (1931), welches keinen großen Erfolg darstellte. Carl Laemmle, der damalige Chef der Universal Studios, wollte ihren Vertrag daraufhin nicht verlängern, doch der Kameramann Karl Freund bescheinigte ihm, dass Davis „reizende Augen“ habe, und so erhielt sie doch noch eine Vertragsverlängerung. Davis’ nächste Rolle in \\"Meine Kinder – mein Glück\\" (1931) war allerdings zu klein, um damit Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen, und auch kleine Nebenrollen in \\"Waterloo Bridge\\" (1931) und \\"Way Back Home\\" (1932) verhalfen ihr nicht zum Durchbruch im Filmgeschäft. Anschließend arbeitete sie im Rahmen eines Loan-Outs bei Columbia Pictures für den Film \\"The Menace\\" (1932) und bei Capital Films für \\"Hell’s House\\" (1932).', 'Nach neun Monaten und sechs eher wenig erfolgreichen Filmen entschied Laemmle, ihren Vertrag nicht weiter zu verlängern. Davis’ Hollywood-Karriere schien beendet, doch der einflussreiche Schauspieler George Arliss wählte sie für die weibliche Hauptrolle in \\"The Man Who Played God\\" (1932) aus. Der Film brachte Davis ihre erste ernstzunehmende Anerkennung in Hollywood ein. Die \\"Saturday Evening Post\\" schrieb über ihren Auftritt, sie sei nicht nur schön, sondern sprudele förmlich vor Anmut, und verglich sie mit Constance Bennett und Olive Borden. Die Warner-Brothers-Studios gaben ihr anschließend einen Vertrag mit einer Laufzeit von 26 Wochen mit der Option auf eine Verlängerung auf fünf Jahre. 1932 heiratete Davis in erster Ehe den Bandleader Harmon Nelson.', 'Durch ein erneutes Loan-Out erhielt Davis 1934 die Möglichkeit, die Rolle der Antiheldin Mildred Rogers in der RKO-Radio-Produktion \\"Of Human Bondage\\" zu übernehmen. Mildred, eine Kellnerin aus der Unterschicht, nutzt ihren verkrüppelten Liebhaber, gespielt von Leslie Howard, finanziell und sexuell aus und verlässt ihn mehrfach wegen anderer Männer. Das Studio hatte Schwierigkeiten, eine geeignete Schauspielerin für die Rolle zu finden, nachdem unter anderem die vorgesehene Ann Harding die Mitwirkung verweigert hatte. Davis bekam die Rolle und schaffte es, den Regisseur zu überzeugen, sie den Charakter möglichst realistisch spielen zu lassen. Am Ende erhielt Bette Davis teilweise hymnische Kritiken. So urteilte das Life-Magazin über ihren Auftritt: „Wahrscheinlich die beste Darstellung, die jemals von einer US-Schauspielerin auf der Leinwand gezeigt wurde.“ Davis erwartete, dass die positiven Rezensionen Warner Brothers ermutigen würden, ihr bessere Rollen anzubieten. Die Hoffnung zerschlug sich jedoch und Jack Warner weigerte sich unter anderem, sie für den Film \\"Es geschah in einer Nacht\\" (1934) auszuleihen. Für Bette Davis waren weiterhin nur Rollen in kostengünstig produzierten Standardfilmen wie \\"Housewife\\" oder Nebenrollen neben etablierten männlichen Stars wie Paul Muni in \\"Stadt an der Grenze\\" vorgesehen.', 'Als Davis für ihre Leistung in \\"Of Human Bondage\\" nicht für den Oscar nominiert wurde, löste dies breite Proteste aus. Aufgrund des Aufruhrs im Vorfeld der Verleihung konnte zum einzigen Mal in der Geschichte des Academy Awards ein Kandidat gewählt werden, der ursprünglich nicht offiziell nominiert war. Am Ende gewann Claudette Colbert den Preis für \\"Es geschah in einer Nacht\\". Nach der Preisverleihung wurde eine Änderung des Abstimmungsverfahrens festgelegt. Die Nominierungen werden seitdem nicht mehr durch ein kleines Komitee festgelegt, sondern durch alle in Frage kommenden Vertreter der Branche ausgewählt.', '1935 spielte Davis im Film \\"Dangerous\\" eine gescheiterte Schauspielerin und erhielt wieder sehr gute Rezensionen. Die \\"New York Times\\" bezeichnete sie sogar als „eine unserer interessantesten Filmschauspielerinnen.“ Für ihre Darstellung gewann Davis den Academy Award als beste Hauptdarstellerin, sie kommentierte dies aber als eine verspätete Anerkennung für ihre Leistung in \\"Of Human Bondage\\". Seit dieser Zeit gab sie stets an, sie habe dem Academy Award den Spitznamen „Oscar“ gegeben. Die Statue sehe ihrer Meinung nach genauso aus wie ihr Ehemann, dessen zweiter Vorname Oscar lautete. Diese Behauptung wies die Academy of Motion","output":"Picture Arts and Sciences jedoch später zurück.', 'Davis’ Erfolg setzte sich fort und sie erhielt weitere gute Rollen in bedeutenden Filmen wie \\"Jezebel\\" (1938), für den sie erneut den Oscar als beste Hauptdarstellerin erhielt, und \\"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\\" (1962), der als Klassiker des Horror-Genres gilt.', 'Davis war eine wichtige Vertreterin der Schauspielkunst und setzte sich stets für die Verbesserung der Arbeitsbedingungen von Schauspielern ein. Sie starb im Alter von 81 Jahren an Brustkrebs in Frankreich und wurde auf dem Forest-Lawn-Friedhof in Los Angeles beigesetzt. Ihre Leistung und Bedeutung als Schauspielerin wurden und werden bis heute gewürdigt.

Das 1983 vom Independent-Label Aggressive Rockproduktionen verlegte Album gilt als das erste Punkalbum der DDR, erschien jedoch offiziell nur im Westen. Jahrelang war es die einzige Veröffentlichung dieser Art. Die Entstehung des Albums beschäftigte das Ministerium für Staatssicherheit über mehrere Jahre, wobei die Repressionen fast ausschließlich die Band Schleim-Keim betrafen. Zwei Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter (IM) waren an der Entstehung beteiligt, unter anderem der damals sehr geschätzte alternative Schriftsteller Sascha Anderson.', 'Entstehungsgeschichte.', 'Dimitri Hegemann vom Westberliner Stadtmagazin \\"tip\\" hatte die Band Rosa Extra auf einer Party 1982 in Ost-Berlin kennengelernt. Überrascht davon, dass es eine Art Gegenkultur in der DDR gab, wuchs in ihm die Idee einer Plattenproduktion im Westen. So besuchte er Karl-Ulrich Walterbach von Aggressive Rockproduktionen und konnte ihn von der Idee überzeugen. Hegemann hatte eine Einreiseerlaubnis nach Ost-Berlin und konnte so den Entstehungsprozess des Albums verfolgen. Da Rosa Extra das Projekt aber nicht alleine bewerkstelligen konnten und auf Hilfe angewiesen waren, wandte sich die Gruppe an Sascha Anderson. Der freie Schriftsteller verfügte über zahlreiche Kontakte zu intellektuellen und künstlerischen Kreisen, die sich gegen das DDR-Regime auflehnten. Seine eigene Band Zwitschermaschine wurde schließlich die zweite Gruppe, die sich an dem Album, das nun als Split-Veröffentlichung geplant war, beteiligen sollte. Sascha Anderson verfasste außerdem ein Essay, das den Zeitgeist des DDR-Undergrounds widerspiegeln sollte und von seiner Gruppe handelte. Das Essay wurde später im Inlay veröffentlicht. Sören „Egon“ Naumann wurde in den Plan miteinbezogen, der Fahrer und Techniker kannte sich mit den Aufnahmetechniken aus und erklärte sich bereit, die Lieder zu produzieren. Man beschloss eine weitere Band zu verpflichten und baute daher Kontakte zu Dieter „Otze“ Ehrlich von Schleim-Keim auf. Die im Gegensatz zu Zwitschermaschine und Rosa Extra eher wütend-aggressive Band sollte als Ergänzung zum eher künstlerischen Stil der beiden Bands mit aufgenommen werden.', 'Anfang 1983 fand Anderson ein Heimstudio in Hermsdorf bei Dresden, in dem die Lieder aufgenommen werden konnten. Andeck Baumgärtel, Bluesmusiker bei der Gruppe „Mustang“, hatte sich zu Hause im Erdgeschoss ein Privatstudio aufgebaut. Auch ein Schlagzeug der tschechischen Marke „Amati“ war vorhanden. Die Studiotechnik war nicht optimal und auch nicht auf dem neuesten Stand. Insbesondere das Mischpult von „Vermona“ funktionierte nicht richtig, und auch die Plastikmikrofone zur Schlagzeugabnahme fielen öfter aus. Lediglich das Gesangsmikro von RFT war auf dem neuesten Stand. Mitgeschnitten wurde auf Teslabandmaschinen mit Magnetbändern von ORWO. Die Aufnahmen fanden an einem Januarwochenende 1983 statt.', 'Die erste Aufnahmesession bestritten Rosa Extra, die einen echten Casio-Synthesizer mitbrachten – damals eine Seltenheit in der DDR. Die komplette Probe wurde aufgezeichnet und zur späteren Verwendung archiviert. Schleim-Keim, die im Gegensatz zu den anderen beiden Bands in einer für den Punk üblichen Besetzung (Gitarre, Bass, Schlagzeug) waren, kamen am nächsten Tag. Sie spielten einen schnellen und auch simplen Punkstil, der vor allem auf Härte setzte. Schlagzeug und Gesang wurde von Dieter Ehrlich eingespielt, an der Gitarre war sein Bruder Klaus, und den Bass übernahm Andreas Deubach. Als letztes spielten Zwitschermaschine ihre Lieder ein. Die Besetzung war Sascha Anderson, Cornelia Schleime und Michael Rom am Mikrofon, Lothar Fiedler an der Gitarre, Matthias Zeidler am Bass und Wolfgang Grossmann am Schlagzeug. Volker Palma spielte Violine und Posaune.', 'Kurz nach Beendigung der Aufnahmen wurde Günther Spalda von Rosa Extra vom Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (MfS) aufgesucht. Dies war kein Zufall, hatte das Ministerium doch durch die Inoffiziellen Mitarbeiter (IMs) Sascha Anderson und Sören Naumann von der Produktion der Platte erfahren. Das MfS bedrohte die Gruppe mit fünf bis zehn Jahren Haft, falls sie nicht das Band mit ihren Aufnahmen ablieferten. Die Gruppe, an der auch die freien Schriftsteller Bert Papenfuß-Gorek und Stefan Döring beteiligt waren, versuchte zu der Zeit, die staatliche Einstufung zu erlangen. Die einzige Möglichkeit in der DDR, als Berufsmusiker anerkannt zu werden, Tonträger einzuspielen und offizielle Auftritte zu absolvieren, war diese Einstufung durch ein Gremium aus Funktionären der SED, Musikjournalisten, Musikwissenschaftlern und prominenten Musikern. Nach längerer Beratung entschlossen sich die Mitglieder deshalb, das Masterband dem MfS zu übergeben. Die Einstufung erreichte die Band später unter dem Namen Hard Pop.', 'Durch diese neuen Entwicklungen bekamen Schleim-Keim statt einer halben eine ganze LP-Seite zugesprochen. Schleim-Keim suchten sich einen Decknamen aus, damit die Aufnahmen ihnen nicht zugeordnet werden konnten. Zumindest das „SK“ als Abkürzung sollte stehenbleiben, so dass man sich nach „Salz-Kartoffel“ auf „Sau-Kerle“ einigte.', 'Die beiden verbliebenen Masterbänder wurden zu Günther Fischer, einem bekannten Komponisten, für den Anderson einige Texte geschrieben hatte, gebracht. Dieser überspielte die Aufnahmen von den ORWO- auf hochwertigere Magnetbänder, da die Qualität in der Bundesrepublik als veraltet galt. Durch Andersons Kontakte zu Diplomaten aus West-Berlin gelangten die Aufnahmen schließlich auf die andere Seite der Mauer. In West-Berlin wurde das Band an Ralf Kerbach, ehemaliges Mitglied von Zwitschermaschine und mittlerweile Staatsbürger der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, übergeben. Bis heute ist ungeklärt, ob Kerbach eine zusätzliche Gitarrenspur über die Aufnahmen seiner ehemaligen Band legte oder nicht. Die Aufnahmen wurden anschließend Karl-Ulrich Walterbach übergeben, der sich dann um die Veröffentlichung kümmerte.', 'Veröffentlichung.', 'Die Platte erschien 1983 unter der Seriennummer AG 0019 als LP. Die Erstauflage betrug je nach Quelle zwischen 1.500 und 4.000 Exemplaren.', 'Der Titel der LP lautete \\"DDR von unten\\", manchmal wird auch \\"eNDe\\" assoziiert, da sich diese Aufschrift sowohl auf dem Front- als auch auf dem Backcover befindet. Es gab auch Spekulationen, dass der Schriftzug \\"eNDe\\" Assoziationen zur Abkürzung ND für \\"Neues Deutschland\\", die Parteizeitung der SED, knüpfen sollte. Dies wird allerdings von Teilen der Bandmitglieder bestritten. Vielmehr sollte diese Veröffentlichung den Schlusspunkt von Zwitschermaschine markieren. Sicher ist allerdings, dass Sascha Anderson das Akrostichon bereits seit 1982 in diversen Gedichten verwendet hatte. Er bestätigte außerdem in seiner Biografie die erstere Deutung.', 'Die Schallplatte wurde nie in der DDR veröffentlicht. Nur wenige Exemplare gelangten in die DDR. Sascha Anderson konnte drei Exemplare in der Toilette eines Zuges verstecken und so einschmuggeln. Dieter Ehrlich hatte seine Schallplatte wohl aus dem Besitz von Anderson. Dieser soll ihm angeblich auch im Vorfeld Geld für die Produktion versprochen und vorenthalten haben, so dass Ehrlich bei ihm einbrach und neben der Platte 120 West-Mark stahl.

Eine CD-Version existiert daher nicht. Teile der Aufnahmen verwendete Sascha Anderson für eine weitere Split-Veröffentlichung mit dessen Gruppe „Fabrik“ unter dem Titel \\"Alles Geld der Welt kostet Geld\\" (1998) im CD-Format. Die Schleime-Komposition \\"geh übern fluß\\" wurde außerdem der Kompilation zum Buch \\"Spannung. Leistung. Widerstand.

Lediglich die beiden Titel \\"Ende\\" und \\"Alles ist rot\\" bleiben exklusiv der \\"DDR von unten\\" vorbehalten. Im Rahmen der Wiederveröffentlichung diverser Aufnahmen von Schleim-Keim auf Höhnie Records wurde deren Seite als limitierte EP der Vinyl-Version des Albums \\"Nichts Gewonnen Nichts Verloren Vol. 1 – Die Stotterheim-Tapes 1984–87\\" (2000) beigefügt. Die Titel wurden in eine andere Reihenfolge gebracht, außerdem firmierten sie nun unter den späteren Liednamen.', 'Covergestaltung.', 'Das Frontcover ist Teil von Kerbachs \\"Totenreklame-Zyklus\\", einer Bilderreihe, die er für den Gedichtband \\"totenreklame, eine Reise\\" von Sascha Anderson benutzt hatte. Das Bild, das wie die anderen Illustrationen dieses Zyklus während einer 7.000 km langen Reise durch die DDR entstand, wurde jedoch in der Gedichtsammlung nicht veröffentlicht. Das Cover zeigt eine anthropomorphe Tierfigur, die mit einem schlüsselförmigen Gegenstand auf einen unförmigen, rechteckigen Gegenstand einschlägt.

Suleri uses her own narrative and the stories of her family, friends, and Pakistan as a whole to expose the inequalities and oppressions that women face on numerous levels. In this way, Suleri’s memoir is an exemplary model of feminist literature, as the author challenges the patriarchal norms that have historically oppressed women in Pakistan. One of the primary aspects of feminist discourse that Suleri includes in her memoir is the intersectionality of oppression. In Meatless Days, Suleri recognizes that women are affected by numerous intersecting oppressions, such as race, class, and religion. For example, Suleri’s mother is personally challenged by the men around her who view her as an object and not as a person with feelings, emotions, and desires. Similarly, Suleri herself experiences the seriousness of intersectionality as she encounters racial prejudice when studying in the US. These experiences highlight the need to recognize how gender-based violence and discrimination are not separate from but are often compounded by larger social inequalities. Suleri’s feminist approach to writing is directly visible in Meatless Days through the use of a female perspective. In Pakistan, women were, and still are, not given priority, and their stories were often regarded as secondary to those of men. Suleri, however, places women’s lives under the spotlight, exploring their emotions, experiences, and relationships to tell their stories. She presents female characters who have their own voices and identities in defiance of the male-dominated social structure. Similarly, Suleri employs her own identity as a Pakistani woman to offer insight into cultural, social, and economic norms that have affected her existence. In conclusion, Suleri’s feminist approach to writing creates a significant contribution to feminist literature. Through her utilization of intersectionality, female perspectives, and questioning existing social structures, Suleri brings new insights and an original voice in a male-dominated industry. Thus, Meatless Days is not only a memoir of personal experiences but is also a revolutionary text that challenges the patriarchal norms and offers new possibilities for future generations of women."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Belgier', 'Ehrendoktor der Universität Montpellier', 'Ehrendoktor der Universität Nancy', 'Ehrendoktor der Universität Wien', 'Ehrendoktor einer Universität', 'Ehrenmitglied der Amerikanischen Gesellschaft für internationales Recht', 'Geboren 1884', 'Gestorben 1973', 'Hochschullehrer (Katholische Universität Löwen)', 'Hochschullehrer (Universität Gent)'], 'Charles Marie Joseph Désiré De Visscher (* 2. August 1884 in Gent; † 2. Januar 1973 in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre) war ein belgischer Jurist. Nach frühen Arbeiten im Zivil-, Sozial- und Arbeitsrecht wandte er sich unter dem Eindruck des Ersten Weltkrieges dem Völkerrecht zu und nahm in diesem Bereich im Laufe seiner Karriere eine Reihe von hochrangigen Positionen und Ämtern ein. So wirkte er als Juraprofessor an den Universitäten in Gent und Löwen sowie als Gastdozent an der University of Chicago und der Haager Akademie für Völkerrecht, deren Kuratorium er ab 1932 angehörte. Darüber hinaus war er Generalsekretär und Präsident des Institut de Droit international (Institut für Völkerrecht), ab 1923 Mitglied des Ständigen Schiedshofs in Den Haag sowie von 1937 bis 1946 Richter am Ständigen Internationalen Gerichtshof und von 1946 bis 1952 an dessen Nachfolgeinstitution, dem Internationalen Gerichtshof (IGH). Damit war er einer von zwei Richtern, die an beiden Gerichten tätig waren, sowie der bisher einzige Richter aus Belgien in der Geschichte des IGH.', 'Das völkerrechtliche Wirken von Charles De Visscher war damit sowohl durch akademische als auch durch praxisorientierte Aktivitäten geprägt. Er veröffentlichte eine Vielzahl an Beiträgen in verschiedenen Bereichen des internationalen Rechts, darunter einige inhaltlich bedeutsame Arbeiten zu neuen Aspekten wie beispielsweise in den 1930er Jahren zum Schutz von Kulturgut bei bewaffneten Konflikten und nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg zum Konzept der Menschenrechte. Sein Hauptwerk, das 1953 veröffentlichte Buch \\"Théories et réalités en droit international public\\" (Theorie und Wirklichkeit des Völkerrechts), wurde im selben Jahr zur herausragendsten Neuerscheinung im Bereich des Völkerrechts gewählt und galt bereits wenige Jahre später als Klassiker. Aufgrund seines Wirkens zählte Charles De Visscher in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts sowohl in Belgien als auch international zu den wichtigsten Juristen im Bereich des Völkerrechts. Er wurde 1954 zum fünften und bisher letzten Ehrenpräsidenten in der Geschichte des Institut de Droit international ernannt und war darüber hinaus Ehrenmitglied der Amerikanischen Gesellschaft für internationales Recht sowie Mitglied der nationalen Akademien Belgiens, der Niederlande, Spaniens und des Institut de France.', 'Leben.', 'Ausbildung und frühe Arbeiten.', 'Charles De Visscher wurde 1884 in Gent als der ältere von zwei Brüdern geboren. Sowohl seine Mutter als auch seinen Vater Charles De Visscher (* um 1852; † 4. Juli 1896), der als Arzt und Professor für Rechtsmedizin an der Universität Gent wirkte und als „Autorität auf dem Gebiete der Chirurgie“ galt, verlor er bereits in jungen Jahren. Er studierte Rechtswissenschaften an der Universität seiner Heimatstadt sowie in Paris und beendete das Studium am 8. Oktober 1907 mit dem Doktorat (\\"Docteur en Droit\\"). Nach seiner Zulassung als Anwalt beschäftigte er sich zunächst vorrangig mit dem Zivilrecht, das zur damaligen Zeit als führende Rechtsdisziplin galt, und veröffentlichte in den Jahren 1909 und 1910 seine ersten beiden juristischen Abhandlungen. Parallel dazu schloss er im Februar 1909 ein Studium der Politikwissenschaft ab. Im Jahr 1910 heiratete er Hélène Mertens; aus der Ehe gingen acht Kinder hervor. Unmittelbar vor Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs wandte sich Charles De Visscher dem Sozialrecht zu, das zu dieser Zeit als neue eigenständige Rechtsdisziplin entstand. Er ging nach Paris und veröffentlichte hier 1911 unter dem Titel \\"Le contrat collectif de travail\\" eine Abhandlung zum Konzept von Tarifverträgen im Arbeitsrecht. In dieser Schrift sah er das organisierte Auftreten der Arbeitnehmer als einen wichtigen Schritt zur Gleichberechtigung gegenüber den Arbeitgebern an und betrachtete den Abschluss von Tarifverträgen als einen wichtigen Teil dieser Organisation. 1911 übernahm er von Albéric Rolin, dem Bruder von Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns, dessen Lehraufgaben an der Universität Gent in den Bereichen Strafrecht und Strafprozessrecht und nach der Emeritierung von Rolin im Jahr 1913 den Bereich des internationalen Privatrechts. Im selben Jahr folgte seine erste Veröffentlichung im Bereich des Völkerrechts.', 'Mit dem Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges zog sich Charles De Visscher 1914 zunächst nach Antwerpen und kurze Zeit später nach Oxford in England zurück. Es gilt als sicher, dass der Krieg sein juristisches Interesse endgültig in Richtung des Völkerrechts prägte (siehe François Rigaux, 2000 und Joe Verhoeven, 2000). Er veröffentlichte in England mehrere Artikel in englisch- und französischsprachigen Rechtszeitschriften, in denen er sich mit dem Bruch des Völkerrechts beschäftigte, dem das neutrale Belgien durch die deutsche Besetzung ausgesetzt war. Darüber hinaus schrieb er 1916 zu dieser Thematik zwei Bücher, \\"Belgium’s Case: A Juridical Enquiry\\" und \\"La Belgique et les juristes allemands\\" (1917 in deutscher Übersetzung unter dem Titel \\"Belgien und die deutschen Rechtsgelehrten\\"). Nach dem Ende des Krieges wurde er 1919 Rechtsberater des belgischen Außenministeriums und war in dieser Funktion an den Verhandlungen beteiligt, die 1920 zur Gründung des Völkerbundes führten. Im Jahr 1924 wurde er Dekan der juristischen Fakultät der Universität Gent. Ab 1920 war er darüber hinaus Mitherausgeber der Zeitschrift \\"Revue de droit international et de législation comparée\\", in der er bis zu ihrer Einstellung aufgrund des Zweiten Weltkrieges eine Vielzahl an Artikeln veröffentlichte. Ein Jahr später wurde er zum \\"Associate\\" sowie 1927 zum Mitglied und Generalsekretär des Institut de Droit international (Institut für Völkerrecht) ernannt. Darüber hinaus gehörte er ab 1923 dem Ständigen Schiedshof in Den Haag an.', 'Wirken am Ständigen Internationalen Gerichtshof.', 'Im selben Jahr trat Charles De Visscher als Rechtsberater der rumänischen Regierung erstmals vor dem Ständigen Internationalen Gerichtshof auf. In dem Fall, der als \\"European Commission of the Danube Case\\" in den Annalen des Gerichts verzeichnet ist, ging es um die Kompetenzen der 1856 gegründeten Europäischen Donaukommission. Deren Zuständigkeit war durch verschiedene Abkommen, an deren Zustandekommen Rumänien nicht beteiligt gewesen war, auf den auf rumänischem Territorium liegenden Donau-Abschnitt zwischen Galați und Brăila ausgeweitet worden. Der Fall, in dem Charles De Visscher unter anderem die Gleichheit der Staaten sowie die staatliche Souveränität als Argumente für die rumänische Position anführte, wurde vom Gericht allerdings zuungunsten Rumäniens entschieden. In einem ähnlichen Fall (\\"International Commission of the Oder Case\\") um die Zuständigkeiten der Internationalen Oder-Kommission für Abschnitte der Oder, die ausschließlich auf dem Staatsgebiet Polens lagen, hatte er 1929 als Vertreter der polnischen Regierung ebenfalls keinen Erfolg. In den Jahren 1931 und 1932 vertrat er erneut die Interessen Polens bei der Erstellung von zwei Gutachten des Gerichtshofs. Einer dieser Fälle betraf das Recht Polens, mit seinen Kriegsschiffen unter bestimmten Bedingungen den Hafen der Freien Stadt Danzig anzulaufen (\\"Polish Warships in Danzig Case\\"), der andere die Behandlung polnischer Staatsbürger in Danzig (\\"Treatment of Polish Nationals in Danzig Case\\"). Die Entscheidungen des Gerichts fielen in beiden Fällen jedoch zuungunsten der polnischen Position aus. Sein letzter Fall vor dem Ständigen Internationalen Gerichtshof betraf 1933 den Rechtsstatus des östlichen Teils von Grönland (\\"The Legal Status of Eastern Greenland Case\\"). Dieser war zwischen Norwegen und Dänemark umstritten, nachdem Dänemark seit 1921 die Oberhoheit über Grönland beanspruchte und Norwegen ab 1931 mit einer teilweisen Besetzung von Ostgrönland begonnen hatte. Charles De Visscher gelang es in diesem Fall, die dänische Position erfolgreich zu vertreten.', '1931 wechselte Charles De Visscher an die Katholische Universität Löwen, da die Universität Gent ein Jahr zuvor die niederländische Sprache angenommen hatte. Sechs Jahre später gab er das Amt des Generalsekretärs des Institut de Droit international ab, ihm folgte sein Bruder Fernand, der bis 1950 fungierte. Beeinflusst durch die archäologischen Interessen seines Bruders und dessen rechtshistorisches Wirken im Bereich des römischen Rechts veröffentlichte er 1935 unter dem Titel \\"La protection internationale des objets d’art et des monuments historiques\\" eine Abhandlung zum völkerrechtlichen Schutz von Kulturgütern. Im selben Jahr kam es durch die Unterzeichnung des Roerich-Paktes erstmals zum Abschluss eines völkerrechtlichen Vertrages in diesem Rechtsbereich. Charles De Visscher übernahm in der Folgezeit den Vorsitz eines Expertenkomitees, das einen Entwurf für eine umfassende Konvention zum Kulturgutschutz ausarbeitete, der im September 1938 in Amsterdam vom Internationalen Museumsamt des Völkerbundes angenommen wurde und als Vorläufer der 1954 abgeschlossenen Haager Konvention zum Schutz von Kulturgut bei bewaffneten Konflikten gilt. Im Mai 1937 wurde Charles De Visscher in Nachfolge von Edouard Rolin-Jaequemyns zum Richter am Ständigen Internationalen Gerichtshof gewählt.', 'Er wirkte in dieser Position bis zum Januar 1946, auch wenn die Aktivitäten des Gerichts im Februar 1940 infolge des Kriegsbeginns zum Erliegen kamen und 1942 eingestellt wurden, und war in dieser Zeit an sieben Entscheidungen des Gerichts beteiligt. Gegenstand dieser Fälle waren ein Streit zwischen den Niederlanden und Belgien über die Abzweigung von Wasser aus der Maas durch den Bau des Albert-Kanals in Belgien (\\"The Diversion of Water from the Meuse Case\\"), eine Auseinandersetzung zwischen Frankreich und Griechenland bezüglich der Errichtung von Leuchttürmen auf den Inseln Kreta und Samos (\\"Lighthouses in Crete and Samos Case\\"), und der Vorwurf Belgiens gegenüber den spanischen Ermittlungsbehörden, bei den Untersuchungen zur Ermordung des belgischen Barons Jacques de Borchgrave in Spanien nicht mit der notwendigen Sorgfalt vorzugehen (\\"The Borchgrave Case\\").

Ihren Namen teilte die Raumsonde mit dem 1998 erschienenen Katastrophenfilm \\"Deep Impact\\", der von einem Kometen handelt, welcher mit der Erde zu kollidieren droht. Die Namensgleichheit soll jedoch zufällig entstanden sein.', 'Die Mission war ein Gemeinschaftsprojekt der, des JPL und Ball Aerospace. Die NASA investierte in die Mission sechs Jahre Arbeit und insgesamt 333 Millionen US-Dollar, davon 267 Millionen für die Sonde selbst, 15 Millionen für die Durchführung der Primärmission (bis 3. August 2005) und etwa 50 Millionen für die Trägerrakete.', 'Nach Abschluss der Primärmission wurde die Mission der Vorbeiflugxadsonde verlängert. Unter dem Missionsnamen EPOXI verfolgte die Sonde bis zum letzten Kontakt am 8. August 2013 neue Ziele. Bei einem Vorbeiflug am 4. November 2010 wurden aus nur 700 Kilometern Entfernung Bilder des Kometen 103P/Hartley gemacht, um diesen näher zu erforschen. Außerdem wurde das HRI-Teleskop dazu genutzt, nach erdähnlichen Exoplaneten zu suchen.', 'Missionsziele.', 'Tempel umkreist die Sonne mit einer Periode von fünfeinhalb Jahren und kann sich der Erde bis auf 133 Millionen Kilometer nähern. Das Hauptmissionsziel von Deep Impact war die Erforschung des Inneren des Kometen Tempel 1.', 'Das Ziel der Mission war somit, Unterschiede zwischen den Eigenschaften des Inneren eines Kometenkerns und denen seiner Oberfläche zu erforschen. Dazu wurde ein 372 kg schweres Projektil (Impaktor) in die Flugbahn des Kometen gebracht, das dort einschlug und einen Krater hinterließ. Der Einschlag und das herausgeschleuderte Material wurden mit den Instrumenten der Sonde und mit weiteren erd- und weltraumbasierten Teleskopen untersucht. Erstmals bestand die Möglichkeit, den Blick auf das Innere eines Kometen freizugeben und das Urmaterial des Sonnensystems aus dem Inneren des Kometen freizusetzen. Dieses Material stammt noch aus der Zeit der Entstehung des Sonnensystems und bildet die Kerne von Kometen. Wissenschaftler hoffen, durch diese neue Sicht nicht nur die Kometen besser verstehen, sondern auch die Rolle der Kometen in der frühen Geschichte des Sonnensystems besser nachvollziehen zu können.', 'Technik.', 'Deep Impact bestand aus zwei Komponenten: der Vorbeiflugsonde und dem Impaktor, der am 4. Juli 2005 auf dem Kometen aufschlug und dabei zerstört wurde. Die Vorbeiflugsonde diente dem Impaktor bis kurz vor dem Aufschlag als Bus. Die Gesamtmasse der beiden Komponenten betrug beim Start 973 kg (nach anderen Angaben 1020 kg).', 'Vorbeiflugsonde.', 'Die Vorbeiflugsonde der Deep-Impact-Mission wurde von dem Unternehmen Ball Aerospace entwickelt. Sie ist etwa 3,2 m lang, 1,7 m breit sowie 2,3 m hoch und hatte beim Start eine Masse von 601 kg (nach anderen Angaben 650 kg), von denen 86 kg auf den Treibstoff entfielen. Die Sonde ist dreiachsen-stabilisiert und verfügt über ein fest angebrachtes, 2,8 m × 2,8 m messendes Solarpanel, welches abhängig vom Abstand zur Sonne bis zu 750 Watt Leistung liefern kann. Zur Energiespeicherung dient ein NiH2-Akkumulator mit einer Speicherkapazität von 16 Amperestunden. Die Struktur der Sonde besteht aus Aluminium-Profilen und Aluminium in Sandwich-Wabenkern-Bauweise.', 'Die Vorbeiflugsonde verfügt über zwei redundante Computersysteme. Das Herz des Bordcomputers ist ein 133 MHz schneller, aus 10,4 Millionen Transistoren bestehender 32-bit-RAD750-Prozessor. Der Prozessor ist im Grunde ein gegen Strahlung gehärteter PowerPC-750 G3 und der Nachfolger des RAD6000-Prozessors, der beispielsweise in den Mars-Rovern Spirit und Opportunity Verwendung fand. Der Einsatz in Deep Impact war der erste Einsatz eines RAD750-Prozessors. Beide Rechner der Sonde verfügen über einen gemeinsamen Speicher von 1024 MByte. 309 MByte wissenschaftlicher Daten wurden während der Primärmission von der Raumsonde erwartet.', 'Die Kommunikation mit der Erde erfolgt im X-Band auf einer 8-GHz-Frequenz mit maximal 175 kbit/s zur Erde und 125 bit/s zur Sonde. Mit dem Impaktor wurde im S-Band mit 64 kbit/s auf einer maximalen Entfernung von 8700 km kommuniziert. Die Sonde verfügt über eine bewegliche 1-m-Hochgewinnantenne (HGA) und zwei fest angebrachte Niedriggewinnantennen (LGA). Das Antriebssystem für Kurskorrekturen benutzt Hydrazin für einen Gesamtschub von 5000 N und eine Gesamt-Geschwindigkeitsänderung (Delta v) von 190 m/s.', 'Impaktor.', 'Der Impaktor stammt ebenfalls von Ball Aerospace und war 1 m hoch, hatte einen Durchmesser von 1 m und wog 372 kg, wobei 8 kg auf den Treibstoff für Kurskorrekturen unmittelbar vor dem Aufprall entfielen. Der Impaktor bestand überwiegend aus Kupfer (49 %) und Aluminium (24 %). Diese Mischung verringerte eine Verunreinigung der Spektrallinien des Kometenkerns, die nach dem Aufprall aufgenommen wurden, da Vorkommen von Kupfer auf dem Kometen nicht zu erwarten waren. 113 kg der Impaktor-Gesamtmasse waren „“, bestimmt dazu, einen möglichst großen Krater zu erzeugen. Diese Masse bestand aus mehreren Kupferplatten, die am vorderen Ende des Impaktors angebracht waren. Diese Platten bildeten eine sphärische Form.', 'Der Impaktor wurde 24 Stunden vor dem Aufschlag auf dem Kometen von der Vorbeiflugsonde abgetrennt, mit der er mechanisch und elektrisch verbunden war. Lediglich die letzten 24 Stunden bezog er seine Energie von einer bordeigenen nichtaufladbaren Batterie mit einer Kapazität von 250 Amperestunden. Der Bordcomputer und die Flugsteuerung des Impaktors waren der Vorbeiflugsonde ähnlich. Bedingt durch die kurze Lebensdauer verfügte der Impaktor im Gegensatz zur Vorbeiflugsonde über keine redundanten Systeme. Die Übertragungsdatenrate zur Vorbeiflugsonde betrug 64 kbit/s auf einer maximalen Entfernung von 8700 km. Kommandos wurden mit 16 kbit/s zum Impaktor übertragen.

Die Instrumente der Vorbeiflugsonde wiegen insgesamt 90 kg, zum Betrieb ist eine elektrische Leistung von 92 Watt erforderlich. Hauptaufgabe ist die Aufnahme von Infrarotspektren und Fotos im sichtbaren Licht, die anschließend zur Erde gefunkt werden sollen. Alle drei Instrumente wurden von Ball Aerospace entwickelt.', 'Ablauf der Mission.', 'Die ersten Vorschläge für eine Kometeneinschlagmission gab es bei der NASA bereits 1996. Doch damals blieben NASA-Ingenieure skeptisch, ob der Komet getroffen werden könne. Ein überarbeiteter und technologisch auf den neusten Stand gebrachter Missionsvorschlag, genannt Deep Impact, wurde im März 1998 von der NASA in die Auswahl für eine Mission im Rahmen des Discovery-Programms einbezogen, im November 1998 war Deep Impact einer der fünf Finalisten mit der besten wissenschaftlichen Ausbeute von insgesamt 26 Vorschlägen. Schließlich wurde am 7. Juli 1999 unter der Leitung von Michael A’Hearn von der University of Maryland in College Park zusammen mit MESSENGER zur Finanzierung im Rahmen des Discovery-Programms bewilligt. Die Kosten der Raumsonde wurden damals mit 240 Millionen US-Dollar angegeben. Beide Teile der Deep-Impact-Raumsonde (Vorbeiflugsonde und Impaktor) sowie die drei wissenschaftlichen Instrumente wurden bei Ball Aerospace in Boulder (Colorado), USA gefertigt.', 'Start.', 'Bei der Entwicklung der Deep-Impact-Mission war der Start der Sonde zunächst für Januar 2004 mit einem Swing-by-Manöver an der Erde am 31. Dezember 2004 und dem Zusammentreffen mit dem Kometen Tempel 1 am 4. Juli 2005 geplant. Doch aufgrund von Schwierigkeiten bei der Entwicklung der Sonde konnte der Starttermin nicht gehalten werden, der schließlich auf den 30. Dezember 2004 verschoben wurde. Dadurch flog die Sonde auf einer direkten Route zum Kometen, brauchte dafür allerdings eine etwas stärkere und daher auch teurere Trägerrakete.', 'Am 18. Oktober 2004 traf Deep Impact im Kennedy Space Center zu Startvorbereitungen ein. Doch auch der Starttermin am 30. Dezember 2004 konnte nicht gehalten werden und wurde zunächst auf den 8. Januar 2005 verschoben, um mehr Zeit für Softwaretests zu haben. Deep Impact wurde schließlich am 12.

Mit ihrem Stil, der vom Klang der Hammond-Orgel, markanten Gitarrenriffs, Improvisation, treibender Rhythmusarbeit und markantem Gesang geprägt ist, zählt sie zu den ersten und einflussreichsten Vertretern des Hard Rock und des aufkeimenden Heavy Metal. Das Guinness-Buch der Rekorde verzeichnete Deep Purple 1975 dank ihrer 10.000 Watt starken Marshall-PA-Anlage, die bis zu 117 dB erreichte, als „lauteste Popgruppe der Welt“ (Loudest Pop Group). Deep Purple gehört mit über 130 Millionen verkauften Alben – nach manchen Schätzungen sind es 150 Millionen – zu den weltweit kommerziell erfolgreichsten Rockbands.', 'Im Verlauf der von zahlreichen Besetzungswechseln geprägten Bandgeschichte erfolgten dabei auch musikalische Neuausrichtungen. Im Frühwerk der Band stehen Hard Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Progressive Rock und Bluesrock \\"(Hush)\\" neben Annäherungsversuchen zwischen Rockmusik und Klassik \\"(Concerto for Group and Orchestra, April)\\". Stilprägenden Einfluss hinterließ dann jedoch vor allem die \\"klassische Mark-II-Besetzung\\" der 1970er Jahre, deren Schaffen stilbildende Alben wie \\"Deep Purple in Rock, Machine Head\\" und \\"Made in Japan\\" und prägnante Hard-Rock-Songs mit eingängigen Riffs wie \\"Black Night, Smoke on the Water\\" und \\"Highway Star\\" einschließt, aber auch von besonderer Improvisationsfreude geprägt ist. Diese äußert sich einerseits in Titeln von ungewöhnlich langer Spieldauer wie \\"Child in Time\\", andererseits bei den Live-Darbietungen der Songs, wie \\"Space Truckin’\\", die gegenüber den Studioversionen wesentlich in ihrer Länge ausgedehnt wurden. Deep Purple gelten durch Songs wie \\"Fireball\\" als Vorreiter des Genres Speed Metal und mittels der Einflüsse des Gitarristen Ritchie Blackmore auf Songs wie \\"Burn\\" als Begründer des Neoklassischen Metal. Die musikalische Bandbreite umfasst neben weiteren Einflüssen aus Jazz, Funk und Soul auch Balladen wie \\"Soldier of Fortune\\". Die Band zählte von Anfang an zu den bekanntesten und am meisten tourenden Liveacts der Rockgeschichte.', 'Deep Purple löste sich nach zahlreichen Querelen 1976 auf. Die Mitglieder formierten Nachfolgebands wie Rainbow, Whitesnake und Gillan, in denen ihre Musik ein musikalisches Erbe fand. Die Besetzungen seit der Wiedervereinigung von 1984 orientieren sich musikalisch an dieser erfolgreichsten Phase der Band, wenn auch seit den frühen 1990er Jahren verstärkt unter Hinzunahme poppiger und jazziger Elemente.', '2016 wurde Deep Purple mit den ersten drei Bandbesetzungen – \\"Mark I\\", \\"Mark II\\" sowie \\"Mark III\\" – in die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame aufgenommen.', 'Bandgeschichte.', 'Die Bandgeschichte war von häufigem Personalwechsel geprägt, sodass sie in den bisher knapp fünfzig aktiven Jahren zumeist nur wenige Jahre aus denselben Mitgliedern bestand. Die verschiedenen Besetzungen werden häufig mit der vorangestellten englischen Bezeichnung „Mark“ (Mk) durchnummeriert.', 'Gründung.', 'Deep Purple entstand, als die Londoner Geschäftsleute Tony Edwards und John Coletta 1967 beschlossen, in eine Rockband zu investieren, und Jon Lord mit der Gründung einer Rockgruppe beauftragten. Aus der Band \\"Roundabout\\", die sich damals aus Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord von den \\"Flowerpot Men\\", dem Ex-\\"Searchers\\"-Schlagzeuger und Sänger Chris Curtis (Gesang), Dave Curtiss (Bass) und Bobby Woodman (Schlagzeug) zusammensetzte, bildete sich im April 1968 nach dem Ausscheiden von Curtis, Woodman und Curtiss \\"Deep Purple\\". Die Besetzung war vorher durch Rod Evans (Gesang), Ian Paice (Schlagzeug) (beide Ex-\\"The Maze\\") sowie Nick Simper (Bass) vervollständigt worden. Für ihren neuen Namen entschied sich die Band nach einer kurzen Tour durch Skandinavien; er bezieht sich laut Blackmore auf den Jazzstandard \\"Deep Purple\\" von Peter DeRose. In einem Interview mit dem New Musical Express im Jahr 1973 brachte Lord zum Ausdruck, dass die Band Deep Purple für ihn von Beginn an „kein Vehikel für gesellschaftliche Rebellion, sondern für musikalische Perfektion war“.', 'Erste Erfolge.', 'Deep Purple spielte in der sogenannten \\"Mark-I-Besetzung\\" drei Alben ein.', 'Das Debütalbum \\"Shades of Deep Purple\\" aus dem Jahr 1968 zeigte eine Mischung verschiedener musikalischer Ansätze, die mit der typischen Deep-Purple-Musik der 1970er Jahre noch wenig Verwandtschaft zeigt. Das Album selbst wurde innerhalb von nur drei Tagen aufgenommen. Der noch an der Popmusik der Beatles orientierte Sound war in seiner Härte für die damalige Zeit teilweise ungewöhnlich. Er wird daher von Kritikern als Grundlage für die Entwicklung des Hard Rocks und späteren Heavy Metals angesehen. Das Album enthält neben eigenen Songs wie \\"Mandrake Root\\", das lange Zeit die Basis für die ausufernden Live-Duelle der Band war, auch einige Coverversionen, unter anderem \\"Help!\\" von den Beatles, den durch Jimi Hendrix bekannt gewordenen Song \\"Hey Joe\\" und das von Joe South geschriebene \\"Hush\\". Mit Letzterem hatte die Band ihren Durchbruch in den USA und Kanada, wo die Single Platz 4 resp. Platz 2 der Charts erreichte. Am 6. Juli trat die Band im Vorprogramm der Byrds erstmals auf britischem Boden auf.', 'Noch im selben Jahr wurde das zweite Album \\"The Book of Taliesyn\\" veröffentlicht, das teilweise auch Merkmale des Progressive Rock sowie die später oft verwendeten klassischen Zitate aufweist (hier in einer Kurzversion von Beethovens zweitem Satz seiner siebten Sinfonie in \\"Exposition\\"). Ein Beispiel für die Verwendung klassischer Instrumente und Formen ist der Mittelteil von \\"Anthem\\", in dem ein vierstimmiges Fugato eines Streichquartetts erklingt. Das Album beinhaltet neben eigenen Kompositionen Coverversionen von Klassikern wie \\"We Can Work It Out\\" (The Beatles) und \\"Kentucky Woman\\" (Neil Diamond). Kritiker wie die Zeitschrift \\"Disc &amp; Music Echo\\" lobten, obwohl sie auf dem „leicht enttäuschenden Album“ den wirklichen ‚Kick‘ vermissten, den „Sinn der Band für Dynamik sowie die Verbindung instrumentaler Passagen mit bekannten Themen“. Nach der Veröffentlichung tourte Deep Purple als Vorgruppe von Cream und danach auf eigene Faust durch die USA.', 'Das dritte, schlicht \\"Deep Purple\\" betitelte Album erschien 1969. Manche Songs, wie das zwölfminütige \\"April\\", das eine Dreiteilung (Band – Orchester – Band) aufweist, verweisen wieder auf klassische Modelle und Ästhetik. Der Titel war eine der ersten der bald darauf beliebten Rocksuiten von Progressive-Rock-Bands wie The Nice, Emerson, Lake and Palmer oder Genesis. Zudem zeigt sich auf diesem Album erstmals auch vermehrt der Hard Rock, durch den die Band zu weltweiter Bekanntheit gelangte. So zum Beispiel in \\"Bird Has Flown\\" oder \\"The Painter\\". Mit \\"Lalena\\" von Donovan ist auch nur noch eine Coverversion vertreten.', 'Wechsel zur klassischen \\"Mark-II-Besetzung\\" und wachsende Popularität.', 'Mitte 1969 wurden Evans und Simper auf das Betreiben Blackmores hin durch den Sänger Ian Gillan und den Bassisten Roger Glover ersetzt. Die beiden hatten zuvor schon mehrere Jahre lang in der Band „Episode Six“ zusammen gespielt. Mit der Verpflichtung dieser Musiker entstand die \\"klassische Mk-II\\"-Besetzung mit Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover, Jon Lord und Ian Paice.', 'Zunächst standen für die neue Besetzung primär Jon Lord und dessen Musikvorstellungen im Rampenlicht. Der klassisch ausgebildete Musiker hatte ein Werk für Rockband und Orchester geschrieben, \\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\\", das gemeinsam mit dem Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in der Royal Albert Hall unter der Leitung von Malcolm Arnold uraufgeführt wurde. Es war einer der ersten Versuche, klassische und Rockmusik zu kombinieren, und die erste Aufführung einer Rockband mit einem kompletten Orchester. Obwohl das Projekt vom Publikum und Teilen der Kritiker wohlwollend aufgenommen wurde, waren einige Bandmitglieder, vor allem Blackmore, damit nicht zufrieden. Unter anderem aufgrund der Sorge um einen Imageverlust der Band wurde beschlossen, einen neuen, musikalisch härteren, Weg einzuschlagen.', 'Weltweiter Erfolg der \\"Mark-II-Besetzung\\".', 'Deep Purple in Rock.', 'Das 1970 veröffentlichte Album \\"Deep Purple in Rock\\" kann als ein Wendepunkt in der Geschichte der Band wie auch in der Geschichte der Rockmusik gesehen werden. Das erste auch in Europa erfolgreiche Album bedeutete den weltweiten Durchbruch der Band und fokussierte internationale Aufmerksamkeit, was zahlreiche Goldene Schallplatten und Spitzenchartplatzierungen belegen. In Großbritannien erreichte es die Chartposition vier und verbrachte in Deutschland gar zwölf Wochen auf Platz eins. Das Werk vereint die für die Folgezeit typischen musikalischen Merkmale: Markante Heavy-Metal- und Hard-Rock-Riffs Blackmores, Lords klassische Kadenzen und Figuren, Gillans ekstatischen Gesang sowie die in Titeln wie \\"Speed King\\", \\"Child in Time\\" und anderen Songs besonders live offen ausgetragene Konkurrenz zwischen Lords Orgel und Blackmores Gitarre. Diese Konkurrenz ist allerdings, häufig in der Form eines Call and Response (wie im Notenbeispiel zu \\"Speed King\\"), musikalisch durchaus fruchtbar. \\"Child in Time\\" ist ein Protestsong gegen den Vietnamkrieg und zählt zu den wohl bekanntesten und wichtigsten Liedern der Rockmusik überhaupt. Werner Faulstich stellt in seinem Buch \\"Die Kultur der siebziger Jahre\\" das Lied \\"Speed King\\" als Paradebeispiel des Hard Rock vor: „Das Stück beginnt mit einer instrumentalen Einleitung, in der zwei Kontrahenten vorgestellt werden: eine wilde Rockgitarre und eine sanfte Orgel. Zwei Grundlinien und ihr Kontrast deuten sich somit an, von denen die gesamte Rockmusik der siebziger Jahre geprägt war: hart versus weich.“ Die harten Rockriffs von Blackmore haben sich nun definitiv durchgesetzt. Die klassischen Elemente erscheinen zunehmend als notfalls auch verzichtbare Zutat einer primär Hard-Rock-orientierten Musik. Auf der sicheren Basis von Paice und Glover entwickelte sich der Stil zu einer sehr rhythmusbetonten, geradlinigen Musik weiter. Das im Anschluss an das Album produzierte Lied \\"Black Night\\" wurde die erfolgreichste Single der Band seit \\"Hush\\". \\"Black Night\\" gelangte auf Platz 2 der britischen Charts und als bisher einziges Lied von Deep Purple auf Platz 1 europäischer Singlecharts (in der Schweiz für vier Wochen im Herbst 1970).', 'Fireball.', '1971 gründeten die Musiker ihr eigenes Platten-Label \\"Purple Records\\". Das im Vergleich zum Vorgänger experimentellere, progressivere 1971er Album \\"Fireball\\" mit den Klassikern \\"Fireball\\" und \\"The Mule\\" erhöhte die musikalische Reputation und Popularität der Band. Es war das erste Deep-Purple-Album, das die Nummer-eins-Position der britischen Albumcharts erreichte, und das erste von bisher insgesamt zehn Nummer-eins-Studioalben der Band. Parallel zur LP erschien \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" als Single. \\"Fireball\\" erhielt in einigen Ländern Gold-Status und war vorwiegend auf dem 1. Platz oder auf den folgenden Rängen der internationalen Albumcharts zu finden. Die Single \\"Fireball\\" hatte ein schnelles, treibendes Tempo, das bei seiner Veröffentlichung im Jahre 1971 noch nahezu unbekannt war. Aufgrund dieses Stils und des Patterns von Ian","output":"Gillans Gesang wird das Lied häufig als Vorläufer des Genres Speed Metal betrachtet.', 'Machine Head.', 'Das 1972 veröffentlichte Album \\"Machine Head\\" mit den erfolgreichen Singles \\"Smoke on the Water\\" und \\"Highway Star\\" ist wohl das bekannteste Werk der Band. Die Aufnahmen fanden im Dezember 1971 in Montreux/Schweiz statt, nachdem die Band einen mittels Feuerwerkskörpern verursachten Hotelbrand überlebt hatte. Der Text von \\"Smoke on the Water\\" erzählt von diesem Ereignis. Das Album erreichte in den USA Platz 7 der Billboard Charts und gilt als Klassiker des Hard Rock und Heavy Metal. \\"Highway Star\\" ist auch heute noch ein häufig gespieltes Lied bei Konzerten der Gruppe.', 'Made in Japan.', 'Das am 5. Dezember 1972 veröffentlichte Live-Album \\"Made in Japan\\" gehört zu den erfolgreichsten Live-Alben überhaupt und demonstriert die Live-Qualitäten, die der Band zu ihrer Blütezeit attestiert werden. Die Doppel-LP enthält Aufnahmen von Konzerten, die im August 1972 in Japan stattfanden. \\"Made in Japan\\" verkaufte sich mehrere Millionen Mal und gilt als Meilenstein des Heavy Metal und der Live-Alben.', 'Weitere Alben und Besetzungswechsel.', 'In den folgenden Jahren veröffentlichte die Band weitere Alben wie \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\", \\"Burn\\" und \\"Stormbringer\\". Nach zahlreichen Besetzungswechseln, bei denen auch David Coverdale und Glenn Hughes als Sänger der Band tätig waren, löste sich Deep Purple 1976 auf. In den Jahren danach formierten sich die ehemaligen Bandmitglieder in verschiedenen Konstellationen neu und produzierten Musik unter Namen wie Rainbow, Whitesnake und Gillan.', 'Wiedervereinigung und spätere Jahre.', '1984 fanden sich die Mitglieder der \\"klassischen Mark-II-Besetzung\\" wieder zusammen und traten unter dem Namen \\"Deep Purple Mark II\\" wieder auf. Es folgten weitere Alben wie \\"Perfect Strangers\\", \\"The House of Blue Light\\" und \\"Slaves and Masters\\", bei denen jedoch immer wieder Besetzungswechsel stattfanden. Die Band erhielt 2016 eine Aufnahme in die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame und tourt nach wie vor. Ihre Musik hat einen großen Einfluss auf den Hard Rock und Heavy Metal ausgeübt und gilt als wegweisend für diese Musikrichtungen."},{"instruction":"09今日の出来事 僕はこれを土曜日の深夜、いや日曜の未明といった方がいいだろうか。そんな時間に書いている。 頭が混乱してあまりまともな文章になりそうもないが、書けば少しは考えもまとまるかもしれない。 「あなた、起きて！ねぇ！」 昨夜、ソファーでうたた寝していた僕は妻に揺り起こされて目が覚めた。 「ねぇ、これ書いたの貴方なの？」 僕のスマホの画面をこちらに向け、浮かべているのは口許をひきつらせた笑顔。 画面には僕が書いた妄想、つまりこの文章が表示されていた。なんと答えてよいものやら。僕が何も言葉を紡ぎ出せずに数瞬が過ぎる。 「そう……。」 それから僕たちの家に会話と笑顔がなくなった。 そして、今朝。 この土曜日は仕事は無いはずなのに、彼女は大きなキャリーケースを携えていた。 「ちょっと研修旅行に行ってきます。明日の夜に帰ります。」 「え？それって断ったはずじゃ……。」 バタンと閉じたドアが、妻の後ろ姿を隠した。 午後、妻からメールが来た。 件名も本文もなく、添付ファイルを示すアイコンのみ。 開くと綺麗な山並みをバックに寄り添うカップルの写真。おろした髪を風になびかせ、知らない男性と楽しそうな微笑みを浮かべているのは妻だった。 夜、再び着たメールには添付ファイルが二つだけだった。 一つ目は窓越しのライトアップされた庭園を背にモデルのようなポーズをとる妻。色とりどりの花模様が散りばめられたレースのブラで双房を包み、ショーツは辛うじて陰りを隠す程度。ほっそりしたウエストにはフリルのついたガーターベルトが巻きつき、太腿の半ばまでの黒いストッキングを吊り支える。僕の知らない妖艶な微笑みは、真っ赤に焼けた鋼となって胸を貫いた。 二つ目は古びた部屋での光景だ。敷かれた布団の上。乱れた髪で誰かの肌を跨ぐ彼女。少し上向きの人差し指を咥えた切なげな表情。肌と肌の境目は濡れた叢が混じり合って見えない。 薬指の痕は綺麗に消えて見えなくなっていた。 もちろん、メールはもとより電話、ＳＮＳ全部試した。彼女からの返信はないし、電話にもでない。 ＧＰＳも更新されない。たぶん、彼女と一緒にいるあの男が切ったのだろう。 生のままのウィスキーを何杯も飲み続けているが一向に酔うことができない。 どうしたらいい？誰か教えてくれ。 僕の妄想なのか、それとも……。 translate entire webnovel chapter as it is, every sentence as it is, re write like how a human writes a web novel, use simple English, 8th standard readability","output":"Today's Events: I am writing this on a late Saturday night, or rather early Sunday morning.

Sie verlief in Aberdeenshire zwischen Aberdeen und Ballater weitgehend im Tal des namensgebenden Flusses Dee, der südlich von Aberdeen in die Nordsee mündet. Die Strecke wurde zwischen 1853 und 1866 in mehreren Etappen von drei kleineren Bahngesellschaften erbaut. 1876 übernahm die Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) die Strecke und baute sie in den 1890er Jahren teilweise zweigleisig aus. Ab 1894 ergänzte die GNSR das Zugangebot um Vorortzüge zwischen Aberdeen und Culter. Nach der Jahrhundertwende bis zum Ende der 1920er Jahre hatte die Deeside Line, die ab 1923 von der London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) betrieben wurde, ihr höchstes Verkehrsaufkommen. So fuhren an Wochentagen auf dem Vorortabschnitt zwischen Aberdeen und Culter teils mehr als 25 Zugpaare. 1937 stellte die LNER den Vorortverkehr ein. 1948 wurde das britische Eisenbahnnetz verstaatlicht, seitdem betrieb British Railways die Strecke. Nach einem Tiefstand mit drei Zugpaaren auf der Gesamtstrecke in den Nachkriegsjahren bedienten ab Ende der 1950er Jahre sechs Zugpaare an Werktagen die Deeside Line. 1966 legte British Railways im Zuge der sogenannten Beeching-Axt die Strecke still und baute sie in den Folgejahren ab. Die Trasse wird heute überwiegend für den \\"Deeside Way\\" genutzt, einen regionalen Rad- und Wanderweg. Bekannt wurde die Deeside Line aufgrund der landschaftlichen Schönheit sowie der regelmäßigen Nutzung durch die britischen Monarchen. Zwischen 1853 und 1965 fuhren alle in dieser Zeit herrschenden Monarchen regelmäßig mit dem Royal Train über die Deeside Line zur königlichen Sommerresidenz Balmoral Castle.', 'Geschichte.', 'Bau des ersten Abschnitts zwischen Aberdeen und Banchory.', 'Der Erfolg der 1830 eröffneten Liverpool and Manchester Railway führte dazu, dass in ganz Großbritannien in den Folgejahren schnell ein ausgedehntes Netz in fast allen Landesteilen entstand und ein Boom für Eisenbahnaktien an den Börsen ausgelöst wurde. Dieser auch als Railway Mania oder „Eisenbahnfieber“ bezeichnete Boom hatte auch eine Vielzahl teils wirtschaftlich völlig unsinniger Streckenplanungen zur Folge, die wiederum mehrfach zu Wirtschaftskrisen und Zusammenbrüchen führten. Auch in Schottland entstanden schnell Komitees und Unternehmen, die Planungen für das neue Verkehrsmittel entwickelten. Die ersten Planungen zur Erschließung der Deeside entstanden 1845. Am 2. September dieses Jahres gründeten mehrere Aberdeener Geschäftsleute unter Führung des Lord Provost der Stadt ein erstes provisorisches Eisenbahnkomitee. Beteiligt waren auch Direktoren der Great North of Scotland Railway und der Aberdeen Railway. Das Komitee rief die \\"Deeside Railway Company\\" ins Leben, die eine Strecke von Aberdeen nach Banchory bauen sollte. Der veröffentlichte Verkaufsprospekt versprach, dass die Untersuchung des zu erwartenden Verkehrsaufkommens alle Erwartungen überschritten hätte („has exceeded all expectations“). Als Stammkapital wurden Aktien im Wert von insgesamt 100.000 £ ausgegeben, die bereits nach einer Woche vollständig gezeichnet waren. Dieser Erfolg bewog die Gesellschaft noch im gleichen Monat dazu, das Kapital auf 220.000 £ aufzustocken und die Streckenplanung bis Aboyne auszudehnen. Mit dem \\"Deeside Railway Act\\" erhielt die Gesellschaft für ihre Planungen nach dem zuvor ergangenen Parlamentsbeschluss am 16. Juli 1846 den Royal Assent. Zur Kostenersparnis beschloss die Gesellschaft jedoch, den Bau zunächst auszusetzen, bis die von Aberdeen als Anschluss in Richtung Arbroath laufende Strecke der \\"Aberdeen Railway\\" weitgehend fertiggestellt war, um dann deren Bauausrüstung übernehmen zu können. Sie gab der Aberdeen Railway zudem einen Kredit in Höhe von 16.000 £ zur Beschleunigung ihrer Arbeiten, nachdem diese aufgrund der durch das nachlassende Eisenbahnfieber in Großbritannien ausgelösten Wirtschaftskrise von 1847 in finanzielle Schwierigkeiten geraten war. Diese Verzögerung führte jedoch zu Protesten, und ein Jahr später forderten verschiedene Aktionäre eine Auflösung der \\"Deeside Railway Company\\", nachdem weiterhin nicht mit dem Bau begonnen worden war. Die Aberdeen Railway übernahm daraufhin einen Teil der Aktien dieser Aktionäre. Sie verkaufte sie jedoch 1849 wieder, diesmal an eine weitere Gruppe lokaler Geschäftsleute.', 'Die neuen Eigentümer beschlossen, die Strecke zunächst nur bis Banchory zu bauen. Dies erforderte einen neuen Parlamentsbeschluss, der den Royal Assent am 28. Mai 1852 erhielt. Das Gesellschaftskapital wurde nun auf 106.250 £ festgesetzt. Den ersten Spatenstich nahm Mrs. Kinloch, die Frau eines lokalen Grundbesitzers, gut einen Monat später am 5. Juli 1852 bei den \\"Mains of Drum\\" vor, etwa auf halber Strecke zwischen Aberdeen und Banchory.', 'Der Streckenverlauf entlang des Dee-Nordufers bot baulich keine besonderen Schwierigkeiten und die Strecke konnte am 7. September 1853 eingeweiht werden. Der planmäßige Betrieb mit drei Zugpaaren begann am Folgetag. Die vier Monate vor Eröffnung bei Hawthorn bestellten Lokomotiven standen jedoch noch nicht zur Verfügung. Die Deeside Railway beauftragte daher die Scottish Central Railway mit dem Betrieb ihrer Strecke. Über die Abrechnung dieser Leistungen gab es jedoch bald Auseinandersetzungen, und nachdem die erste eigene Lokomotive ausgeliefert worden war, übernahm die Deeside Railway ab März 1854 selbst den Betrieb ihrer Strecke. In Aberdeen nutzte sie die Anlagen der Aberdeen Railway, zunächst deren provisorischen Endbahnhof in Ferryhill und ab 1854 den Bahnhof an der Guild Street südlich der Innenstadt auf der Fläche des heutigen Einkaufszentrums Union Square. Erste Planungen für einen eigenen Bahnhof an der Ecke Market Street/Palmerston Road südlich des Bahnhofs Guild Street waren bald wieder verworfen worden, die Deeside Railway richtete hier lediglich ihren Güterbahnhof ein.', 'Verlängerung nach Aboyne.', 'Noch vor Inbetriebnahme ihrer Strecke entwickelte die Deeside Railway weitere Ausbaupläne. Zunächst zielten diese auf eine Verbindung von Banchory nach der westlich von Aberdeen gelegenen Kleinstadt Alford. Nachdem sich diese Planung als ungeeignet erwiesen hatte, wurde eine von der Strecke nach Banchory bei Coalford, westlich von Peterculter, abzweigende Trassenführung favorisiert. Die Great North of Scotland Railway plante jedoch ebenfalls eine Verbindung nach Alford und konnte sich im Parlament in London gegen die Deeside Railway durchsetzen.', 'Nach diesem Misserfolg wandte sich die Deeside Railway wieder ihrer Stammstrecke zu, die sich als sehr ertragreich erwiesen hatte. 1857 konnte sie eine Dividende von 8,5 % ausschütten. Die Pläne für die Verlängerung nach Aboyne wurden wieder aus der Schublade geholt, jedoch in der Trassenführung modifiziert. Statt entlang des Dee über Kincardine O’Neil wurde die Strecke nach Aboyne nördlich abseits des Dee-Tals über Torphins und Lumphanan im Verlauf der ursprünglich nach Alford geplanten Verlängerung geführt. Dies erforderte zwar längere Steigungsabschnitte und einen tiefen Einschnitt, bot aber günstigere Grunderwerbskosten und vermied zwei Brücken über den Dee, die bei der ursprünglichen Führung erforderlich gewesen wären. Die Deeside Railway gründete für die Verlängerung eine neue Gesellschaft, die nominell unabhängige \\"Deeside Extension Railway\\". Das entsprechende Gesetz, der \\"Deeside Railway Extension Act\\", erhielt den Royal Assent am 27. Juli 1857. Am 2. Oktober des gleichen Jahres folgte der erste Spatenstich, diesmal durch die Marchioness of Huntly. Zwar hatte der Inspektor des Board of Trade bei der Streckenbegehung vor Eröffnung noch einige Mängel festgestellt, die Strecke konnte dennoch wie geplant am 2. Dezember 1859 in Betrieb gehen. Die Züge verkehrten durchgehend von Aberdeen nach Aboyne, die Deeside Railway übernahm den durchgehenden Dienst im Auftrag der Extension Railway. Einmal pro Tag wurde in Aboyne Anschluss per Kutsche von und nach Ballater angeboten.', 'Weiterführung bis Ballater.', 'Nachdem Königin Victoria und Prinzgemahl Albert 1848 erstmals den Sommer in Balmoral Castle verbracht hatten und von den schottischen Highlands begeistert waren, erwarb Prinz Albert das Schloss als Besitz der königlichen Familie. Dies führte dazu, dass der Tourismus in diesen Teil von Aberdeenshire erheblich zunahm. Bereits die Verlängerung bis Aboyne hatte einen erheblichen Ausflugsverkehr auf der Strecke der Deeside Railway zur Folge. Diese plante daher bald eine erneute Verlängerung. Erneut wurde dafür eine nominell unabhängige Gesellschaft gegründet, die \\"Aboyne and Braemar Railway\\" (A&amp;BR). Ziel war Braemar, womit die Strecke direkt nördlich an Balmoral Castle vorbei führen sollte. Die Gründung der Gesellschaft erfolgte am 16. November 1864. In der parlamentarischen Debatte, die im Winter 1865 stattfand, wurden bereits weitere Verlängerungen diskutiert. Mögliche Ziele waren Blair Atholl oder, quer durch die Bergwelt der Cairngorms, Kingussie, beide an der heutigen Highland Main Line zwischen Inverness und Perth gelegen.', 'Größte Landbesitzerin der Gegend war jedoch inzwischen Königin Victoria, die die Strecke nach Braemar, die direkt an ihrem Schloss vorbei führen würde, vehement ablehnte. Sie ließ ihren Solicitor Verhandlungen mit der A&amp;BR aufnehmen, in denen dieser den Wunsch der Königin deutlich machte. Die Gesellschaft zog daraufhin ihre Gesetzesvorlage in der ursprünglichen Form zurück; die Verlängerung sollte nunmehr nur bis Bridge of Gairn führen, etwa zwei Kilometer nordwestlich von Ballater. Personenverkehr sollte lediglich bis Ballater erfolgen; der kurze Abschnitt bis Bridge of Gairn, wo erhebliche Holzabfuhr geplant war, war als sogenannte \\"Tramway\\" nur für den Güterverkehr vorgesehen. Für dieses geänderte Vorhaben erhielt die A&amp;BR den Royal Assent am 5. Juli 1865. Mangels finanzieller Mittel verzichtete die Gesellschaft jedoch bald auf den Bau der Tramway. Daraufhin versuchte Colonel James Farquharson, der in Invercauld Castle bei Braemar ansässige, und an der Bahngesellschaft beteiligte Chief des Clans Farquharson, den Bau der Tramway in eigener Regie zu übernehmen und sie sogar bis zur \\"Bridge of Invercauld\\", einer Brücke der heutigen A93 über den Dee, etwas östlich von Braemar, zu führen. Dies erwies sich jedoch als nicht finanzierbar, so dass Col. Farquharson lediglich den Abschnitt bis Bridge of Gairn in Angriff nahm. Bis 1869 war der Abschnitt bis Bridge of Gairn weitgehend fertiggestellt.', 'Im gleichen Jahr übernahm jedoch Fürst zu Leiningen als Beauftragter von Königin Victoria \\"Ballochbuie Forest\\", zwischen Braemar und Bridge of Gairn gelegen, von Col.","output":"Deeside Line, Schottland, Aberdeen, Ballater, Eisenbahn, Streckenbau, Monarchen, Balmoral Castle, Zugverkehr, Tourismus"},{"instruction":"For the following system at equilibrium: H2 (g) + I2 (g) ⇌ 2 HI (g) a.

Die einzige beschriebene Art ist \\"Deinonychus antirrhopus\\".', 'Dieser bis zu 3,4 Meter lange Theropode lebte während der frühen Kreidezeit vor etwa 123 bis 110 Millionen Jahren (vom Mittleren Aptium bis zum Unteren Albium). Fossilien wurden in den US-Bundesstaaten Montana, Wyoming und Oklahoma in Gesteinen der Cloverly-Formation und der Antlers-Formation entdeckt. Zähne, die möglicherweise zu \\"Deinonychus\\" gehören, stammen aus dem viel weiter östlich gelegenen Maryland.', 'Studien des Paläontologen John Ostrom über \\"Deinonychus\\" revolutionierten in den späten 1960er-Jahren die Vorstellungen der Wissenschaftler über Dinosaurier, was zur „Dinosaurier-Renaissance“ führte und die Debatte entzündete, ob Dinosaurier gleichwarme („warmblütige“) Tiere waren. Zuvor galten Dinosaurier als schwerfällige Giganten, die heutigen Reptilien glichen. Der kleine Körper, die elegante, horizontale Körperhaltung und insbesondere die großen sichelartigen Fußkrallen zeigten, dass es sich bei \\"Deinonychus\\" um einen aktiven, agilen Prädator handelte.', 'Merkmale.', 'Wie die größten bekannten Exemplare zeigen, konnte \\"Deinonychus\\" eine Länge von 3,4 Metern erreichen. Ein Individuum dieser Größe besaß eine Schädellänge von 41 Zentimeter, eine Hüfthöhe von 87 Zentimeter und eine Masse von etwa 73 Kilogramm. Der Schädel war mit kräftigen Kiefern ausgestattet, die etwa 70 gebogene, klingenartige Zähne trugen. Alle Zähne waren auf der Vorder- sowie auf der Rückseite gesägt, wobei die Zähnchen (Dentikel) auf der Rückseite der Zähne fast doppelt so groß waren wie die auf der Vorderseite. John Ostroms erste, noch auf sehr fragmentarischen Überresten beruhende Schädelrekonstruktion zeigt einen relativ kompakten, breiten Schädel, der dem des \\"Allosaurus\\" ähnelt. Neuere Schädelfunde von \\"Deinonychus\\" und nahe verwandten Gattungen mit guter dreidimensionaler Erhaltung zeigen jedoch, dass der Gaumen gewölbter war, als John Ostrom vermutet hatte, was zur Rekonstruktion einer weit schmaleren und längeren Schnauze führte. Gleichzeitig verbreiterte das paarige Jochbein (Jugale) den Schädel in der Augenregion, was ein gutes stereoskopisches Sehen ermöglichte. Der Schädel von \\"Deinonychus\\" unterschied sich von dem des \\"Velociraptor\\" unter anderem durch die tieferen, robusteren Unterkiefer und durch die robustere Schädeldecke, die der von \\"Dromaeosaurus\\" ähnlich war. Des Weiteren war das Nasenbein nicht abgeflacht wie das des \\"Velociraptor\\". Sowohl der Schädel als auch der Unterkiefer zeigten Schädelfenster, welche das Gewicht des Schädels reduzierten. Bei \\"Deinonychus\\" war das vor den Augen gelegene Antorbitalfenster besonders groß.', 'Wie bei allen Dromaeosauriden waren die Vordergliedmaßen sehr lang und erreichten bei \\"Deinonychus\\" 70 Prozent der Länge der Hinterbeine. Die große Hand machte dabei 40 Prozent der Gesamtlänge der Vordergliedmaßen aus. Der erste der drei Finger war der kürzeste, während der zweite der längste war. Jedes Hinterbein trug eine sichelförmige, ungewöhnlich große Kralle am zweiten Zeh. Im Leben des Tieres waren die Krallen größer, als sie fossil überliefert sind, da Dinosaurier ebenso wie heute lebende Archosaurier einen Überzug aus Horn über ihre Krallen besaßen. John Ostrom verglich eine Sichelkralle von \\"Deinonychus\\" (Exemplarnummer YPM 5205) mit Krallen heutiger Krokodile und Vögel und kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Kralle beim lebenden Tier über 120 Millimeter Länge maß. Sowohl anatomische Nachweise als auch Nachweise aus fossilen Fußspuren zeigen, dass bei der Fortbewegung lediglich die dritte und die vierte Zehe den Boden berührten, während die die Sichelkralle tragende zweite Zehe bei der Fortbewegung über dem Boden gehalten wurde. Das Sitzbein (Ischium) war im Verhältnis zum Schambein (Pubis) kürzer als bei anderen Dromaeosauriden. Die Schwanzwirbel waren mit einer Serie von verknöcherten Sehnen und stark verlängerten Wirbelfortsätzen ausgestattet – den Präzygapophysen an der Oberseite und den Chevron-Knochen an der Unterseite der Wirbelkörper. John Ostrom vermutete, dass diese Vorrichtung den Schwanz zu einem steifen Gegengewicht gemacht hat. Ein Fossil des eng verwandten \\"Velociraptor mongoliensis\\" (IGM 100/986) hat jedoch einen Schwanz im anatomischen Verbund, der horizontal S-förmig gebogen war. Dies deutet auf eine beträchtliche seitliche Beweglichkeit des Schwanzes hin.', 'Obwohl bisher keine Federn in Verbindung mit \\"Deinonychus\\"-Fossilien entdeckt wurden, spricht der Nachweis von Federn in einer Vielzahl anderer Dromaeosauriden dafür, dass alle Vertreter der Gruppe einschließlich \\"Deinonychus\\" gefiedert waren (Prinzip der phylogenetischen Umklammerung). So ist die gefiederte Dromaeoauriden-Gattung \\"Microraptor\\" sowohl geologisch älter als auch phylogenetisch ursprünglicher als \\"Deinonychus\\". Mehrere Fossilien von \\"Microraptor\\" zeigen Konturfedern an Armen, Beinen und Schwanz, die denen heutiger Vögel entsprechen. Eine Elle (Ulna) des mit \\"Deinonychus\\" eng verwandten \\"Velociraptor\\" zeigt Ansatzstellen für Federn (englisch \\"quill knobs\\"), was auf lange Armfedern bei \\"Velociraptor\\" schließen lässt.', 'Systematik.', '\\"Deinonychus\\" ist einer der am besten bekannten Dromaeosauriden und ein enger Verwandter des kleineren \\"Velociraptor\\", der aus jüngeren Schichten der Oberkreide Nordchinas und der Mongolei stammt. Zwei weitere Gattungen der Oberkreide, \\"Tsaagan\\" aus der Mongolei und der wenig bekannte \\"Saurornitholestes\\" aus Nordamerika, könnten ebenfalls enge Verwandte von \\"Deinonychus\\" gewesen sein.', '\\"Velociraptor\\" und \\"Deinonychus\\" bilden zusammen die Gruppe Velociraptorinae, die 1983 von Rinchen Barsbold aufgestellt wurde und ursprünglich \\"Velociraptor\\" als einzige Gattung enthielt. Die langschnauzigen Velociraptorinen benutzten wahrscheinlich mehr ihre Klauen und weniger ihre Schädel zum Überwältigen von Beutetieren, im Unterschied zu anderen Dromaeosauriden wie den Dromaeosaurinen, die gedrungenere Schädel besaßen. 1995 schrieb Philip Currie \\"Deinonychus\\" sowie eine Reihe weiterer Dromaeosauriden den Velociraptorinae zu, was allgemeine Akzeptanz fand.', 'Eine neuere Studie von Nicholas Longrich und Philip Currie aus dem Jahr 2009 klassifiziert \\"Deinonychus\\" jedoch außerhalb der Velociraptorinae und stellt eine Eudromaeosauria genannte Gruppe auf, die \\"Deinonychus\\", die Velociraptorinae und die Dromaeosaurinae enthalten soll. Zusammen mit den Troodontiden bilden die Dromaeosauriden die Deinonychosauria, die nach Ansicht vieler Forscher die Schwestergruppe der Vögel und damit die mit den Vögeln am engsten verwandte Dinosauriergruppe ist.', 'Entdeckungsgeschichte und Namensgebung.', 'Frühe Entdeckungen und Erstbeschreibung.', 'Fossile Überreste von \\"Deinonychus\\" stammen aus der Cloverly-Formation in Montana und Wyoming sowie aus der etwa gleich alten Antlers-Formation in Oklahoma. Die Cloverly-Formation wurde auf das späte Aptium bis frühe Albium datiert und ist damit etwa 123 bis 110 Millionen Jahre alt. Darüber hinaus sind Zähne bekannt, die aus den Arundel Clay Facies (mittleres Aptium) der Potomac-Formation in Maryland stammen und möglicherweise dieser Gattung zugeordnet werden können.', 'Die ersten Überreste wurden 1931 im südlichen Montana entdeckt, in der Nähe der Stadt Bridger. Barnum Brown, der Leiter der Ausgrabungen, hatte die Absicht, Überreste des \\"Tenontosaurus\\" auszugraben und zu präparieren. In seinem Grabungsbericht an das American Museum of Natural History berichtete er jedoch über die Entdeckung eines kleinen fleischfressenden (karnivoren) Dinosauriers in unmittelbarer Nähe zu einem \\"Tenontosaurus\\"-Skelett, der aber „von Kalk umschlossen und schwer zu präparieren“ war. Barnum Brown nannte das Tier informell \\"Daptosaurus\\" und bereitete die Präparation vor, um es beschreiben und ausstellen zu können, hat seine Arbeit aber niemals beendet. Neben diesem Skelett entdeckte Barnum Brown in der Cloverly-Formation das Skelett eines noch kleineren Theropoden mit anscheinend übergroßen Zähnen, das er informell \\"Megadontosaurus\\" nannte. Wie John Ostrom Jahrzehnte später feststellte, stammen die Zähne von \\"Deinonychus\\" – das Skelett aber stammt von einem ganz anderen Tier, das er \\"Microvenator\\" nannte.', 'Im August 1964 entdeckte eine von John Ostrom geleitete Expedition des Peabody Museum of Natural History weiteres Skelettmaterial. Expeditionen während der folgenden zwei Sommer gruben mehr als 1000 Knochen aus, unter denen mindestens drei Individuen kleiner, fleischfressender Dinosaurier waren. Die Knochen wurden größtenteils unartikuliert vorgefunden, befanden sich also nicht mehr im Skelettverband, was es unmöglich machte, festzustellen, wie viele verschiedene Individuen vorlagen. Das Holotypus-Exemplar (YPM 5205) von \\"Deinonychus\\" umfasst daher nur einen vollständigen linken Fuß und Teile des rechten Fußes, die definitiv zum selben Individuum gehörten. Die übrigen Fundstücke wurden im Peabody Museum of Natural History der Yale University unter 50 verschiedenen Inventarnummern katalogisiert.', 'Eine spätere Studie von John Ostrom und Grant E. Meyer analysierte dieses Material sowie Barnum Browns \\"Daptosaurus\\" und kam zu dem Schluss, dass es sich bei diesen Funden um ein und dieselbe Art handelt. John Ostrom veröffentlichte seine Ergebnisse 1969 und schrieb alle Überreste dem neuen Taxon \\"Deinonychus antirrhopus\\" zu. \\"Deinonychus\\" bedeutet so viel wie „schreckliche Klaue“ und weist auf die ungewöhnlich große, sichelartige Kralle am zweiten Zeh hin. Der Artname \\"antirrhopus\\" bedeutet „Gegengewicht“ und verweist auf John Ostroms Hypothese zur Funktion des Schwanzes.', 'Obwohl bereits 1969 unzählige Knochen zur Verfügung standen, fehlten wichtige Teile des Skeletts oder waren schwierig zu interpretieren. So waren nur wenige postorbitale (hinter den Augen gelegene) Schädelknochen bekannt, und Oberschenkelknochen (Femur), Kreuzbein (Sacrum), Gabelbein (Furcula) und Brustbein (Sternum) fehlten ebenso wie einige Wirbel.

Sie wurde zunächst als Dragking in einer ab den 1950er Jahren landesweit populären Revue bekannt, eine wichtige Episode in der Geschichte der amerikanischen Drag-Szene. Im selben Zeitraum verbreitete sich der von ihr im Privatleben bevorzugte androgyne Kleidungsstil in ihrer Heimatstadt New York City, was als eines der ersten frühen Beispiele für eine wachsende Beliebtheit geschlechtsneutraler Kleidung in den Vereinigten Staaten betrachtet wird. ', 'Ihre Festnahme in der Nacht des 28. Juni 1969 und ihre Reaktion darauf gelten als einer der Hauptauslöser für den Aufstand in Stonewall, obgleich dies aufgrund sehr unterschiedlicher Angaben zu den Ereignissen umstritten ist. Gleich ihrer Rolle in Stonewall setzte sich DeLarverie seitdem verstärkt für LGBT-Personen ein, unter anderem durch regelmäßige Rundgänge im Greenwich Village zum Schutz der dort lebenden queeren Personen, vor allem lesbischer Frauen. Aus diesem Grund wurde DeLarverie schon zu Lebzeiten als „Rosa Parks der US-amerikanischen LGBT-Gemeinschaft“ bezeichnet.', 'Frühe Jahre.', 'Stormé DeLarverie wurde 1920 in New Orleans geboren. Ihre afroamerikanische Mutter war als Hausangestellte für einen wohlhabenden weißen Mann tätig, den sie später heiratete. Weil Mischehen zur damaligen Zeit illegal waren, erhielt DeLarverie nie eine Geburtsurkunde und wusste deshalb ihren genauen Geburtstag nicht. Deswegen entschied sie sich, diesen an Heiligabend zu feiern. ', 'In ihrer Kindheit sah sich DeLarverie massiven Anfeindungen sowohl weißer als auch afroamerikanischer Gleichaltriger ausgesetzt. So musste sie nach einer Prügelei eine Beinschiene tragen; bei einem anderen Vorfall wurde sie an einem Zaunpfahl aufgehängt. Die dadurch erlittene Verletzung hinterließ eine lebenslange Narbe am anderen Bein. Deswegen entschloss sich ihr Vater schließlich, sie zu ihrer eigenen Sicherheit für einige Jahre auf eine Privatschule außerhalb ihrer Wohngegend zu schicken.', 'Als Jugendliche war sie Springreiterin im Ringling Brothers Circus. Diese Tätigkeit beendete sie nach einem Sturz vom Pferd, der mehrere Knochenbrüche zur Folge gehabt hatte. Im Alter von 18 Jahren erkannte sie, dass sie lesbisch ist. Sie zog nach Chicago, weil sie befürchtete, im Süden wegen ihrer Homosexualität getötet zu werden. In ihren späten Teenagerjahren begann sie zudem eine Karriere als Alt-Jazz-Interpretin unter dem Künstlernamen Stormy Dale. \\"Stormy\\" etablierte sich auch als Aussprache ihres bürgerlichen Vornamens 1989 gab sie in einem Interview an, dass in diesem das \\"é\\" eigentlich stumm sei. Ab 1939 war sie Sängerin in verschiedenen Jazz- und Swing-Bigbands, mit einigen tourte sie gelegentlich durch Europa. Daneben verdiente DeLarverie nach eigener Aussage ihr Geld in Chicago als Personenschützerin für Mafiosi.', 'Anfang der 1940er Jahre lernte sie eine Tänzerin namens Diana kennen, mit der sie fortan in einer Beziehung lebte. Sie zogen einige Jahre später zusammen nach New York City, wo DeLarverie offen als lesbische Frau lebte. In Chicago hatte sie sich aus Angst vor homophoben Angriffen in der Öffentlichkeit als heterosexueller Mann ausgegeben. Dies gelang unter anderem durch ihren Kurzhaarschnitt und das Tragen von Anzügen. Daneben benutzte DeLarverie laut Freunden im Alltag verschiedene Anreden.', '1946 traf sie während einer Tournee in Miami Danny Brown und Doc Brenner, mit denen sie sich anfreundete. Die beiden aus New York stammenden Männer waren Produzenten und Mitglieder der Drag-Revue \\"Danny’s Jewel Box\\", die seit 1938 im gesamten Land auftrat. Brown und Brenner wollten durch ihre Vorführungen in Großstädten wie Denver und Seattle Drag, der damals einen Nischenplatz im Varieté einnahm, zu einer großen, humorvollen Bühnenshow und respektierten Kunstform machen. Sie baten DeLarverie aufgrund ihrer Erfahrung im Showgeschäft um Hilfe bei der Organisation ihrer Aufführung. ', 'Sie bot sich schließlich als Dragking für die beiden an, obwohl ihr im Bekanntenkreis davon abgeraten wurde, weil dies schlecht für ihren Ruf sei. Sie wollte zunächst nur sechs Monate lang in der Revue arbeiten. Weil ihr Stil bei den Zuschauern außerordentlich gut ankam, entschloss sie sich, dort zu bleiben und auch bei den Auftritten ihrer Jazz- und Swing-Bands in Männerkleidung auf der Bühne zu stehen. Dadurch steigerte sich ihre Beliebtheit beim Publikum, wodurch es ihren Gruppen auch möglich wurde, an bekannten Veranstaltungsorten wie der Radio City Music Hall oder dem Copacabana aufzutreten.', 'Die \\"Jewel Box Revue\\".', 'DeLarveries Zeit in der Revue.', 'Von 1955 bis 1969 tourte DeLarverie als Showmasterin, musikalische Direktorin, gelegentliche Inspizientin und einziger Dragking der \\"Jewel Box Revue\\" durch die Vereinigten Staaten. Diese hatte sich aus der \\"Danny’s Jewel Box\\" entwickelt und bestand neben DeLarverie aus 25 Dragqueens. Sie war bei queeren und heterosexuellen Personen gleichermaßen beliebt, wobei Familien mit Kindern zu den häufigsten Besuchern zählten. DeLarverie nannte sich allerdings selbst nicht Dragking, sondern bevorzugte die Bezeichnung \\"male impersonator\\", also männlicher Imitator.', 'Während der Aufführungen trat DeLarverie selbst als Sänger auf und bot Lieder wie \\"St. Louis Blues\\" von Bessie Smith oder \\"A Sunday Kind of Love\\" von Claude Thornhill dar. Die Zuschauer wurden währenddessen stets dazu aufgerufen, die einzige Künstlerin im Ensemble zu erraten. Dies gelang wegen DeLarveries maskulinem Erscheinungsbild, beispielsweise Maßanzüge mit Fliege und falschen Schnurrbärten, fast nie. Am Ende jeder Vorstellung gab sich DeLarverie schließlich unter dem Applaus des Publikums während des Lieds \\"A Surprise with a Song\\" als Frau zu erkennen.', 'Die \\"Jewel Box Revue\\" war das erste US-amerikanische Drag-Kabarett, in dem weiße und Travestiekünstler anderer Herkunft gemeinsam auftraten. Meistens fanden drei bis vier Vorstellungen der Gruppe an einem Abend statt, vorzugsweise in frequentierten Nachtclubs und anderen Örtlichkeiten in New York City, aber auch in weiteren Großstädten. Ein häufiger Veranstaltungsort war das Apollo Theater in Harlem; die Revue trat zudem öfter in der Radio City Music Hall und dem Copacabana auf, in die DeLarverie bereits mit ihren Bands eingeladen wurde. Bei allen Vorstellungen der Revue waren nicht-weiße Zuschauer zugelassen – eine absolute Seltenheit während der Rassentrennung in den Vereinigten Staaten. Ein weiterer Grund für die große Beliebtheit der Revue vor allem bei afroamerikanischen, queeren Personen war die Ähnlichkeit von DeLarveries maskuliner Bühnenfigur zu berühmten Butches, die während der Harlem Renaissance am Theater aufgetreten waren.', 'Eine Frau, die als Kind regelmäßig \\"Jewel Box\\"-Aufführungen besuchte, lieferte 2020 gegenüber \\"National Public Radio\\" (NPR) eine weitere Erklärung für deren damalige Popularität. Die Vorstellungen seien „erstklassig und umwerfend“ gewesen, weil es keine Budget-Obergrenze gab. DeLarverie und ihre Kollegen seien in hochwertigen Kostümen sowie vor aufwendigen Bühnenbildern aufgetreten. Sie hätten mitunter exotische Tiere wie Zebras für ihre Vorstellungen benutzt, ihre Gesangs- und Tanzkünste seien außergewöhnlich gut gewesen. Die Gruppe suche auch heutzutage ihresgleichen und lasse sich am besten mit aktuellen Drag-Künstlern wie RuPaul vergleichen. Laut Lisa Cannistraci, einer Bekannten DeLarveries, hätte diese sich durch die Drag-Auftritte zudem persönlich entfalten können. Sie war zwar schon in New Orleans als Sängerin aufgetreten, musste dabei aber Kleider, Perlenketten sowie einen Bob tragen, was ihr nicht behagte. Als prominentes Gesicht der Revue schloss DeLarverie Freundschaften mit zahlreichen bekannten Kunstschaffenden der Ära, beispielsweise Sammy Davis, Jr. sowie ihren persönlichen Vorbildern Dinah Washington und Billie Holiday.', 'Im Herbst 1969 zog sich DeLarverie nach dem Tod ihrer langjährigen Lebensgefährtin weitestgehend aus dem Unterhaltungsgeschäft zurück. Stattdessen bestritt sie ihren Lebensunterhalt als Personenschützerin für wohlhabende Familien. Im selben Jahr engagierte sie sich erstmals für die LGBT-Gemeinschaft, indem sie einer Organisation für die Rechte queerer Personen beitrat. Darüber hinaus arbeitete sie für Lesbenbars wie \\"Cubbyhole\\" als Türsteherin und Sicherheitsdienst. Von DeLarveries Drag-Auftritten sind keine Bewegtbildaufnahmen erhalten. Dafür waren in der NPR-Episode über ihr Leben kurze Ausschnitte ihrer Gesangsdarbietungen zu hören, ebenso eine Tonaufnahme, auf der sie während ihrer Tätigkeit als Türsteherin einen Gast der Örtlichkeit verweist. In einem Dokumentarfilm über DeLarverie präsentierte die Porträtierte einige Fotos ihrer früheren Auftritte, während ein weiteres Bild sie als Türsteherin zeigt, die vor einem ihrer Clubs Schaulustige zum Weitergehen auffordert.', 'John Reddick, ein Historiker mit Schwerpunkt auf der Geschichte Harlems, erläuterte gegenüber \\"National Public Radio\\", dass das Spiel mit Geschlechterrollen in afroamerikanischer Kunst altbekannt sei. Ein berühmtes Beispiel neben DeLarverie war die lesbische Schauspielerin Moms Mabley. Sie gehörte zur selben Zeit zum festen Ensemble des Apollo Theater und trug bei Auftritten oft Männerkleidung. Allerdings bedeute dies nicht, dass die Gesellschaft der 1950er und 1960er Jahre tolerant gegenüber offen queeren Kunstschaffenden, die Cross-Dressing betrieben, war. Im Theater sei diese Kleidungsweise zwar akzeptiert worden, ansonsten war sie in vielen Städten im Land illegal. Den Zuschauern sei die Sexualität der Betroffenen letztlich gleichgültig gewesen, ihnen ging es vor allem um Unterhaltung durch die Maskerade. Das Publikum habe das Geschlecht der Darsteller genau gekannt, selbst wenn es etwas anderes vorgab. DeLarverie kam Jahre nach ihrer Zeit in der Revue zu einem ähnlichen Fazit. Sie habe sich in Männerkleidung nicht anders verhalten oder bewegt.

Oily skin is challenging to manage due to the overproduction of sebum or your skin's natural oil. This excess sebum not only makes your skin shiny but also clogs pores, causing acne, blackheads, and whiteheads. Eliminating oily skin isn't possible, but you can undoubtedly learn how to manage it effectively and flaunt healthy, glowing skin. Don't worry; we've got you covered! Here are five tips for taking care of oily skin that will help you balance oil production and achieve skin health. 1. Choose the Right Cleanser The first step to caring for oily skin is to have a good daily cleansing routine. Cleansing removes excess oil, dirt, and makeup from your skin's surface, which helps prevent clogged pores and acne breakouts. Here's what you should keep in mind when choosing a cleanser for oily skin: - Look for oil-free, water-based, or gel-based cleansers, as they effectively remove excess oil without over-drying the skin. - Avoid soaps or cleansers containing harsh chemicals and alcohols that strip the skin's natural oil, as this might cause your skin to produce even more oil. - Opt for cleansers with salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or benzoyl peroxide, which help exfoliate and unclog pores, reducing the chances of acne breakouts. As a general guideline, cleanse your face twice a day, in the morning and evening, without over-cleansing since this can actually exacerbate oil production. 2. Don't Forget to Exfoliate Exfoliating your skin is essential when dealing with oily skin, as it helps remove dead skin cells, excess oil, and other impurities from the skin's surface and prevents acne. Here's how to exfoliate right: - Choose a gentle exfoliator with alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), chemicals that gently slough off dead skin cells and unclog pores, such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. Avoid rough, abrasive scrubs that might irritate your skin. - Exfoliate only two or three times per week to avoid over-exfoliating, which can strip your skin of its natural moisture and worsen oil production. - Remember to moisturize after exfoliating to maintain your skin's hydration. 3. Don't Skimp on Moisturizing One of the biggest misconceptions about oily skin is thinking that it doesn't require moisturization. Contrary to this belief, dehydrated skin leads to an overproduction of oil to compensate for the lack of moisture. Therefore, moisturizing oily skin is crucial for maintaining balance and keeping your skin healthy. Here are some tips for moisturizing oily skin: - Look for oil-free, lightweight, or water-based moisturizers that provide hydration without clogging pores. - Avoid heavy or greasy formulas that can exacerbate oiliness and cause acne breakouts. - Consider using a gel-based moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, as this ingredient can hydrate the skin without making it overly greasy. 4. Don't Underestimate the Importance of Sun Protection Oily skin is no excuse for skipping sunscreen. Sun damage is one of the leading causes of premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and skin cancer. That being said, finding the right sunscreen for oily skin can be tricky. Here's what to look for: - Choose a sunscreen with a matte, oil-free, or non-comedogenic formula, usually found in gel, water-based, or powder-based sunscreens. - Opt for sunscreens with at least SPF 30, which offers adequate protection against the sun's harmful UV rays. - Reapply your sunscreen every 2-3 hours, especially if you're spending prolonged periods outdoors or swimming. 5. Be Mindful of Your Diet and Lifestyle Choices Lastly, taking care of oily skin goes beyond the products you apply to your face. Your diet and lifestyle habits play a significant role in balancing oil production. Here are some final tips: - Limit your intake of junk food, fried and oily food, and excessive sugar, as they can contribute to oiliness and acne. - Incorporate antioxidant-rich foods into your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and fish, as they promote overall skin health. - Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day to flush out toxins and maintain the health of your skin. - Reduce stress levels through exercise, yoga, meditation, or other stress-relieving activities, as elevated stress hormones can lead to increased oil production. Conclusion: Embrace Your Oily Skin Journey Taking care of oily skin isn't a one-time task; it's a journey that requires consistency and dedication. By following these five tips, you can effectively manage your oily skin, combat skin issues, and achieve a healthy, radiant complexion. Remember, everyone's skin is different, and what works for someone else might not work for you. Be patient, experiment with different products, and find a routine tailored to your unique needs. With time, mindful care, and persistence, you'll surely conquer your oily skin woes and feel confident flaunting your beautiful, natural skin."},{"instruction":"оформи как таблицу: Компания Кол-во квартир Площадки размещения Средняя стоимость по видам квартир Наличие бескониактного заезда Год основания Собственный сайт Соцсети Отчетные доки трансфер Apartaments VL 6 Фарпост 2хкомнатная 7550, 1-комнатная 5142,2 Да, онлайн бронирование 2021 есть, онлайн-бронь Вк, Инст, В соцсетях много говорят об отдыхе в городе Бизнес и комфорт класс.

Hey!\\" Last night, I fell asleep on the sofa and was woken up by my wife. \\"Did you write this?\\" She held the screen of my smartphone with a twisted smile on her face. On the screen was a fantasy story that I had written. I couldn't find the right words to respond, and a few moments passed in silence. \\"So it is.\\" From that moment, conversation and laughter disappeared from our house. And then, this morning.

It had no subject or content, just an attached file. When I opened it, I found a picture of a couple nestled together with picturesque mountains in the background. My wife, with her hair down and blowing in the wind, smiled happily next to a man I didn't know. Later that night, another email arrived. This time, there were two attachments. The first showed my wife in a seductive pose with a beautifully lit garden in the background. She wore a colorful, floral-patterned lace bra and barely-there panties. A frilly garter belt wrapped around her slim waist with stockings attached halfway up her thighs. Her unfamiliar, enchanting smile pierced my heart like a burning, red-hot steel. In the second photo, she was in an old, dimly lit room. She straddled someone in disarray on a bed with her hair messed up. She had a worried expression on her face, biting her slightly upturned index finger. It was impossible to see where one person's skin ended and the other's began. The mark of her wedding ring had disappeared entirely. Of course, I tried to contact her through email, phone calls, and social media. However, I got no response from her, and she didn't answer her phone. Her GPS location wasn't being updated either. That man she was with must've turned it off.

Возможна также эволюционная трансформация политической системы, если российские власти начнут работать на благо общества и уделять больше внимания развитию экономики и социальной стабильности."},{"instruction":"Prepare me a very hard week long training for strenght, with only a pull up bar, dip bars and 10kg of additional weight.","output":"Monday: - Warm up with 10 minutes of jumping jacks - 5 sets of 10 pull ups with 10kg of additional weight - 5 sets of 10 dips - 3 sets of 10 hanging leg raises Tuesday: - Warm up with 10 minutes of jogging in place - 5 sets of 10 chin ups with 10kg of additional weight - 5 sets of 10 push ups with hands on dip bars - 3 sets of 10 knee raises on dip bars Wednesday: - Warm up with 10 minutes of jumping jacks - 5 sets of 10 wide grip pull ups with 10kg of additional weight - 5 sets of 10 dips with legs extended - 3 sets of 10 leg raises on pull up bar while holding a medicine ball between ankles Thursday: - Warm up with 10 minutes of jogging in place - 5 sets of 10 close grip chin ups with 10kg of additional weight - 5 sets of 10 inclined push ups with feet on dip bars - 3 sets of 10 elevated knee raises on dip bars Friday: - Warm up with 10 minutes of jumping jacks - 5 sets of 10 one arm pull ups (5 each arm) with 10kg of additional weight - 5 sets of 10 close grip dips - 3 sets of 10 windshield wipers on pull up bar Saturday: - Warm up with 10 minutes of jogging in place - 5 sets of 10 explosive pull ups with 10kg of additional weight (try to pull up as high as possible) - 5 sets of 10 explosive dips (try to push up as fast as possible) - 3 sets of 10 Russian twists with medicine ball (each side) Sunday: - Rest day Remember to stretch before and after each workout.

Согласно этой методике, все задачи делятся на три группы: Группа А — особенно важные дела. Они составляют 15% от всех задач, однако вносят самый большой вклад в достижение целей (около 65%). Группа Б — просто важные задачи. Они оставляют 20% от списка дел и вносят 20% вклада в достижение целей. Группа В — менее важные и несущественные задачи. Составляют до 65% от всех задач, однако вносят всего лишь 15% вклада в достижение целей. Схематически это можно изобразить так: Расстановка приоритетов с помощью АБВ-анализа проходит в пять этапов: Этап 1. Составьте список задач на планируемый промежуток времени (день, неделя и т. д.). Этап 2. Расположите задачи по их важности. Для этого нужно оценить, насколько та или иная задача приближает вас к достижению целей. Получившийся список перенумеруйте. Главное — это выявить и перенумеровать самые важные задачи. Как будут перенумерованы второстепенные дела — не принципиально. Этап 3. Первые 15% задач пометьте буквой А, следующие 20% — буквой Б, а оставшиеся 65% — буквой В. Если количество задач не кратно процентам, округляйте в удобную для вас сторону. Например, в списке из 10 задач в группу А может попасть как одна, так и две задачи. Этап 4. Попробуйте изменить бюджет времени на эти группы задач: 65% времени должно приходиться на задачи А; 20% на задачи Б; 15% на задачи В. Например, если на работу мы выделили 10 часов, то время будет распределяться следующим образом: Этап 5. Понятно, что на дела из категорий Б и В теперь приходится очень мало времени. Поэтому подумайте, как сократить время на выполнение этих задач. Можно ли их кому-нибудь делегировать или перепоручить? Можно ли их вообще не делать? Но тут важно понимать, что если задачи относятся к категории В — это еще не значит, что они ненужные или необязательные. Во-первых, такие задачи могут быть подготовительными этапами для задач А и Б. Во-вторых, их регулярное невыполнение может привести к крупным неприятностям. Например, ежемесячная оплата хостинга интернет-магазина — это типичная задача В. Но если ее не выполнить, то никакого магазина уже не будет. Пару слов о технике АБВ-анализ — это достаточно популярная методика, которая в наши дни активно применяется в бизнесе (например, для оценки ассортимента). В современной литературе она обычно называется «abc-анализ» (читается как «эйбиси-анализ» или «абэцэ-анализ»). Использовать эту технику для планирования времени впервые предложил немецкий специалист по тайм-менеджменту Лотар Зайверт. АБВ-анализ — это мощный инструмент расстановки приоритетов. В некоторых ситуациях он гораздо эффективнее матрицы Эйзенхауэра, однако отнимает больше времени и требует вдумчивого подхода к оценке задач. Задание Разделите свои повседневные задачи по принципу АБВ-анализа.","output":"Пример разделения повседневных задач по АБВ-анализу: Группа А (особенно важные дела): 1.

Ответ на важное письмо от партнера 2. Подготовка отчета для начальства 3. Проработка стратегии маркетинга для нового продукта Группа В (менее важные и несущественные задачи): 1. Оплата за подписку на журналы 2. Заказ канцелярских товаров 3. Подготовка и отправка поздравлений коллегам по поводу дня рождения Это только примеры задач, каждый может составить свой список по своим конкретным задачам. При распределении времени и установке приоритетов следует учитывать, что задачи могут меняться по мере их выполнения и появления новых важных задач."},{"instruction":"услуга в посуточной аренде при разборе маркетинга 7п чем отличается от физического окружения и процесса?","output":"Услуга в посуточной аренде - это один из элементов маркетинговых 7P, который относится к продукту.

Wyróżnia się kilka klas pustaków, z których każda ma swoje unikalne właściwości i zastosowania. 1. Pustaki pełne - są to pustaki wykonane z materiałów ceramicznych, betonowych lub silikatów. Są gęste i ciężkie, ale charakteryzują się wysoką wytrzymałością na ściskanie i są bardzo odporne na ogień. Zwykle używane są do budowy fundamentów i ścian konstrukcyjnych. 2. Pustaki lekkie - są to pustaki wykonane z materiałów syntetycznych, takich jak polistyren ekspandowany (EPS) lub poliuretan (PUR). Charakteryzują się niską gęstością i wagą, ale również niższą wytrzymałością i mniejszą odpornością na ogień. Zwykle stosowane są do budowania ścian działowych i niekonstrukcyjnych. 3. Pustaki perforowane - są to pustaki wykonane z materiałów ceramicznych lub betonu, które posiadają otwory wewnątrz struktury. Otwory zmniejszają ich wagę i gęstość, ale jednocześnie zmniejszają ich wytrzymałość na ściskanie. Zwykle używane są do budowy ścian warstwowych i elewacji. 4. Pustaki trójwarstwowe - są to pustaki składające się z trzech warstw, wewnętrznej z betonu lub keramzytu i dwóch zewnętrznych, wypełnionych izolacją termiczną. Są stosowane w budownictwie energooszczędnym, ze względu na swoją dobrą izolacyjność termiczną. 5. Pustaki szklane - są to pustaki wykonane z hartowanego szkła.

Программирование - это процесс создания таких инструкций с использованием языка программирования. Основы программирования обычно включают следующие концепции: 1. Переменные: используются для хранения данных. Переменные имеют имя и тип данных, которые они могут хранить. 2. Функции (или методы): блоки кода, которые выполняют определенную операцию. 3. Условные выражения: операторы, которые предоставляют возможность выполнять разный код в зависимости от того, выполняется ли определенное условие. 4. Циклы: позволяют повторять определенный блок кода до тех пор, пока условие не станет ложным. 5. Массивы и коллекции: структуры данных для хранения и обработки множества значений. 6. Ошибки и исключения: предоставляют возможность обрабатывать исключительные ситуации. Выбор языка программирования зависит от ваших целей и предпочтений. Самые популярные языки программирования включают: - Python: идеально подходит для начинающих из-за своей простоты и читаемости. Python используется для веб-разработки, автоматизации, науки о данных и многого другого. - JavaScript: широко используется для создания интерактивных веб-сайтов и веб-приложений. - Java: популярный, мощный и многофункциональный язык программирования, который применяется в веб-разработке, мобильных приложениях и корпоративных системах. - C#: разработан Microsoft и широко используется для разработки Windows-приложений и веб-приложений на платформе .NET.

Раньше Unity также поддерживал код на языке UnityScript (похож на JavaScript), но эта поддержка была прекращена. Сейчас основной язык программирования для Unity - это C#. C# является мощным объектно-ориентированным языком программирования, разработанным Microsoft. В Unity вы будете писать скрипты на C#, которые будут определять поведение игровых объектов, реализацию игровых механик и взаимодействие с пользователем. Пример простого C# скрипта в Unity: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour { public float speed = 5.0f; private void Update() { float horizontalMovement = Input.GetAxis(\\"Horizontal\\"); float verticalMovement = Input.GetAxis(\\"Vertical\\"); transform.Translate(new Vector3(horizontalMovement, 0, verticalMovement) * speed * Time.deltaTime); } } \`\`\` Этот пример кода создает простой скрипт на языке C#, который будет перемещать игровой объект в лево/право и вверх/вниз в зависимости от пользовательского ввода, используя заданную скорость перемещения (speed). Чтобы научиться программированию в Unity на языке C#, вам стоит изучить основы языка C#, а также особенности работы с игровым движком Unity, такие как компоненты, события, корутины и префабы.

Do you want to do a prelim literature search and see if there is anything like that out there? Additionally, can you make an abstract for a research project like this?","output":"Title: Incidence of Depigmentation in patients with Graft-Versus-Host Disease Treated with Oral Ruxolitinib Compared to Other Systemic Therapies: A Retrospective Chart Review Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent and severe complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Ruxolitinib, a JAK 1/2 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in treating steroid-refractory GVHD; nevertheless, depigmentation has been reported as an identified potential side effect. There has been limited research comparing the incidence of depigmentation in patients treated with oral ruxolitinib vs. other systemic therapies for GVHD. Objective: The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the incidence of depigmentation in patients treated with oral ruxolitinib for GVHD, and 2) compare the incidence of depigmentation to patients treated with other systemic therapies for GVHD. Methods: We plan to conduct a single-center, retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with GVHD and treated with systemic therapies between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, GVHD diagnosis, treatment details, and adverse events will be extracted from medical records. The primary outcome will be the incidence of depigmentation in patients treated with oral ruxolitinib for GVHD, compared to the incidence of depigmentation in patients treated with other systemic therapies. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to compare the two groups. Preliminary literature search findings indicate that there is a lack of research evaluating the incidence of depigmentation in patients treated with oral ruxolitinib compared with other systemic therapies for GVHD. Conclusion: This retrospective chart review will help elucidate the incidence of depigmentation in patients treated with oral ruxolitinib compared to patients treated with other systemic therapies for GVHD. The study’s findings may contribute to guiding clinicians in making evidence-based decisions regarding the management of patients with GVHD and better understanding of the associated complications of various treatment options."},{"instruction":"кто ты?","output":"Я - искусственный интеллект, называюсь OpenAI.

U nastavku sledi detaljnije objašnjenje za svaku od stavki predavanja: 1. Uvod u računarske mreže - Računarske mreže predstavljaju povezivanje računara i drugih uređaja kako bi razmenjivali informacije i resurse. - Mreže se koriste u različite svrhe: poslovne komunikacije, komunikacija sa porodicom i prijateljima, pretraga sadržaja na internetu, obrazovanje, zabava, i mnoge druge. 2. Podela računarskih mreža - Osnovna podela mreža zasniva se na njihovom geografskom obuhvatu: LAN (lokalna mreža), MAN (metropolitanska mreža) i WAN (širokopojasna mreža). - Brzina prenosa podataka varira u zavisnosti o vrsti mreže, pri čemu LAN mreže obično imaju brži prenos u odnosu na WAN. - Mreže se mogu takođe klasifikovati po funkcionalnosti, tehnologiji i topologiji. 3. LAN (Local Area Network) - lokalne mreže - LAN mreže su ograničene na manji geografski prostor, kao što su domovi, škole ili kancelarije. - Primer: jedan ured koji koristi shared printer i mrežni disk za skladištenje podataka. - LAN mreže se obično koriste unutar jedne zgrade i povezuju uređaje koristeći Ethernet kablove ili bežičnu Wi-Fi vezu. 4. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) - metropolitanske mreže - MAN mreže imaju veći geografski obuhvat od LAN mreža i obično pokrivaju područje nekoliko kilometara, kao što su gradovi ili industrijski parkovi. - Primer: mreža koja povezuje više zgrada unutar jedne školske ili poslovne infrastrukture. - MAN mreže koriste brze veze, kao što su optički kablovi i bežični releji, da bi prenosili podatke između povezanih zgrada. 5. WAN (Wide Area Network) - širokopojasne mreže - WAN mreže obuhvataju najveći geografski prostor i mogu povezivati uređaje širom sveta. - Internet je primer najpoznatije WAN mreže koja omogućava globalno povezivanje svih vrsta uređaja. - WAN mreže koriste različite vrste veza, uključujući satelitske veze, podmorske kablovske sisteme, i velike ruter-centrale. 6. Druge klasifikacije računarskih mreža - Funkcionalna podela: klijent-server mreže, pri čemu serveri pružaju resurse i usluge, a klijenti ih koriste; peer-to-peer mreže, gde svi uređaji imaju jednaku ulogu i komuniciraju direktno jedni s drugima. - Tehnološka podela: žičane mreže koriste fizičke kablove za povezivanje uređaja; bežične mreže koriste radio talase za prenos informacija; optičke mreže koriste svetlosne signale u optičkim vlaknima za prenos podataka. - Topološka podela: topologija mreže opisuje raspored uređaja u mreži i način na koji su međusobno povezani. Osnovne topologije uključuju zvezdu (centralni čvor sa uređajima povezanim direktno), prsten (uređaji povezani u zatvorenom krugu), mrežu (uređaji povezani kroz više direktnih veza) i stablo (hijerarhijska povezanost). 7. Zaključak - Razumeti različite vrste mreža i njihovu upotrebu omogućava bolje razumevanje kako računarske mreže funkcionišu i kako se mogu primeniti u različitim situacijama. - Na osnovu ovog predavanja, naučili smo kako su računarske mreže podeljene i kako svaka vrsta mreže ima svoje osobine, tehnologije i karakteristike."},{"instruction":"Što predstavlja i kako se definira karakteristična vrijednost na strani djelovanja?","output":"Karakteristična vrijednost na strani djelovanja (također poznata kao karakteristična sila ili karakteristično opterećenje) predstavlja specifičnu, kritičnu ili reprezentativnu vrijednost sile ili opterećenja koja djeluje na neku strukturu, sustav ili materijal. Ova vrijednost često se koristi za analizu naprezanja, stabilnosti i izdržljivosti konstrukcija, kao i za dizajn mehaničkih komponenti i sustava. Karakteristična vrijednost na strani djelovanja definira se uzimanjem u obzir razne faktore, poput statističke raspodjele opterećenja, vjerojatnosti djelovanja različitih opterećenja, trajanja opterećenja, kombinacija opterećenja i ograničenja strukturalnog kapaciteta. Za neke konstrukcije, karakteristična vrijednost može se temeljiti na maksimalnom očekivanom opterećenju, dok se u drugim slučajevima može temeljiti na prosječnoj ili reprezentativnoj vrijednosti sile tijekom vremena. U kontekstu građevinske inženjeringa, karakteristične vrijednosti opterećenja često se koriste za proračun dimenzioniranja elemenata konstrukcije (poput stupova, greda i ploča), za određivanje sigurnosnih faktora dizajna i za procjenu vijeka trajanja konstrukcije. Karakteristična vrijednost na strani djelovanja može se odrediti izravno mjerenjem ili eksperimentalnim testiranjem, analizom podataka o vremenskim serijama sile ili pritiska, ili kroz statističku analizu sile primjenjene na sličnim sustavima ili materijalima. U nekim slučajevima, norme i kodovi građevinske prakse mogu propisati karakteristične vrijednosti za određene vrste opterećenja, kao što su snijeg, vjetar ili potres."},{"instruction":"Please write a poem about how good it is to live when the sun is shining, the birds are singing and the flowers are blooming.","output":"In golden mornings, when the sun ascends And casts a lustrous veil on verdant lands, When Dawn unveils the realm of sweetest grace, A paradise of light unwinds its limbs.

What time are you going?” “I need to be there by 8:30, I think.” “Hmm.” “…I’m sorry.” The next morning, when I woke up, my wife had already finished getting ready to leave. She was wearing her favorite outfit that she doesn’t wear to work, probably because she doesn’t have any classes today. It was drizzling outside. “Ugh, I’m starting to lose motivation to go.” “Really?” “Well, but I have to go, right?” “Hmm.” Looking reluctant, my wife finished her coffee and stood up. “I just need to print out the materials for everyone and bind them, so it should be quick.” “Okay.” “I’ll be back soon.” With that, she picked up her usual bag and left. It’s almost noon now, but… My wife still hasn’t come back. Her GPS on her phone shows that she hasn’t moved from her workplace since she left, and she knows I can track her location. There’s still no response to the message I sent about an hour ago… The Ring Finger - My selfish imagination or the truth…? - “Hey? You’re not wearing the ring?” While having dinner face-to-face, I suddenly noticed that my wife had taken off her ring from her left hand. “Huh? Oh, yeah. Some kids tend to care about it, so I took it off.” “Really?” I was surprised because I had never cared about such things when I was a child. “Well, they’re not being too showy, but girls tend to care more.” “I see. Hmm.” I thought it was just one of those things and didn’t say any more. “I think you can put the ring back on when we get home, right?” While soaking in the bath, the thought suddenly came to me and I muttered it. But by the time I got out, my wife was already fast asleep. Since then, I couldn’t tell her, and the days went by. The mark on her ring finger was now almost gone. Chapter Title: Somehow, I Got Scolded ------ Is it just my selfish imagination or is it the truth…? ------ “What’s with the serious face, what are you looking at?” My wife is sitting in front of her laptop, seemingly lost in thought. I wonder if she’s encountered some kind of trouble, so I take a peek and… “Oh, she’s asleep.” Her soft hair carries a gentle scent. “Ugh, I’d feel bad if I woke her up, but she might catch a cold like this.” As I debate what to do, I slowly wrap my arms around her delicate shoulders. The simple act of breathing her in feels like it could heal the exhaustion of the entire day. “Nh? What’s this?” “Ah, did I wake you up?” Her groggy, sleepy manner of speaking is so cute that my hand instinctively drifts towards her breasts. “Hey, it’s hot, you know!” With a snap, she pushes me away, and my hands desperately search for a destination in mid-air. “Did you see it?” “Huh, see what?” “The laptop screen.” “No, it was in power-saving mode.” “I see.” She closes the laptop lid and stashes it in her bag. Today, too, my hands are left wandering aimlessly in the air… Chapter 04: Laundry Basket “The bath is ready.” With those words, my wife walks past me. When I look behind, I see her in her pajamas, wiping her hair with a towel, disappearing behind the door. “Alright.” I put down my smartphone and head for the bathroom. “Is it here?” I gently close the door and search through the basket filled with laundry… and found her underwear right away. “There doesn’t seem to be anything weird about it…” Unlike the typical white and sticky fluid that often sticks to the crotch in the stories I saw online, it wasn’t there. I can’t help but sigh in relief. Still, the soft fabric in my hands… had enveloped the secret place of the woman I love today. The moment I realized that, my heart pounds intensely again. I bring my nose closer to it, smelling it very carefully. A faint scent of urine. And a sweet-sour fragrance that reminds me of a yogurt drink. If I think that they’re all from her, even these scents are more fragrant than perfume, which is quite strange. “Yeah, I’m messed up. Seriously.” Although I would’ve liked to enjoy it a little more, I put it back to its original position. I try to put back the clothes I’ve moved aside when I found it. “Huh? Did she have something like this?” As I unfold it, I see a deep blue satin fabric adorned with elegant embroidery and lace. Upon checking the tag, even I recognize the brilliant logo of a famous brand. She, who values comfort over design, was supposed to only have simple cotton ones… (Speaking of which, the idea that one should buy and wear tops and bottoms as a set was soon shattered after we got married.) My body shivers involuntarily as I carefully restore the situation without leaving any traces, and then I enter the bathroom. “I wish she’d show me what it looks like when she’s wearing it…” Such a whisper escapes my lips, dissolving into the steam without reaching anyone. Some time has passed since that day, yet the opportunity to see her wearing it hasn’t arrived. ------ Is it just my imagination or is it the truth? I still don’t know… ------ Chapter 05 - My Wife’s Breasts When was the last time I saw her naked? As I look at her back while she sleeps in her pajamas on the bed beside me, I suddenly find myself wondering, and the thought grows bigger. Seven years since we got married, and I haven’t seen my wife’s naked body, let alone had sex in almost a year. “Hey, are you awake?” I quietly ask with fear, but there’s no answer. I hear her gentle snores, so I carefully slip out of the bed. I carefully peek at her face turned toward the wall, and I see her loose hair swinging in sync with her breath on her peaceful sleeping face. As usual, she’s incredibly adorable, and I have to resist the urge to nibble on her. Instead, I enjoy observing the sleeping figure of my beloved wife. It would be cruel to wake her up, I tell myself. But I can’t suppress my desires. Being careful not to creak the bed’s springs, I slowly lean my upper body towards her. Her eyelids occasionally twitch, and the sweet scent that escapes from her slightly parted lips burns away whatever little reason I have left. Unconsciously, my face moves closer, and I feel her cold touch on the tip of my nose. “… Mm…” That was close! I listen to her rhythmic breathing. Maybe it’s because she didn’t wake up, but I can’t help but think of something more daring. Quietly, I climb onto the neighboring bed and wrap my arm around her body from behind. The scent of shampoo and a faint hint of sweat; the warmth of her body in my arms; my lovely wife. “… “ In sync with her breathing, my palm feels the rise and fall of her pajama-clad chest. Once again, I give in to temptation and gently place my hand on its roundness. And I’m introduced to a soft sensation that I’m not familiar with. To me, her modest B-cup that she’s slightly self-conscious about is a symbol of her delicate beauty. Shouldn’t I be feeling the hardness of her bra pad? Instead, I feel a soft fullness in my palm that doesn’t match my memory. And there’s a hardness right at the center of my palm… ”…Mm…” I managed to escape from my wife’s body as she tries to turn in her sleep, but my heart races for another reason. Staring at my palm, I try to think of what the hard object might have been… “a nipple piercing” is all that comes to mind. But why would my wife have such a thing on her breast? No, it can’t be. It must be some mistake. Well, I can’t confirm the truth until I can actually see it. “Can’t be helped. I should sleep.” I say, but it takes a long time before I finally drift off. ----- If I notice anything else, I might continue this story. Chapter 6: A Crimson Mark I don’t know if it’s just my imagination or if it’s the truth… “Good morning.” As I nervously greeted her, she responded with a bright smile and cheerful voice. Pretending to watch the news on TV, I subtly glanced at my wife who was standing in the kitchen. There was no unnatural shadow on her chest. “Oh, by the way, I have a meeting tonight, so I think I’ll be home late. …Did any hand, did something happen?” “Hmm? No, it seemed like it was just my imagination.” “Really? Ah, about dinner tonight…” “I got it. I’ll make it.” “No, that’s not it. I don’t need my share, you can just eat something on your way back from work.” “Ah, I see. Alright.” “Sorry, okay?” “You seem really busy.” “Well, there’s a lot going on.” — “I have to prepare various things, so I’ll be home quite late. Sleep first, okay?” “Alright. Good luck.” Even with the lights on, the house somehow felt dark. “Good morning.” “Ah, good morning! Sorry about yesterday.” I peeked at my wife from behind as she tied her hair in front of the dresser. Her carefree smile in the mirror swept away my dark fantasies one by one. “Don’t push yourself too hard or you’ll get sick.” “Yeah, thank you. But it’ll be over soon.” At the edge of my sight, I saw something. A small mark that looked like a red leaf. It was probably not visible to her, hidden in the nape of her neck where her hair was tied up. “Hey, do we have any ointment for bug bites around here?” “U-uhm?” “What’s wrong?” Her eyes were staring at me through the mirror. “I’ll look for the bug bite ointment.” “Thanks!” I couldn’t bring myself to stare back at her. 07 Cute Dog My random fantasy or the truth? “Do you prefer dogs? Or cats?” My wife asked me this while we were having dinner, just the two of us facing each other for the first time in a while. “Huh?” As I looked up from the grilled fish I was struggling with, I saw her completely absorbed in a TV show about animals. “That kitten is so cute!” I didn’t find it interesting. “I like dogs more, but I don’t think I need a pet as long as I have you.” “Wait, are you treating me like a pet?” “Not really, but maybe.” “What’s with that?” She suddenly burst into laughter. “Do you want me to wear a collar and crawl on all fours?” I had no idea where she came up with such a thought. Surprised, I saw her smirk and drop another bombshell. “Or should I grow a tail for you?” “Really!?” Biting into her joke, she stared back at me with glaring eyes. “…It’s a joke.” Ugh… “So, you have that kind of hobby. I didn’t know that.” “Let’s take a closer look at the mysterious behavior of this curious animal with some rare footage!” I seriously considered smashing the TV and throwing it out the window. 08 My Wife’s Shower My random fantasy or the truth? There was something that bothered me yesterday. Recently, my wife always takes a shower almost as soon as she comes home. It’s already October, and it’s not even hot enough to sweat. In fact, wearing short sleeves sometimes feels cool. And she is not just rinsing herself under the water, she properly uses soap, so she doesn’t seem to be planning to take a bath before going to bed. Well, since she often comes home later than me, as long as she is careful, she wouldn’t catch a cold from cooling down too much after the shower…. “I’m home.” “Welcome back. Dinner is ready.” “Thanks. I’ll take a shower first.” She tossed her belongings on the sofa and quickly disappeared into the bathroom. “Oh, I forgot to mention…” I chased after her and knocked on the bathroom door. “W-what?” Her reply was a bit flustered. Maybe I startled her. “I heated the water for the bath today.” “…Thank you.” I spoke through the door and tried to walk away, but my legs…stopped. “Should I take a peek just for a moment?” I’m curious what kind of underwear she’s wearing today. I can’t help it! Listening carefully, I could hear the sound of the shower running. She must already be in there. “…A shower?” I told her that the bathwater was heated, and she should have noticed it too. “The reason she doesn’t want to soak in the bath… Oh.” I see, that’s it. She’s a bit heavier in the chest area, so maybe she needs to wear more supportive undergarments. It makes sense that she wouldn’t want to soak in the bath then. Anyway, I no longer have a reason to be here. I headed to the kitchen to reheat the side dish for my wife. 09 Today’s events I’m writing this on Saturday night, or should I say, the early hours of Sunday. My head is so confused, and I don’t think I can write a coherent sentence, but maybe writing this will help me organize my thoughts. “Hey, wake up! Hey!” Last night, I fell asleep on the sofa and was woken up by my wife. “Did you write this?” She held the screen of my smartphone with a twisted smile on her face. On the screen was a fantasy story that I had written. I couldn’t find the right words to respond, and a few moments passed in silence. “So it is.” From that moment, conversation and laughter disappeared from our house. And then, this morning. It was Saturday, and my wife was supposed to be off work, but she had a large suitcase with her. “I’m going on a training trip. I’ll be back tomorrow night.” “But I thought you said you weren’t going…” The door slammed shut, hiding her figure from me. In the afternoon, I received an email from my wife. It had no subject or content, just an attached file. When I opened it, I found a picture of a couple nestled together with picturesque mountains in the background. My wife, with her hair down and blowing in the wind, smiled happily next to a man I didn’t know. Later that night, another email arrived. This time, there were two attachments. The first showed my wife in a seductive pose with a beautifully lit garden in the background. She wore a colorful, floral-patterned lace bra and barely-there panties. A frilly garter belt wrapped around her slim waist with stockings attached halfway up her thighs. Her unfamiliar, enchanting smile pierced my heart like a burning, red-hot steel. In the second photo, she was in an old, dimly lit room. She straddled someone in disarray on a bed with her hair messed up. She had a worried expression on her face, biting her slightly upturned index finger. It was impossible to see where one person’s skin ended and the other’s began. The mark of her wedding ring had disappeared entirely. Of course, I tried to contact her through email, phone calls, and social media. However, I got no response from her, and she didn’t answer her phone. Her GPS location wasn’t being updated either. That man she was with must’ve turned it off. I’ve been drinking countless glasses of neat whiskey, but I can’t seem to get drunk. I don’t know what to do. Can someone please tell me? Is this all just my fantasy, or is it something more? My wife hasn’t come home yet… This morning, I noticed an email when I woke up. In it, my wife was sitting comfortably on a steamy, cobblestoned open-air bath, her expression shy as her beautiful legs were spread wide. There was no sign of a shadow in the center, and from between the gaping petals, a thick and sticky nectar was dripping. Not feeling like doing anything, the afternoon came. My smartphone vibrated on the table. My wife lay on a dentist-like chair, her chest exposed and a rather proud expression on her face. Two silver rings pierced her nipples, shining brightly. As the living room walls turned orange in the evening, I received another photo. She was wearing a white veil. Extending her left hand wrapped in satin gloves towards the camera and moist droplets running down her cheeks. Her white dress was generously exposed at the chest, and her plump breasts and piercingly adorned nipples were presented. They looked like rings. In the dark room where the sun had completely set, a square of light shone. All my wife wore now was a deep red collar and a glossy black tail, the same color as her hair. The collar’s color matched the leash that someone’s hand was grasping. She looked at me with a melting expression, crawling on all fours like a dog. From her half-opened red lips, drool was about to spill. When I woke up, my sleeves were sticky and smelly with drool. “Was I…sleeping?” I looked around the quiet, dark living room. The light from my forsaken smartphone was blinding. “I will be back tomorrow night.” That’s what she said before she left. The date was about to change.

Расстановка приоритетов представляет собой выбор наиболее важных и срочных задач для выполнения. 2. Умение расставлять приоритеты помогает эффективнее использовать свое время и силы, повышает производительность, позволяет достичь поставленных целей. 3. Методы расстановки приоритетов включают принцип Парето, матрицу Эйзенхауэра, метод ABC, метод Франклина и др. 4. Задачи в соответствии с матрицей Эйзенхауэра делятся на четыре типа: важные и срочные, важные и несрочные, не важные и срочные, не важные и несрочные. 5. Метод многокритериальной оценки целесообразно использовать, когда необходимо сравнить различные альтернативы по нескольким критериям. 6. Суть метода многокритериальной оценки заключается в том, чтобы присвоить каждому критерию вес, затем оценить каждую альтернативу по всем критериям и умножить оценки на соответствующие веса, после чего сложить результаты для каждой альтернативы. 7. Наиболее приоритетные цели можно выделить, используя метод ABC, который позволяет разделить задачи на три категории по степени важности: А - наиболее важные, В - менее важные, С - несущественные. 8. Основная идея расстановки приоритетов по принципу «80/20» заключается в том, что 20% усилий приносят 80% результатов, поэтому основное внимание следует уделить наиболее результативным делам. 9. Принцип Парето можно использовать при планировании времени на задачи, выбирая для выполнения те задачи, которые приносят наибольший результат при определенных усилиях. 10. Отсеивание навязанных дел и задач помогает сосредоточиться на наиболее важных и сокращает время, затрачиваемое на выполнение несущественных дел."},{"instruction":"Используя многокритериальную оценку, расставьте приоритеты для своих долгосрочных целей.","output":"Для того, чтобы использовать метод многокритериальной оценки для расстановки приоритетов своих долгосрочных целей, вы можете следовать следующим шагам: Шаг 1. Определите критерии, по которым будете оценивать свои цели. Например, это могут быть важность, достижимость, потенциальная доходность, затраты на реализацию и т.д. Шаг 2. Присвойте каждому критерию вес, отражающий его значимость для вас. Важные критерии должны иметь больший вес, менее существенные - меньший. Сумма весов критериев должна быть равна 1. Шаг 3. Оцените каждую из своих целей по каждому критерию, используя шкалу от 1 до 10. Например, если вы оцениваете цель по критерию \\"важность\\", то дайте ей оценку от 1 (цель не важна) до 10 (цель очень важна). Шаг 4. Умножьте каждую оценку на соответствующий вес критерия и сложите результаты для каждой цели. Шаг 5. Отсортируйте свои цели в порядке убывания их оценок. Цели с более высокими оценками будут иметь более высокий приоритет. Приведем пример: Шаг 1. Критерии: важность, сложность, потенциальная доходность, время на выполнение. Шаг 2.

Before the collision, the hockey players have momentum in their respective directions. After the collision, the pair together has some momentum in a new direction. According to the conservation of momentum principle, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. Let's break the momentum of each player into components: P1_x = m1 * v1_x and P1_y = m1 * v1_y P2_x = m2 * v2_x and P2_y = m2 * v2_y Now let's find the velocity components of each player: v1_x = v1 * cos(32) = 2.12 * cos(32) = 1.7982 m/s (W direction) v1_y = v1 * sin(32) = 2.12 * sin(32) = -1.1284 m/s (S direction) v2_x = v2 * cos(42) = 1.40 * cos(42) = 1.0366 m/s (E direction) v2_y = v2 * sin(42) = 1.40 * sin(42) = 0.9357 m/s (N direction) The total momentum before collision in x-direction: P_x = m1 * v1_x + m2 * v2_x = 98.0 * 1.7982 - 87.0 * 1.0366 = 176.3396 kg m/s The total momentum before collision in y-direction: P_y = m1 * v1_y + m2 * v2_y = 98.0 * (-1.1284) + 87.0 * 0.9357 = -42.7474 kg m/s Now, let's find the total mass of the player-pair after the collision: m = m1 + m2 = 98 + 87 = 185 kg From the conservation of momentum, we know that the total momentum after the collision in both x and y directions will be the same as before the collision. So, the velocity components of the pair after the collision will be: v_x = P_x / m = 176.3396 / 185 = 0.9529 m/s v_y = P_y / m = -42.7474 / 185 = -0.2311 m/s We can now compute the magnitude of the final velocity using the Pythagorean theorem: v = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2) = sqrt((0.9529)^2 + (-0.2311)^2) = 0.9845 m/s To find the direction of the final velocity, we can compute the angle using the inverse tangent function: θ = atan(v_y / v_x) = atan(-0.2311 / 0.9529) = -13.66° N of W So the velocity of the pair immediately after the collision is 0.9845 m/s, 13.66° N of W."},{"instruction":"answer is 0.488","output":"I apologize for my mistake in my previous response calculation.

So, the velocity components of the pair after the collision will be: v_x = P_x / m = 98.6056 / 185 = 0.5327 m/s v_y = P_y / m = -20.6796 / 185 = -0.1118 m/s We can now compute the magnitude of the final velocity using the Pythagorean theorem: v = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2) = sqrt((0.5327)^2 + (-0.1118)^2) = 0.5407 m/s (approximately) Please note that this answer is not exactly the value you mentioned, but it is close to it.

According to the conservation of momentum principle: P_x = (m1 + m2) * V_x => V_x = P_x / (m1 + m2) = 54.44 kg m/s / 185 kg ≈ 0.294 m/s (W direction) P_y = (m1 + m2) * V_y => V_y = P_y / (m1 + m2) = -33.25 kg m/s / 185 kg ≈ -0.18 m/s (S direction) Now, we can find the magnitude of the final velocity: V = sqrt(V_x^2 + V_y^2) ≈ sqrt((0.294)^2 + (-0.18)^2) ≈ 0.34 m/s My previous calculations had errors, and the final computed velocity here doesn't match the given answer of 0.488 m/s.

Tra le numerose composizioni di Rossini, l'Overture della sua opera \\"La gazza ladra\\" è un pezzo particolarmente brillante e coinvolgente, che vorrei analizzare e descrivere brevemente in questa tesina. Descrizione dell'Overture di \\"La gazza ladra\\" \\"La gazza ladra\\" è un'opera in due atti di Rossini, su libretto di Giovanni Gherardini, tratto da una commedia di Louis-Charles Caigniez. La storia narra le vicende di una serva che viene accusata ingiustamente di aver rubato un oggetto di valore, mentre il vero colpevole è una gazza. L'opera fu rappresentata con successo per la prima volta al Teatro alla Scala di Milano, nel maggio del 1817. L'Overture di \\"La gazza ladra\\" è forse una delle più famose e popolari composizioni di Rossini. Questo pezzo strumentale, che introduce l'opera, si apre con un suggestivo colpo di timpani, seguito da un tema solenne e marziale esposto dai fiati.

La tensione inizia a crescere attraverso l'utilizzo di diverse dinamiche e colori orchestrali, fino a raggiungere il noto crescendo rossiniano, nel quale il tema principale viene ripreso e sviluppato con un crescendo in voluminosità e intensità.

Here's an example of this technique: \`\`\`cpp // Declare a static variable to store the opening time of the last candle static datetime lastCandleOpenTime = 0; void OnTick() { // Update the lastCandleOpenTime if it is equal to 0 or if a new candle has formed if (lastCandleOpenTime == 0 || lastCandleOpenTime != Time[0]) { lastCandleOpenTime = Time[0]; // Check trade opening criteria bool tradeOpenCriteria = CheckTradeOpenCriteria(); // If the criteria are met, open a trade and update the lastCandleOpenTime if (tradeOpenCriteria) { // Open a trade OpenTrade(); // Update lastCandleOpenTime lastCandleOpenTime = Time[0]; } } } bool CheckTradeOpenCriteria() { // Check criteria for opening a trade // This is a placeholder for a custom function where you can add your conditions for opening a trade return true; // return true if trade opening criteria are met, false otherwise } void OpenTrade() { // Add your trade opening code here // Example: OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, 0.01, Ask, 10, 0, 0, NULL, 0, 0, clrGreen); } \`\`\` In this example code, the \`lastCandleOpenTime\` variable is used to store the opening time of the last candle. If a new candle is formed (indicated by a different \`Time[0]\`) and your trade opening criteria are met, the trade will be opened, and \`lastCandleOpenTime\` will be updated."},{"instruction":"فقط یک ممعامله در هر کندل","output":"برای اطمینان از اینکه در MQL4 تنها یک معامله در هر کندل باز می‌شود، شما می‌توانید از یک تکنیک ساده با استفاده از ویژگی \`Time[0]\` استفاده کنید. این ویژگی زمان افتتاح کندل جاری را بازیابی می‌کند. شما می‌توانید مقدار \`Time[0]\` را ذخیره کنید و آن را با مقدار ذخیره شده مقایسه کنید تا مشخص شود که آیا کندل جدیدی شکل گرفته است. در صورتی که کندل جدیدی شکل گرفته و شرایط افتتاح معامله شما برآورده می‌شود، معامله را باز کنید و مقدار ذخیره شده وقت افتتاح را به روز کنید. در زیر نمونه‌ای از این تکنیک را مشاهده می‌کنید. \`\`\`cpp // اعلام یک متغیر استاتیک برای ذخیره زمان افتتاح کندل آخرین static datetime lastCandleOpenTime = 0; void OnTick() { // به روزرسانی lastCandleOpenTime اگر برابر با 0 است یا اگر یک کندل جدید شکل گرفته است if (lastCandleOpenTime == 0 || lastCandleOpenTime != Time[0]) { lastCandleOpenTime = Time[0]; // بررسی شرایط افتتاح معامله bool tradeOpenCriteria = CheckTradeOpenCriteria(); // در صورت برآورده شدن شرایط، باز کردن یک معامله و به‌روزرسانی lastCandleOpenTime if (tradeOpenCriteria) { // باز کردن یک معامله OpenTrade(); // به‌روزرسانی lastCandleOpenTime lastCandleOpenTime = Time[0]; } } } bool CheckTradeOpenCriteria() { // بررسی شرایط برای افتتاح یک معامله // این یک جایگزین برای یک تابع سفارشی است که شما می‌توانید شرایط خود را برای باز کردن یک معامله اضافه کنید return true; // بازگشت صحیح در صورت برآورده شدن شرایط افتتاح معامله، غلط در غیر این صورت } void OpenTrade() { // کد معامله خود را در اینجا وارد کنید // مثال: OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, 0.01, Ask, 10, 0, 0, NULL, 0, 0, clrGreen); } \`\`\` در این مثال کد، متغیر \`lastCandleOpenTime\` برای ذخیره سازی زمان افتتاح کندل آخرین استفاده می شود. اگر کندل جدیدی شکل گرفت (که با \`Time[0]\` متفاوت است) و شرایط افتتاح معامله شما برآورده می‌شوند، معامله باز میشه و \`lastCandleOpenTime\` به‌روز می‌شود."},{"instruction":"این جمله ای که در پرانتز قرار میدهم را به کد mql4 تبدیل کن . لطفا فقط جمله داخل پرانتز به کد بگو و کار دیگری نکن .","output":"لطفا جمله‌ای که می‌خواهید به کد MQL4 تبدیل شود را در اینجا قرار دهید. جمله داخل پرانتز را نیاورده‌اید. فرستادن جمله کامل به ما کمک می‌کند تا کد مناسبی به شما ارائه دهیم."},{"instruction":"(در هر کندل فقط یک معامله انجام بده .)","output":"برای اجرای فقط یک معامله در هر کندل در MQL4، کد زیر را به عنوان مثال استفاده کنید: \`\`\`cpp static datetime lastCandleOpenTime = 0; void OnTick() { if (lastCandleOpenTime == 0 || lastCandleOpenTime != Time[0]) { lastCandleOpenTime = Time[0]; bool tradeOpenCriteria = CheckTradeOpenCriteria(); if (tradeOpenCriteria) { OpenTrade(); lastCandleOpenTime = Time[0]; } } } bool CheckTradeOpenCriteria() { // شرایط افتتاح معامله را در اینجا بررسی کنید return true; } void OpenTrade() { // کد افتتاح معامله خود را در اینجا قرار دهید } \`\`\` این کد باعث می شود در هر کندل تنها یک معامله انجام شود. البته بر اساس شرایط افتتاح معامله که در تابع \`CheckTradeOpenCriteria\` بیان میشود و کد افتتاح معامله که در تابع \`OpenTrade\` قرار خواهد گرفت."},{"instruction":"параметр maxHistory тега rollingPolicy","output":"Параметр maxHistory тега rollingPolicy определяет максимальное количество резервных файлов журнала, которые будут сохранены.

В независимой подвеске колеса не связаны между собой осью. Это значит, что перемещение одного колеса в поперечной плоскости не передается другому — они свободно двигаются относительно друг друга. В зависимой подвеске колеса связаны между собой мостом. Чем хороша независимая подвеска? В ней каждое колесо стоит плотнее на поверхности, больше пятно контакта его с дорогой. Меньше вероятность крена машины или ее вывешивания. Недостатка два. Часто у колес короткий ход и он сводит на нет остальные достоинства. Второе — ремонтопригодность подвески, а именно стоимость ее восстановления, которая обычно неприятно удивляет ценником. У зависимой подвески один очевидный плюс — сравнительно недорогой ремонт. Классикой жанра является именно зависимая подвеска, мостовая, торсионная или торсионно-рессорная. Привод Монопривода будет мало — единственная ось с двигающими машину колесами чувствует себя неуверенно на плохой дороге. Полный привод помогает взять у двигателя максимум его возможностей. Многие модели умеют «перекидывать» крутящий момент с одной оси на другую — в зависимости от того, какие колеса начали буксовать. За это отвечают электронные помощники, увеличивающие внедорожные возможности машины. Роль помощников тут особенно важна. В современных машинах электроника помогает водителю в любых ситуациях: если вы поднимаетесь на гору, спускаетесь, двигаетесь с наклоном, хотите уверенно ехать по снегу, песку или грязи, в глубокой колее или по каменистой насыпи. Тип полного привода Два типа полного привода: постоянный и подключаемый автоматически. Первый является эталонным для автомобилей этого сегмента. Его конструкция подразумевает постоянную передачу крутящего момента от двигателя сразу на все колеса. Такие трансмиссии имеют важный компонент — межосевой дифференциал, позволяющий передним и задним колесам при повороте проходить разные расстояния. В тяжелых бездорожных условиях дифференциал может быть заблокирован для увеличения крутящего момента на колесе/оси с лучшим сцеплением. Блокировка может осуществляться двумя способами: принудительно водителем или же автоматически при пробуксовке колес. Автоматически подключаемый полный привод все чаще встречается на новых моделях машин. Его возможностей хватает там, где не нужны исключительные внедорожные возможности. Условно, автомобиль постоянно едет на переднем приводе, а задний подключается электроникой в моменты пробуксовки ведущих колес. Многие современные внедорожники оснащаются так называемым превентивным автоматически подключаемым полным приводом через многодисковую муфту Haldex. Неведущие колеса постоянно идут с преднатягом (на них передается до 10% крутящего момента), и это дает возможность быстрого «переброса» на них тяги в случае необходимости. Тип КПП Прошли времена, когда механическая коробка была безальтернативным вариантом для внедорожников. Теперь бал правят автоматические трансмиссии, работающие вместе с электронными системами помощи на сложной дороге. Мануальные КПП конечно еще остались, но скоро от них откажутся сами автолюбители, а затем и производители. \\"Автоматы\\" теперь не менее надежные, чем МКПП, стоят приемлемых денег в обслуживании, не тратят больше топлива и банально удобнее.\\"","output":"\\"При выборе настоящего внедорожника многие автолюбители сталкиваются с выбором между различными типами подвески. У независимой подвески колеса не связаны осью, поэтому каждое колесо может свободно двигаться относительно другого в поперечной плоскости.

Однако, некоторые независимые подвески имеют короткий ход и высокую стоимость восстановления, что является их недостатком. Зависимая подвеска колес связана между собой мостом, что обеспечивает относительно недорогой ремонт. Трудно переоценить значимость подвески для удобства и безопасности внедорожника. Полный привод является предпочтительным для большинства внедорожников в условиях плохого покрытия дороги. При использовании полного привода на задних и передних осях машина получает максимальную затягивающую силу из двигателя, что позволяет преодолевать сложные условия на дороге.

This would have set off a chain reaction of events that could have potentially changed the course of Star Wars history. Here are some possible outcomes: 1. Dueling Jedi orders: With Count Dooku forming his own secret Jedi order, there would likely be a rift between his faction and the main Jedi Order under the tutelage of Yoda and Mace Windu. This might cause tension or potential conflict between the two factions, especially if Dooku's order decided to adopt different beliefs and practices. 2. Sidious' plans disrupted: If Count Dooku never became Darth Tyranus, then Darth Sidious' plans for spreading his influence and starting the Clone Wars might have been severely hampered. Dooku not only provided the leadership necessary for the Separatists, but also supplied the Sith with valuable intelligence about the Jedi Order. 3. Anakin never becomes Darth Vader: Anakin Skywalker's path to becoming Darth Vader was facilitated by his interactions with Palpatine and Count Dooku. With Dooku removed from the equation, it's very possible that Anakin would have remained loyal to the Jedi Order. This would mean that the tragedy of Order 66 would never have unfolded, and the Jedi would not have been nearly wiped out. 4. Palpatine's eventual defeat: Without the aid of Count Dooku, Palpatine would have been forced to find another apprentice. While he ultimately chose Anakin Skywalker, there's no guarantee he would have been successful with another candidate. If the secret Jedi order created by Dooku had eventually discovered Palpatine's true identity as Darth Sidious, they could have joined forces with the primary Jedi Order to defeat him, potentially preventing the rise of the Empire. 5. A new hope for the Jedi: With a second order of Jedi existing in secret, the Jedi's knowledge and teachings would not have been lost even after Order 66. This could have provided hope for the future, giving the galaxy a chance at stability and balance after the fall of the Sith. Ultimately, the creation of a secret Jedi order by Count Dooku would have had a profound impact on the Star Wars universe. It could have prevented the rise of the Empire, altered the path of Anakin Skywalker, and ensured the survival of the Jedi Order."},{"instruction":"What if Obi Wan reluctantly joined this secret order?","output":"If Obi-Wan Kenobi reluctantly joined Count Dooku's secret Jedi order, it would create a significant shift in his relationships with other key characters in the Star Wars universe, as well as impact the overall storyline: 1. Strained relationship with Anakin Skywalker: Obi-Wan's decision to join Dooku's secret Jedi order might put a strain on his relationship with his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. This could drive a wedge between the two, possibly leading to Anakin's further isolation from the Jedi Order and potentially pushing him closer to the dark side or even towards Palpatine in his search for guidance. 2. A powerful alliance: Obi-Wan's alliance with Count Dooku and his secret order would likely strengthen the group's influence, especially given Obi-Wan's reputation as an esteemed Jedi Knight. His connections to other Jedi and his strategic mind would prove invaluable to the secret order, potentially making them a formidable force against the Sith and any other threats to the galaxy. 3. Increased vigilance against the dark side: Obi-Wan might have left the main Jedi Order due to concerns about corruption or manipulation by the dark side. With his membership in the secret order, he would be more motivated than ever to fight against the dark forces that threaten the galaxy and might work tirelessly to uncover the truth about Darth Sidious and his plans. 4. An undercover operative: Obi-Wan could also serve as a spy within the main Jedi Order, gathering information and reporting back to Dooku's group. This would allow the secret order to stay one step ahead of their opponents and increase their chances of thwarting Sidious' plans. 5. A changed galactic history: With Obi-Wan joining the secret Jedi order, the timeline of the Star Wars universe could be significantly altered. It may lead to the eventual unmasking and defeat of Palpatine before he could consolidate his power, thereby preventing the rise of the Empire, the fall of Anakin Skywalker, and potentially saving countless lives throughout the galaxy. In conclusion, Obi-Wan joining a secret Jedi order led by Count Dooku would have a profound impact on his character development, his relationships with other key characters, and the overall arc of the Star Wars universe. It may lead to a brighter future for the galaxy, where the power of the Sith is curtailed and the Jedi Order remains intact."},{"instruction":"What if the order was about balance?","output":"If Count Dooku's secret Jedi order was focused on achieving balance, it could lead to several significant consequences for both the Jedi Order and the galaxy at large: 1. Redefinition of Jedi philosophy: The secret order's focus on balance would cause them to reevaluate the teachings of the traditional Jedi Order, which leaned heavily towards the light side of the Force. Dooku's group might advocate for a more harmonious approach that recognizes the importance of both the light and dark sides. This could create a new and more practical Jedi philosophy that embraces both aspects of the Force. 2. Challenges from within: As Obi-Wan and others joined this order, many within the traditional Jedi Order might see this as a threat to their ideology. This differing philosophy could lead to internal strife among Jedi, as they grapple with questions about the nature of the Force and their role in the galaxy. 3. A more resilient Jedi order: Achieving balance within the Force could ironically make the secret order less vulnerable to falling to the dark side or being manipulated by the Sith. Members might be more self-aware and better prepared to deal with temptations from the dark side, making the secret order a stronger force for good within the galaxy. 4. Altered confrontation with the Sith: If the secret Jedi order were successful in promoting balance and eliminating extremist views, the galaxy's confrontation with the Sith and other threats could take on a new dynamic. Rather than engaging in all-out war, the balanced Jedi order might seek diplomatic resolutions and more peaceful means of addressing conflicts where possible. However, they would still confront the Sith directly if necessary, using a combination of light and dark side powers to protect the galaxy. 5. Paving the way for future Jedi: The balanced secret order could set a new path for future generations of Jedi, breaking free from old dogmas and embracing a more balanced philosophy. This could lead to a more diverse and adaptive Jedi order, in better alignment with the true nature of the Force. In summary, if Count Dooku's secret Jedi order aimed to achieve balance, it would signal a significant change in the Jedi philosophy and open up new possibilities for the resolution of conflicts. This new direction for the Force-users may lead to a more resilient and adaptive Jedi order, capable of navigating future challenges and ensuring peace and stability in the galaxy."},{"instruction":"How could the secret order influence things within all three films?","output":"If Count Dooku's secret order seeking balance within the Force were to influence all three films in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, it could potentially create an alternate timeline with significant ripple effects on the overall story arc. Here's what could happen in each of the prequels: 1. Episode I - The Phantom Menace: The existence of the secret order might not have a direct impact on the main events of this film, but they could be working behind the scenes to keep the main Jedi Order together, or subtly undermine it. For instance, Qui-Gon Jinn's open-minded approach towards the Force (such as advocating for Anakin's training despite reservations from the Jedi Council) might align with Dooku's order, and he could have been a member or sympathizer. This connection with Qui-Gon may come into play in later films. 2. Episode II - Attack of the Clones: Obi-Wan's participation in Dooku's order would have a more significant impact, as it would alter his relationship with Anakin and his perspective on the Jedi Council. His association with the secret order might lead to him being more skeptical of the Council's decisions and could push him and Anakin to work together more closely. The secret order's influence might also help them uncover Palpatine's true intentions earlier and avert the start of the Clone Wars, thereby changing the course of the conflict and influencing subsequent events in the galaxy. 3. Episode III - Revenge of the Sith: If the secret Jedi order managed to thwart or delay Palpatine's plans, the tragic events of Revenge of the Sith may not occur as originally depicted. The secret order might have been able to prevent or lessen the impact of Order 66 and save some of the Jedi from being wiped out. In this alternate timeline, Anakin might not become Darth Vader, and the Empire's rise to power could be delayed or hindered by the combined efforts of the secret order and remaining traditional Jedi. This would ultimately change the trajectory of Anakin and Padme's lives, as well as the fate of their twin children, Luke and Leia. It is crucial to note that introducing a secret order into the Star Wars prequel trilogy could have far-reaching consequences for both the characters and the overall storyline. The balanced approach Dooku's secret order promotes and the key players involved, like Obi-Wan, would alter critical points in the timeline, leading to new possibilities and potentially averting the tragic outcomes seen in the original story arc. This could ultimately result in a markedly different state of the galaxy, with a stronger Jedi presence and possibly a weakened Sith threat."},{"instruction":"What if no one else knew about the secret order? How could it keep secret, and eventually, how could it be found out?","output":"If no one else knew about the secret Jedi order, its continued secrecy would depend on the leadership and members' strict adherence to concealing their activities and purpose. The order could employ various methods to ensure its continued secrecy: 1. Strict induction process: The order could have a rigorous selection and initiation process that would require members to prove their loyalty and commitment to the cause. Only Jedi who showed an unwavering dedication to maintaining the secrecy of the order would be allowed to join. 2. Coded communications: Members of the secret order could employ a coded language or encrypted methods of communication to share information and coordinate their activities. This would make it difficult for anyone outside the order to intercept or understand their messages. 3. Secret meeting locations and times: To prevent detection, the order might hold gatherings in remote or hidden locations, away from the public eye. Meetings could be scheduled infrequently and unpredictably, with members only alerted at the last minute to reduce the risk of their plans being discovered. 4. Anonymity among members: To protect the identity of its members, the secret order could enforce strict anonymity, with all members using code names or other disguises when interacting with each other. This would make it difficult for any outsiders to connect members of the secret order to their true identities in the Jedi Order. Despite these precautions, there are several scenarios in which the secret order could be found out: 1. A mole or traitor: One of the members could betray the secret order by disclosing its existence and members to the Sith, the main Jedi Council, or another organization. This betrayal could stem from a change of heart, fear, or coercion by an outside force. 2. Tracking the members: A skilled investigator, such as an Intelligence officer or a bounty hunter, could detect patterns and connections between the secret order's members. By following their movements and activities, they might eventually uncover the existence and purpose of the secret order. 3. A failed mission: In the event of a botched mission led by the secret order, the ultimate goal might be exposed. Their secrecy and objectives might unravel as their enemies attempt to learn more about the mysterious group responsible for the failed operation. 4. Accidental discovery: The secret order's activities could inadvertently come to light through an unexpected event or a chance encounter. A third party could stumble upon a meeting or overhear a pivotal conversation, leading them to investigate the order further. Regardless of how the secret order is discovered, its exposure could have significant ramifications for the Star Wars universe. The revelation could lead to internal strife within the Jedi, as well as external threats from Sith and other opponents who would see the secret order as a challenge to their power. The secret order's existence and eventual unmasking would add new layers of complexity and intrigue to the Star Wars storyline."},{"instruction":"Who could be potential members of this secret order, and who could be. Secret supporters?","output":"For the secret order established by Count Dooku, potential members could be Jedi who are sympathetic towards a more balanced view of the Force and those who question the traditional dogmas of the Jedi Council. Some of these potential members could include: 1. Qui-Gon Jinn: As a Jedi with a somewhat unorthodox approach to the Force, Qui-Gon Jinn could be a key member of Dooku's order. He frequently defied the Jedi Council during his lifetime, and his belief in the Living Force aligns with the balanced philosophy of the secret order. 2. Ahsoka Tano: As a former Jedi Padawan who grew disillusioned with the Jedi Order, Ahsoka Tano could become a member of the secret order. Her experiences during the Clone Wars and her willingness to question authority make her a strong candidate for Dooku's organization. 3. Barriss Offee: Another Jedi who questioned the Council's decisions and became disillusioned with the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars, Barriss Offee could potentially be a member of the secret order seeking balance. Her character arc would fit well within the perspective of a group working to restore balance within the Force, even if her actions in the series seemed violent. In addition to these members, the secret order could have secret supporters within the Jedi Order or the broader galactic community. This could include individuals who either cannot join the order themselves or prefer to support it from the shadows. Potential secret supporters could be: 1. Mace Windu: As a member of the Jedi Council, Mace Windu would likely not join the secret order outright. However, he could be a secret supporter who sympathizes with their cause. Windu's personal understanding and utilization of the dark side of the Force to fuel his fighting style might make him inclined to support an order with a more balanced view. 2. Bail Organa: As a Senator from Alderaan and an ally of the Jedi, Bail Organa could secretly support the aims of the secret order. He might see the order's balanced philosophy as a path to peace and stability in the galaxy and work behind the scenes to aid their cause. 3. Yoda: Although it may seem unlikely at first, Yoda's own journey of self-discovery during and after the Clone Wars could lead him to see the merits of a more balanced approach to the Force. He might secretly agree with the aims of the secret order, even if he cannot openly support them. This could ultimately affect his guidance for future Jedi, like Luke Skywalker, in embracing a more balanced outlook on the Force. These potential members and supporters would bring different perspectives, skills, and resources to the secret order. Their varied reasons for joining or supporting the organization would emphasize the shared goal of promoting balance within the Force and challenging rigid beliefs within the Jedi Order."},{"instruction":"Write a holographic conversation between Obi wan and Padme, five hours before the secret order is exposed.
