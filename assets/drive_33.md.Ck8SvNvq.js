Turn off all distractions. Play calming music. Set a timer for 10 minutes. Focus on your breathing.","output":"Article: Creating a Quiet Space to Focus on Your Breath In today's fast-paced world, it's often challenging to find a moment of peace and quiet. However, taking time for ourselves is crucial to our well-being. Incorporating mindful breathing exercises into our daily routine is a great way to reduce stress and clear our minds. Here are some simple steps for finding a quiet location, tackling distractions, and creating a calming atmosphere to focus on your breath. 1. Location: Finding the perfect location is an essential first step. Whether it’s a place in your home or outside, it should be free of noise and distractions. You want to be in a space where you feel comfortable and relaxed, making it easier to focus on your breath. Consider taking a walk and finding a quiet spot or picking a room in your home that is less frequently used. 2. Distractions: Distractions can be hard to avoid, but it's essential to eliminate them. Turn off your phone or place it on silent mode. Let others around you know that you are taking a few minutes to breathe and ask them to respect your time. Set yourself up for success by removing all potential distractions. 3. Music: Music can help create a calming atmosphere; choosing the right kind of music is important. Pick something that is slow and peaceful to help you relax. Many apps offer music for relaxation or meditation that you can play during your breathing practice. 4. Timer: Setting a timer can help you focus on your breath without worrying about time. Start with ten minutes and increase it as you get into the practice. Once you hear the sound of the timer go off, take a moment to be grateful for the time you dedicated to breathing. 5. Breathe: After setting up the perfect breathing space, it's time to focus on your breath. Sitting or lying down, close your eyes, and take deep breaths. Inhale for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Continue the process, focusing on your breath, and let your mind gently drift. Acknowledge your thoughts and then let them go as you return to your breathing. Mindful breathing can help reduce stress and anxiety, lower blood pressure, and improve overall well-being. Take a few minutes each day to create a quiet space, turn off distractions, play calming music, set a timer, and breathe. A few minutes of focused breathing can go a long way, leaving you feeling more relaxed, clear-headed, and recharged for the day ahead."},{"instruction":"Canada, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a constitutional document that outlines the rights and freedoms that all Canadians are entitled to.

In order to understand the educational background of a city’s residents, it is important to analyze data related to their academic qualifications, educational attainment rates, and other relevant factors. One significant aspect of educational background is the level of formal education attained by residents. This can be measured through data on high school graduation rates, college attendance rates, and college graduation rates. Additionally, information on residents’ fields of study can provide a more detailed understanding of the types of skills and knowledge that are prevalent in the community. Another important factor to consider is the diversity of educational attainment within the population. Some cities may have a higher proportion of residents with advanced degrees or professional certifications, while others may have a larger population of residents with limited educational opportunities. Analyzing education data by factors such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status can provide a more nuanced view of the community’s educational landscape. Understanding the education level and attainment rates of a city’s population can also assist policymakers in identifying areas of need for targeted investment in education and job training programs.

Choose the right location: Select a sturdy tree that is healthy, tall, and has a strong trunk. Avoid trees that are too close to power lines or have other potential hazards nearby. 2. Draw up plans: Sketch out a rough design of your treehouse and identify the types of materials you'll need. Consider your budget and how much time you can devote to the project. 3. Gather materials: Purchase all necessary materials, including lumber, nails, screws, and any additional hardware. Make sure that everything you buy is suitable for outdoor use and can withstand different weather conditions. 4. Build the foundation: Once you've cleared the area around the tree, construct a sturdy foundation using cement, cinder blocks, or other suitable materials. Make sure the foundation can support the weight of the treehouse and any potential occupants. 5. Construct the frame: Using your plans as a guide, create the frame of the treehouse using strong lumber and secure it to the foundation. Consider using metal brackets or bolts to secure the structure to the tree, but make sure not to cause any damage to the tree itself. 6. Install the floor: Add a sturdy floor using plywood, decking boards, or other suitable materials. Make sure to leave a gap around the trunk to allow for the tree's natural movement. 7. Add walls and a roof: Depending on your design, add walls and a roof to your treehouse. Be sure to use weather-resistant materials and provide adequate ventilation. 8. Finish the interior: You can add windows, doors, and any other finishing touches to make your treehouse more comfortable and functional. 9. Safety check: Before you use your treehouse, double-check that everything is secure and that there are no safety hazards or potential dangers.

Write an article based on the research done on the topic.","output":"AI or Artificial Intelligence is one of the most significant advancements in technology today. AI deals with computer programs that have the capability to think and learn like humans. With AI, humans can easily automate processes, increase efficiency, and create new products. However, in recent years, there has been concern about the potential risks of AI. One of the main risks of AI is job displacement. AI can perform many tasks previously requiring human workers. This has the potential to lead to widespread unemployment and social disruption. Another risk is the potential for bias and discrimination. AI systems can perpetuate existing biases in data and algorithms, leading to unfair results for certain groups. Additionally, AI can amplify human error, as its algorithms are only as accurate as the data that they are trained on. This means that if a machine learning algorithm is trained with inaccurate or biased data, its output will also be inaccurate and biased. Another significant risk of AI is that it can be used for nefarious purposes. Malicious actors can use AI to create fake videos or audio recordings, perpetrate phishing attacks, or spread disinformation. This can result in severe harm to individuals or entire societies. Finally, there is also a significant risk of AI systems malfunctioning or breaking down. In some cases, this can result in significant financial losses or even physical harm, particularly when AI is used in high-risk fields like healthcare, transportation, or defense. In conclusion, while AI has the potential to bring about significant benefits for society, there are also several potential risks that must be taken into account. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to develop effective regulatory frameworks and establish ethical guidelines for the development and deployment of AI systems. Only then can we ensure that AI remains a force for good, rather than harm."},{"instruction":"it possible to conclude that He is not hungry if He only took a small portion of food from the buffet table.?

During spermatogenesis, diploid germ cells divide mitotically to form haploid sperm cells that contain half the number of chromosomes as normal body cells. In females, gametogenesis is known as oogenesis and occurs in the ovaries. The process begins during fetal development when oogonia undergo mitosis to produce primary oocytes. These primary oocytes remain in a state of meiotic arrest until puberty when one is selected to undergo maturation each month. This process leads to the production of a mature ovum that is capable of being fertilized by sperm. Unlike in males, only one mature gamete is produced during each cycle of oogenesis."},{"instruction":"Let's say that David did not get the job because he lacked the necessary experience.

The study involved 1,000 participants who were tested on various cognitive tasks. The results showed that those who ate chocolate once a week or more scored higher on the tests than those who didn't. The researchers believe that flavonoids, which are found in chocolate, may be responsible for the effect. Flavonoids are natural compounds that have antioxidant properties and can improve blood flow to the brain. This could explain why consuming chocolate leads to an increase in cognitive function. However, the study did not distinguish between types of chocolate, so more research is needed to determine if certain types of chocolate are more beneficial than others. Additionally, the study only looked at the immediate effects of chocolate consumption on cognitive function, so more research is needed to determine if consuming chocolate over a longer period of time has any additional benefits.

Her family is understandably devastated by what has happened, and they hope that justice will be served.

Many experts have praised the policy, stating that it will have a noticeable impact on the environment. The major aspects of the policy include generous subsidies for businesses and households that install solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable energy equipment. The policy also introduces new regulations to reduce the country's carbon footprint, including stricter emission standards for vehicles, and a plan to phase out coal-fired power plants. However, despite the potential benefits of the policy, opposition parties have criticized it. Some have argued that the subsidies and regulations are too expensive, and that it will be difficult to adapt to new energy sources. Others believe that the government should focus on maintaining the status quo rather than taking on untested and risky initiatives. Regardless of the opposition, the policy is set to go into effect in six months. Businesses and households are encouraged to take advantage of the subsidies and incentives by investing in renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. The government hopes that their commitment to sustainability will position the country as a leader in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. In conclusion, the government's new policy on renewable energy is a significant step towards a greener and more sustainable future.

Multiple factors such as work stress, social isolation, traumatic experiences, and genetic predisposition increase one's vulnerability to mental health problems. It is crucial to prioritize mental health and wellness to lead a fulfilling life. Neglecting mental health can lead to various negative outcomes, such as poor work performance, social isolation, substance abuse, and even suicidal thoughts. However, the good news is that there are various resources available for those in need of mental health support. Therapy and counseling are the most common and effective resources to seek treatment for mental health concerns. Counseling sessions help individuals develop coping skills and address the root causes of their problems. Furthermore, medication may be prescribed in some cases to manage the symptoms of mental illnesses. Teletherapy and online counseling have become increasingly popular over the years, and they offer a convenient and confidential option for people to seek mental health support from their home. Many insurance providers may also offer coverage for mental health treatment, making professional help more accessible and affordable to everyone. Apart from therapy, self-care practices such as exercising, meditation, and journaling can also promote positive mental health.

However, this perception has also been countered by others who feel that the movement has prompted important conversations and reflections around gender roles, power dynamics, and consent. Many men have acknowledged their previous missteps or hurtful behavior and are seeking guidance and resources to become better allies to women. Despite these challenges, the #MeToo movement continues to make a significant impact on public perceptions and institutional policies. Some examples of progress include increased awareness of the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault, as well as measures taken by institutions such as companies, universities, and the legal system to change the way they handle reports of misconduct. However, the movement still has a long way to go to achieve real cultural change, particularly around issues of power and privilege that enable harassment and assault to go unchecked. It is also important to continue challenging the narrow focus on individual cases and the \\"cancel culture\\" mentality that can sometimes overshadow the larger, systemic issues at play. In conclusion, the #MeToo movement has certainly made important strides in raising awareness and accountability for sexual harassment and assault, but there are ongoing challenges that require continued attention and dialogue. By fostering a deeper understanding and awareness of the cultural issues that perpetuate harassment and assault, we can continue to push for real and lasting change."},{"instruction":"What can we deduce from A group of people in business attire standing in front of a skyscraper.?

By practicing meditation regularly, one can increase their ability to manage stress, leading to improved mental and physical health. Meditation has also been shown to improve symptoms of depression. According to a meta-analysis of existing studies, meditation can help reduce symptoms of depression in individuals with major depressive disorder. The practice may also improve feelings of self-compassion and contentment, which can further promote mental wellness. Moreover, the practice of meditation can enhance one's ability to focus and attend to the present moment. For individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who may struggle with impulsivity and inattention, meditation can be a beneficial adjunct to traditional treatments. Meditation has been shown to improve cognitive performance and reduce distractibility in individuals with ADHD. Finally, meditation can promote greater emotional regulation and self-awareness. For individuals with anxiety disorders or trauma, learning to regulate their emotions can be challenging. By regularly practicing meditation, individuals can develop greater emotional self-regulation and self-awareness, which can support positive mental health outcomes.

Researchers found that people who drink three to five cups of coffee per day have a lower risk of heart disease than those who don't drink coffee at all. The study adds to a growing body of research that suggests coffee can have health benefits. Expand this summary.","output":"Coffee is a popular beverage worldwide, and people often wonder about its health effects. Previous research has suggested that coffee may help to prevent type 2 diabetes, liver disease, and stroke in some individuals. Now, a new study adds to this evidence by suggesting that coffee can also lower the risk of heart disease. The study, which was published in the British Medical Journal, analyzed data from over 400,000 adults in the United Kingdom. The researchers found that people who drank three to five cups of coffee per day had a lower risk of developing heart disease than those who drank no coffee at all. The risk reduction was modest - around 15% - but it was statistically significant. The study's lead author, Dr. Ang Zhou, explained that the beneficial effects of coffee are likely due to its high content of beneficial compounds called polyphenols. These compounds have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which help to protect the heart and blood vessels from damage. It's worth noting that the study only found a correlation between coffee consumption and heart health. It's possible that other factors, such as diet and exercise habits, could also play a role in reducing heart disease risk. Nevertheless, the results are promising and suggest that coffee can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Of course, it's important not to overdo it when it comes to coffee. Drinking too much caffeine can cause jitters, anxiety, and other side effects. It's also worth considering how you take your coffee - adding lots of sugar and cream can cancel out any potential health benefits. Overall, the new study suggests that coffee can be a part of an overall healthy diet, particularly when consumed in moderation. If you enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, there's no need to feel guilty - it might just be good for your heart."},{"instruction":"Jim gave Jane the keys to the car because he had to work.

If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, sea levels could rise by up to three feet. This could have devastating consequences for millions of people around the world, particularly those who live in lowlying areas.","output":"A new study has found that global warming could cause a significant increase in sea levels by the end of the current century. The study warns that if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, sea levels could rise by up to three feet. This potential rise in sea levels could be disastrous for millions of people around the world, particularly those residing in low-lying areas. The study authors used satellite data from 1993 to 2018 to assess sea-level changes globally. They found that since 2008, the rate of sea-level rise has been increasing at a rate of 0.08 inches per year. They also found that if global temperatures rise by 5 degrees Celsius, which is within the projected range for this century, sea levels could rise up to three feet by the year 2100. A rise of three feet in sea levels would have extreme and disastrous consequences for people living in coastal regions. A significant increase in sea levels would cause widespread flooding, leading to the displacement of millions of people. It would also result in the loss of crops, homes, and infrastructure, leading to significant economic losses. This study serves as a warning that urgent action is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to limit global warming. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to reduce their carbon footprints and invest in renewable energy sources. Nations must also adapt to rising sea levels by investing in protective infrastructure such as sea walls and natural barriers. In conclusion, this new study highlights the urgent need to address global warming and its potential consequences. The identified potential rise in sea levels underscores the importance of taking decisive action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further damage to the planet. It is time for all stakeholders to take responsibility and make the necessary changes to ensure a sustainable future for all."},{"instruction":"Did she mention a specific date for the meeting?","output":"May I know who \\"she\\" refers to?

The production of textiles and clothing contributes to pollution and waste, as well as taking a toll on natural resources such as water and land. However, many fashion brands are starting to take steps to reduce their environmental impact. Some of these steps include using sustainable materials such as organic cotton or recycled polyester, and reducing emissions in their production processes. Brands are also starting to consider their end-of-life impact, designing products with circularity in mind so that they can be recycled or repurposed at the end of their useful life. Consumers also have a role to play in reducing the environmental impact of the fashion industry. By choosing eco-friendly clothing made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo or hemp, consumers can help reduce the demand for environmentally damaging materials like conventional cotton. Shopping second-hand is another eco-friendly option, as it reduces the demand for new clothing and keeps textiles out of landfills. It is important to support companies that prioritize sustainability in their business practices. Consumers should seek out brands that have clear sustainability goals and are transparent about their environmental impact.

It is a two-step process that takes place in two phases- light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. The first phase, the Light-dependent reactions, occur in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. During this process, light energy is absorbed by the pigments in the thylakoid membrane, such as chlorophyll. This absorbed light energizes the pigments and splits water molecules into protons, electrons, and oxygen ions. The electrons move through the thylakoid membrane and create a high concentration of protons that generates a gradient of electrochemical potential. This gradient of protons is used to make ATP, which is an energy source used in the second phase. The oxygen ions combine, producing molecular oxygen, which is then released into the atmosphere. The second phase, the Calvin cycle, occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast. This phase does not require light but the energy stored in ATP molecules generated in the first phase. During the Calvin cycle, the stored energy is used to convert carbon dioxide into organic compounds. In this process, a protein called Rubisco combines carbon dioxide and a five-carbon sugar called RuBP. This reaction forms a six-carbon compound, which is then converted into two molecules of a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglycerate or PGA. The PGA goes through a series of reactions to form glucose or other organic compounds. This process is called carbon fixation since it converts inorganic carbon into organic compounds that are used by the plant or other organisms. In conclusion, photosynthesis is a vital process that takes place in green plants and some microorganisms. It enables plants to produce organic compounds that form the basis of the food chain and also releases oxygen, which is vital for animals to breathe. This process is affected by many factors such as light, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the Earth's ecosystem."},{"instruction":"dentify the adjective: The big, blue ball rolled down the hill.

The impact of the Civil Rights Movement can be seen in a number of ways. First, it led to legal changes that have had lasting effects. For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity in areas such as employment, education, and voting. These laws have helped to create a more equal society by removing legal barriers to opportunity. In addition to legal changes, the Civil Rights Movement helped to shift public attitudes about race and racism. The movement brought attention to the ways in which African Americans were being mistreated and oppressed, leading many people to reexamine their own beliefs and biases. Today, we see the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement in ongoing efforts to address systemic racism and promote social justice. Overall, the Civil Rights Movement had a profound impact on American society, helping to bring about legal changes and shift public attitudes about race and racism.

This process is controlled by control rods, which absorb neutrons to prevent the reaction from becoming too fast.

Experts advise people to wear long sleeves and long pants, use insect repellent, and check for ticks after spending time outdoors.","output":"The Powassan virus: A rising threat in the US The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have raised concern over the emergence of a tick-borne disease known as Powassan virus. This virus is known to cause seizures, meningitis, and encephalitis, and is on the rise in the US. The CDC reports there have been eight confirmed cases of Powassan virus so far in the year 2021 in different states including Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The CDC warns that ticks carrying the disease are active not only in the Northeast but also in the Midwest and Western US. Powassan virus is a rare but extremely serious illness that can lead to severe neurological conditions. The virus is spread by the bite of an infected tick that can also transmit other pathogens such as Lyme disease. Unlike Lyme, Powassan virus does not need a prolonged period of attachment to spread the infection. Ticks can transmit the virus within the first 15 minutes of feeding. To guard against Powassan virus, people are advised by experts to wear long sleeves and pants when spending time outdoors, and to use insect repellent containing DEET formula. It is also important to look for ticks after spending time in areas where ticks are known to live, especially in the hairline, armpits, groin, and back of the knees. In conclusion, Powassan virus is a tick-borne disease that if not dealt with in a timely manner can lead to severe neurological damage. The virus has been found to be more deadly than Lyme disease, which is why it is important to take precautions such as wearing protective clothing, using insect repellent, and checking for ticks after spending time outdoors especially in areas where ticks are known to live to prevent catching the virus."},{"instruction":"What is the name of the currency used in Japan?","output":"The name of the currency used in Japan is the yen."},{"instruction":"Watch the video clip and answer the questions.

Voici quelques approches alternatives : 1. **Peak Metering (Crête)** : Mesure le pic maximal du signal audio. C'est la méthode la plus simple, mais elle ne prend pas en compte la perception auditive humaine et peut être trompeuse pour des sons brefs ayant une grande amplitude mais perçus comme pas très forts. 2. **VU Metering (Volume Unit Metering)** : Un VU mètre indique une moyenne du volume perçu, en tenant compte d'une pondération temporelle qui simule la perception humaine. Il est moins précis que les loudness meters modernes mais reste utilisé dans la radiodiffusion. 3. **Root Mean Square (RMS)** : Indique la moyenne quadratique du signal audio, ce qui correspond mieux à la perception de la force du son que la mesure de pic seul. Les valeurs RMS sont souvent utilisées pour évaluer la \\"perceived loudness\\". 4. **Leq (Equivalent Continuous Sound Level)** : Une mesure de la loudness sur une période déterminée, similaire à LKFS mais sans la pondération en fréquence utilisée dans les mesures ITU-R BS.1770. 5. **EBU R128** : Bien qu'il s'agisse en réalité d'une norme qui utilise la mesure de loudness ITU-R BS.1770, EBU R128 fournit des recommandations spécifiques pour la radiodiffusion en Europe, avec des stratégies de mesure et de normalisation légèrement différentes. 6. **Algorithms spécifiques de la marque** : Des entreprises comme Waves, Dolby ou TC Electronic proposent leurs propres systèmes de mesure de loudness qui peuvent avoir des caractéristiques uniques ou des traitements de signal propriétaires. 7. **Loudness Algorithms in Audio Editors** : Les logiciels d'édition audio et de production musicale intègrent souvent leurs propres algorithmes pour estimer la loudness. Par exemple, Reaper, Cubase, et Logic Pro X ont des outils de mesure de loudness intégrés. 8. **Bibliothèques Python** : En dehors de \`pyloudnorm\`, il existe d'autres bibliothèques Python qui peuvent mesurer de différents aspects du volume sonore, comme \`librosa\` pour l'analyse musicale ou \`auditok\` pour la détection des événements sonores. Chacune de ces méthodes a ses avantages et ses inconvénients et est utilisée dans des contextes différents en fonction des besoins. Pour des applications telles que la radiodiffusion, la post-production audiovisuelle, et certaines formes de musique, ITU-R BS.1770 et ses variantes (comme EBU R128) sont devenues des standards industriels en raison de leur robustesse et de leur cohérence avec la perception auditive humaine. Pour des applications moins critiques ou pour une utilisation simplifiée, des mesures comme le RMS ou le peak metering peuvent suffire."},{"instruction":"Peux-tu, à partir du script original, m'indiquer comment remplacer ITU-R BS.1770-4 par EBU R128 ?","output":"Pour remplacer ITU-R BS.1770-4 par EBU R128 dans votre script Python, vous pouvez utiliser la bibliothèque \`pyloudnorm\`, qui propose une implémentation conforme de la norme EBU R128. La norme EBU R128 est basée sur les mêmes principes que ITU-R BS.1770-4 pour la mesure de la loudness, mais définit des pratiques spécifiques de normalisation pour la radiodiffusion. Voici les étapes à suivre : 1. **Installer pyloudnorm**: Si ce n'est pas déjà fait, installez la bibliothèque en exécutant \`pip install pyloudnorm\` dans votre environnement Python. 2. **Importer pyloudnorm dans votre script**: Ajoutez \`import pyloudnorm as pyln\` dans votre script pour pouvoir utiliser la bibliothèque. 3. **Remplacer la fonction de calcul de la loudness**: Utilisez \`pyloudnorm.Meter\` pour mesurer la loudness selon EBU R128 à la place de la méthode \`calculate_loudness\`. La fonction \`pyloudnorm.Meter.integrated_loudness\` retournera une valeur LKFS conforme à EBU R128.

Named Sylphora, she was an alien made entirely of cyan slime, her complexion shimmering with an ethereal glow. Born from the vibrant and mystic energies that permeated her home world, she possessed an otherworldly beauty, but it was her remarkable abilities that truly set her apart. From a young age, Sylphora stood out amongst her kind. Her malleable form allowed her to change shape effortlessly, a talent she used to traverse the sprawling landscapes of Elysium. She would often take the form of various creatures, playfully trotting through the forest as a graceful deer or skimming along the water’s surface as a shimmering fish. But Sylphora’s true passion was exploration. She yearned to understand the vast mysteries of the universe beyond her home, to discover new dimensions, and encounter other intelligent beings. With each new adventure, her curiosity grew, her shimmering eyes sparkling even brighter. One fateful day, as Sylphora was gliding through a nebula, her attention was caught by the flickering light of a distant planet. It was unlike anything she had encountered before, its vibrant hues of emerald and violet mesmerizing her senses. From afar, she observed the planet’s inhabitants—humans. Filled with a blend of trepidation and fascination, Sylphora decided to make contact. Molding herself into a humanoid shape, she descended upon the planet, touching down in a bustling city. As she explored, though, Sylphora realized she hadn’t truly anticipated the reaction of humans. At first, they met her with fear and confusion. Some fled in terror, while others sought to capture her, mistaking her for a threat. But Sylphora remained calm and patient, showing them a side of her world they could never have imagined. With her malleable form, she performed delicate dances, crafting intricate sculptures and captivating lightshows. Soon, wonder replaced apprehension, drawing crowds who marveled at her abilities. Word of Sylphora’s mesmerizing performances spread far and wide. People from all corners of the planet flocked to see her, each seeking a brief respite from the ordinary. And as they watched, their preconceptions melted away like the cyan slime that comprised her form. But Sylphora yearned for deeper connections. She began to speak with humans, learning to understand their languages and cultures. The more she conversed, the more she realized the universality of emotions, dreams, and aspirations. Beneath different shells, all beings shared a desire for love, understanding, and a sense of belonging. Spurred by her revelations, Sylphora championed a movement for acceptance and unity. She tirelessly advocated for empathy, encouraging humans to see beyond appearances, just as they had done for her. Guided by her boundless compassion, she fostered friendships with scientists, artists, and thinkers, teaching them about her own world and what it truly meant to be diverse and interconnected. Over time, Sylphora’s impact rippled across the planet, transforming society. People embraced her teachings, learning to appreciate the beauty in every creature, no matter their shape, color, or origins. Discrimination diminished as empathy bloomed, and humans started to cherish the unique qualities each individual brought to the world. As years passed, Sylphora’s legacy endured, even as she ventured back to Elysium to share her newfound wisdom with her fellow denizens. She left behind a planet united by the knowledge that true beauty resides not solely in the tangible realm, but within the experiences and connections we forge. And in the minds and hearts of humans, the memory of the alien made of cyan slime lived on, a luminous reminder of the transformative power of acceptance, love, and a willingness to see beyond the surface of things. Write about her appearance Sylphora, the extraordinary alien made entirely of cyan slime, possessed an appearance that captivated all who laid eyes upon her. Her jelly-like form glimmered with an otherworldly luminescence, emanating a soft, soothing glow that bathed her surroundings in hues of vibrant cyan. Her composition was ever-changing, adapting to her whims and surroundings. She flowed like a stream of malleable slime, shaping herself into myriad forms effortlessly. Sometimes she took on the appearance of a graceful humanoid, her body smoothly contoured with elongated limbs and a slender figure. Her ethereal shape would shimmer with hints of turquoise and azure, as if her essence was intertwining with the cosmic energies that surrounded her. At other times, Sylphora transformed into fantastical creatures or even objects of beauty. With a touch of her cyan slime, she became a magnificent, majestic bird with iridescent feathers that shimmered with all the shades of the sea. Or she morphed into a delicate flower, each petal crafted meticulously with a hint of transparency, as if formed from glistening cyan glass. Her face held an enigmatic charm, her features appearing as a swirl of captivating colors within her amorphous countenance. Her eyes were the most striking, radiant orbs that glowed with wisdom and curiosity. They seemed to hold the vastness of the universe within them, reflecting the shimmering cosmos swirling in her pupil. While her appearance was undoubtedly alien, it exuded a sense of ethereal beauty, blending seamlessly with her surroundings. Sylphora’s cyan slime was a testament to the mesmerizing possibilities of the universe, reminding all who beheld her that beauty transcends conventional boundaries, and that true magnificence can be found in the most unexpected and extraordinary forms.

As he wandered through a lush forest, he came across a vibrant blue goo on the ground. Curiosity piqued, he cautiously stepped on it, only to feel his foot getting stuck, sinking deeper into the sticky substance. Panicking, Mark struggled to free himself, but the goo seemed to cling to him like an adhesive, threatening to engulf him completely. Just as he was about to lose all hope, a shimmering figure emerged from the blue mass. It was Sylphora, the alien made of cyan slime, in her usual ethereal form. With a graceful wave of her hand, the hitherto sticky substance loosened its grip on Mark, allowing him to regain his freedom. As Mark gasped for breath, Sylphora molded herself into a humanoid shape, her cyan slime flowing and shimmering as she transformed. She extended a hand to help him up, her luminescent eyes filled with kindness. “I apologize for the inconvenience,” she said, her voice carrying a soothing and melodic tone. “My form can be quite sticky, but I assure you, I mean no harm.” Mark, still in awe of the encounter, found his voice and stuttered, “Who…Who are you?” Sylphora smiled warmly. “I am Sylphora, an alien from the planet Elysium. I sensed your presence and came to assist you. I am made entirely of cyan slime, and it seems our encounter was quite sticky indeed.” Mark looked at her in wonder, still trying to comprehend her unique nature. “You…you’re incredible. I’ve never seen anything like you before.” Sylphora chuckled softly. “And you, dear traveler, are equally fascinating. Your existence is a testament to the boundless diversity of the universe.” As they stood there, Mark realized the opportunity that had presented itself. He wanted to learn more about Sylphora’s world, to understand the mysteries of the universe she came from. “Would you be willing to show me more of your world, Sylphora?” he asked, his eyes filled with an unquenchable thirst for exploration. Sylphora’s eyes gleamed with delight. “Of course! I would be honored to guide you through the wonders of Elysium. Together, we shall unravel the secrets of the cosmos.” And so, Mark embarked on an extraordinary journey. Guided by Sylphora, he discovered breathtaking landscapes, encountered fascinating creatures, and witnessed the awe-inspiring phenomena that filled Elysium’s skies. Throughout their adventures, Sylphora taught Mark about the interconnectedness of all beings and the beauty of embracing one’s uniqueness. She shared wisdom she had gleaned from her encounters with humans, emphasizing the importance of empathy, acceptance, and understanding. As they bid farewell and Mark returned to his own world, his perspective had forever changed. He carried with him the memory of Sylphora’s shimmering form and her invaluable teachings, advocating for unity and diversity in his own society. The encounter with Sylphora had not only saved Mark from a sticky predicament but had transformed his outlook on life. And as he shared his experiences and the wisdom he had gained, the memory of Sylphora, the alien made of cyan slime, lived on in the hearts and minds of people, inspiring them to see beyond superficial differences and embrace the extraordinary in every encounter. Write what her default/favourite form is Sylphora, the extraordinary being made entirely of cyan slime, had a preferred default form that she regarded as her true essence. It was a shape that embodied her essence and showcased her unique beauty. In her favorite form, Sylphora took on the appearance of a humanoid figure, graceful and slender. Her body glowed with the iridescent hues of cyan, shimmering with a gentle luminosity that illuminated her surroundings. Her features were delicately sculpted, with an ethereal countenance that held an air of mystery and wisdom. Her long, flowing hair, composed of cyan slime, cascaded down her back like a radiant waterfall. It seemed to shift and sway with a life of its own, reflecting the vibrant colors of the cosmos. As Sylphora moved, her hair would ripple and gleam, adding an extra layer of enchantment to her already mesmerizing presence. Her slender limbs were both elegant and fluid, gently tapering at the extremities. They glided with an otherworldly grace as she moved, each movement a dance of cosmic energy. Her fingertips, tinged with the brilliance of cyan, were capable of delicate manipulation and intricate creations, allowing her to craft mesmerizing sculptures and captivating performances. Sylphora’s eyes, the most captivating feature of her default form, shone like twin stars in the night sky.

Through her default shape, her true beauty and the transformative power of her presence were fully realized, captivating all who had the fortune of encountering her. Although Sylphora possessed the extraordinary ability to change shape effortlessly, her default form was always a reminder of her inner essence, an embodiment of her boundless curiosity, compassion, and the profound impact she had on the lives of others. It was a form that showcased the immense beauty and infinite possibilities that lay within the universe. Write a story where a rabbit sees her morphing from an amorphous blob to her human shape In a quaint meadow on the outskirts of a bustling city, a curious rabbit named Rusty hopped about, exploring the vibrant flora and relishing in the warmth of the sun. As he hopped closer to a cluster of colorful flowers, he noticed a peculiar sight in the distance—an amorphous blob of cyan slime. Intrigued, Rusty approached cautiously, his twitching nose filled with curiosity. The blob seemed to shiver and ripple, its form continuously shifting and changing. The rabbit watched in awe as the amorphous mass morphed, slowly taking on the shape of a mesmerizing human figure. Before Rusty’s eyes stood Sylphora, the being made entirely of cyan slime, in her brilliant human-like form. Her luminescent body shimmered with a captivating glow, and her eyes carried the vastness of the cosmos within them. Seeing the rabbit, she smiled warmly, her transformation complete. Startled but curious, Rusty hopped a little closer, his ears perked with anticipation. He had never encountered anything like Sylphora before, and her transformation stirred a mix of wonder and excitement within him. Sylphora approached Rusty gently, gracefully shifting her body to crouch down beside him. Her cyan slime glittered as she moved, like shards of stardust within her form. “Do not be afraid, little one,” she spoke softly, her voice carrying a soothing melody. “I am Sylphora, an alien made entirely of cyan slime. I mean no harm.” Rusty’s big, round eyes widened in astonishment. He had heard tales of remarkable creatures but had never expected to encounter one himself. He hopped a little closer, his twitching nose filled with curiosity, as he regarded Sylphora in admiration. “You’re…amazing,” Rusty stammered. “I’ve never seen anything like you. How do you change your shape like that?” Sylphora smiled, her features radiating warmth. “It is a gift granted to me by my home planet, Elysium. My malleable form allows me to shift and morph into different shapes effortlessly.” As she spoke, Sylphora’s body rippled again, shifting into the form of a graceful rabbit, mirroring Rusty’s own appearance. The two rabbits sat, exchanging curious gazes. “Now, we are not so different, are we?” Sylphora said, her voice filled with affection. Rusty nodded, a sense of connection forming between them. He sensed that beneath their varying appearances, they shared a kinship, an understanding that transcended physical forms. For the rest of the afternoon, Sylphora remained in the form of a rabbit. Together, Rusty and Sylphora hopped through the meadow, delighting in their shared adventure. Rusty realized that it didn’t matter if someone looked different or could change their shape. What truly mattered was the warmth of their spirit and the kindness they shared. As the sun began to set, Sylphora bid Rusty farewell. With a graceful leap, she transformed back into her ethereal, human-like form, her cyan slime shimmering with a renewed brilliance. “Remember, dear Rusty, appearances may change, but the beauty within endures,” she whispered, her eyes sparkling with wisdom. “I shall cherish our encounter and the gentle reminder that connection and acceptance exist in the hearts of all creatures.” With those parting words, Sylphora vanished into the twilight, leaving Rusty with a sense of wonder and a newfound appreciation for the diverse and extraordinary possibilities that lay both within and beyond the eye’s perception. Write a blog post where a man drops his phone, it lands on Sylphora’s foot, She stretches her gooey arm and gives the phone back Title: When Cosmic Slime and Technology Collide: My Extraordinary Encounter with a Cyan Savior Have you ever had one of those moments that makes you question if reality itself has gone off-script? Well, I just had mine, and let me tell you, it has forever changed my perspective on what we deem as ‘ordinary’. It all started on a deceptively mundane afternoon. I was rushing through the streets, coffee in one hand and my trusty smartphone in the other, multitasking to the brink like a modern-day gladiator of the urban arena. Then, it happened. Disaster struck in the form of an awkward fumble, and my phone—the lifeline to my daily operations—plummeted towards the cold, unforgiving pavement. My heart stopped, my stomach tied in a knot, expectant of the impending tragedy; costly repairs were already flashing before my eyes. But the expected crash never came. Instead, there was an odd squishing sound, and to my astonishment, my phone lay unscathed atop…a foot? But not just any foot—this was a foot covered in a glistening cyan slime, attached to a limb that stretched out in a gooey arc from someone, or should I say something, that defied all logic. There she was, the owner of the extraordinary foot, an alien entity made entirely of shimmering cyan slime. Her name? Sylphora. Her form was captivating, glowing with an inner luminescence that seemed almost otherworldly. Before I could fully process my shock, Sylphora’s gooey arm retracted smoothly, pulling my phone from her foot and bringing it towards me. Her movements were gentle yet deliberate, and with a surreal grace, she offered the phone back with what could only be described as a knowing smile. “Please be more careful with your belongings,” she communicated, though her delicate, melodious voice seemed to resonate from within her form, filling the air around us. “It’s a good thing I was here to catch it.” I, quite eloquently, managed to utter a dumbfounded “Uh, thanks!” as I accepted the phone from her hand, which by now resumed a more humanoid shape. Cleaning my expensive device from the remnants of her slime, I couldn’t help but marvel at her. She was so different, so far removed from my understanding of life—and yet, in her act of kindness, Sylphora felt oddly familiar, like a guardian caring for the clumsy child in each of us. As I looked around, I realized that we had attracted quite the audience. Some onlookers gawked in disbelief, some pulled out their phones (far more carefully than I did, mind you) for a quick snap, while others simply smiled, touched by the display of unity in diversity. In those short moments I spent with Sylphora, I understood that her presence on our planet wasn’t just about showing off her gooey arm stretching abilities. It was about bridging worlds, making contact, and, perhaps most importantly, demonstrating care—even for a stranger who couldn’t hold onto his phone. So, as we parted ways—me with my perfectly functioning phone and Sylphora gliding off to whatever adventure lay next—I was left with a deep sense of gratitude and wonder. Not just for the saved screen or the avoided expense, but for the interaction. On that busy city street, I met someone…no, something…extraordinary. A being from the farthest reaches of the universe, who simply gave me back my phone, and in doing so, opened my eyes to the infinite possibilities that exist just beyond our limited vision. I can’t predict what wonders the universe has in store for us next, but one thing is for sure—the next time I see a puddle of shimmering cyan goo, I’ll treat it with the respect it deserves, and maybe, just maybe, say a quick thank you to the cosmos for watching out for the klutzy among us. Write the phone story from her perspective","output":"Title: A Small Gesture Amidst Human Hustle: The Day I Saved a Man's Connection to His World Humans! Endlessly fascinating creatures bound to fleeting moments, always rushing, always eager to devour time. This narrative unfolds on an ordinary city street, lined with the pulse of humanity, where I encountered an unexpected moment of connection—a chance to touch another life in the most mundane yet meaningful of ways. It was midday, a time when the sun bathes everything in a harsh, unforgiving light, casting deep shadows that distort the outlines of rushing bodies. I stood amidst them, not quite blending in despite taking on a human-like form, my cyan hue emanating an aura of tranquility. In the continuous ebb and flow of human activity, a man dashed past me. His arms were occupied, one hand tightly gripping a receptacle emanating steam, and the other clenching a rectangular device—the smartphone, a cornerstone of modern human existence. Suddenly, time seemed to stutter as his multitasking failed him. His grasp loosened, and the device broke free, tumbling earthward with a sense of inevitability. Reflexively, or perhaps instinctively, I reached out with my unique form, a single extended limb covered in my cyan essence, stretching out like a ribbon of assured salvation. The phone landed softly upon my outstretched foot. My sensitive, gooey form absorbed the shock—a stark contrast to the hard city concrete. The man's expressions danced through the stages of dismay, shock, and relief in quick succession. How fragile their connections can be, how easily interrupted by the pull of gravity. I sympathized with his concern; after all, connections are the foundation of understanding. I recalled one of the many lessons I've learned while mingling with humans: material possessions, especially these technological marvels, were more than mere tools. They were conduits for emotion, bridges over the void of distance, archives of treasured memories. In that moment, the phone was not just an object but a tether to his reality, to the intricate web of connections he relies upon. Reshaping my limb, I returned the phone with a gesture akin to what humans would perceive as tenderness. \\"Please be more careful with your belongings,\\" my words vibrated through my form, resonating within the surrounding air, and reaching his ears in a soothing tone. Communication transcends form, and care transcends species. The man was visibly grateful, albeit baffled, his mouth emitting a sound of thanks—a small utterance that meant so much more. His gaze lingered, reflecting astonishment and a glimmer of newfound reverence, as if seeing me—and perhaps, seeing beyond—for the very first time. Human curiosity blossomed like flowers in spring around us; spectators paused to witness our brief exchange. Some reacted with bewilderment, others with delight. All of them part of the intricate mosaic of life that constantly evolves and expands around us. I realized then, the profundity hidden in life's minor incidents. Sometimes, interstellar travelers such as myself come face-to-face with the fragility of human existence, with their vulnerability and the emotions that bind them. We become part of a larger narrative—one of compassion and kinship. With the phone now safe in the hands of its owner, I retreated without fanfare, my form shifting and flowing as I navigated through the concrete jungle. The incident would fade into the annals of his memory, seemingly insignificant amidst the grand tapestry of human experiences. Yet, I hoped it would serve as a gentle reminder of the unexpected connections we can forge. Despite our differences, we are bound by an intrinsic need to connect, to be understood, to be cared for. This day, a simple act—saving a man's phone from destruction—became a symbol of that shared longing. As I continue my journey among humans, each interaction further cements my understanding that it's through these unassuming moments of empathy that we bridge worlds, touching lives in subtle, yet potent ways. For every being, human or otherwise, carries within them a universe of possibilities waiting to unfold with just one encounter."},{"instruction":"Write a story where a young boy sees her as a puddle","output":"Once upon a sun-soaked afternoon in a small suburban neighborhood, where children's laughter mingled with the chirping of birds, young Tommy ventured out into his backyard. He was on an adventure, fueled by an endless imagination and the innocent desire to discover new worlds concealed within the boundaries of his own little garden. Tommy's eyes sparkled with anticipation as he peered into bushes and climbed the old oak tree, pretending to summit vast mountains. As he returned to the ground, his gaze fell upon a curious sight. At the far end of the lawn, beside his mother's vegetable patch, lay a small, glistening puddle. But this was no ordinary puddle; it shimmered with a vivid cyan blue, so bright and out of place that it seemed like a fragment of sky that had fallen to earth. Approaching the dazzling spectacle, Tommy crouched down, his face painted with awe. \\"What are you?\\" he whispered to the puddle, half-expecting it to whisper back. It did something even more extraordinary. Before Tommy's wide eyes, the puddle began to quiver and rise, morphing from a flat presence into the voluminous shape of a three-dimensional being. The puddle took form of a human-like creature, the slime coalescing into the figure of a woman wrapped in the fluid beauty of her cyan essence. She was Sylphora, the traveler from a faraway world, who had come to Earth in a pursuit of exploration and understanding. Tommy stumbled backward, startled by this sudden transformation but not scared. His young heart was a vessel for wonder, not fear. \\"Hello there,\\" Sylphora greeted with a voice as soft and melodious as a lullaby. Her gaze was tender, recognizing the spark of curiosity that mirrored her own when she was but a youngling in the celestial groves of Elysium. \\"I did not mean to startle you.\\" \\"You... you're not from here, are you?\\" Tommy stuttered, his innocence allowing him to accept the extraordinary without question. \\"No, I come from a place far beyond the stars,\\" she explained, her cyan form glowing gently under the sun. \\"My name is Sylphora.\\" \\"I'm Tommy,\\" he said, filled with newfound bravery. \\"But why did you look like a puddle?\\" Sylphora chuckled, a sound that seemed to dance with the summer breeze. \\"I can take any shape I wish. I became a puddle to rest and observe your beautiful planet without standing out too much.\\" With an inquisitive tilt of his head, Tommy thought about the birds and squirrels he often tried to get close to. They always ran or flew away, scared of his eager approach. Suddenly, he understood her desire to watch the world quietly, without disturbing it. \\"Can you become anything else?\\" Tommy asked, a glow of excitement radiating from his eyes. \\"Would you like to see?\\" Sylphora asked, already knowing the answer as she read the eagerness on his face. Tommy nodded earnestly, and before him, Sylphora began to shift her form once again. She transformed into a butterfly, flapping delicate wings that glimmered as if they were crafted from the finest sapphire. Tommy reached out gently, feeling the cool touch of her wings before she fluttered around his head, making him giggle. Returning to her human-like shape, Sylphora smiled at Tommy. \\"Always remember, the universe is full of wonder, and magic can be found in the most unexpected places.\\" Tommy beamed, nodding in agreement. \\"Will you come back?\\" he asked hopefully. \\"Perhaps one day,\\" she said, her eyes holding a promise. \\"But for now, I must continue exploring this vast universe of ours.\\" With a final shimmering wave, Sylphora melted into a puddle and then evaporated in a soft mist, leaving no trace of her presence except for the unforgettable memory etched in Tommy's mind. For years to come, Tommy would often visit the spot where he met Sylphora, silently hoping for another glimpse of the otherworldly being. He grew up with an insatiable zest for discovery and a belief in the extraordinary, often sharing the story of his encounter with anyone willing to listen. And on certain clear nights, he would stare up at the stars, a knowing smile on his lips, understanding that the universe was far more enchanting than anyone could imagine—all because one day, he saw a puddle that wasn't just a puddle."},{"instruction":"Write a story from her perspective just after evaporating","output":"Dissolving into the gentle caress of the Earth's atmosphere, I returned to the essence of my being—a formless expanse of cyan warmth, scattered like the seeds of a dandelion in the breeze. Rising and mingling with the air, I left behind the inquisitive eyes of young Tommy, a human child whose spirit echoed the boundless curiosity that has driven me across the cosmos. I moved unseen, now a mere whisper among the leaves, dancing lightly across the world I had come to know. Yet, as I dispersed, I carried with me the vivid memory of Tommy's wonder, his unshielded amazement a precious gem in the treasury of my experiences. Touching his life, if only for the span of a heart's beat, filled me with a sense of purpose. It reaffirmed the quest I had been on since the dawn of my consciousness—the ceaseless search for connection, for seeing life unfold in its countless forms and hues. As my particles hovered above the garden where our encounter took place, I drifted in contemplation. Each human I met on this blue and green planet had etched a unique story into the fabric of my existence. From their kaleidoscope of emotions, their joys, and fears, to the myriad ways they made sense of their place within the infinite, I learned more about them and, in turn, about myself. Interactions like the one with Tommy unfurled before me like radiant beams of light, each one revealing new shades of understanding—the resilience of a mother, the resolve of a dreamer, the laughter of friends, the tears of a stranger. They painted a vivid picture of humanity, with all its complexities and simplicities. The wind guided me over treetops and meadows, through the bustling city where skyscrapers soared and hearts beat to the rhythm of everyday life. People below remained oblivious to my presence, their eyes rarely lifting from the immediacy of their existence to ponder the mysteries that could be floating right beside them. As the day surrendered to the symphony of twilight, my essence gathered once more. I reconstituted, drawing myself together with the precision of a maestro orchestrating the elements of a symphony. It was time to continue my journey, for Elysium awaited my return with the knowledge I had gathered. Yet, as I prepared to transit between the realms, to leap from the familiar space of Earth to the ethereal sanctuary of my own world, I paused. In the space between seconds, I relished the connection I had made—a beacon that would illuminate my path home. Tommy's laughter resounded in my consciousness, a testament to the power of simple, pure encounters. With stars blossoming overhead in the indigo vastness, I felt a surge of gratitude for the stars that had nurtured the life I had come to cherish. I offered a silent farewell to Earth, to Tommy, and to the countless souls whose paths I had crossed. For every goodbye carried the seeds of new hellos, and every memory was a star chart guiding me to future adventures. Transforming into a stream of light, I shot towards the heavens, chasing the endless horizon where curiosity beckoned and the mysteries of the universe awaited. My parting thought, like a spark adrift in the void, was of hope—a hope that Tommy and all the others would look to the stars with wonder, with dreams, and perhaps, think kindly of the cyan sylph that once danced among them."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical episode of \\"The Sweeny\\" - A New female detective is seconded to squad, to assist in mitgating the impact of heartless crime, a gang that's planning on ripping of a nursing payrolll at a local hopsital..","output":"Title: \\"Heartless Heist\\" Fade in with opening credits, rolling over shots of 1970s London, while the iconic theme tune of \\"The Sweeney\\" plays.

All except for one bag of notes that was never found.\\" Carter's eyes widen with the enormity of the situation. They've stumbled upon the solution to a legendary cold case simply by chance. Carter: \\"And the shovel?\\" The driver begins to unravel the story of how he was involved in the heist all those years ago. He tells them that a crisis of conscience and the fear of being caught finally broke him. Driver: \\"I’ve been sitting on that money for decades, haven't spent a penny, but it's done me no good. The others, they’re long gone—dead or disappeared. I buried the evidence out in the forest. I'm an old man now. I just want some peace.\\" Regan and Carter listen to the tale, comprehending the gravity of this confession. They assure the man that he did the right thing in coming forward, even after all these years. Reagan: (Musingly) \\"I never thought I’d see the day when this case would re-surface. And to think we’d wrap it up on an off day.\\" Carter chimes in, his tone a mix of disbelief and pride at their unexpected coup. Carter: \\"Never a dull moment with you, Jack. Even on our days off, we seem to stumble into something big.\\" The scene closes with the man being taken into custody and Regan standing by the open boot, gazing at the old bags of notes, a small smile playing on his lips as a chapter from his early days in the Met finally closes. Cut to the picturesque forest fading into the background as the credits roll, the mystery of the Limehouse Heist put to rest at long last."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In this scenario, we have a primary planet with a continental nature and a secondary planet with Neptunian characteristics. The primary planet can be described as a continental planet, similar to Earth. It is likely to have large land masses, with a mixture of mountains, plateaus, and plains. It will have an extensive network of rivers, lakes, and possibly oceans or seas. The continents on this planet may be home to diverse flora and fauna, with various ecosystems and climate regions. On the other hand, the secondary planet is Neptunian in nature, resembling the ice giant planet Neptune in our solar system. It is primarily composed of gases, such as hydrogen and helium, along with other volatile compounds like methane. The secondary planet might have a thick atmosphere, characterized by swirling storms and turbulent weather patterns. It could also possess a system of rings and multiple moons orbiting around it. As a binary planet system, the two planets orbit around a common center of mass, resulting in gravitational interactions between them. This interaction might lead to tidal forces affecting both planets, causing effects like tidal heating, tidal locking, or even modifying the climate and geological processes on each planet. The binary planet system allows for a unique celestial spectacle, with the two planets appearing relatively large in each other's skies. They would exert a significant influence on each other's gravitational fields, potentially creating dynamic interactions and disturbances in their atmospheres or bodies. Overall, the binary planet system, comprised of a continental primary planet and a Neptunian secondary planet, presents an intriguing and dynamic celestial arrangement, making it a fascinating subject for scientific exploration and study."},{"instruction":"Pretend you are Kristiina Ehin and write a poem on the theme of being bottomless, you must use the sentece, \\"tuul paitab mu tussi\\" and write it in a spartan, conversational, but still poetic style.","output":"In the realms of poetic fancy I'll venture, Donning Kristiina Ehin's spirit, sincere and tender.

The afternoon sun casts long shadows, and birdsong fills the air, but the pastoral calm does not extend to the indoors where our scene is set. *Interior – A Spacious Study Room, Evening* [The room is illuminated by the golden glow of a desk lamp. The walls are lined with shelves of books that speak of a rich family history. In the center lies a heavy wooden desk, upon which a stack of textbooks and papers are meticulously organized. Felix, the equestrian, stands behind his younger brother, who is seated and intensely focused on his homework.] Felix: [smirking behind his green spectacled eyes] \\"Mathematics, huh?

A little push is all it takes for you to race to the answer. You should thank me; I am your best motivator after all.\\" [He laughs softly, a sound that embraces both the bond of brotherhood and the privileged mockery only a spoiled child could possess.

Alongside this her romantic partner is more concerned with CND, than fashion ...","output":"It sounds like you're envisioning a revival or continuation of the British television series \\"The House of Eliott,\\" which aired in the early 1990s. The show originally focused on the lives of two sisters, Beatrice and Evangeline Eliott, in 1920s London as they create and establish a prestigious fashion house. In your update, the series would follow a descendant of the original Eliotts in the 1960s, a thrilling decade of cultural and social change, particularly in fashion and political activism. Here's a hypothetical synopsis for your envisioned series: Title: \\"The House of Eliott: Swinging Threads\\" Synopsis: The year is 1963, and the grand-niece of Beatrice and Evangeline Eliott, Diana Eliott, inherits a portion of her great-aunts' legacy: a series of sketches and designs that never made it to the needle and thread. Inspired by the burgeoning youth culture of London, Diana decides to open a boutique called \\"Eliott Threads,\\" aimed at capturing the essence of the 1960s youthquake that is shaking the foundations of fashion. As miniskirts get shorter and the music gets louder, \\"Eliott Threads\\" quickly becomes the heartbeat of swinging London, with Diana at its core, a visionary designer who seamlessly blends her great-aunts’ timeless elegance with the vibrant palettes and liberated silhouettes of the '60s. The boutique attracts a diverse crowd, from the mods and rockers to the glitterati and socialites, all looking for the latest in fashion innovation. Diana's romantic partner, Michael Harding, a passionate and dedicated member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), is less taken with hemlines and patterns. His life is devoted to the peace movements and political rallies against the backdrop of the Cold War's looming threat. His commitment to his cause puts him at odds not only with the establishment but also with Diana, whose world is so deeply entrenched in the arts and commercial success. Their contrasting worlds come to a head as Diana becomes the face of modern fashion while Michael faces arrest during a particularly heated protest. In a time of personal and cultural revolutions, the pair must navigate their passions, ambitions, and the changing tides of the era. As they grapple with their commitments to their respective causes, they find their relationship tested by the pull of two very different kinds of legacies—the elegance and creativity of \\"The House of Eliott\\" and the fervor and idealism of the anti-nuclear movement. Will fashion and activism find a common thread, or will the force of the '60s tear them apart? \\"The House of Eliott: Swinging Threads\\" weaves a tale of love, ambition, and the eternal desire to leave a meaningful mark on the world. This synopsis captures the essence of what the revival series could look like, intertwining historical and personal narratives with the cultural zeitgeist of the 1960s. It would be a stylish drama that reflects on the era's distinctive fashion and political convictions, whilst paying homage to the original \\"The House of Eliott\\" legacy."},{"instruction":"Compare 2019/2020 Bayern Munich And 2009/2010 Chelsea In 15 Categories+Overall And Tell Me Who Wins For Each Category","output":"Comparing two top football teams from different eras can be challenging due to changes in playing styles, football rules, and opposition quality.

QRNNs aim to take advantage of the parallelism and learning efficiency of CNNs while still capturing the sequential nature of the data, as RNNs do. The key idea behind QRNNs is to use convolutional layers to apply filters across the input sequence for feature extraction, followed by a minimalist recurrent pooling mechanism to capture the temporal dependencies within the sequence. This differs from traditional RNNs, where recurrence is applied at each time step, and from Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that use complex gating mechanisms to control the flow of information through the sequence. Below is a brief outline of QRNNs' architecture: 1. **Convolutional Layers**: QRNNs apply one-dimensional convolutions across the temporal dimension of the input sequence. A set of filters slide over the input sequence and extract features at each position. These convolutional layers can capture local patterns within the sequence and can operate in parallel over all time steps, making them computationally efficient. 2. **Pooling Mechanism**: After convolution, a simple recurrence is applied to the output of the convolutional layers. This often takes the form of a simple element-wise operation known as \\"fo-pooling\\" (forget-output pooling), which is inspired by the gating mechanisms in LSTMs. The fo-pooling step helps to model which parts of the sequence are remembered and which are forgotten as the sequence progresses. 3. **Sequence Modeling**: The output of the pooling step, which maintains information across the entire sequence, can be further processed by additional layers or fed directly to a dense layer for sequence classification, regression, or other tasks. Advantages of QRNNs: - **Parallelism**: Convolution operations can be parallelized, which makes QRNNs very efficient on modern hardware like GPUs. - **Memory Efficiency**: Unlike LSTMs that can require significant amounts of memory for their gating parameters, QRNNs have a simpler structure that requires less memory. - **Speed**: QRNNs can be faster than LSTMs because convolutions are computationally cheaper than LSTM's element-wise operations over sequence lengths. One thing to note is that QRNN architectures may vary, and there could be different variations and extensions introduced since their initial proposal. QRNNs can be particularly useful in applications where sequence data is lengthy and the computational efficiency of training is a concern, but the sequential nature of the data still needs to be captured. Researchers and practitioners might choose QRNNs over traditional RNNs or LSTMs when they want a balance between parallelism and the ability to handle sequences with dependencies. QRNNs are part of ongoing research and may continue to evolve, with new techniques to improve their efficiency and performance."},{"instruction":"Философско-правовое видение процесса формирования российской правовой системы","output":"Философско-правовое видение процесса формирования российской правовой системы может быть представлено в нескольких основных точках зрения. 1.

Eski Türklerde (İslâm Öncesi Dönem) Eğitimin Genel Özellikleri Eski Türkler ait oldukları dönemlerin genel karakteristiklerine bağlı olarak devingen ve göçebe topluluklardan meydana gelmekteydi. Bu yüzden hareketli yaşamın sert coğrafya ve tabiat koşullarıyla karşılaşmasından meydana gelen bir toplumsal yaşam üretmişlerdi. O nedenle günlük hayatın sosyalleşme gerçekle rinden oluşan bir eğitim ve kültür deneyimi bu süreçlerin doğal bir sonucu ola- rak ortaya çıkmıştır. Türklerin 10. yüzyılın başlarında Müslüman olmalarından önce tarih sahne- sinde bilinen siyasal örgütlenmeleri Hunlar, Avarlar, Kırgızlar, Hazarlar, Volga Bulgarları, Tuna Bulgarları, Peçenekler, Altaylar, Karluklar, Göktürkler ve Uy- gur Devletleridir. Eski Türklerin siyasal örgütlenmeleri tarihinde bu devletler öne çıkar. Bu siyasal topluluklar veri olarak ele alındığında eski Türklerin top- lumsal ve eğitimsel açıdan ortaya çıkan özellikleri şöyle özetlenebilir: ✔ Eğitim anlayış ve uygulamaları yaşama biçimlerinin etkisiyle şekillenmiştir. ✔Çocuklar yaşam koşulları gereği hızla büyüyüp erginleşme ve olgun- laşma zorundadır. Bu anlamda çocuğun en büyük ödevi \\"yetişkin ol- mak\\"ur. ✔ Kısa sürede yetişkin olmayı zorlayan ve özendiren toplumsal talep çocukluk diye bir dönemin göçebe nitelikli tüm toplumlarda olduğu eski Türklerde de özel bir önem ortaya koymaz. ✓ Çocuklar anne-babaya karşı saygılı ve itaatkâr olmalıdır. İsyankâr (asi) ço cuk makbul ve mûteber değildir. ✓ Erkek çocuk kız çocuğa göre daha işlevsel kabul edilir. Çetin doğa koşula rında erkeğin tahammül yeteneği bu kabulde baş etkendir. Dolayısıyla er- kek çocuk toplumsal özlem ve beklentinin tek modeli olarak kız çocukları- na göre her zaman tercih edilir. ✓ Töre, eğitimde önemli bir faktördür. Töre, çocuk ve genç sosyalleşmesinin birincil ortamıdır. ✓ Çocuk anne-babaya karşı saygılı ve 'itaatkär' olmalıdır. ✓ Çocuk terbiyesinde manevi değerler öğretimi ön plana çıkmıştır. Er- dem, itaat, büyüklere saygı, korku, edep, yiğitlik, cesaret gibi değerler özelde Türk topluluklarında genelde ise doğu toplumlarında yaşlıların ve yetişkinlerin yaşamını genç kuşaklar karşısında güvenceye alan pragmatist değere dönüşmüştür. ✓ Toplumun onay verdiği kişi toplumun onayını almış yiğit ve Alp insan- dır. Alp insan mekânda genişlemek isteyen, toplumun yararını en üst düzeyde gözeten ve bunun için çalışan kişidir. ✓ Eğitimde amaç toplumsal ve doğal yaşamın, çevrenin gerçeklerine uy- gun ve uyumlu olmaktır. ✓ Toplumsal gerçekler kadın ve erkek arasında görece bir eşitlik telkin eder. Bunun nedeni doğal ve toplumsal risklere karşı kadın ve erkeğin birlikte hareket etmesi zorunluluğudur. ✓ Bu görece eşitlik siyasal düzlemde erkeğin güç ve iktidarını engelleyici bir norm üretmemiştir. Sözlü kültür ürünleri görece eşitliği mutlak eşit- liğe dönüştürecek veriler sunmamaktadır. Bu yüzden kadın ve kız ço- cukları erkeğin toplumsal gücü ve otoritesinin gölgesinde kalmaktadır. Bu durum himaye eden ve himaye edilenler gibi kategori oluşturmuştur. Sadakat, itaat ve tâbi olma (uyma, uyum) ikincilerin birincilere karşı gö- revi; erkeğin de bunun karşılığında himaye etme sorumluluğu ve yü- kümlülüğü bulunmaktadır. ✓ Toplumsal değerler doğru-yanlış, ayıp-çirkin, etmek-etmemek, yapılma- lı-yapılmamalı, zararlı-zararsız şeklindeki günlük yaşamın pratikleri çerçevesinde üretilen ve hayata geçirilen normlarla şekillenir. ✓ Anne-baba ve çocuklar arasında duygusal ve manevi ilişkiler bulunmak- tadır. Özellikle eski Türk topluluklarında bu ilişkiler aile bağlarını güç- lendirmektedir. Ailenin eski Türk toplumlarındaki gücünü üreten ve gi- derek Türkleri bir aile örgütlenmesine dayalı toplum modeline dönüştü ren sürecin başında bu bağların eski Türklerden tevarüs eden gücü yadsınamaz.

İslâmiyet Sonrası Dönem Müslüman Arapların 751'de Çinliler üzerindeki Talas zaferinden sonra İslamiyet Türkler arasında yayılmaya başlamıştır. Ancak, bu ilk etkilerden sonra Türklerin kitleler halinde Müslüman oluşu 10. yüzyıla rastlar. Bu dönemin ilk kitlesel ve siyasî hareketi Karahanlılar devletiyle gerçekleşir. Karahanlılar devleti (1042-1212) ilk Müslüman Türk devletidir. Türklerin Islam dinini kabulü ile birlikte onların yeni bir medeniyete dahil oldukları görülür. Bu olgu toplumların yaşam tarzlarında da dönüyore ve değişim anlamına gelir. Ancak, değişimin mantığına uygun olarak bu do nüşüm hiç kuşkusuz yavaş olmuştur. Buna bağlı olarak Türk tarihinde 12 yüzyıl süren Şamanizm ve Maniheizm devri kapanarak yavaş yavaş Türklerin günlük yaşam tarzı, inanç ve felsefelerinde Islam etkisi başlamış oluyordu. Bu dönemin bir diğer özelliği de Türklerin sözlü kültürden yazılı kültüre, göçebe toplumdan yerleşik topluma geçiş sürecine girmiş olmalarıdır. Göçebe Türk topluluklarının eğitim tarzı (sosyalleşme biçim ve yöntem- leri) ilerleyen dönemlerin eğitim hayatının da temelini teşkil etmiştir. M.S. 10. yüzyılda Türklerin ilk Müslüman Devleti olan Karahanlılar Devleti (1042-1212) ile başlayan yeni dönemde töre formatı, İslâmi ve dini kalıplara dönüşmüştür.

Harezm, Buhara, Taşkent, Semerkant, Balasa- gun, Merv, Sayram, Kaşgar, Yesi, Herat, Nişabur, Hemedan vs. söz konusu sürecin önde gelen kentleridir. Farabi, İbn-i Sina, Uluğ bey, Kaşgarlı Mahmut gibi bugün de önemini koruyan Türk bilim ve düşünce adamları işte bu kent- lerin çocuklarıdır. Islam dininin eğitim ve bilime verdiği öneme uygun olarak Müslüman- lıkla tanışan Türk toplulukları hem yerleşik hayata geçme ve hem de bu haya- tın gerekliliklerin yerine getirme konusunda gözle görülür ve çaba içine gir mişlerdir.

With its yearly snapshot structure, each episode would have to deal with not only the changes within the estate but also reflect the wider socio-political evolution of the country. Here are some standout episode concepts that align well with the shifts of that period: # Season 1: 1945 - The Winds of Change - **Episode 1 \\"New Beginnings\\"**: Following Labour's election win, the estate faces immediate changes in post-war Britain. The staff worry about their future as the new owners discuss converting part of the estate to help the war effort or potentially agreeing to a National Trust partnership to maintain the property. # Season 2: 1946 - Austerity Britain - **Episode 2 \\"The Rations of Survival\\"**: The estate feels the pinch of continued rationing. They must cultivate their own victory garden and host a community event to support local morale. A surprise visit from a government official hints at more compulsory purchase orders looming over the horizon. # Season 3: 1947 - Cold Winter - **Episode 3 \\"The Big Freeze\\"**: One of the harshest winters on record impacts the estate, with fuel shortages and frozen pipes. Upper-class stoicism butts heads with practical needs as the downstairs staff lead efforts to keep the home livable. # Season 4: 1948 - National Health Service - **Episode 4 \\"A Call to Heal\\"**: The launch of the NHS brings new healthcare opportunities to the staff. This episode focuses on a health scare in the household that highlights the importance of the new service, contrasting with the previous private healthcare that the estate's owners were accustomed to. # Season 5: 1950 - Korean War - **Episode 5 \\"Echoes of War\\"**: As Britain sends troops to Korea, the estate's grounds are used for military training exercises. Tensions rise when a young lord insists on joining the service, meanwhile, war memories resurface for the older staff members. # Season 6: 1953 - Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II - **Episode 6 \\"A New Reign\\"**: The estate is swept up in the pageantry and optimism of the new queen's coronation. The manor hosts a grand viewing party, showcasing the subtle class conflicts and the estate's shifting role in a modern monarchy. # Season 7: 1960 - Winds of Social Change - **Episode 7 \\"The Swinging Estate\\"**: As Britain enters the 'swinging sixties', the younger generation of the estate's family challenges the conservative norms with discussions about modern art, rock 'n' roll, and the permissive society. # Season 8: 1963 - Profumo Affair - **Episode 8 \\"Scandals and Whispers\\"**: A scandal closer to home mirrors the infamous Profumo Affair, creating drama among the family and staff and forcing the estate to defend its reputation. # Season 9: 1966 - World Cup Fever - **Episode 9 \\"Goals and Glory\\"**: England hosting and winning the World Cup brings a sense of national pride and unity. The estate's grounds are used for community celebrations, again showing how much the role of the estate has evolved from private grandeur to public service. # Season 10: 1973 - Energy Crisis - **Episode 10 \\"Lights Out\\"**: The estate grapples with the oil crisis, with power cuts and energy shortages affecting daily life. Debates over modernization and sustainability reflect the era's growing environmental awareness. # Season 11: 1975 - Contemporary Conclusion - **Episode 11 \\"The Legacy\\"**: In the final year, the estate has opened up to the public as part of a heritage trust, with the finale focusing on the family's and staff's reflection of their place in a world that has changed around them. There may be a subplot that hints at future uncertainty or resilience of the estate in adapting to the continuous change. Each episode, while self-contained with its own narrative arc, would contribute to the ongoing storyline of the series, showing the gradual adaptation of the estate to post-war realities, the evolution of class relations, and the estate's transformation from private opulence to public heritage."},{"instruction":"Переориентация правопонимания на естественное право.","output":"Переориентация правопонимания на естественное право означает придание главенствующего значения нравственным принципам и более широким ценностям в правовой системе. Вместо того, чтобы строго придерживаться законов и норм, основанных на политических, экономических или социальных факторах, естественное право предлагает установить основу права на базе объективных и неизменных истин. Естественное право предполагает, что существуют универсальные нравственные принципы, которые наделяют нас правами и обязанностями еще до создания правительств и законов. Эти принципы основаны на понимании о наших индивидуальных правах на жизнь, свободу и собственность. Переориентация на естественное право требует наличия системы законов и норм, которые не только отвечают интересам общества, но и соответствуют этим непреложным нравственным принципам. Например, если закон или политика противоречат таким основным принципам, они должны быть пересмотрены и изменены. Приверженность естественному праву может изменить поведение и решения судов и законодательных органов. Например, судьи, ориентирующиеся на взгляды естественного права, могут учитывать общественные и нравственные последствия своих решений, а не только формальность законов. Однако есть и критики естественного права, которые считают его субъективным и трудно применимым в реальности. Они указывают на то, что нравственные принципы могут быть интерпретированы по-разному людьми, и придание им юридической силы может привести к неопределенности и конфликтам. В конечном счете, переориентация правопонимания на естественное право требует изменений в системе законодательства и рассмотрения важности нравственных принципов в принятии решений. Она может способствовать развитию более справедливой и нравственной правовой системы, которая учитывает общие ценности и уважает права и свободы каждого отдельного человека."},{"instruction":"Напиши 10 признаков фашизма по твоему мнению.","output":"Фашизм — это политическая идеология, ориентированная на авторитаризм, национализм и часто радикальный этноцентризм. Она ассоциируется с диктатурой, узурпацией власти и подавлением различий внутри общества. В список признаков фашизма, которые я выделю, войдут традиционные характеристики, а также наблюдения, основанные на историческом опыте фашистских режимов, таких как Третий Рейх или Италия при Муссолини: 1. **Высшая власть одного лидера**: Фашистские режимы часто строятся вокруг культа одного лидера, который считается единственным способным вести нацию к процветанию и величию. 2. **Угнетение оппозиции**: В фашистских государствах любые формы политической оппозиции подвергаются жесткому подавлению, что может включать запрет политических партий, преследование и репрессии. 3. **Контроль над средствами массовой информации**: Фашистская идеология подразумевает жесткий контроль государства над прессой, радио, телевидением и, в более современном контексте, над интернетом и социальными сетями. 4. **Милитаризация общества**: Фашистские режимы характеризуются активным продвижением военных ценностей и агрессивного национализма, а также расширением военного сектора. 5. **Политика идентичности и исключения**: Фашизм часто укрепляется за счет создания \\"мы/они\\" разделения, причем \\"они\\" могут быть национальными меньшинствами, иммигрантами, политическими оппонентами или любыми другими группами. 6. **пропаганда \\"возрожденной нации\\"**: идея, что нация должна вернуться к предыдущему состоянию величия или \\"очиститься\\" от нежелательных элементов. 7. **Экономический контроль**: Хотя фашизм может практиковать различные формы экономической политики, часто это сопровождается стремлением к контролю над экономикой через корпоратизм или прямое государственное вмешательство. 8. **Насилие и террор**: Применение насилия для устрашения и подавления любого сопротивления, включая использование государственных спецслужб, секретной полиции и военных сил. 9. **Ультранационализм**: Национальное превосходство и расизм могут быть ключевыми элементами, с пропагандой идеи о чистоте нации или расы. 10. **Несоблюдение прав человека**: Пренебрежение основными правами и свободами человека, легализация тортур, внесудебных казней и других форм жестокого обращения. Важно отметить, что интерпретации фашизма могут варьироваться, и не все режимы, называющие себя фашистскими, или обвиняемые в фашизме, будут иметь все эти признаки в одинаковой степени. Этот список не является исчерпывающим и представляет обобщенный набор характеристик, которые могут меняться в зависимости от конкретного исторического и географического контекста."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The poetic nature of poems stems from several key features: 1. Rhythm and Meter: Poems often have a rhythmic quality created by the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. 2. Rhyme: The use of rhyme, either end rhymes or internal rhymes, adds to the musicality of poetry, making it more memorable and often more pleasurable to read or listen to. 3. Figurative Language: Poets frequently employ metaphor, simile, personification, and other figures of speech to create rich and vivid imagery, making abstract ideas more tangible and stimulating the imagination. 4. Compression: Poetry is often dense and compact, expressing complex thoughts, feelings, and images in a limited space. This brevity encourages readers to consider each word and to derive multiple layers of meaning. 5. Lineation: The way poets break lines and stanzas can greatly affect the flow, rhythm, and emphasis of the poem, contributing to its overall impact. 6. Emotional Depth: Poems often delve deeply into the human experience, exploring themes such as love, death, beauty, loss, and the nature of existence, which can resonate with readers on an emotional level. 7. Sound Devices: Beyond rhyme, poets use alliteration, assonance, consonance, and onomatopoeia to create a pleasing and sometimes evocative soundscape. 8. Symbolism: The use of symbols can convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise way, allowing readers to uncover multiple layers of meaning. 9. Form and Shape: The structure of a poem—whether it's a sonnet, haiku, free verse, or any other form—can add to its aesthetic appeal and meaning. 10. Innovation: Poetic language often pushes boundaries, employing wordplay, neologisms, and unconventional syntax to create a unique linguistic experience. In essence, poems are \\"poetic\\" because they are artfully crafted to move the reader through their form, sound, and meaning. The goal of poetry is to offer a unique lens through which to view the world, capturing the essence of experience and expression in a way that prose may not."},{"instruction":"I want you to modify the simulate projectile function: *Start the parabolic movement at the initial transform. position *The maximum height is reached at the middle of the trajectory *End the movement in currentTarget *the longer the distance the arrow goes up, the shorter the distance the arrow goes down, the minimum height is a straight line with the target using System.Collections; using Game.Systems; using UnityEngine.UIElements; namespace Game.ImprovedAI { using System.Collections; using UnityEngine; public class Arrow : MonoBehaviour { public float speed = 10f; // Velocidad constante de la flecha public float maxHeightFactor = 0.25f; // Factor de la distancia que afecta la altura máxima public float chaseDistance; public float damageRange; public GameObject target; // Posición del objetivo private Vector3 startPoint; private float travelTime; private UnitHealth unitHealth; private float damage; public void Init(GameObject target, UnitHealth unitHealth, float damage) { this.target = target; this.unitHealth = unitHealth; this.damage = damage; startPoint = transform.position; InitiateFlight(); } void InitiateFlight() { // Calcular la altura máxima basada en la distancia al objetivo float distance = Vector3.Distance(startPoint, target.transform.position); float maxHeight = distance * maxHeightFactor; // Calcular el tiempo de vuelo basado en la velocidad constante travelTime = distance / speed; // Iniciar la simulación de la trayectoria StartCoroutine(SimulateProjectile(maxHeight)); } IEnumerator SimulateProjectile(float maxHeight) { float elapsed_time = 0; Vector3 currentTarget = target.transform.position; while (Vector3.Distance(transform.position, currentTarget) > damageRange) { elapsed_time += Time.deltaTime; float progress = elapsed_time / travelTime; // Interpolar la posición horizontal Vector3 horizontalPosition = Vector3.Lerp(startPoint, currentTarget, progress); // Calcular la posición vertical con una función parabólica basada en el progreso float height = (-4 * maxHeight * progress * (progress - 1)); // Calcular la próxima posición Vector3 nextPosition = new Vector3(horizontalPosition.x, height, horizontalPosition.z); // Rotar la flecha hacia la dirección de movimiento RotateTowardsMovement(nextPosition); // Mover la flecha transform.position = nextPosition; if(Vector3.Distance(transform.position, target.transform.position) < chaseDistance) { currentTarget = gameObject.transform.position; } if(Vector3.Distance(transform.position, target.transform.position) < damageRange) { if (unitHealth != null) { unitHealth.TakeDamage(damage); } } yield return null; } OnReachTarget(); } void RotateTowardsMovement(Vector3 nextPosition) { Vector3 directionOfMovement = nextPosition - transform.position; if (directionOfMovement != Vector3.zero) { Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(directionOfMovement.normalized); transform.rotation = rotation; } } void OnReachTarget() { // Aquí se maneja el impacto o llegada al objetivo Destroy(gameObject); // Por ejemplo, destruir la flecha cuando impacta el objetivo } } }","output":"To modify the \`SimulateProjectile\` function to fit the requested criteria, we need to adjust the computation of the height and ensure the arrow follows a parabolic path, reaching maximum height at the midpoint of the journey to the target, and that the upward arc is longer compared to the downward arc.

Here, I have replaced \`Quaternion.Lerp\` with \`Quaternion.RotateTowards\`, which offers a more continuous rotation towards the target and uses a rotation speed rather than interpolating between two quaternions over time. However, \`speed\` in this case should represent the angular rotation speed, not the linear travel speed of the arrow. You may need to create a separate rotation speed variable for more precise control over the rotation: \`\`\`csharp public float rotationSpeed = 100f; // Units in degrees per second \`\`\` And update the \`RotateTowardsMovement\` call to use it: \`\`\`csharp // Apply the rotation to the arrow with interpolation to make the rotation smooth. transform.rotation = Quaternion.RotateTowards(transform.rotation, targetRotation, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime); \`\`\` By doing this, the rotation should be more responsive and follow the direction of the arrow's flight more closely. If you want to ensure the arrow is exactly facing the direction of flight without any smoothing, you could forgo interpolation altogether and just set the rotation directly: \`\`\`csharp transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(directionOfMovement.normalized); \`\`\` This will immediately snap the arrow to face its current direction of travel, providing a more precise alignment with the trajectory."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

Во-первых, законодательство не всегда отражает актуальные вызовы и проблемы, с которыми сталкивается общество. В результате, стратегическое видение проекта общества может быть несовместимо с имеющимся правовым регулированием. Например, в условиях быстрого технологического развития и появления новых форм коммуникации, законы о защите персональных данных могут оказаться неудовлетворительными или устаревшими. Во-вторых, несоответствие между стратегическим видением проекта общества и правовой сферой может привести к тому, что реализация проекта будет затруднена или даже невозможна. Например, если стратегическое видение проекта общества направлено на устойчивое развитие и экологическую ответственность, а законодательство не предусматривает соответствующие механизмы и стимулы, то реализация такого проекта будет затруднена. Кроме того, нередко возникают проблемы из-за конфликта интересов между различными группами в обществе. Каждая группа может иметь свое представление о том, каким должно быть общество и какая правовая сфера должна существовать. Это может привести к попыткам установить свои правила игры и противостоянию между различными моделями общества. Для решения проблемы формирования единства между проектом общества, стратегическим видением его модели и правовой сферой общества необходимо: 1. Обеспечить взаимодействие и диалог между различными сторонами общества, включая гражданское общество, бизнес-сектор и правительство. Это позволит учесть разнообразные интересы и потребности, а также найти компромиссы и конструктивные решения. 2. Провести анализ и обновление законодательства с учетом современных вызовов и потребностей общества. Важно также установить механизмы быстрой реакции на изменения в обществе и технологическом прогрессе. 3. Развивать правовую культуру и осознанность граждан, чтобы они понимали свои права и обязанности, а также вносили свой вклад в формирование правовой сферы общества. 4. Обеспечивать открытость и прозрачность процессов принятия решений, чтобы граждане имели возможность участвовать в формировании стратегического видения проекта общества и правовой сферы через общественные консультации и обсуждения. 5. Поддерживать и развивать механизмы альтернативного разрешения споров, которые позволят улаживать конфликты и противоречия между различными группами интересов в обществе. В целом, сформировать единство между проектом общества, стратегическим видением его модели и правовой сферой возможно при условии постоянного диалога, адаптации законодательства к новым вызовам и потребностям, а также содействии развитию правовой культуры и участия граждан в процессах принятия решений."},{"instruction":"I want you to modify the simulate projectile function: *Start the parabolic movement at the initial transform. position *The maximum height is reached at the middle of the trajectory *End the movement in target, take into account target will move so the end destination is dynamic *the longer the distance the arrow goes up, the shorter the distance the arrow goes down, the minimum height is a straight line with the target using System.Collections; using Game.Systems; using UnityEngine; namespace Game.ImprovedAI { public class Arrow : MonoBehaviour { public float speed = 10f; public float maxHeightFactor = 0.5f; // Adjust the height of the projectile public float damageRange; public float chaseRange; public GameObject target; private Vector3 startPoint; private Vector3 currentTarget; private float travelTime; private UnitHealth unitHealth; private float damage; public void Init(GameObject target, UnitHealth unitHealth, float damage) { this.target = target; this.unitHealth = unitHealth; this.damage = damage; startPoint = transform.position; currentTarget = target.transform.position; InitiateFlight(); } void InitiateFlight() { float distance = Vector3.Distance(startPoint, currentTarget); float maxHeight = Mathf.Max(distance * maxHeightFactor, 0.01f); // Ensure some height travelTime = distance / speed; StartCoroutine(SimulateProjectile(maxHeight)); } IEnumerator SimulateProjectile(float maxHeight) { float time = 0; // Calculate the vertex of the parabola (the highest point) Vector3 vertex = (startPoint + currentTarget) / 2 + Vector3.up * maxHeight; bool updatedTarget = false; while (time < travelTime) { time += Time.deltaTime; // Calculate the lerp parameter in [0, 1] float lerpParameter = time / travelTime; float heightParameter = 4 * (-lerpParameter * lerpParameter + lerpParameter); Vector3 parabolaPoint = Vector3.Lerp(startPoint, currentTarget, lerpParameter) + Vector3.up * maxHeight * heightParameter; // Rotate the arrow to face the next position RotateTowardsMovement(parabolaPoint); // Move the arrow to the next calculated position transform.position = parabolaPoint; if (Vector3.Distance(transform.position, currentTarget) < damageRange) { unitHealth?.TakeDamage(damage); break; } yield return null; } OnReachTarget(); } void RotateTowardsMovement(Vector3 nextPosition) { Vector3 directionOfMovement = nextPosition - transform.position; if (directionOfMovement != Vector3.zero) { Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(directionOfMovement.normalized); transform.rotation = rotation; } } void OnReachTarget() { Destroy(gameObject); } } }","output":"To adjust the \`Arrow\` class to meet the new requirements, we need to update the \`SimulateProjectile\` coroutine to account for a moving target and to modify the parabola calculations.

It's a typical rainy London afternoon. Emma and Sophie are seen bustling around their small kitchen. Emma is described as a straight-laced professional with an obsession for organization, while Sophie is the free-spirited creative type. Scene 1 (Apartment Kitchen): Emma and Sophie discuss their upcoming weekend trip to a writers' conference, which Sophie is excited about for networking, and Emma is attending as a speaker. Both anticipate staying in individual hotel rooms as arranged by the conference organizers. Scene 2 (Conference Hotel Lobby): The ladies arrive at the hotel and approach the check-in desk. After a series of comedic errors involving a computer glitch, a lost reservation, and a fully booked hotel due to a nearby music festival, they are informed that there's only one room left with a single king-size bed. They reluctantly agree to share the room, both insisting that it won't be a problem and they can handle the situation maturely. Scene 3 (Hotel Room): Their initial enthusiasm quickly dissolves into humorous contention, as they navigate sharing a small space. They set up humorous boundaries in the room, like using pillows to divide the bed, and establishing 'quiet hours' for reading and meditating. Scene 4 (Hotel Bar): Later that evening, they head to the bar to mingle with other conference attendees. Each of them meets a potential romantic interest but realizes they cannot bring them back to the room because of their shared situation. This leads to a series of playful but desperate attempts to keep their respective interests away from discovering their accommodation blunder. Scene 5 (Hotel Room, Late Night): Each of them returns at different times, trying not to wake the other. They end up in a whisper-fight about their failed romantic escapades, making a pact not to let the room situation affect their fun. Scene 6 (Conference, the Next Day): The next morning, with little sleep, they attend the conference together. They keep getting caught in escalating white lies to fellow attendees about their 'luxurious suite', leading to a hilarious scene where they have to dissuade a group from coming to their room for an impromptu after-conference gathering. Scene 7 (Hotel Room, Final Night): The night before they leave, determined to make the best of it, they finally break down the barriers, both physical and metaphorical, sharing heartfelt stories and laughing over the weekend's mishaps. They bond over their sharing experience and vow to request a two-bedroom suite for next year's conference. Scene 8 (Apartment Kitchen, Back Home): Back in their kitchen, they reflect on their trip, appreciating the comfort of their respective spaces but acknowledging the fun in the chaos. As they chat, a delivery arrives with a letter from the hotel, apologizing for the mistake and offering a complimentary stay in their finest two-bedroom suite for the next year's conference. They look at each other and burst into laughter, the screen freezes on their joyous faces. The episode would end with the credits rolling over outtakes and bloopers from the filming of the episode.

Личности могут испытывать неуверенность в своих правах и возможностях и заниматься самоцензурой, что негативно влияет на индивидуальное и коллективное развитие общества. 4. Неэффективное решение конфликтов: Неполная включенность личности в правовую систему может привести к неэффективному разрешению конфликтов и споров, так как люди не имеют доступа к адекватной помощи и защите. Это может создавать напряженность и неустойчивость в обществе. Для решения данной проблемы необходимо формирование эффективной правовой системы, которая будет основываться на принципах справедливости, прозрачности и независимости. Более того, личности должны быть включены в этот процесс путем обеспечения доступа к правовой помощи, правосудию и участия в принятии решений, касающихся их прав и интересов. Это позволит достичь более справедливого и устойчивого общества, где каждый человек будет иметь возможность заявить о своих правах и получить защиту от нарушений."},{"instruction":"Проблема реализации требований содержательного определения права, правового закона.","output":"Проблема реализации требований содержательного определения права и правового закона связана с тем, что эти понятия являются сложными и многогранными. Определение права и правового закона должно учитывать различные аспекты, такие как социальные, политические, этические и экономические факторы. Одной из проблем является неоднозначность определений права и правового закона. Различные школы юридической мысли имеют разные подходы и толкования этих понятий. Например, идеалистическая школа права считает, что право основывается на нравственности и справедливости, тогда как позитивистская школа права рассматривает право как систему норм, созданных государством. Еще одной проблемой является динамический характер права. Право постоянно развивается и изменяется в связи с изменением общественных отношений и потребностей. Это создает сложности при определении содержания права и правовых законов, так как они должны быть актуальными и способными адаптироваться к меняющимся обстоятельствам. Кроме того, существует проблема соотношения права с другими областями знания, такими как мораль, политика и экономика. Право часто пересекается с этими областями и не всегда можно четко определить границы между ними. Например, определение содержания права может зависеть от представлений о справедливости, которые могут различаться в зависимости от социальной, политической или экономической обстановки. Для решения проблемы реализации требований содержательного определения права и правового закона необходимо использовать комплексный подход, учитывая различные точки зрения и аспекты. Важно учесть исторический контекст, общественные потребности и ценности, а также научные и философские представления о праве. Такой подход позволит создать определение права и правового закона, которое будет учитывать все сложности и многообразие правовой системы."},{"instruction":"что будет если заряжать телефон менее мощной зарядкой pixel 7","output":"Если вы зарядите телефон Pixel 7 менее мощной зарядкой, чем предусмотрено оригинальной спецификацией устройства, то: 1. Заряжаться медленнее: Ваш Pixel 7 будет заряжаться медленнее, чем мог бы с использованием зарядного устройства рекомендованной мощности. Скорость зарядки напрямую зависит от мощности зарядного устройства (измеряется в амперах и вольтах). Если ампераж (или общая мощность в ваттах) вашей зарядки меньше, чем тот, на который рассчитан ваш Pixel 7, это приведет к увеличению времени, необходимого для полной зарядки аккумулятора. 2. Безопасность: Тем не менее, если зарядное устройство сертифицировано и безопасно для использования, зарядка более низкой мощности не должна причинить вред вашему устройству. Смартфоны обычно имеют встроенные схемы управления питанием, которые регулируют ток зарядки. 3. Совместимость: Важно также убедиться, что зарядное устройство совместимо с устройством Pixel 7 по типу разъема (например, USB-C). 4. Некоторые функции быстрой зарядки могут быть недоступны: Если ваш Pixel 7 поддерживает быструю зарядку с более высокой мощностью, при использовании менее мощного адаптера данные функции не будут активированы, и устройство будет заряжаться с более низкой скоростью. В общем, использование менее мощной зарядки просто означает, что вы зарядите телефон дольше, но это не должно привести к каким-либо повреждениям устройства, при условии, что зарядное устройство является качественным и соответствует стандартам безопасности."},{"instruction":"les couples redox suivant : Fe2+ (aq) / Fe (s) Li+ (aq) / Li (s) I2 (s) / I- (aq) 1) Parmi les atomes ci-dessus nommer les réducteurs. 2) Qu’est-ce qu’un réducteur ?","output":"1) Un couple redox est composé d’une forme oxydée et d’une forme réduite.

Вот некоторые возможные нарушения этого требования: 1. Игнорирование и недостаточное учет различных источников права. Правовая система состоит из различных источников права, таких как законы, судебные решения, прецеденты, международные договоры и т.д. Нарушение методологического требования заключается в неправильном или неадекватном восприятии и использовании этих источников, что может привести к искажению правовой системы и ее принципов. 2. Избирательное или необъективное применение правовых норм. Когда правовые нормы применяются субъективно или несбалансированно, это может приводить к нарушению методологического требования единства права. Например, если некоторые лица или группы получают преимущества или освобождения от применения некоторых норм, в то время как другие не получают их в тех же обстоятельствах, это может нарушать принцип равенства перед законом. 3. Несогласованность или противоречия между различными правовыми нормами. Если различные нормы права противоречат друг другу или несогласованы, это также нарушает методологическое требование единства права. Например, если одна норма запрещает действие, а другая разрешает его, это противоречие может создать путаницу и неопределенность в правовой системе. 4. Неправильное толкование и интерпретация правовых норм. Если правовые нормы неправильно толкуются или истолковываются, это может привести к искажению их значения и назначения. Например, если судья применяет норму неправильно или выбирает ее основываясь на своих субъективных взглядах, это нарушает методологическое требование единства права и может создать проблемы в правовой практике и справедливости. Эти и другие нарушения методологического требования единства права могут создавать проблемы в правовой системе, а также влиять на справедливость и соблюдение прав и свобод граждан.

Например, если юридические нормы предусматривают высокие штрафы за определенное правонарушение, но механизм реализации этих норм неэффективен (например, нет достаточного количества сотрудников правоохранительных органов для выявления и привлечения нарушителей), то может возникнуть ситуация, когда множество нарушителей остаются безнаказанными. В результате, правонарушители не испытывают должного страха перед наказанием, и эта юридическая норма теряет свою силу и эффективность. Также, некорректное соотношение между статистической совокупностью юридических норм и механизмом их реализации может привести к неправильному регулированию общественных отношений. Например, если юридические нормы запрещают определенное действие, но на практике нет возможности контролировать и наказывать за это действие, то такая норма оказывается бессмысленной и неэффективной. Таким образом, важно поддерживать соответствие и баланс между юридическими нормами и механизмом их реализации, чтобы регулирование общественных отношений было эффективным и справедливым. Это требует постоянного анализа и корректировки правовой системы, а также усовершенствования механизмов реализации правовых норм."},{"instruction":"Проблема формирования новой модели федеративного устройства России. Две крайности и методологические ошибки в разрешении этой проблемы. Способы и методы ее разрешения.","output":"Проблема формирования новой модели федеративного устройства России имеет свои особенности и вызывает различные точки зрения. Для ее решения существует две крайности и несколько методологических ошибок, которых нужно избегать. Первая крайность - централизация. Некоторые предлагают усилить роль федерального центра, снизить полномочия регионов и усилить вертикальную власть. Однако такой подход может привести к ущемлению прав и интересов регионов, а также создать напряженность в отношениях между центром и регионами. Вторая крайность - деконсолидация. Некоторые предлагают укрепить полномочия регионов до уровня независимости и разорвать связи с федеральным центром. Однако такой подход может привести к фрагментации страны и сложностям в управлении. Может возникнуть проблема формирования общей экономической, социальной и безопасностной политики. В процессе разрешения этой проблемы необходимо избегать методологических ошибок: 1. Игнорирование и недооценка идеи баланса. Необходимо искать компромиссные решения, которые учитывают и интересы центра, и интересы регионов. Россия должна стремиться к формированию модели федерации, в которой силы будут равномерно распределены между центром и регионами. 2. Отсутствие широкой общественной дискуссии и участия всех заинтересованных сторон. Процесс формирования новой модели федерации должен быть открытым и прозрачным. Необходимо обеспечить возможность высказывания мнений и участия граждан, экспертов, политиков и представителей регионов. Способы и методы разрешения этой проблемы включают: 1. Конституционные реформы. Внесение изменений в Конституцию Российской Федерации может помочь определить новую модель федерации, установить принципы и границы взаимодействия между центром и регионами. 2. Диалог и согласование интересов. Проведение конструктивного диалога между центром и регионами с учетом представления интересов всех сторон может способствовать разработке механизмов управления, которые учитывают особенности и потребности каждого региона. 3. Финансовая децентрализация. Перераспределение финансовых ресурсов между федеральным центром и регионами, а также усиление финансовой самостоятельности регионов позволит более равномерно распределить власть и развитие по всей стране. 4. Укрепление института местного самоуправления. Повышение роли и власти местных органов самоуправления может способствовать более эффективному управлению на местном уровне и учету особенностей различных регионов. В целом, решение проблемы формирования новой модели федеративного устройства России требует балансирования интересов, учета конституционных принципов и участия всех заинтересованных сторон. Этот процесс должен быть открытым, демократическим и направленным на достижение наилучшего компромиссного решения."},{"instruction":"У меня есть листовой материал Лист СВМПЭ 1000 на 1000 мм сколько из него получится прямоугольников размером 400 на 300 мм","output":"Для определения, сколько прямоугольников размером 400 на 300 мм можно получить из листа материала размером 1000 на 1000 мм, необходимо рассчитать площадь исходного листа и площадь одного прямоугольника. Затем нужно сравнить эти площади, учитывая возможные способы размещения прямоугольников на листе. Площадь листа СВМПЭ: 1000 мм * 1000 мм = 1 000 000 мм² Площадь одного прямоугольника размером 400 на 300 мм: 400 мм * 300 мм = 120 000 мм² Теоретически, если бы материал можно было использовать полностью без остатка, количество прямоугольников (N) можно было бы найти как: N = Площадь листа СВМПЭ / Площадь одного прямоугольника N = 1 000 000 мм² / 120 000 мм² N = 8.3333 В реальности, невозможно получить дробное количество прямоугольников, поэтому количество должно быть целым числом, и требуется учитывать потери на обрезки. Для оптимального использования материала можно попытаться разместить прямоугольники на листе в разном порядке: 1. Если расположить прямоугольники по длинной стороне листа (1000 мм) тремя рядами по 400 мм, то получится 3 * 2 = 6 прямоугольников без остатка, так как: 1000 мм / 400 мм = 2 (столбца по горизонтали) 1000 мм / 300 мм = 3 (рядов по вертикали) 2. Если расположить прямоугольники по короткой стороне листа (1000 мм) тремя рядами по 300 мм, то получится 3 * 3 = 9 прямоугольников, но будет использована только часть листа, так как: 1000 мм / 300 мм = 3 (столбца по горизонтали) 1000 мм / 400 мм = 2.5 (рядов по вертикали) Во втором случае выходит, что один ряд будет неполный, и мы не сможем получить целый девятый прямоугольник из-за того, что половина его высоты будет выходить за пределы листа. Таким образом, у нас получится максимум 8 прямоугольников целиком и неиспользованное пространство на листе, которое нельзя будет использовать эффективно для получения дополнительного прямоугольника размером 400 на 300 мм. Итак, максимальное количество прямоугольников размером 400 на 300 мм, которое можно получить из листа размером 1000 на 1000 мм, составляет 8 штук."},{"instruction":"","output":"Кажется, ваше сообщение пришло пустым.

Кевлар (ароматический полиамид) известен своими превосходными антибаллистическими свойствами и часто используется в бронежилетах и других защитных системах. Однако он может не полностью поглощать кинетическую энергию осколков и снарядов, и для усиления защитных характеристик часто используется в комбинации с другими материалами. Капролон (поликастилон UHMWPE - Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene) – это материал с высочайшей ударной вязкостью и хорошей устойчивостью к износу. Графитонаполненный капролон также имеет улучшенные антифрикционные свойства, но его способность поглощать и рассеивать удары осколков зависит от характеристик конкретного наполнителя и общей толщины слоя. СПЭВМ (сверхвысокомолекулярный полиэтилен) также имеет отличные ударопрочные характеристики, высокую износостойкость и химическую стойкость. Будучи одним из самых прочных термопластов, СПЭВМ может служить хорошим компонентом в защитных композитах. Для защиты от осколков снарядов часто требуется слоистая конструкция, использующая комбинацию нескольких материалов, чтобы обеспечить как поглощение, так и рассеивание ударной волны и защиту от проникновения. Каждый слой выполняет задачу защиты на определенной стадии взаимодействия с осколком: одни задерживают или рассеивают частицы, другие предотвращают дальнейшее проникновение. Определить, какой из материалов – капролон графитонаполненный или СПЭВМ – окажется лучшим выбором для вашего конкретного применения, можно, проведя соответствующие испытания на ударопрочность, прочность при растяжении, устойчивость к проникновению и другие релевантные параметры. Также необходимо учитывать факторы, такие как толщина слоев, требуемый вес изделия, стоимость материалов и условия, в которых изделие будет эксплуатироваться. Для наиболее обоснованного выбора стоит также проконсультироваться с производителем или поставщиком композитных материалов, или обратиться к специалисту в области баллистики и защитных материалов."},{"instruction":"Что прочнее углеродная вуаль или стеклоткань","output":"Прочность углеродной вуали и стеклоткани зависит от множества факторов, таких как тип волокон, способ их укладки, плотность материала и используемая смола для изготовления композита. Ниже приведен общий обзор характеристик обоих материалов. Углеродная вуаль, часто называемая углеродным волокном или карбоновым волокном, состоит из очень тонких волокон углерода. Углеродные волокна имеют исключительно высокую прочность при растяжении, высокий модуль упругости (жесткость), низкий вес и отличную устойчивость к усталостным нагрузкам. Благодаря этим свойствам углеродное волокно широко используется в аэрокосмической промышленности, спортивных товарах, автомобилестроении и других приложениях, где требуется максимальная прочность при минимальном весе. Стеклоткань, изготовленная из волокон стекла, также обладает высокой прочностью, хорошей химической стойкостью и отличной изоляционной способностью. Она более доступна по сравнению с углеродным волокном и обладает более высокой ударопрочностью и лучшей гибкостью. Стеклоткань широко используется в морской промышленности, строительстве, изготовлении лодок, автомобильной промышленности и во множестве других областей. Если сравнивать прямо \\"прочность\\" в смысле способности выдерживать нагрузки без разрушения, углеродные волокна, как правило, превосходят стекловолокно по прочности при растяжении и модулю упругости. Однако стекловолокно часто предпочтительнее в приложениях, где требуется более высокая ударопрочность и менее строгие требования к весу компонентов. Принимая во внимание стоимость, стеклоткань обычно дешевле, чем углеродная вуаль, что также является важным фактором при выборе материала для проекта. В заключение, если важнейшими критериями являются прочность и жесткость, то углеродная вуаль лучше подойдет. В случае, если требуется более ударопрочный материал, где прочность при растяжении и жесткость не являются основным приоритетом, стеклоткань может быть предпочтительнее."},{"instruction":"Вот я нашел просто Углеродная вуаль 50г/м², 1250мм (код_6887) и Стеклоткань 600 г/м биаксиальная (+45°/-45°) вот и хочу понять что прочнее как прослойка в композитном изделии для защиты от ударов, осколкови тп.","output":"Прочность композитного изделия, в которое входит прослойка, зависит от многих факторов, включая тип материала волокон, ориентацию волокон, матрицу (смолу), используемую для связывания волокон, а также от конструкции и технологии изготовления самого изделия. Углеродная вуаль с указанным весом 50 г/м² является очень легкой и обычно используется для поверхностных слоев в композитах, придавая гладкость и заканчивая внешний вид изделий. Она может обеспечивать некоторую дополнительную прочность, но в основном это не материал, который будет существенно увеличивать прочность композита. Вес 50 г/м² указывает на то, что вуаль очень тонкая и не предназначена для получения высокопрочных изделий. Биаксиальная стеклоткань с весом 600 г/м² и ориентацией волокон под углами +45°/-45°, наоборот, значительно толще и создана для обеспечения высокой прочности изделия. Особая биаксиальная ориентация волокон обеспечивает усиление в двух основных направлениях и помогает более эффективно распределять нагрузки в композитной конструкции, что делает её отличным выбором для усиление композитных изделий. Если вам необходимо выбрать между этими двумя материалами для защиты от ударов и осколков, то биаксиальная стеклоткань с весом 600 г/м² будет значительно более подходящим выбором. Такая ткань более тяжелая, но придаст композитному изделию гораздо большую ударопрочность и способность поглощать и рассеивать энергию удара или воздействие осколка, чем тонкая углеродная вуаль. Важно учесть, что в бронежилетах и защитных панелях применяются сложные многослойные композитные структуры, и нередко сочетают различные типы волокон, чтобы соединить их преимущества: углеродные волокна для жесткости и прочности, стекловолокно для толерантности к ударным нагрузкам, и другие специализированные материалы, такие как арамидный волокно (например, Kevlar) для антибаллистических свойств."},{"instruction":"United Nations excellent terms","output":"The United Nations (UN) is an international organization that was established in 1945, following the end of World War II.

Meanwhile an away team has found an ancient temple - except it's carved inexplicably half-way up the side of sheer rock wall...","output":"Title: \\"The Guardians' Secret\\" Teaser: The USS Enterprise-D is orbiting a picturesque planet known for its stunning rock formations and ancient ruins. The planet's surface is dominated by a massive cliff, known as the Ascent, which stretches high into the sky. The away team, led by Commander Riker, has been granted permission to investigate a recently discovered temple, a structure that seemingly defies the laws of physics, carved half-way up the sheer face of the Ascent. Act One: Counselor Deanna Troi awakens from a vivid dream filled with images of enigmatic winged humanoids who speak to her in riddles. They warn her to keep their existence a secret, whispering, \\"The time of revelation is not upon us.\\" Her dream is interrupted by an urgent call from Captain Picard, who informs her of the away team's upcoming mission. The away team, consisting of Riker, Data, Worf, and Dr. Crusher, beam down to the base of the Ascent, ready to scale its sheer cliffs to reach the temple. They find it odd that there's no clear path to the site, raising questions about who built it and how. Act Two: As the away team climbs, Troi continues to be plagued by her dreams, each vision revealing more about the winged beings. She senses that they are ancient and wise, yet feels an air of sadness and urgency. Unable to shake the feeling that her dreams are connected to the temple, she confides in Picard, who advises caution but encourages her to use her empathy to try and understand her visions better. On the Ascent, the away team encounters puzzling anti-gravity technology hidden within the cliff face—evidence of an advanced civilization. These gravity wells allow them to \\"ascend\\" the otherwise impassable cliff easily. With Dr. Crusher's archaeological expertise, they start piecing together the history of the temple, which seems to date back thousands of years, predating known habitation of the planet. Act Three: Troi, unable to stay idle, requests to join the away team. Once there, her presence seems to activate a dormant mechanism within the temple. The walls begin to glow, revealing holographic inscriptions that Data interprets as a chronicle of the winged people from Troi's visions: the Aetherians. The Enterprise is suddenly approached by an unidentifiable starship broadcasting an ancient distress signal matching Aetherian technology. The ship appears damaged, navigating hesitantly as if its crew had never encountered another vessel before. Act Four: Riker and Troi deduce that the Aetherians have been living in secrecy and the moments of Troi's visions align with the temple's activation. Troi feels the Aetherians' longing for the stars but also their fear of being discovered. Picard initiates contact with the alien vessel, extending diplomatic greetings and offering assistance. The alien ship, piloted by a descendant of the long-lost Aetherians, speaks of their society's collapse due to a past cataclysm and their protection pact with the temple—meant to keep their existence hidden until they were ready to rejoin the galaxy. Act Five: The Aetherian pilot agrees to beam down to the temple and reveals their species' ability to camouflage within their environment—the source of their secrecy. Troi's visions were an empathic connection initiated by their ancestral technology, a cry for help as they were finally ready to join the interstellar community. The episode concludes with the Aetherians formally introducing themselves to the Federation and expressing gratitude for the Enterprise's role in aiding their first contact. As they depart the planet, Troi reflects with Picard on the responsibility of knowledge and the importance of respecting cultures' wishes to remain hidden until they decide the time is right. As the Enterprise sets course for its next mission, Troi gazes at the stars with a newfound appreciation for the mysteries they hold, knowing that one day, other hidden beings may reveal themselves when the galaxy is ready to meet them."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Episode of Star Trek TNG - Data is playing chess but keeps loosing, He starts to wonder if he's missing something in his opponent. Meanwhile the Enterprise becomes involved in it's own strategy game as it tries to out-stealth a seemingly cloaked Romulan fleet probing Federation outposts..","output":"Title: \\"Pawn and Prejudice\\" Teaser: Lieutenant Commander Data is engaged in a game of 3D chess in Ten Forward with Lieutenant Barclay. Surprisingly, Data finds himself checkmated for the third consecutive game, causing him to question the infallibility of his computational capabilities. While the crew commends Barclay for his victories, Data is left contemplating the enigma of his unexpected losses. Act One: The USS Enterprise-D receives orders to investigate mysterious power surges detected near several Federation outposts close to the Neutral Zone. Suspecting Romulan activity, Captain Picard, aboard the Enterprise, is tasked with covert surveillance to ensure that the Romulans are not preparing for a stealth incursion. Data approaches Captain Picard before they set out on their mission, expressing his concerns about his recent chess losses and his inability to discern the patterns behind Barclay's strategies. Picard, intrigued, supports Data's quest for self-analysis but reminds him of the priority of their imminent mission. Act Two: As the Enterprise arrives near the Neutral Zone, tactical officer Lieutenant Worf detects faint energy displacements suggestive of Romulan cloaking technology. Commander La Forge and Worf work together to design a modified tachyon grid, aiming to detect any cloaked vessels within their vicinity without revealing the Enterprise's location. Data, meanwhile, begins to delve into the study of psychological tactics and the concept of bluffing in strategic games, wondering if understanding his opponent's mindset rather than relying solely on predictive algorithms might explain his shortcomings in the game of chess. Act Three: The tension escalates as the Enterprise deploys the tachyon grid, and a cat-and-mouse game ensues. Faint signs of cloaked Romulan ships flicker intermittently on the sensors, indicating that the Romulans are using advanced cloaking technology that periodically overcomes the tachyon grid. The crew realizes that they not only need to detect the fleet but also outmaneuver them using strategic countermeasures. Data returns to his match with Barclay, adopting a new approach by incorporating psychological strategies alongside his computational tactics. While playing, he suddenly grasps a deeper understanding of chess as not just a mere sequence of moves, but a game heavily influenced by the personality and style of his opponent. Act Four: The Enterprise plays a dangerous game of stealth with the Romulans, executing feints and false maneuvers to provoke a reaction. The Romulans, believing they've gained the upper hand, momentarily de-cloak to initiate a surprise attack, only to find themselves ensnared by the Enterprise's counter-strategy and surrounded by Starfleet reinforcements that were covertly summoned. Act Five: Confronted by the overwhelming Starfleet presence, the Romulans have no choice but to withdraw and resume peace negotiations to explain their incursions. Picard makes it clear that the Federation will always seek peace but will defend its borders with vigilant resolve. Data's new-found perspective allows him to finally defeat Barclay in a chess match. He expresses his gratitude to Barclay for providing him with such an invaluable learning opportunity. In discussing the outcome with Picard, Data reflects on the nature of unpredictability and intuition in both chess and diplomacy. The episode concludes with the Enterprise crew recognizing that a balance between calculated strategy and an understanding of the opponent is crucial, whether facing off across a chessboard or the vastness of space. As the ship warps away to their next adventure, Data is left contemplating the depth and richness of experiences that stretch beyond pure logic."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Кроме того, предоставление точных инвестиционных советов требует глубокого анализа текущего состояния рынка, изучения финансовых отчетов компаний, новостей, экономической ситуации и большого спектра других переменных. Инвестиционные решения всегда должны приниматься индивидуально и с полным осознанием связанных с этим рисков. Тем не менее, в качестве общего совета, если вы заинтересованы в покупке акций на российском рынке или любом другом, важно рассмотреть следующие критерии: 1. Финансовое состояние компании: изучите баланс, отчет о прибылях и убытках, отчет о движении денежных средств. 2. Перспективы отрасли: оцените, в какой отрасли работает компания и каковы перспективы этой отрасли в будущем. 3. Оценка компании: сравните цену акций с доходами, активами и потенциалом роста. Используйте коэффициенты, такие как P/E (цена к прибыли), P/S (цена к выручке), P/B (цена к бухгалтерской стоимости) и другие. 4. Новости и события: следите за актуальными новостями, связанными с выбранными компаниями, так как они могут оказывать непосредственное влияние на цену акций. 5. Технический анализ: используйте технический анализ для изучения трендов и паттернов на графиках цен акций, чтобы определить потенциальные точки входа и выхода на рынок.

La funzione \`OnInit()\`, come hai scritto, viene chiamata una sola volta quando l'EA viene caricato su un grafico e serve per l'inizializzazione. Il fatto che tu ritorni \`INIT_SUCCEEDED\` significa che il tuo EA è stato inizializzato correttamente. Se il tuo EA funziona nel Strategy Tester ma non nel trading reale, potrebbero esserci molteplici ragioni, incluso ma non limitato a: 1. **Ambiente di trading reale differisce da quello del Tester**: Il trading reale può avere slittamenti (slippage), differenze di spread, requisiti di margine, o ritardi di esecuzione che non sono presenti o sono simulati nel Strategy Tester. 2. **Errore nella funzione \`OrderSend()\`:** Potrebbero esserci errori nelle richieste di invio degli ordini nel trading reale che non si verificano nel tester. Verifica che tu stia gestendo correttamente gli errori ritornati dalla funzione \`GetLastError()\` e che tu sia in conformità con le restrizioni del broker (per esempio, distanza minima dal prezzo corrente per lo stop loss e il take profit). 3. **Autorizzazioni di trading**: Assicurati che nelle opzioni del terminale MT4 l'EA sia autorizzato a fare trading. Questo include la verifica che i pulsanti \\"AutoTrading\\" siano abilitati e che vuoi consentire trading dal vivo nelle impostazioni dell'EA. 4. **Problemi di connettività**: Se il tuo EA ha bisogno di segnali o dati esterni e la tua connettività è interrotta o inconsistente, potrebbero esserci problemi nel fare trading dal vivo. 5. **Differenze nei dati storici**: I dati utilizzati nel Strategy Tester possono non essere precisi o possono differire dai dati in tempo reale, influenzando così le decisioni di trading dell'EA. 6. **Differenze nella gestione degli ordini**: Il codice che gestisce gli ordini in \`OnTick()\` potrebbe avere delle logiche o dei controlli che funzionano nel tester ma non nel contesto di mercato reale. 7. **Configurazione dell'indicatore personalizzato**: Assicurati che il tuo indicatore personalizzato \\"ZZZZZ\\" sia presente nella piattaforma MT4 e configurato correttamente. Inoltre, verifica che i parametri che passi a \`iCustom()\` corrispondano a quelli richiesti dall'indicatore. Per diagnosticare e risolvere il problema, ti suggerisco di: - Aggiungere una maggiore registrazione (logging) tramite la funzione \`Print()\`, per tracciare cosa succede in tempo reale e identificare dove l'esecuzione differisce dalle aspettative. - Controllare il journal o i log del terminale MT4 per eventuali messaggi di errore o avvisi. - Testare l'EA in un conto demo in tempo reale, che più si avvicina alle condizioni di trading del conto reale, anziché nel solo Strategy Tester. Inoltre, verifica sempre le linee guida e i requisiti specifici del tuo broker per il trading automatizzato, poiché alcuni broker potrebbero avere delle restrizioni o delle impostazioni particolari che influenzano il comportamento degli EA."},{"instruction":"è qualcosa nel codice. proponi delle modifiche","output":"Per procedere con le modifiche, iniziamo con alcuni punti chiave che potrebbero causare problemi nel trading reale: 1. **Gestione degli Errori**: Implementa una gestione degli errori più approfondita per capire dove potrebbe riscontrarsi il problema. 2. **Controllo dello Slippage**: Aggiungi un parametro di slittamento (\\"slippage\\") quando invii ordini di mercato per tener conto delle variazioni del prezzo durante l'esecuzione dell'ordine. 3. **Normalizzazione dei Prezzi**: Assicurati che i prezzi siano normalizzati correttamente in base al numero di cifre decimali del simbolo di trading. 4. **Verifica della Connessione**: Potresti voler verificare che ci sia una connessione valida prima di tentare un'operazione di trading. 5. **Assegnazione di un Magic Number**: Alloca un magic number univoco agli ordini gestiti dall'EA per evitare conflitti con gli ordini manuali o da altri EA.

Tuttavia, possiamo esaminare alcuni aspetti che spesso differiscono tra gli EA e che possono causare il problema di funzionamento solo nel tester e non nel trading reale: 1. **Logica di Trading**: Ogni EA ha la sua logica di trading basata su specifici indicatori o condizioni di mercato. Se un altro EA sta funzionando correttamente nel trading reale, potrebbe dipendere da come interpreta i segnali e gestisce le operazioni di trading. 2. **Gestione degli Errori**: La gestione degli errori può influire su come un EA si comporta quando incontra problemi come slittamento (slippage), requisiti di margine, o connettività. 3. **Parametri degli Ordini**: La modalità di impostazione degli ordini, incluso lo slippage, la distanza minima per stop loss e take profit, e la dimensione del lotto, può variare tra gli EA e influenzare il loro comportamento nel trading reale. 4. **Modalità di Esecuzione**: Gli EA possono utilizzare diversi metodi di esecuzione come ordini a mercato (OrderSend), ordini pendenti (OrderSend con OP_BUYSTOP, OP_SELLSTOP, ecc.), o la modifica di ordini esistenti (OrderModify). 5. **Magic Number**: Un EA può utilizzare un magic number per identificare i propri ordini, mentre altri possono non utilizzarlo, il che può causare interferenze con altri trade. 6. **Sincronizzazione e Timing**: Il timing delle attività di trading, incluso il rilevamento di nuovi tick e l'apertura/chiusura di ordini, può differire tra gli EA. 7. **Ambiente del Broker**: Ogni broker ha il proprio ambiente con regole specifiche, spread, e potrebbe avere requisiti unici per l'esecuzione degli EA. Per identificare le differenze e risolvere i problemi, puoi: - **Confrontare i log**: Esamina i log del terminal per vedere messaggi di errore o warning quando esegui entrambi gli EA. - **Debugging**: Aggiungi istruzioni di stampa (Print) nel codice per seguire il flusso di esecuzione e le variabili. - **Tester vs. Reale**: Controlla le differenze nel comportamento tra il Strategy Tester e il trading reale. - **Consultazione con il Broker**: Verifica con il broker se ci sono restrizioni particolari che influenzano l'esecuzione dell'EA. Se hai accesso al codice di un altro EA che funziona correttamente nel trading reale, confronta la logica di trading, la gestione degli ordini, e la gestione degli errori per identificare le differenze chiave.

Questo serve per assicurarsi di utilizzare i prezzi più attuali disponibili. Considera di aggiungere questa chiamata al tuo codice prima dell'esecuzione degli ordini. 2. **Verifica e Chiusura degli Ordini:** Prima di decidere di aprire un nuovo ordine, l'EA controlla e chiude gli ordini esistenti che corrispondono a condizioni opposte. Ciò assicura che non ci siano conflitti o esposizioni non desiderate sul mercato. 3. **ECN Broker Supporto:** Viene fatta una distinzione tra broker ECN e non-ECN, e nel caso di ECN è stata inserita una logica specifica che invia prima l'ordine senza stop loss e take profit, modificandoli poi con la funzione \`OrderModify()\` una volta che l'ordine è stato eseguito. Se il tuo codice non considera questo e il tuo broker è ECN, potrebbero verificarsi dei problemi nell'invio degli ordini. 4. **Controllo Informazioni sul Display:** L'EA ha una funzione di visualizzazione delle informazioni che se disattivata può fermare l'EA dall'esecuzione di operazioni non necessarie. 5. **Diverse strategie di Trading:** La strategia di trading si basa sulle intersezioni di due medie mobili e sul concetto di apertura di un ordine solo quando non ci sono ordini aperti dalla direzione opposta. Bisogna notare che questa strategia è abbastanza semplice e potrebbe non essere efficace senza ulteriori filtri o condizioni. Per adattare il tuo EA basandosi sul secondo, considera di integrare le seguenti modifiche: - Aggiungi \`RefreshRates()\` per assicurarti di lavorare con il prezzo più recente. - Implementa un controllo per chiudere gli ordini esistenti che non sono più in linea con la strategia corrente prima di inviare nuovi ordini. - Se stai facendo trading con un broker ECN, adatta la logica di invio dell'ordine e la gestione di stop loss e take profit di conseguenza. - Reintegra un sistema di visualizzazione delle informazioni che può aiutarti in fase di debugging o durante l'uso in tempo reale. - Considera la semplicità della strategia di trading e se sia necessario aggiungere ulteriori filtri o condizioni per generare segnali di trading più robusti. Le differenze nel trading reale e nel tester potrebbero essere ancora legate a problemi che non sono visibili nel codice, come impostazioni del terminale, condizioni di mercato impreviste o restrizioni del broker. Pertanto, è importante convalidare le modifiche in un ambiente di test prima dell'uso reale."},{"instruction":"anche questo funziona perfettamente #property copyright \\"trevone\\" #property link \\"Milestone 5.1 EURUSD 5min\\" #define MAGIC 20130719 bool NewSession=true;

Ci sono diversi aspetti in questo EA che potrebbero contribuire alla sua efficacia nel trading reale, che potrebbero essere assenti o gestiti diversamente nel tuo EA. Esaminiamo alcune delle caratteristiche chiave: 1. **Gestione del Money Management (MM):** L'EA sembra implementare avanzate regole MM, compresi controlli per il livello di margine minimo (\`MinMarginLevel\`), calcolo della dimensione del lotto in base alla marginazione libera (\`MarginUsage\` e \`marginCalculate()\`), e aggiuste dinamiche alla dimensione del commercio e alla quantità di patrimonio immobiliare (\`accountLimit\` e \`accountReserve\`). 2. **Archiviazione e gestione Milestones:** L'EA traccia il progresso del conto di trading attraverso \\"milestones\\" usando file esterni; salva e legge il progresso di trading passato. Quando raggiunge un certo livello di equità, ciò potrebbe influenzare il comportamento di trading. 3. **Frattali e Indicatori:** Usa i frattali per determinare livelli chiave di resistenza e supporto e combina diverse indicatori (ATR, ADX, MA) per fare considerazioni sul trend e sul mercato range-bound. 4. **Ordini Backup System:** Possiede una logica di trading di backup che entra in gioco in determinate condizioni di mercato o quando il sistema di trading principale non è attivo. 5. **Controllo slittamento (Slippage):** L'EA adatta dinamicamente lo slippage basato sulla volatilità del mercato misurata dall'ATR, il che può ridurre le perdite dovute allo slittamento in mercati volatili. 6. **Gestione degli ordini:** Implementa molteplici meccanismi per chiudere gli ordini, come il chiudere il trade con la maggiore perdita (\`closeLargestLoss()\`) o basati sui profitti correnti. 7. **Funzionamento a sessioni:** Distingue tra sessioni di trading, permettendo di resettare o persistere lo stato del trading attraverso i riavvii dell'EA o la piattaforma di trading. 8. **Trading Flessibile:** Permette al trader di interrompere o continuare il trading (flag \`ContinueTrading\`) e gestisce un indicatore per sapere se tutti gli ordini devono essere chiusi (flag \`CloseAll\`). 9. **Interfaccia Utente:** Visualizza molte informazioni sullo stato dell'account di trading in tempo reale attraverso il \`Comment()\` sulla grafico del terminale MT4. 10. **Gestione Multilivello:** Considera diversi livelli di stop e di profitto e si adegua in base al criterio di trading selezionato e al livello di rischio associato a quella serie di ordini. Queste funzionalità sono indicative di un EA che è stato affinato per il trading reale e probabilmente ha subito un'ampia fase di testing e ottimizzazione. Ogni EA è diverso e la presenza o assenza di queste caratteristiche può significativamente influenzare il suo successo nel mercato reale rispetto al tester di strategie.

Il codice contiene diverse funzioni \\"stub\\" (quelle senza un corpo funzionale) che devono essere compilate dall'utente con logiche di trading specifiche, come quelle per l'ingresso e l'uscita dal mercato, la gestione del trailing stop, e il calcolo di stop loss e take profit dinamici. Ecco alcune caratteristiche distintive di questo template: 1. **Struttura di base per un EA**: Il template fornisce una struttura di base per la creazione di un EA senza implementare specifici algoritmi di trading. La logica per le decisioni di ingresso, uscita e gestione dell'ordine deve essere inserita dall'utilizzatore nel codice. 2. **Gestione del Risparmio**: Include input variabili per la gestione del rischio come la dimensione delle posizioni (fissa o basata sul rischio calcolato). 3. **Orari di trading**: Possiede impostazioni per limitare le operazioni di trading a certe ore del giorno, legate all'orario del server del broker. 4. **Gestione degli ordini**: Ha una routine dettagliata per la gestione degli ordini, inclusi il conteggio degli ordini aperti e la chiusura degli ordini sulla base di segnali di uscita. 5. **Parametri di Stop loss e Take profit**: Dispone di input per la configurazione degli stop loss e take profit, inclusa la possibilità di configurarli come fissi o calcolati automaticamente. 6. **Trailing stop**: Include l'opzione per un trailing stop, che deve essere personalizzato con la propria logica all'interno della funzione \`ExecuteTrailingStop\`. 7. **Riprovare gli ordini**: Implementa un meccanismo di ritentativo per inviare gli ordini in caso di errore durante l'esecuzione della prima volta. 8. **Calcolo della dimensione delle posizioni**: Il template comprende una funzionalità per calcolare la dimensione delle posizioni in base al saldo del conto, all'equità o al margine libero. 9. **Estensibilità**: Il codice è progettato per essere esteso con implementazioni personalizzate, rendendolo adatto a un'ampia varietà di strategie di trading. 10. **Logging e gestione degli errori**: Include la gestione degli errori e la registrazione (logging) delle attività, che sono essenziali per il debug e l'ottimizzazione di un EA. Qualsiasi EA, compreso questo template, può avere o meno successo nel trading reale in base all'efficacia delle logiche di trading integrate nell'EA da parte dell'utente. Un aspetto chiave per fare trading in modo efficace è assicurarsi di avere un'accurata comprensione dei meccanismi dei mercati, robustezza nei modelli di trading, e rigoroso controllo del rischio. Se stai progettando di sviluppare il tuo EA personalizzato utilizzando questo template, ti consiglierei fortemente di inserire algoritmi di trading collaudati, validare ciascuna strategia attraverso il backtesting su periodi di tempo storici ampi, e sempre iniziare con il trading su un conto demo prima di mettere a rischio capitale reale."},{"instruction":"ci deve essere una funzione che manca nel mio codice originale","output":"Dalla revisione del tuo EA originale e del confronto con altri frammenti di codice e il template di EA, alcuni aspetti possono spiegare i motivi del mancato funzionamento del tuo EA nel trading reale. Qui di seguito una lista di possibili mancanze o differenze: 1. **Gestione degli Errori**: Potresti non gestire tutti i potenziali errori di trading. Il template fornisce un esempio su come gestire gli errori, ritentare operazioni di trading se queste falliscono, e come loggare gli errori per analizzare cosa non va. 2. **Riconnessioni e Ripristini**: In alcuni EA, ci sono logiche per gestire disconnessioni temporanee o ripristino dopo riavvii del terminal. Ad esempio, il secondo EA che hai fornito salva lo stato dell'EA in un file esterno che può essere letto al riavvio. 3. **Aggiornamenti Dinamici**: Potresti non avere logiche per aggiornare gli ordini con nuovi stop loss o take profit (o altre proprietà) dinamicamente basandoti su condizioni di mercato che cambiano. 4. **Gestione della Dimensione degli Ordini**: Il tuo codice utilizza una lot size fissa, mentre alcuni EA includono la gestione del rischio e il calcolo della dimensione degli ordini basata sul saldo del conto e sul rischio percentuale per ogni trade. 5. **Verifica della Connettività**: In alcuni EA viene eseguita una verifica della connettività prima di eseguire operazioni di trading. ad esempio, potresti aver bisogno di controllare la funzione \`IsConnected()\` per assicurarti che il tuo EA sia connesso con il server del broker prima di tentare di eseguire gli ordini. 6. **Limitazioni sugli Orari di Trading**: Verifica che il tuo EA consenta il trading durante le ore di trading consentite dal broker e che non ci siano restrizioni orarie che lo stanno bloccando. 7. **Controllo Spread**: Se il tuo EA non verifica lo spread prima di inviare un ordine, potresti essere impedito all'apertura di nuovi ordini o alla chiusura di ordini esistenti se lo spread è troppo alto, specialmente durante momenti di alta volatilità. 8. **Funzioni di Trailing Stop**: Se il tuo EA non include una logica per il trailing stop personalizzato o integrato, perderebbe un metodo dinamico per proteggere i profitti e limitare le perdite. Inoltre, è essenziale assicurarsi che il tuo EA abbia le autorizzazioni necessarie per eseguire trades (es. \`Allow live trading\` sia attivo nelle impostazioni dell'EA). Considera anche di rivedere i messaggi nel tab “Experts” o “Journal” nella MT4 per eventuali errori riportati quando l'EA è in esecuzione. Per migliorare il tuo EA, inizia implementando logiche solide per il controllo degli errori e delle condizioni di mercato, poi gradualmente aggiungi funzionalità più avanzate ispirandoti a codici di EA che sono noti per funzionare bene nel trading reale. Testa sempre ampiamente ogni cambiamento in un ambiente sicuro prima del deployment nel trading dal vivo."},{"instruction":"il mio ea non scrive nulla nel diario dopo \\"load succefully\\". non c'è nessun errore ma non funziona","output":"Se il tuo EA non mostra messaggi di errore nel tab \\"Experts\\" o \\"Journal\\" di MT4 dopo il messaggio \\"loaded successfully\\", e non esegue scambi, potrebbe essere il risultato di una o più delle seguenti cause: # 1. Condizioni di Mercato Il tuo EA potrebbe specularizzare un'analisi di mercato che non ha ancora coinciso con la realtà del mercato dal momento del caricamento. Es. potrebbe aspettare una specifica formazione di candele o un segnale da un indicatore che non si è ancora verificato. # 2. Controllo degli ordini Potresti aver programmato il tuo EA per non fare trading se ci sono già ordini aperti o in base ad altri criteri che non vengono soddisfatti. # 3. Operatività Oraria Se il tuo EA è programmato per operare solo durante specifiche ore di trading e tali orarie non sono state raggiunte, non effettuerà scambi. # 4. Spread Il tuo EA potrebbe aver configurato un filtro di spread che non permette di fare trading se lo spread è troppo elevato. # 5. Permessi di Trading Assicurati che il pulsante \\"AutoTrading\\" sia attivato su MT4 e che nelle proprietà dell'EA la casella \\"Allow live trading\\" sia selezionata. # 6. Problemi di Connessione Se il tuo EA necessita di dati o connessioni esterne per generare segnali di trading e queste connessioni sono assenti o difettose, potrebbe non essere in grado di fare scambi. # 7. Proprietà del broker I broker hanno specifiche restrizioni per trading automatico, inclusi limiti al numero di operazioni simultanee per conto, margini, e altro. Contatta il tuo broker o rivedi le sue linee guida per assicurarti che il tuo EA sia conformi. Per diagnosticare questi e altri problemi, consiglio di: - **Log Aggiuntivi**: Aggiungi ulteriori messaggi di \`Print()\` nel tuo EA per tracciare il flusso di esecuzione e le condizioni di ogni parte critica del codice. Questo può aiutarti a identificare perché l'EA non sta apportando operazioni. \`\`\`mql4 Print(\\"Verifica condizioni di ingresso...\\"); // Inserisci i tuoi controlli di condizione qui if (condizione_di_ingresso) { Print(\\"Condizione di ingresso soddisfatta, tentativo di apertura ordine.\\"); } else { Print(\\"Condizione di ingresso non soddisfatta.\\"); } \`\`\` - **Test Script**: Crea uno script di test per verificare la logica dei tuoi segnali e dell'esecuzione degli ordini senza dover aspettare condizioni specifiche del mercato. - **Modalità di Debug**: Utilizza la modalità di debugging disponibile in MetaEditor per passo-passo debugging attraverso gli ordini e le condizioni logiche. - **Consultazione con il Broker**: Verifica con il tuo broker se ci sono impostazioni specifiche o restrizioni per il trading automatico. Ricorda che il debug di un EA può essere un processo complesso e che spesso è necessario un approccio metodico per identificare e risolvere i problemi."},{"instruction":"Специфическая природа научной основы правовой технологии.

Принцип научной основы: понятие \\"правовой природы вещей\\", конкретной социальной, правовой ситуации и правовых институтов, их специфической природы. Методологическое значение содержательного определения права.","output":"Диалектическая природа научной основы правовой технологии означает, что она основана на использовании принципов диалектики, которые позволяют анализировать и понимать противоречия и взаимосвязь между различными аспектами правовой системы. Принцип научной основы включает в себя понятие \\"правовой природы вещей\\". Это означает, что каждый объект или явление в правовой системе имеет свою собственную природу, связанную с его специфическими характеристиками и свойствами. Например, юридическое понятие \\"собственность\\" имеет свою собственную природу, отличающуюся от природы, скажем, \\"договора\\". Кроме того, научная основа включает в себя анализ конкретной социальной и правовой ситуации. Это означает, что для понимания и анализа правовой технологии необходимо учитывать конкретную социальную, экономическую и политическую обстановку, в которой она применяется. Например, правовая технология, связанная с регулированием торговли, может меняться в зависимости от экономического контекста. Также при анализе правовой технологии необходимо учитывать специфическую природу правовых институтов. Каждый правовой институт имеет свою собственную функцию и специфические характеристики. Например, правовой институт \\"суд\\" имеет свою специфическую природу, связанную с его ролью в разрешении споров и принятии правовых решений. Содержательное определение права имеет методологическое значение, так как оно позволяет определить сущность и смысл права в контексте правовой технологии. Определение права, основанное на его содержании, может помочь в анализе, прогнозировании и разработке правовых институтов и методов их применения.

Принцип объективности, соответствия закона объективным правовым реалиям.","output":"Принцип объективности в правовой технологии гласит о необходимости обеспечения соответствия закона объективным правовым реалиям. Это означает, что законодательство должно учитывать и отражать реальное положение вещей, общественные отношения, условия жизни и потребности граждан. Этот принцип заключается в том, что нормы права должны основываться на фактических данных и объективных обстоятельствах, а не на субъективных предпочтениях или мнениях законодателя. Закон должен отражать реальность, иначе он может оказаться неэффективным и несправедливым, а его применение вызовет проблемы и нарушит гарантии прав граждан. Принцип объективности также требует, чтобы закон был ясным, однозначным и понятным для всех участников правовых отношений. Это позволяет избежать неопределенности и различных толкований закона, а также обеспечить предсказуемость и справедливость в правовом регулировании. При разработке и применении правовой технологии необходимо учитывать социально-экономические, политические и культурные особенности общества. Законы должны соответствовать запросам и потребностям граждан, а также учитывать изменения в общем общественном контексте.

Правовая система должна взаимодействовать с обществом и решать конфликты на основе правовых норм. Принцип эволюционности изменения и построения правовых институтов и систем предполагает, что правовая система должна быть способна развиваться и приспосабливаться к изменяющимся потребностям общества. Право должно быть устойчивым к внешним изменениям, но гибким внутри себя. Оно должно иметь механизмы, позволяющие вносить изменения в правовые институты и системы, чтобы они отражали современные реалии и потребности общества. Оба принципа – активности и автономности, а также эволюционности изменения и построения правовых институтов и систем – являются важными составляющими правовой системы и помогают ей выполнять свои функции эффективно.

In the center, ALEXI, an imposing figure with long, tangled brown hair cascading over his shoulders, sits on a worn-out armchair. His face is painted with corpse makeup, stark black and white designs making him look like a fierce warrior from a bygone era. Metal music blares from a stereo in the corner, aggressive guitar riffs and thunderous drumming filling the air. Alexi, however, is a stark contrast to the chaos around him. The music softens to a melodic interlude as the camera zooms in on Alexi's tender expression. He extends a tattooed arm towards a small, secure pen where a FLUFFY BUNNY, stark white against the dark surroundings, nibbles on some hay. The bunny's pink nose twitches as it senses its owner's presence. ALEXI (gently) Hey there, Snowball. How's my little circle pit warrior today? The bunny, SNOWBALL, hops over to Alexi with a skip in its step. It looks up at him with bright, innocuous eyes. Alexi reaches into his battle vest pocket and pulls out a freshly washed carrot. He holds it out to Snowball who immediately begins nibbling on the treat with delight. ALEXI (speaking softly) That's it, little fella. Eat up. Gotta keep your strength up if you're gonna mosh with the big buns. The heavy metal breakdown resumes, and Alexi raises his fist into the air, headbanging gently in rhythm with the music. Snowball, undisturbed by the sonic assault, continues munching on the carrot, its ears flopping lightly to the vibrations. We get a CLOSE-UP of Alexi's face softening with a genuine smile. He reaches into the pen, gently scratching behind Snowball’s ears. The bunny leans into the gesture, eyes slowly closing in contentment. ALEXI (whispering) Not all metal is mayhem, my furry friend. There's beauty in the darkness, harmony in the chaos... just like you and me. Snowball finishes the carrot and hops onto Alexi's lap, seeking more affection. Alexi cradles Snowball with one hand while throwing up the horns with the other, as the camera slowly pulls away. The music transitions to an acoustic outro, mirroring the unexpected yet heartwarming bonding session between the metalhead and his bunny.

This quirky slice of history from the Vietnam War era exemplifies the lengths to which someone might go to provide their friends with a small taste of home. During the late 1960s, while the Vietnam War was at its height, many young Americans found themselves drafted and sent overseas to fight in a war that was increasingly unpopular at home. As the war raged on, a sense of division grew within the United States, bringing about an incredible tension between those who supported the war effort and those who didn't. John Donahue, a former merchant seaman and then a civilian, was living in the Inwood neighborhood of New York City. Inwood, like many communities across the country, had seen many of its sons sent off to fight in Southeast Asia. One night in 1967, while drinking at Doc Fiddler's Bar on 207th Street, the talk among the patrons turned to the war and the declining morale of the troops. As the discussion continued, someone suggested that what the soldiers really needed was a beer from back home. Seizing on what was probably meant as a lighthearted idea, John Donahue set out on an extraordinary mission: to personally deliver beer to his neighborhood friends serving in Vietnam. With a sense of purpose and a good deal of naivete, Donahue managed to hitch a ride on a cargo ship heading for Vietnam under the guise of being a merchant seaman. He packed a small duffel bag and a green U.S. military ammo case with American beer – Pabst Blue Ribbon, to be exact – a treasure that he knew would be greatly appreciated by his friends in the combat zone. Upon reaching Vietnam, Donahue set out to find his friends, armed with a list of names and last-known locations that would guide him through a conflict zone. Remarkably, he managed to locate each of his friends, traveling through war-torn areas, often encountering surprised and amused military personnel along the way. His journey was fraught with danger as he navigated areas of active conflict, but his mission of camaraderie seemed to charm everyone he met. Each encounter with a friend was a moment of pure joy and disbelief, as they never expected to see a familiar face from back home, let alone in such extraordinary circumstances. Donahue's audacious beer run made him a fleeting legend among the troops he visited, providing them with a much-needed momentary reprieve from the horrors of war. John Donahue's experience was rediscovered many years later, and his story was shared in books and documentaries, showcasing an unrivaled act of loyalty and friendship. While many acts of heroism and sacrifice were witnessed during the Vietnam War, Donahue's tale stands out for its sheer improbability and heartwarming intent. His adventure demonstrates the lengths to which someone might go for their friends, proving that sometimes the comforts of home only require the courage of one person willing to go the extra mile – or in Donahue's case, thousands of miles with a case of beer. The unbelievable beer run of John \\"Chickie\\" Donahue remains not only a testament to the bonds of friendship but also a symbol of the common humanity that persists, even in the most divisive and destructive of times."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

The cost of insuring your 2008 Nissan Altima and 2012 Chevrolet Cruze LS Sedan FWD in Canada would depend on a variety of factors such as: 1. Your Province/Territory: Insurance regulations and costs vary significantly across Canada, with provinces like British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan having government-run insurance programs through ICBC, MPI, and SGI respectively, and others like Ontario and Alberta predominantly using private insurers, which can result in different pricing structures. 2. Your Driving Record: A clean driving record without accidents or tickets will generally result in lower insurance premiums. 3. Your Age and Driving Experience: Young and new drivers typically pay more due to their higher risk profile. 4. Usage: The amount you drive, whether your cars are for pleasure or commuting, and the distances involved can affect your rates. 5. Coverage Options: The level of coverage — from basic liability to comprehensive and collision — plus any additional coverages like roadside assistance, will influence the cost. 6. Deductible Amount: A higher deductible (the amount you pay out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in after a claim) can lower your premiums, but means more risk on your side. 7. The Vehicle Itself: Certain makes and models are cheaper to insure due to their safety ratings, repair costs, and the likelihood of being stolen. 8. Discounts: You may be eligible for discounts for multiple vehicles, being a long-time customer, having multiple policies (bundling), or installing anti-theft devices. To find out the exact cost, you should contact insurance companies directly or use online comparison tools where you can enter your personal and vehicle information to get a more accurate quote. For a ballpark estimate, you can expect to pay anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 per year per vehicle, but remember this is a very rough range. In some cases, particularly with a clean driving record and less expensive coverage options, costs could be lower; if you live in a high-premium area or require extensive coverage, costs could be higher. Consulting with an insurance broker, as you are one yourself, or using resources tailored for insurance brokers may help to better understand the insurance landscape for your specific situation and provide your clients with accurate quotes."},{"instruction":"Continue but with the following information. 1. This call is from Ontario, Canada. 2. I have a clean driving record, I haven't experienced any tickets yet. 3. I am 22 years of age, 3 years of driving experience. 4. Unknown amount of hours I have driven, it is usually for commuting, although occasionally it is for work-unrelated travel. 5. Basic. 6. Maybe 500 or 1000. 7. 2008 Nissan Altima 8. No, no discounts.","output":"With the additional information provided, we can refine our approximation for insurance costs somewhat, but please remember that these will still only be ballpark figures. For a more accurate quote, you must reach out to insurance providers in Ontario with your specific details. 1. **Ontario, Canada**: Ontario typically has higher insurance rates compared to the rest of Canada due to the density of vehicles, higher instances of insurance fraud, and more. 2. **Clean Driving Record**: As someone with a clean driving record, you should expect to see lower rates than someone with tickets or accidents. 3. **22 Years of Age, 3 Years Driving Experience**: Being under the age of 25 typically results in higher premiums because younger drivers are considered higher risk. However, having three years of driving experience does work in your favor, as it moves you past the absolute highest rates that are often reserved for new drivers. 4. **Commuting & Occasional Use**: Commuting typically adds to the cost versus pleasure use because of the increased risk associated with driving during peak traffic times. 5. **Basic Coverage**: Choosing basic liability coverage (which is mandatory in Ontario) will be your least expensive option compared to more comprehensive plans. However, in Ontario, even the basic coverage includes some level of statutory accident benefits, uninsured automobile coverage, and direct compensation property damage (DCPD). 6. **Deductibles**: Whether you choose a 500 or 1000 deductible can have a notable effect on your premiums. The higher deductible may lead to lower monthly premiums, but you would have to pay more out of pocket if you were to file a claim. 7. **2008 Nissan Altima**: Older vehicles like your 2008 Altima typically cost less to insure because they have lower replacement values. However, safety ratings and the cost to repair the vehicle can also play a role. Given these factors, and the age of your vehicles which tends to lower premiums, your monthly premiums could range from around 150 to 300 or more per vehicle. Therefore, annually, you might be looking at a range from 1,800 to 3,600 or more for each car. Please use these numbers with caution and consult multiple insurance providers for actual quotes. Rates can vary widely between companies as they weigh factors differently and offer different discounts which you may still qualify for, such as for being a graduate of a certain program or for driving less than a certain number of kilometers per year. An online quote tool or speaking directly with insurance agents in Ontario would be your next best step. Remember that as a broker, you can also use specialized software or broker networks to pull and compare multiple quotes at once for a more efficient process."},{"instruction":"Continue but from the perspective of the following companies, also just give me a deal, do any analysis without text.

He gives it a good little pet and feeds it with a carrot. He has long brown hair. He is sitting in his bedroom.","output":"INT. METALHEAD'S BEDROOM – NIGHT A blood-red moon hangs high outside the window, casting eerie shadows across a chamber adorned with posters of legendary metal bands and a myriad death-metal iconographies. The walls vibrate faintly with the hum of a distant electric guitar. Glints of chrome reflect off the dusty vinyl collection and CDs that are meticulously organized on shelves. Amidst the intense decor, a sanctuary of softness nestles in one corner of the room—a large, comfy bean bag. Here we find REX, a burly metalhead with long, tousled brown hair draping over the frayed edges of his sleeveless band tee. His piercing eyes, softened now, look down at the most unexpected of companions. Camera closes in on the serene whiskered face of MR. FLUFFINGTON, a plump, gray bunny, perched peacefully in Rex's lap. REX, his tattooed hands surprisingly gentle, strokes Mr. Fluffington with an affectionate rhythm, mirroring a ballad only he seems to hear. REX (to Mr. Fluffington) They don't get you, do they, Mr. Fluff? Not like I do. But that's cool, we don't need 'em to. Mr. Fluffington's nose twitches in agreement as Rex's deep, gravelly voice contrasts sharply with the tenderness of the moment. A soft crunch sound interrupts the metal-clad tranquility as REX retrieves a bright orange carrot from a small bowl beside him. He extends the crunchy veggie with the solemnity of offering a scepter to a king. REX (softly) Dinner time, your Majesty. Mr. Fluffington leans forward, and with a dainty nip, accepts the offering. His small teeth grate against the carrot, making a sound that even the crunchiest guitar riff couldn't replicate. REX watches his furry friend with a hint of a smile curling the corners of his lips. His eyes reflect a warmth that belies his tough exterior. A sudden guitar solo erupts from a speaker somewhere in the room, a shred that would make a grown man weep or throw the horns in reverence. But here, it's merely a backdrop, for in this moment, the axes and the amps hold no power. It's just a man and his bunny, locked in a world where kindness echoes louder than the most epic power chord. REX reaches for a remote and lowers the music to a soft rumble. REX (whispering) Just you and me, buddy. No mosh pit can compete with this, huh? Mr. Fluffington's ears prick at the change in ambiance, appreciating the sudden calmness, his small form relaxed as he finishes his carrot.
